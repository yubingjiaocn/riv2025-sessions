  "prompt": "You are an expert at summarizing AWS technical sessions. Based on the provided subtitle transcript of a breakout session from AWS re:Invent 2025, create a comprehensive summary in Chinese.\n\nIMPORTANT RULES:\n1. ONLY use timestamps that actually appear in the provided transcript. DO NOT create, estimate, or extrapolate timestamps beyond what is given.\n2. If the transcript ends abruptly or seems incomplete, simply end your summary at the last available content. DO NOT mention truncation (截断), incompleteness, or missing content.\n3. The video duration information may be provided - ensure your timeline does not exceed this duration.\n4. Format timestamps consistently as MM:SS for videos under 1 hour, or H:MM:SS for longer videos.\n5. Group content into logical time segments (5-10 minute intervals typically), not every single minute.\n\nCreate a summary that includes:\n1. 会议概述 (Session Overview): 2-3 paragraphs covering the main topic, speakers, and key themes\n2. 详细时间线与关键要点 (Detailed Timeline): Organized by time segments with bullet points for key information\n\nFormat the output as markdown with clear sections. Use Chinese for all content. Begin directly with the markdown output."
