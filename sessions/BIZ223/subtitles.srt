1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,330
- Hello.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,610
I'd like you to think
about a time recently

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,183
where you needed to research
or analyze something complex.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,830
If you're in IT or engineering,
perhaps you had to research

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,840
what other companies
in your space are doing

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,900
with AI assisted coding agents,

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,780
to figure out what makes
sense for your organization.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,980
Or maybe you're in marketing.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,440
And so for your research
might have been looking at

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,160
what your competitors are doing
to develop a marketing plan

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,950
or an advertising strategy.

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,680
Or maybe you are, like me,
you're in product management

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,860
and you were digging into
customer feedback to figure out

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,330
what new features you should build

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,760
or what the roadmap should look like.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,350
Or maybe you're a business analyst

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,150
or you're in business intelligence

18
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,490
and you needed to dig
into your internal metrics

19
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,950
and dashboards to figure
out the root cause

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,800
of an issue that you're experiencing.

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,570
The fact is all across your organization,

22
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,750
there are probably users
today who are doing research

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,910
as part of their day-to-day jobs,

24
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,380
even though they may not have research

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,793
in their official job title.

26
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,170
The problem is that business
research is challenging,

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,870
as I'm sure most of the folks here

28
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,977
would attest to.

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,720
So for instance,

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,770
there's not enough time.

31
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,500
Doing high quality,
deep research takes time

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,020
that we oftentimes don't have.

33
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,960
Sometimes the information
that we're trying to access

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,330
is stored in disparate systems

35
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,100
and we don't have access to it.

36
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,630
Or maybe you don't even know

37
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,600
what information your
company subscribes to

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,940
that you should have access to.

39
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,310
Or let's say you're
doing internet research.

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,100
I'm sure we've all had the
experience of finding a website

41
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,850
that has information that's
outdated or unreliable.

42
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,400
Or, you know, perhaps
you're trying to do research

43
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,140
using one of the new AI tools,

44
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,620
but it's not approved to
handle your company data,

45
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,180
or the results that you're getting

46
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,333
are just not reliable
enough to use in your work.

47
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,450
To address these problems,
we built Quick Research.

48
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,030
Quick Research provides the most accurate

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,850
and reliable AI research.

50
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,850
It works across enterprise data, the web,

51
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,640
and premium third party data sources

52
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,640
to deliver verifiable expert
level insights in minutes.

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,770
My name is Jon Einkauf.

54
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,900
I'm a principal product manager at AWS,

55
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,140
I work on Quick Research specifically.

56
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,250
During the next couple of minutes,

57
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,970
I'm gonna give you a brief
overview of Quick Suite

58
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,380
and then I'm gonna go a little bit deeper

59
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,063
on Quick Research specifically.

60
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,300
Next we're gonna have Nicki Susman,

61
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,450
enterprise AI tech lead at
Principal Financial Group,

62
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,060
talk to us about how
Principal Financial Group

63
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,563
is using Quick Research.

64
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,160
And then finally, my
colleague, Natalie Hirsch,

65
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,830
gen AI specialist at AWS,
is gonna be joining us

66
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,740
to talk about how you
can automate research

67
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,860
and is gonna walk us through
a case study from AstraZeneca

68
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,660
so we can see it in
action in the healthcare

69
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,010
and life sciences industry.

70
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,323
So let's get started.

71
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,400
Quick Suite, Amazon Quick Suite,

72
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,050
is an agentic AI application
for business users.

73
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,850
It pulls together all of your data

74
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,340
and applications to make it easier for you

75
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,740
to access the data that you need

76
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,660
and to take action in the tools

77
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,433
that you use as part of your work.

78
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,660
There's a lot going on with Quick Suite.

79
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,510
I'll just give you a couple of highlights.

80
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,870
Spaces is a feature that
helps you organize files,

81
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,140
dashboards, and data sources
so that you can collaborate

82
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,830
with teammates and give
access to company knowledge

83
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,930
to agents that you create.

84
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,560
Chat agents helps you
create custom AI assistants

85
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,940
that have access to your company data

86
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,843
and third party data.

87
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,950
Research is what we're gonna
go deeper on in this session.

88
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,190
This is for when you need to
do complex business research

89
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,820
or analysis that would
ordinarily take hours,

90
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,590
days, or even weeks.

91
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,400
Quick Sight is a service that
lets you visualize your data,

92
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,950
create and share dashboards.

93
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,840
Many of the folks in this room may be

94
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,760
using Quick Sight already.

95
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,320
Quick Flows is a feature

96
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,140
that helps you automate common tasks

97
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,820
in your day-to-day work,

98
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,870
getting ready for meetings,

99
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,970
sending emails, things like that.

100
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,293
Automate is for automating more
complex business processes.

101
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,090
So Quick Research is used in
a large variety of use cases.

102
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,310
So I'm just gonna highlight a few here.

103
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,660
So if you are in sales,

104
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,220
you can use something like Quick Research

105
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,870
to analyze a company
to prepare a sales plan

106
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,313
or to prepare for a meeting.

107
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,580
Somebody in marketing
might use Quick Research

108
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,320
to analyze customer data, market trends,

109
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,843
to develop marketing plans,
marketing strategies.

110
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,160
Somebody in policy or regulatory
might use a tool like this

111
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,310
to evaluate how laws and regulations

112
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,863
that are ever evolving
may impact your business.

113
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,300
Somebody in product might
use Quick Research to come up

114
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,943
with new product ideas
or to refine a roadmap.

115
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,760
A business analyst

116
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,770
or a business intelligence
engineer might use it

117
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,900
to dig into metrics to
prepare for a weekly

118
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,940
or a monthly business review.

119
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,020
Somebody in M&A or corp development
might use Quick Research

120
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,000
to do due diligence on a company

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,650
that you're considering
acquiring or partnering with.

122
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,840
One of the things that makes
Quick Research so powerful

123
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,750
is that it supports a wide
range of data sources.

124
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,240
It starts with your own company data.

125
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,083
So if you have documents,
files in OneDrive, SharePoint,

126
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:46,170
other knowledge bases like
this, you can pull it in

127
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,910
and do research on those sources.

128
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,360
If you have files in S3,
you can pull those in.

129
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,460
If you have dashboards in Quick Sight

130
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,930
or you have files in spaces,

131
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,970
you can pull those into the research.

132
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,370
You can also upload your
own files from your laptop,

133
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,233
if that's part of the research plan.

134
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,430
Of course, it can also
search across the web.

135
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,690
One of the things that's really powerful

136
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,580
about Quick Research
is that you can control

137
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,800
what websites the agent is using.

138
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,440
So if you have a list of websites
that you wanna prioritize

139
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,540
or a list of sites that you want to avoid,

140
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,490
you can provide that to the agent.

141
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,883
It will steer where the agent
is getting its information.

142
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,630
We also support hundreds
of premium media outlets

143
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,050
from websites like The New York
Times, the Associated Press,

144
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,813
Forbes, Washington Post,
and hundreds of others.

145
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,110
And as of last week, we announced support

146
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,110
for third party data
sources, S&P Global, IDC,

147
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:44,160
FactSet, PubMed.

148
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,720
This is just the start,
we're gonna be adding

149
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,720
more and more premium third
party data sources over time

150
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,950
and we're very excited about that

151
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,740
because it continues
to increase the quality

152
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,290
and the depth of the research
that you can produce.

153
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,650
So let's see it in
action, I'm gonna show you

154
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,930
with a simple example how you use the tool

155
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,330
and I'll point out a few things as we go.

156
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,620
So what we're looking at here is the

157
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,960
homepage for Quick Suite.

158
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,630
If you look on the left,
you'll see a navigation pane.

159
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,730
This is where you access
all of those features

160
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,730
that I was talking about
earlier, flows, chat agents,

161
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,500
faces, research.

162
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,457
We're going to click on
the research tab here

163
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,840
to see the research, the
Quick Research homepage.

164
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,230
What you're seeing here is a
list of the research reports

165
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,513
that have been run in
this account recently.

166
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,200
I'm gonna click on the
button at the top right

167
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,793
that says new research.

168
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,847
So on this page is where
you configure your research,

169
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:43,740
and this is, we've designed this

170
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,540
to be extremely simple to use.

171
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,070
So what you're gonna start with

172
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,640
is adding your research
objective at the top left.

173
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,260
So this is your prompt,
or your research goal.

174
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,450
For this example, what we're gonna do is,

175
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,480
I'll read it aloud in case
you can't read off the screen.

176
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,590
The font is a little bit small.

177
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:06,590
It says "Create a gen AI
strategy for a major US airline.

178
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,500
Include an analysis of
what competitors are doing,

179
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,380
identify 10 high priority use cases,

180
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,630
describe the technical
and organizational factors

181
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,340
that are required for success,

182
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,310
and develop a three year
implementation plan."

183
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,980
So this is fairly complex.
There's a lot going on here.

184
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,870
I would expect something like this

185
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,470
to ordinarily take a few
days, maybe a few weeks.

186
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,303
Using this tool,

187
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:31,953
you actually get back a 20
page report in 20 minutes.

188
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,940
Once you've added your
research goal, you know,

189
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,310
look at the bottom left,
this is where you configure

190
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,520
what sources you want
to use in your research.

191
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,890
So for this example, I'm
just gonna use web search

192
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,923
and I'm gonna add a third
party data provider, IDC,

193
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,400
because I know that IDC
provides a wealth of insights

194
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,170
for the technology market

195
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,210
and it probably has some
interesting insights

196
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,400
on gen AI strategies.

197
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,770
Now if you were actually
working at an airline

198
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,603
doing this research,

199
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:01,800
you would probably add some company files.

200
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,257
You might add some
documents from SharePoint.

201
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:05,880
I'm not gonna do that for this example,

202
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,490
but if you wanted to, the
way you would do that is

203
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,373
through the little tab that
says Quick Suite assets.

204
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,850
So once I'm happy with
the research prompt,

205
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,850
I'm gonna click the button, create plan.

206
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,500
This is where I've selected IDC.

207
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,310
So once I click create plan,
about 20, 30 seconds later,

208
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,230
I'm gonna view this research plan.

209
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,540
What this is, is it's a list of the topics

210
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,030
that the agent is gonna
go and investigate.

211
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,160
And if I'm happy with this, I can go ahead

212
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,070
and execute the research,
but I can also refine it.

213
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,470
And so let's say I wanna
make a change to the plan.

214
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,400
The way I do that is in the
little text box on the right,

215
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,870
I can add a comment.

216
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,940
You'll also notice there,
there are some recommendations

217
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,720
from the agent that I can choose
to address or not address.

218
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,607
So in this case, the agent
is saying, "You know,

219
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:56,010
you might wanna specify which airline,"

220
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,110
which I didn't include in my prompt.

221
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,580
The agent is also recommending, "You know,

222
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,680
maybe you should provide parameters

223
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,770
around what's your budget for this."

224
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,730
So I find oftentimes these recommendations

225
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,840
are pretty helpful.

226
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,850
For now, I'm gonna skip through this

227
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,140
and we're just gonna start the research,

228
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,180
but in the real world,

229
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,920
you would probably wanna
look at these recommendations

230
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,973
and refine the plan.

231
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,260
So I'm gonna click the
button, start researching.

232
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,660
At this point, the research kicks off,

233
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,090
it will typically take about
20 minutes to complete,

234
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,070
it may be a little less, it
may be a little bit more.

235
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,470
It depends on how many
data sources you're using,

236
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,180
how complicated your research goal is.

237
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,880
But 20 minutes is about average.

238
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,140
While the research is happening,

239
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,520
you can watch it in action.

240
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,230
So you can see what the agent is doing,

241
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,610
what websites is it looking at,

242
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,410
what insights is it developing.

243
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,540
You can also just close
the tab and come back.

244
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,023
You'll get a notification
when the research is done.

245
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,870
When the research is complete,
you'll see a page like this.

246
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,080
This is what the final
research report looks like.

247
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,760
And as I mentioned earlier,
it's quite thorough.

248
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,343
This, it may be 20 pages, 30 pages long.

249
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,803
If we scroll through it,

250
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,860
one of the sections in the
report that I asked for

251
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,700
is a roadmap.

252
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,750
So this is a Gantt chart
view of the roadmap

253
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,000
where it's showing all of the initiatives

254
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,410
described earlier in the report

255
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,410
and then laying it out time-wise.

256
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,140
Now, if I read the line
right before the chart,

257
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,580
right after the chart, it says

258
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,530
the implementation timeline follows

259
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,530
a structured three phase
approach based on BCG's

260
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,050
deploy, reshape, invent framework.

261
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,150
Now, I have not heard of
this framework before.

262
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,590
Let's say as a user, I wanna dig in

263
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,000
and understand that better.

264
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,553
What I'm gonna do is you'll
notice there's a little icon

265
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:34,230
that says 11.

266
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,860
I'm gonna click on that

267
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,970
and it's gonna tell me
where that came from.

268
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,470
And if I want, I can click on this

269
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,660
and it will deep link,
it'll open a new tab

270
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,190
and deep link me into that article.

271
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,813
I can read all about it.

272
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,840
Throughout the whole
report you'll see lots

273
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,910
of source citations, which
is really helpful for you

274
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,393
to understand more detail
about what's in the report.

275
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,840
All right, so let's say I keep scrolling,

276
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,430
and in the section of the report

277
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,900
that talks about the key use cases,

278
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,080
one of the use cases here is using gen AI

279
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,800
to develop a customer
service conversational AI

280
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,620
and customer service automation.

281
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,780
So let's say as a user, I'm
really interested in that

282
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,370
and I want more detail.

283
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,800
All I need to do is highlight the text

284
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,495
or add a global comment in the report

285
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:20,280
and I can ask for more detail.

286
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,050
So in this case, I've
highlighted the words

287
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,370
customer service automation

288
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,757
and I've added the comment,

289
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:27,450
"Create a dedicated
section on this topic."

290
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,220
The agent will take that
feedback and it will go

291
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,840
and work on that and it'll come back

292
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,430
and the report will be updated

293
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,620
with a brand new section, maybe a page

294
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,150
or two pages just on that topic.

295
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,350
And so you can go through this

296
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,820
and you can keep iterating with the agent

297
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,890
until you get the research to be exactly

298
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,963
what you need for your purposes.

299
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,623
Now if I keep going,

300
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,870
you may have noticed if you're,
it's maybe a little hard

301
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,610
to see on the screen, but
there's a little icon here

302
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,383
with some bars and a plus sign.

303
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,260
You'll see that throughout
the report in places

304
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,300
where the statement is complex.

305
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,280
So maybe it's using multiple sources

306
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,740
or there's a complex
calculation that's happening.

307
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,140
And so when you click on
this icon, it will bring up

308
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,680
a right pane where you can dig
into that statement in depth.

309
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,930
You can see all the sources
that are being used,

310
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,790
the content within those sources.

311
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,950
If there are logical
inferences being made,

312
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,660
it explains the logic.

313
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,120
So we refer to this feature as tracing

314
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,730
and it's really helpful when
you've got a complex statement

315
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,473
that you really need to unpack.

316
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,360
Now I said earlier, this
report is quite long.

317
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,750
You may not wanna read
20 pages or 30 pages.

318
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,850
Let's say what you really
want is an executive summary,

319
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,230
two pages long.

320
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,790
What you're gonna do then is
click on the little button

321
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,950
at the top right that says summarize.

322
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,200
It will bring up this page.

323
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,600
You can either provide
custom instructions for

324
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,520
how you want the summary to be created

325
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,650
or you can just select one of the presets.

326
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,720
In this example, I'm just
gonna click on the button

327
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,120
that says executive summary.

328
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,400
And about 30 seconds
later I'll have a crisp

329
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,350
one and a half, two page summary

330
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,100
that I can then download and share.

331
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,720
So hopefully this gives you
a sense of how easy it is

332
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,400
to use Quick Research

333
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,010
and also a sense of how
it can provide value

334
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,143
for users across your organization.

335
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,390
Next we're gonna hear from Nicki

336
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,710
from Principal Financial Group.

337
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,850
She's gonna talk to us about

338
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,700
how Principal Financial Group
has been using Quick Research

339
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,390
and some of the lessons that
they've learned along the way.

340
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,863
- Awesome, thank you Jon.

341
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,420
So I'm gonna start off with a
brief overview of who we are.

342
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,150
Principal is a global
financial services company

343
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,960
with specialized solutions
helping people, businesses,

344
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,930
and institutions reach their
long-term financial goals

345
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,690
and access greater financial security.

346
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,880
We have an integrated
business model across

347
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,220
retirement, benefits and protection,

348
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,060
and asset management, working
together to deliver holistic

349
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,220
and customizable solutions

350
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,680
to more than 71 million customers

351
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,500
in more than 80 markets around the world.

352
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,320
We have nearly 20,000 global employees

353
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,630
with about 4,000 in IT.

354
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,750
And they all work together
across all business functions

355
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,910
with one shared focus,

356
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,220
to continuously improve the experience

357
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,173
for every customer we serve.

358
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,640
I'm here today to tell you
about our real world story,

359
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,220
our challenge, our journey, our wins,

360
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,690
what worked and what didn't,

361
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,240
and what genuinely
surprised us along the way.

362
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,683
So let's get started.

363
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,990
What if I told you that our
biggest win from Quick Research

364
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,600
wasn't actually solving the problem

365
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,880
that we set out to solve?

366
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,490
It was discovering new
research opportunities

367
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,833
that we never knew we had time for.

368
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,190
We started with a strong use case.

369
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,050
Our private market products team

370
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,290
and our real estate
asset management division

371
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,600
needed to establish two new funds.

372
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,030
And that traditional research process

373
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,583
took three to four weeks per fund.

374
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,420
Establishing a fund requires
comprehensive research

375
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,660
across competitive analysis,
market opportunities,

376
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,900
regulatory requirements,
investment strategy,

377
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,390
operational infrastructure and more.

378
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,610
And all of those are key components

379
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,463
to determine the fund's
viability and structure.

380
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,270
Our problem was not a lack of expertise,

381
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,210
it was where that expertise was going.

382
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,010
Our analysts were spending their time

383
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,680
on manual internet searches, requests,

384
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,990
and curating market reports

385
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,450
instead of actually analyzing the data

386
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,480
and developing those investment insights.

387
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,180
We saw an opportunity to
transform this process

388
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,950
with Quick Research, and we started

389
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,200
by using just publicly available data

390
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,443
to validate our approach
and prove out the platform.

391
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,920
What immediately surprised the team

392
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,220
was that Quick Research didn't
just make research faster

393
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,840
and enhance what they did.

394
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,190
It actually allowed them

395
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,510
to produce more in-depth
research at a higher quality

396
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,070
than they previously would've been able

397
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,830
to justify the time for.

398
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,950
Even with just publicly
available data, the team was able

399
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,860
to reduce their timeline
from three to four weeks

400
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,930
down to one week.

401
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,307
And when they were able to stop asking,

402
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:14,820
"Do we have time to research that?"

403
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,567
they were able to start asking,

404
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:19,737
"What else should we be researching?"

405
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,480
How many of you have great
ideas that never get researched

406
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,583
because they would just take too long?

407
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,870
Yes, that is exactly what changed for us

408
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,470
because word about Quick
Research spread so fast,

409
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,270
we went from that one use case

410
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,520
to teams across the entire enterprise

411
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,150
asking for access basically overnight.

412
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,240
We had software engineers
using it for technical research

413
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,950
and vendor evaluations.

414
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,260
We had enterprise architects leveraging it

415
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,420
for strategy assessments.

416
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,550
We had our investment, our marketing,

417
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,790
different strategy teams
all finding new applications

418
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,420
from due diligence to regulatory research.

419
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,420
But we also had an unexpected outcome.

420
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,630
You heard Jon talk about
Quick Suite as this ecosystem

421
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,370
with all of these tools,

422
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,700
and our users started getting
excited not just about

423
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,310
Quick Research as a standalone tool,

424
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,193
but the entire Quick Suite ecosystem.

425
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,620
Could they upload research
to a shared space?

426
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,420
Could teams from other departments

427
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,063
build on the same research foundation?

428
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,230
Our team started imagining
these custom agents

429
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,520
and automated workflows

430
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,950
and most importantly,
breaking down the silos

431
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,650
between teams and departments.

432
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,350
Because of this, Quick
Research became our proof point

433
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,370
for what was possible

434
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,230
and we were excited to see it start

435
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,910
going across the enterprise

436
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,360
for all of these different
diverse use cases.

437
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,460
But there were a couple key capabilities

438
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,700
that really made it effective
for enterprise teams

439
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,713
and specifically within Principal.

440
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,320
First and foremost,

441
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,960
we loved the persistent
research capability

442
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,840
because you can go back to
old research, you can edit,

443
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,630
you can refine, you can
then share that out,

444
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,880
summarize like Jon shared.

445
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,010
But when we were going through this,

446
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,720
we learned to always double check

447
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,880
where the data was pulling from,

448
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,780
because as teams started
integrating those internal sources,

449
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,720
we learned that our proprietary data made

450
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,130
a night and day difference

451
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,950
in terms of reliability, accuracy,

452
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,330
as we started building

453
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,823
on these different research foundations.

454
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,170
We also found that Quick
Research's transparency,

455
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,900
which again, Jon shared,
really helped our users learn

456
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,000
to trust the platform.

457
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,010
Because we were able to see exactly

458
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,110
where a claim was being pulled from,

459
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,770
users were able to dive deeper
into these complex insights

460
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,300
and ensure that the reasoning

461
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,060
behind those insights was accurate

462
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,163
and valid for their use cases.

463
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,520
But what we found really
set Quick Research apart

464
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,080
from traditional tools was again
that ecosystem integration,

465
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,000
but with the security controls

466
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,010
that made us comfortable leveraging

467
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,800
our company confidential data within it

468
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,320
for that advanced research.

469
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,380
But one of our users
really put it perfectly,

470
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,220
Quick Research excels when you're trying

471
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,390
to uncover solutions that
your teams might be blind to.

472
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,040
And this is especially critical

473
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,860
for filling knowledge gaps
like architecture questions

474
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,533
or organizational structure challenges.

475
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,210
But none of this matters
if you don't know how

476
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,490
to ask the right question.

477
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,230
We're all familiar with
prompt engineering,

478
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,450
it's been all the rage
for like two years now.

479
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,760
We know about prompt engineering.

480
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,480
But Quick Research takes
it to a different level.

481
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,620
Let me show you what I mean.

482
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,920
And I promise, you don't
have to read this slide,

483
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,290
I'm gonna talk through
everything that's on here,

484
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,020
but this is just an example
of one of our prompts

485
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,470
to show you what we found worked
best within Quick Research.

486
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,110
And I actually had to
trim this down quite a bit

487
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,003
to make it fit on this slide.

488
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,010
But first and foremost,

489
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,480
and I think it's quite obvious,

490
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,420
this works because it's
not a simple sentence

491
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,680
or a single request, it is
structured and detailed.

492
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,730
We start specific, instead of
saying "Tell me about GDPR,"

493
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,150
we specifically call out
US-based asset managers

494
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,980
with global operations,

495
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,530
and this immediately eliminates thousands

496
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,393
of irrelevant research results.

497
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,200
We break it into clear
sections, core requirements,

498
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,720
industry impact, compliance integration,

499
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,730
implementation framework.

500
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,600
And this helps Quick Research
structure its approach

501
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,223
as it conducts the research.

502
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,670
Next, we tell it exactly where to look,

503
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,980
European data board protection guidelines,

504
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,283
authority guidance, recent
enforcement actions.

505
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,820
And finally this is what
we ask for at the end.

506
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,660
A practical compliance checklist,
risk assessment matrix,

507
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,640
implementation timeline.

508
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,810
Because we want tools that
our teams can immediately use

509
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,990
and not just another report
that they have to sit there

510
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:07,823
and read.

511
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,360
But what we found is
that Quick Chat excels

512
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,420
when you are very precise
about what you want,

513
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,620
where it's gonna be used,

514
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,570
and how you're going to use it.

515
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:23,570
That specificity wins when
it comes to Quick Research.

516
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,820
But this level of prompt
mastery did not come

517
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,640
to our users naturally, believe it or not.

518
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,080
One of the things that we found was

519
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,990
that using Quick Chat
really helped us refine

520
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,820
and iterate on our prompts.

521
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,290
'Cause the platform is self-aware,

522
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,240
it's able to provide suggestions

523
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,940
and recommendations on
how to improve the prompt

524
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,803
to become more precise.

525
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,920
But this is just one thing.

526
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,930
We teach our users prompt engineering,

527
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,540
we teach them how to
write the correct prompt,

528
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,150
but when it comes to implementation,

529
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,720
we need to talk about
organizational strategy as well.

530
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,480
So some of the key lessons that
were the difference between

531
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,023
that single use case and
enterprise wide demand are here.

532
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,470
First and foremost, the
technical implementation

533
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,610
is straightforward.

534
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,740
And I say that with a
background in engineering,

535
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,230
I know how complex things can get,

536
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,900
but you literally just
log into Quick Suite

537
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,690
and Quick Research is there.

538
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,460
We already had security groups

539
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,990
configured in our Azure tenant

540
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,530
that we were able to immediately
leverage within Quick Suite

541
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,620
because of its native
identity center integration.

542
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,890
So all of the user
onboarding natively followed

543
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:35,460
our enterprise guidance for
identity and access management

544
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,230
without having to jump through hoops,

545
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,733
which was amazing.

546
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,270
But secondly, we found
that governance matters

547
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,680
more than you think.

548
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,890
So upfront establish
clear guidelines about

549
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,350
what data can be included in Quick Suite

550
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,410
and Quick Research, how
that data gets stored,

551
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:55,740
how it gets shared,
who has access to what.

552
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,540
It's your standard data governance

553
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,230
and AI governance questions,
but on a bit of a broader scale

554
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,050
because Quick Suite does have
so many different functions

555
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,523
and foundations within it.

556
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,270
Next, we found comprehensive user training

557
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,890
was absolutely critical.

558
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,560
Both prompt engineering,
how to use the tool,

559
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,780
what to do with the outcomes,

560
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,880
all the way down to what is an agent.

561
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,010
So make sure that you're
training your users

562
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,260
on all the possibilities
of Quick Research,

563
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,810
as well as the entire ecosystem.

564
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:28,110
But don't just stop at doing
it with your early adopters.

565
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,983
Plan to scale that training
as your adoption grows.

566
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,370
Next, and this one might
be the most important,

567
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,200
get executive sponsorship early.

568
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,330
Make sure your leadership
knows what's going on

569
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,160
and make sure that they understand

570
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,850
that this tool isn't just
about faster research,

571
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,950
it's about competitive advantage

572
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,800
through knowledge transformation.

573
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,640
Really think about what
happens when success scales.

574
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,110
Teams are gonna want to create

575
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,940
those shared research repositories

576
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,250
and integrate your confidential data.

577
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,840
And all of these things are going

578
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,030
to require leadership buy-in.

579
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,760
And if you don't have that from the start,

580
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,130
you will hit organizational roadblocks

581
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,833
that no amount of technical
success can overcome.

582
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,400
And the last one, this is a bit more fun,

583
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,140
is plan for success.

584
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,440
Because when this works,
it's going to work fast.

585
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,410
You will have organic adoption
across your enterprise.

586
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,990
So you need to make sure
that your infrastructure

587
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,533
and your support model can
scale with that demand.

588
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,110
So these lessons shaped

589
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,870
how we're scaling Quick
Research across Principal,

590
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,050
because we found that when
you get that foundation right,

591
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,103
the next exciting challenge
is the growth that comes next.

592
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,870
So to wrap this up, where are we today?

593
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,580
Well, we're live in production.

594
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,110
We are actively onboarding

595
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,560
what we call high value use cases,

596
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,070
but not necessarily high dollar value.

597
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,210
It's the scenarios

598
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,130
that really showcase Quick Research's

599
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,960
differentiating capabilities

600
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,320
and true potential in our environment.

601
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,580
We are building momentum

602
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,830
and we're actively
establishing our roadmap

603
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,960
based on these real world outcomes.

604
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,420
And the diversity of teams wanting access

605
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,210
continues to surprise us.

606
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,550
But let me leave you with this.

607
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:21,990
Quick Research isn't just
about getting faster answers,

608
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,310
it's about asking bigger
and better questions.

609
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,000
Because when you give your
teams the ability to dive deeper

610
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,310
and explore blind spots,

611
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:35,700
you're not just increasing productivity,

612
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,630
you're creating advantage
through knowledge transformation,

613
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,610
faster decision making, and
that faster market response.

614
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,310
We didn't just speed up our research.

615
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,070
That three to four weeks
down to one week was amazing,

616
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,910
but don't get me wrong,

617
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:54,060
and we're continuing to work
through that and improve it.

618
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:59,060
But we fundamentally changed
our relationship with curiosity

619
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,160
because teams started
tackling strategic questions

620
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,040
that they had never even proposed before

621
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,673
because that barrier to
exploration had disappeared.

622
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,720
My advice to you is don't
just think about your current

623
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,060
strategic research bottlenecks.

624
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,220
Think about the strategic questions

625
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,020
that your teams aren't even asking

626
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,900
because they seem too big to tackle,

627
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,850
because that is where Quick Research

628
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,400
is going to create transformation.

629
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,050
And that shift from
efficiency to curiosity

630
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,923
is exactly where innovation
becomes inevitable.

631
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,810
And when teams start asking
those bigger questions,

632
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,850
well that's exactly why Natalie's here

633
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,560
to walk you through how Quick Flows

634
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,210
automates what comes next.

635
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,043
Natalie?

636
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,773
- Thank you Nicki.

637
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,810
So hi everyone, I'm Natalie Hirsch,

638
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,360
I'm on the Amazon Quick
Suite go to market team,

639
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,000
and my job is to work with
customers like yourselves

640
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,240
as well as with our
field and partner teams

641
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,380
to help them understand

642
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,450
how Quick Suite can
truly transform the way

643
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,550
your employees are working.

644
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,310
So I know this latte on your
screen has you thinking about

645
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,540
your next coffee break,

646
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,650
but I want you to stay with me

647
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,000
for just a couple more minutes.

648
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,950
So I don't know about you,

649
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,370
but I personally like end
up reaching out for coffee

650
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,560
when I know I have to do
repetitive work, right?

651
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,970
And a lot of times that work

652
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,190
can be very, very important,

653
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,697
but right in my head I'm thinking,

654
00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:29,370
"Oh, I know how to do this,

655
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,110
it's just gonna take me
a little bit longer,"

656
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,320
always longer than I plan on, right?

657
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,280
So I grab my coffee,

658
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,710
and with research tasks in particular,

659
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,630
I actually love the
research side of things,

660
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,790
but by the time I have
to start summarizing

661
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,590
and writing that, especially in a format

662
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,420
that my leadership is expecting,

663
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,170
I've probably downed three coffees.

664
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,560
So just take a second,

665
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,050
think about like if you have
similar situations, right?

666
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,150
At some point in your process, right,

667
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,100
where you find yourself
reaching out for coffee,

668
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,020
and that's frustrating,

669
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,940
and let's talk about maybe a scenario

670
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,620
where we can make this a more relaxing

671
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,900
and enjoyable experience for all of you,

672
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,640
and less caffeinated.

673
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,330
So maybe you're preparing for, you know,

674
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,060
an important architecture
review this afternoon

675
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,980
and, you know, you actually have a lot

676
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,030
of research tasks for this.

677
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,710
You've gotta check out, you know, what are

678
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,270
the latest LLM benchmarks,

679
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:21,480
maybe you have to check out
your competitor API changes,

680
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,480
emerging security
advisories for your stack.

681
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,520
And then you've gotta get
that all into Confluence.

682
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,357
So I know you're thinking to yourself,

683
00:29:28,357 --> 00:29:30,840
"She said this was
gonna be more relaxing."

684
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,493
And here's why it is,

685
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,020
we can now today put this
all together in a workflow.

686
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,900
So instead of having to do all
these different tasks, right,

687
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,820
maybe going over to Quick Research

688
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,950
and, you know, doing all of that manually

689
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,317
and then summarizing it, still
copying and pasting into,

690
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:50,160
you know, various documents,

691
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,860
we can now do this in
step-by-step workflows

692
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,420
within Quick Research.

693
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,130
So I'm really excited to share that

694
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,180
and dive deeper into that with you today.

695
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,560
So you heard from Jon earlier,

696
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,760
you've already seen this slide,

697
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,290
but I'm gonna take a couple minutes

698
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,390
to dive a little bit deeper into it now

699
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,700
because at this point we're
gonna be talking about

700
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,100
how several Quick Suite
capabilities work together

701
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,840
to make this happen.

702
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,460
So I'm gonna start at the bottom.

703
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,680
I'd like to think of this
as like our knowledge layer.

704
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,670
And so we have company
data, we have connectors

705
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,680
to both unstructured data sets.

706
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,740
Think of like SharePoint,
Google Drive, right?

707
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,950
Confluence, uploaded files, right?

708
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,770
We also have connectors
for structured data,

709
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,340
think Snowflake, Redshift,
those types of things.

710
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,530
All of those, when you
curate them into a space,

711
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:40,713
can be used within Quick
Research as knowledge sources.

712
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,950
We also have a concept called actions.

713
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,010
Those are for real time,

714
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,630
you know, both read and write actions

715
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,980
with third party applications.

716
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,680
And so we have native
connectors to a lot of sources

717
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,560
as well as, you know, API and MCP

718
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,870
where you can use those to connect.

719
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,970
And so examples there might be, you know,

720
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:03,030
you might use Quick
Suite to give you a list

721
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,770
of Jira tickets assigned to you

722
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,080
or maybe, you know, send an email

723
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,960
or, you know, post
something to Slack or Teams.

724
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,660
And so while actions are not yet supported

725
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,190
within Quick Research,

726
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,070
they are supported within our chat agents

727
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,630
and our automations.

728
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,550
And that's gonna be important in a moment.

729
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,070
So this middle layer,

730
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,810
we don't have time to
talk about that today,

731
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,790
but that's our governance
and securely layer

732
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,140
and I just wanna make sure, right?

733
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,190
You're all thinking about that.

734
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,380
Of course, if you're using research

735
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,940
in this company environment

736
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,100
and you're putting your
company data in it,

737
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,680
you know, you definitely need
to be thinking about having

738
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,410
a product that, you know,
takes this into account

739
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,210
and for which it's really important.

740
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,260
And then at the top, again,
Jon did introduce these to you,

741
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,360
but just to reiterate,
right, we have spaces

742
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,940
where you're gonna curate these
various knowledge sources.

743
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:55,590
Those can be used within
chat agents, within Research.

744
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,690
With Quick Sight, you're
able to have dashboards

745
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:01,320
and scenario analysis, and
then we get to our automations.

746
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,130
So flows, as Jon mentioned,
is more for like team

747
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,893
and personal productivity, right?

748
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,830
You're gonna see in a moment
we're gonna really dive

749
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,120
deeper into flows.

750
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,860
I also wanna tell you about automate,

751
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,360
automate is for generally
more complex workflows.

752
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,250
You can mix both like deterministic

753
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,900
and non-deterministic types
of steps into, you know,

754
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,890
pretty complex things.

755
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,450
And we will bring this up in a moment

756
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,920
as part of one of our examples,

757
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,500
but we're gonna really
be focusing on flows.

758
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,730
And the reason for that is

759
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,400
because what we released
last Friday was actually

760
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,133
the ability to call
research within a flow.

761
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,730
So flows are really easy
to get started with.

762
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,096
Anybody here,

763
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:47,670
any business user should be
able to get started with flows

764
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,140
because you use natural language

765
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,970
to describe the workflow that you want.

766
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,560
And it's gonna actually, once you do that,

767
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,210
it's gonna automatically build out some

768
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,593
editable steps for you.

769
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,490
So I'm gonna dive a little bit deeper into

770
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,480
what that means, right?

771
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,300
If you're deciding to use a research step.

772
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,020
So first, flows are gonna let you create

773
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,570
reusable research workflows.

774
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,800
Nicki was just talking about

775
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,140
how important prompts are, right?

776
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,420
For research. And think about that.

777
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,370
Like if you're just doing it manually,

778
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,410
you have the opportunity
like Jon showed you

779
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,560
to go back and forth and to
really refine the outline

780
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,780
and refine what you want
out of the research.

781
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,300
But once you're getting into
automation, you wanna make sure

782
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,420
that saved prompt is really solid.

783
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,660
And so what I think is really
great about the way we do it

784
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,440
in flows is you can create
this reusable prompt,

785
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,030
but you can also have input parameters.

786
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,863
So variables.

787
00:33:39,863 --> 00:33:42,480
So when somebody's running
this, like in my case,

788
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,040
I'll show you in a
moment, all I have to do

789
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,240
is enter the customer name

790
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,580
and all of a sudden that
prompt is personalized,

791
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,440
but it's a vetted prompt, right?

792
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,800
That somebody put in here to
then share with their team.

793
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,960
There's also gonna be
situations where, you know,

794
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,000
you don't want your
team copying and pasting

795
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,200
and maybe making edits, right?

796
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,390
You maybe have taken the
time to really, you know,

797
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,590
do that prompt engineering

798
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,260
and you know you wanna
have consistent output.

799
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,240
So the thing with flows too is, you know,

800
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,310
if they're running the
flow you shared with them,

801
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,860
they can't make that edit
on the prompt, right?

802
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,960
They're just gonna be able to change the

803
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,943
input parameters and that's it.

804
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,730
The other thing, right,
that works with flows is

805
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,800
the ability to then have
different types of steps

806
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,820
before or after it.

807
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,910
So in my situation here,
I do have an input step,

808
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:29,880
but then after that I'm
getting meeting notes,

809
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,350
I'm gonna generate speaking points,

810
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,970
I'm gonna send a Slack message,

811
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,220
and I'm gonna dive into this in a moment

812
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,570
and we'll get a little
bit more under the hood.

813
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,730
So before I do that, what I'm
gonna do is do a little bit

814
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,320
before and after, show and tell, right?

815
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,500
So for me, as I mentioned,
I work a lot with customers.

816
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,380
So a big part of my
daily life is preparing

817
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,420
for meetings with customers.

818
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,700
And here's how it used to
work for me before, right?

819
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,140
I would have to look at my calendar,

820
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,790
figure out what my customer meetings are,

821
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,350
take a look at that agenda, right?

822
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,900
So I know what I need to prepare for.

823
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,450
And then, I like to do
web research, right?

824
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:08,040
I like to go to their website,
I like to do some, you know,

825
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,560
some just checking the search
engine, checking the news.

826
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,690
What are some initiatives
that are important

827
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,360
to our customers so that
I can understand, right,

828
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,850
how AWS can help them.

829
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,160
On the other side, I'm also
doing internal research.

830
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,650
So I actually only joined
AWS a little over a year ago.

831
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,600
And I will tell you that
when I first started,

832
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,910
this took me a lot of time, right?

833
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,190
Understanding all the
different AWS services,

834
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,670
understanding what case
studies are available, right?

835
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,840
As you can imagine, we have

836
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,940
so much different documentation available,

837
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,130
not only externally,
but internally as well,

838
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,230
to support all of you guys, right?

839
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,660
And then by the time I'm
done, I'm making a plan,

840
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,230
I'm synthesizing that
to share it, you know,

841
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,510
with our account team or for myself.

842
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,650
And that, I mean honestly can
take anywhere from 15 minutes

843
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,793
to an hour, used to.

844
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,000
Now here's how I'm getting a
lot of that done in 10 seconds,

845
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,680
which is crazy, right?

846
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,180
So whenever I agree to
a new customer meeting,

847
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,610
I start my flow, I literally
type the customer name

848
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,443
and hit enter.

849
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,080
From there, it's gonna
kick off a research step.

850
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,230
That research step is gonna
check both public sources

851
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,960
and it's also connected
to my Quick Suite space.

852
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,760
So that's a curated space that we have

853
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,190
that includes both external documentation

854
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,410
as well as some of those
internal resources, right?

855
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,420
With the case studies and, you know,

856
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,433
industry use cases, things like that.

857
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,910
Separately, I'm actually
using a chat agent step

858
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,010
and I could have done
this as separate actions,

859
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,020
but my chat agent step
is a bit more efficient

860
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,580
in that I have it set up to
check my email, my Slack,

861
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,510
my OneDrive notes,

862
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,650
my calendar, right?

863
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,990
So that's where it's
kind of doing all of my

864
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,260
connected internal company
sources to, you know,

865
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,230
make sure that this flow
understands, you know,

866
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,333
what is my history with this customer.

867
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,980
After that, we're gonna
generate some speaking points.

868
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,020
So I have a step that we call a

869
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,160
Quick Suite data step, right?

870
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,350
It's gonna take the results
from these previous steps

871
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,480
and it's gonna combine that along with

872
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,770
an additional prompt

873
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,250
to create those speaking
points in a format that I like.

874
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,420
And then the last one,

875
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,130
I'm actually sending
myself a Slack message.

876
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,043
'Cause I like to read things in Slack,

877
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,120
and you know, it's just helpful
to refer back to quickly.

878
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,180
So a couple things here that
I really wanna point out.

879
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,340
When, you know, a lot of
times when we're talking

880
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,730
to people about automations,
sometimes people get scared

881
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,563
because they're like,

882
00:37:33,563 --> 00:37:35,430
"Oh, I still need a human in the loop."

883
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,340
And I wanna tell you that
that is super important

884
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,320
and built into our flows.

885
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,140
So there's a couple different
ways that that is the case.

886
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,677
One is, when I'm sending
the Slack message,

887
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:47,850
I mean for myself, this
doesn't matter as much,

888
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,620
but if I was to send
something like posting

889
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,270
to a team channel or something,

890
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,730
I'd wanna approve that
before it sends, right?

891
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,930
Definitely before I'm sending an email

892
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,130
or something like that.

893
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,200
You can actually add in additional inputs

894
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,850
so that at any point
in time you can kind of

895
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,700
stop the flow before you
let it continue running

896
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,350
if you want to verify it.

897
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,480
I can go back to any of the previous steps

898
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,530
so I can, you know,

899
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,610
and sometimes that's important.

900
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,990
I'm reviewing the meeting speaking notes

901
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,670
and I wanna dive into something deeper.

902
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,440
I can go back to that research report,

903
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,440
I can take a look at the
sources, you know, I can go back

904
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,660
and see what it's pulling from my notes,

905
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,217
and I can even chat with the flow to say,

906
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:22,980
"Hey, you know, can you update this?"

907
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,820
Maybe I wasn't fully satisfied
with one particular step.

908
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,250
So very important to have that, you know,

909
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,110
the idea behind this is definitely not

910
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,030
to just do everything for you

911
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,260
and, you know, move forward.

912
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,060
It's to make you a better employee

913
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,830
and to be able to just spend your time

914
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,010
on the more strategic work
as it relates to the research

915
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,860
and, you know, taking action from it.

916
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:49,050
So now the flow I just showed
you was on demand, right?

917
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,330
Meaning I run it with my specific inputs

918
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,400
whenever I have a meeting to prepare for.

919
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,350
But flows can also be scheduled

920
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,230
to run automatically on a recurring basis.

921
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,970
And I think that's, you
know, that's perfect.

922
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,650
There's certain things that
you know you need to do

923
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,570
on a consistent and predictable basis.

924
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,150
So example, maybe, right,

925
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,130
every Monday, you know that you need

926
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,890
to stay current on your
cloud infrastructure updates.

927
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,150
And ideally this is something

928
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,560
that you're just gonna schedule.

929
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,530
You don't wanna have to
remember to kick it off, right?

930
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,617
So what you can do is actually
schedule it with research.

931
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:21,960
You can do it daily, weekly, right?

932
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,150
Whatever makes the most sense.

933
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,130
And so what I think is
really awesome about this,

934
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,830
this is another thing that
we just launched last week.

935
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,530
It's turning research
from not only reactive,

936
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,260
meaning like, okay, I know I need to go

937
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,690
research this now in
response to something,

938
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,450
but being proactive, meaning
like the research is ready

939
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,340
before I'm even ready to think about it.

940
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,933
And that's really helpful.

941
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,550
So I wanna show you how
one of our customers

942
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,800
is planning to use this at scale.

943
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,190
AstraZeneca is a leading global
biopharmaceutical company.

944
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,540
They came to us with a challenge

945
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,970
that I think really
demonstrates well the power

946
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,323
of automated research.

947
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,900
So let's start with their goals.

948
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,610
One of the key AstraZeneca therapy areas,

949
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,650
working with their IT colleagues,

950
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,980
wanted to enhance their
intelligent alerts capabilities.

951
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,380
And they had three main drivers.

952
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,450
One, market leadership acceleration.

953
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,700
So they wanted proactive alerts

954
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,350
on the latest scientific outcomes

955
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,750
so they could rapidly
capture opportunities

956
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,510
and make informed business decisions.

957
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,550
Second, they're thinking a lot about

958
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,170
strategic executive empowerment

959
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,050
by automating intelligence
gathering into alerts.

960
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,850
This is gonna free up their leaders

961
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:36,210
to focus on high value
strategic decision making

962
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,943
and not spend as much
time sifting through data.

963
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,450
And third, real-time
competitive advantage, right?

964
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,100
They wanna use agents to remove the need

965
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,683
for information review
via multiple channels.

966
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,390
And so they came to us saying,
"Hey, we need a solution

967
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,940
with three very specific
requirements," right?

968
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,370
They wanna aggregate real-time insights

969
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,720
across multiple sources,

970
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,420
named sources, from the past 24 hours.

971
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,960
These might include scientific
journals, regulatory filings,

972
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,433
and competitor updates.

973
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,330
Next, they wanna summarize
this breaking news,

974
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,330
but specifically tailored
to their projects

975
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,040
and therapeutic areas, right?

976
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,780
That analysis is really important.

977
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,390
A lot of times you think
about research as, you know,

978
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,680
just gathering information,

979
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,350
but Quick Research does an amazing job

980
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,123
with analyzing that as well.

981
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,750
Last, they wanna send leadership summaries

982
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,770
that are accurate, timely, relevant,

983
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,850
and not duplicative,

984
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,890
they don't wanna waste
their leader's time,

985
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,773
with proper scientific
citations for onward review.

986
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,390
So let's talk about the approach.

987
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:45,690
Actually for me it was
really cool experience

988
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,770
when this project kicked off.

989
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,767
'Cause they came to us and said,

990
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:52,710
"Hey, we just spent two hours
with Quick Research and flows.

991
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,390
We've been trying other tools,

992
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,820
but we can see immediately
how this is going

993
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,360
to help us scale, but in a
tailored approach, right,

994
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,420
to help our R&D colleagues."

995
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,883
And so this is how we
started working with them.

996
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,880
We started thinking first
about the data sources.

997
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,680
So when this project kicked
off, we did not yet have

998
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,450
the capability that Jon
mentioned about being able

999
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,190
to specify specific websites.

1000
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,440
And so as I mentioned earlier,

1001
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,330
their requirement was really, you know,

1002
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,617
gathering data from named sources.

1003
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:25,440
And so we approached this
in two different ways.

1004
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,220
One is we have a web crawler
data connector, right?

1005
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,530
So as you recall in my
Quick Suite diagram, right,

1006
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,870
we have these managed connectors,
front structured data.

1007
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,340
One of those is a web crawler.

1008
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,220
So we are using that
for some of the sources.

1009
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,470
And then we're actually
also using quick automate.

1010
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:43,830
Quick automate has UI agent
capabilities built into it.

1011
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:46,380
And those UI agents, you can, you know,

1012
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,870
give it some instructions
to go to websites to

1013
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,280
look for information.

1014
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,620
And that is actually how we
are gathering information

1015
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,170
from some of the other sources.

1016
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,667
From there, right, they started to say,

1017
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:59,310
"Okay, well how can we optimize

1018
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,080
the research and analysis piece?"

1019
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,670
And there's three things I wanna share

1020
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,440
with you on that piece.

1021
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,910
So one is they experimented

1022
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,980
with single versus multiple reports.

1023
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,540
So what they found is that
for their particular use case,

1024
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,160
they actually decided that

1025
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,140
they were getting better results

1026
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,803
when they split some of their
prompts into various reports.

1027
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,620
They also talked about
website content filtering.

1028
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,780
So because they had made this decision

1029
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,450
to kind of curate the
data sources elsewhere,

1030
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:33,810
not using the features
from Quick Research,

1031
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,970
they actually decided to turn web off.

1032
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,330
So they are truly using
the research, right,

1033
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,363
purely on company data
that's already been curated,

1034
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,020
and not going out to the web in real time

1035
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,343
when they run research.

1036
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,580
The last thing is they
had this date requirement,

1037
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,980
they really wanna focus
on the last 24 hours.

1038
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,220
And so that took some prompt
engineering within research

1039
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,710
to be able to make sure
that it's really focusing on

1040
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,183
that last 24 hours.

1041
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,490
And so finally, you know,

1042
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,840
now they're pulling it all together

1043
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,830
with the Quick Flows, right?

1044
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,810
That's consolidating
some of these reports,

1045
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,510
deduplicating against previous reports,

1046
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,760
validating, and then getting to the point

1047
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,420
where it sends a leadership
email in a very beautiful

1048
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,883
HTML format in Outlook.

1049
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,900
So what's next for this project?

1050
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,260
So this MVP is about to
go to production soon

1051
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,490
and based on the work to date,

1052
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:29,220
AstraZeneca sees value in
continuing to invest in scale.

1053
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,813
So I'm very happy about that.

1054
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,610
Their optimization plans
include actually moving to APIs

1055
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,530
for some of the sources that support them

1056
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,290
because, you know, that's gonna
help reduce the web crawler

1057
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,000
and UI agent processing time.

1058
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,590
And I think this is good insight, right?

1059
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,080
Not every single step
has to be agentic, right?

1060
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,750
There are definitely times
where you still wanna use APIs

1061
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,970
and go straight to the source.

1062
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,100
They're also gonna be
measuring retrieval precision

1063
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,330
for some of those web crawlers,

1064
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:57,240
and seeing if they can make
some improvements there.

1065
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,580
They're also continuing
to measure success, right?

1066
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,610
That's important to really
get the business confidence

1067
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,443
in this.

1068
00:45:03,443 --> 00:45:06,063
So they're benchmarking
performance and accuracy.

1069
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,160
And then they're planning to scale.

1070
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,310
They wanna monitor more
therapeutic areas and sources.

1071
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,950
They wanna get insights
from the end users in R&D

1072
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,540
who are receiving these alerts, right?

1073
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,950
They wanna make sure that they can tailor

1074
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,870
and enhance the experience,

1075
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,430
and then they do plan

1076
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,410
to actually move from a semi-automation

1077
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,540
to full automation once they've achieved

1078
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,140
the business confidence in this.

1079
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,890
All right, so we heard from
Jon all the ways Quick Research

1080
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:34,109
can empower your teams.

1081
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:34,980
You know, you heard from Nicki

1082
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,470
how Principal Financial Group
is transforming their research

1083
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,900
and analysis across multiple use cases.

1084
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,640
You heard from me, you know,

1085
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,890
how AstraZeneca is automating
their alerts process

1086
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:45,000
all using Quick Research.

1087
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,910
So at this point, I really want you

1088
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,980
to now start exploring what's possible.

1089
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,620
So if you scan these QR
codes, there's two here.

1090
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,050
One is for our Quick Suite community

1091
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,090
and the other is for
our AWS Skill Builder.

1092
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,790
So if you're not familiar with
the Quick Sight community,

1093
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,010
I really encourage this resource.

1094
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,590
Not only do we have like
tens of thousands of members

1095
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:05,970
that participate in forums

1096
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,920
and help each other out
with using Quick Suite,

1097
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,440
including of course our own moderators.

1098
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,040
We post events, we have weekly
and monthly events that,

1099
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,100
you know, sometimes are
virtual, sometimes live.

1100
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,960
We have tons of learning resources,

1101
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,340
we have interactive demos.

1102
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,860
So please check out that community.

1103
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,110
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you everyone.
