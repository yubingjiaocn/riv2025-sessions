1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,890
- Thank you everyone for joining.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,397
Very excited to talk about
the topic we have today,

3
00:00:04,397 --> 00:00:07,680
which is about cracking the SMB code

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,540
and how United Airlines

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,915
has very successfully
been able to do that.

6
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:13,800
So as we have introduction,
my name is Kunal,

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,318
I am a principal at ZS,
and I help lead our travel

8
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:18,600
and hospitality practice.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,920
And who better to talk about
this topic than with the person

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,280
who leads B2B marketing and
international marketing.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,570
A lot of good stuff at United.

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,180
But before I take away
her introduction, Jane,

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,580
maybe any quick introduction

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,020
that you'd like to share?
- Sure.

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,603
- Sure, thanks Kunal, great to be here.

16
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:40,020
My fun fact is this is my
second time in Venice this week,

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,060
I actually was fortunate enough

18
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,210
to be in the real Venice
earlier this week.

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,920
Just got back on Friday, so I'm just kind

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,610
of hopping all over time zones.

21
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,461
So my name is Jane, I've been with United

22
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:52,330
for about six years.

23
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,470
I lead the B2B marketing
team as Kunal said,

24
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,303
and I have the pleasure

25
00:00:56,303 --> 00:00:58,738
of launching this brand new capability

26
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:01,380
to address the SMB potential.

27
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,420
So really excited to
chat with you all today.

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,190
- Amazing, well, thank
you again for joining.

29
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,860
Thank you everybody for
joining us for this session.

30
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,740
So, Jane, let's start all the
way at the beginning, right?

31
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,231
Small and medium business is

32
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:14,882
of course a very attractive segment.

33
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:18,750
What did you guys see at United
that you thought, you know,

34
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,812
highlighted the opportunity

35
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:22,110
or the challenges that you were facing?

36
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,373
How did you embark on this?

37
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:25,500
Where did this journey start?

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,222
- Yeah, and it's funny,
it actually really started

39
00:01:27,222 --> 00:01:28,920
to almost my very first day

40
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,410
at United Airlines six years ago in 2019.

41
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,713
And it was work that you
guys were kicking off.

42
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:35,670
One of the things we asked ZS

43
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,810
to do is give us the entire
landscape of the business travel

44
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,081
and the travel market in the US,

45
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:45,001
and help us understand
where we have opportunities.

46
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:48,453
And the number one opportunity,
of course, not surprisingly,

47
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:50,790
was the SMB space.

48
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,562
And what we saw is that we had really deep

49
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:55,710
and longstanding relationships with some

50
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,133
of the world's largest organizations,

51
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:01,290
but we had essentially
single digit penetration

52
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,275
with the small businesses, right?

53
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:06,480
And as we really dug into
that, we realized it's

54
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,573
because we didn't have a capability

55
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:10,842
to serve them profitably.

56
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:12,360
So that's really where it started,

57
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,010
very simply looking at the landscape

58
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,470
and identifying a white
space where we had really,

59
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,120
really low penetration.

60
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,740
- Yeah, and you know,
as you were speaking,

61
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,450
I was just looking out at folks,

62
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,031
and you know, you see a few nods here too.

63
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:27,812
I don't think it's uncommon
among any industries

64
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:32,582
to target and acquire small
and medium sized businesses.

65
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:36,330
Very hard to go after with
traditional sales forces,

66
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,490
because the ROI is just not there.

67
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,030
But of course now with the, you know,

68
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,160
with innovation in B2B marketing

69
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,598
and just martech more broadly,

70
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,862
we can actually do this
efficiently, effectively.

71
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:52,740
So as you embark on, as you
guys embarked on that journey,

72
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,110
can you talk a little bit
about how you used some

73
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,987
of what's available now to
win some of these customers?

74
00:02:57,987 --> 00:03:00,734
- Yeah, absolutely, as we
went to build the story

75
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:02,105
of how we wanna go

76
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:05,364
after this opportunity, one of
the questions we knew we had

77
00:03:05,364 --> 00:03:08,900
to answer is, What are we
gonna do differently this time?

78
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,610
Because it wasn't the first
time that United tried to go

79
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,500
after this opportunity,
as you can imagine.

80
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,090
In fact, we joked around at the time

81
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,610
that we still have United Business Go

82
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,199
as a registered trademark
for the last time

83
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,060
that we had tried it.

84
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,353
So it wasn't even that long
ago that we had failed,

85
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,770
and our competitors had also failed.

86
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,660
So the question that we
really asked ourselves,

87
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,755
What are we gonna do
differently this time?

88
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:32,790
And as I was building a
story, I realized it had

89
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,424
to be this idea that
it's not a technology,

90
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,460
it's an ecosystem that we had to build.

91
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,744
That's really around four parts.

92
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:42,390
The first part of the ecosystem

93
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,270
is of course the site itself,

94
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,272
a place for SMB customers to go

95
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:50,010
to sign up for their program.

96
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,610
The second piece was the
digital marketing capability

97
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,530
to drive them to the site,

98
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,650
and actually get them
to sign up and engage.

99
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,560
The third piece of it was the
data that was gonna allow us

100
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,120
to build our target list,

101
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,670
build our segmentations
off of those target lists,

102
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,171
and you know, actually
again, kind of attract them

103
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,230
through the digital marketing capability.

104
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,406
And finally, it was the team,

105
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:14,153
like we needed to actually have a team

106
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,822
to orchestrate all this.

107
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,484
It wasn't just building a portal

108
00:04:17,484 --> 00:04:20,850
or building some sort of
system and push and go.

109
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,420
It really had to be a full ecosystem

110
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,620
of those four components.

111
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,822
And that's what I've been
preaching since that day

112
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:30,662
is it has to be all of
those four elements together

113
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:33,180
in order to build the right foundation

114
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,490
to scale this in the long term.

115
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,600
- Yeah, it's a great point.

116
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,120
And for those of you who
may not be as familiar

117
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,030
with the travel industry,
especially on the B2B side,

118
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,740
on the corporate travel side more broadly,

119
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,570
there's sort of two buyers, right?

120
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,020
There is the buyer that we call, you know,

121
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,190
a corporate travel manager

122
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,862
or the ones who decide to sign up

123
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:54,060
for a program with United, right,

124
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,706
for instance, or any other company.

125
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:58,986
And those could be for a small
business, could be a CEO,

126
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:01,890
it could be a CFO, it could
be a head of procurement,

127
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,980
it could even be a sort of
designated travel manager, right?

128
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,200
But then there's also the second
piece, which is the people

129
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,260
who actually travel, the end
travelers, all of us, right?

130
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,093
And those people,

131
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:12,450
so the way we like to, you know,

132
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,172
characterize it is you
gotta get on the shelf

133
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:17,520
and then you gotta get
picked off the shelf, right?

134
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,880
And I think, you know,
to win both those pieces,

135
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,000
like Jane said, you have to
win in B2B marketing, you have

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,410
to win in B2C marketing

137
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,670
'cause you get the, you know, you have

138
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,085
to have the end travelers pick you.

139
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:30,817
You have to have a dashboard

140
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:32,689
that allows you to manage the program

141
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:36,990
and even a.com capability
where you go to united.com say,

142
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,697
and you want all your fares
to sort of seamlessly appear

143
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:43,320
for you, your corporate rates
to pull through, and so on.

144
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,060
And of course technology is a big element.

145
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,089
Jane talked a little bit
about people and process,

146
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:48,990
and we'll talk about that in a second.

147
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,148
But Jane, can you talk a little bit more

148
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:53,010
about the technology?

149
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,187
'Cause United has done such
good stuff in enabling this,

150
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:59,040
and even allowing for this
sort of seamless experience,

151
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,705
and connecting all of these four pieces.

152
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:01,925
- Yeah, thank you.

153
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:03,285
Let me unpack that a bit,

154
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:04,470
'cause I think you've said some,

155
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,896
a lot of important things there.

156
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:09,630
So yeah, it's helpful to
understand our ecosystem,

157
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,514
and both the travel manager

158
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:12,535
and the travel that we're working with.

159
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:14,910
But as advice to all of
you, I'm sure not all

160
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,500
of you are in the travel industry.

161
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,873
I think the piece of advice
there is to think through

162
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:21,300
those layers of influence,

163
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,801
and understand when you need
to unlock that influencer

164
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,761
and with what particular message.

165
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,780
And that's exactly what
we did in our case, right?

166
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,489
When we're talking to the travel manager,

167
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:35,490
we're talking about savings
that they can deliver

168
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,780
for their company,

169
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,000
that maybe is not necessarily
the most relevant message

170
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,490
to the traveler, but to
the traveler manager,

171
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,900
that's what's important.

172
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,510
Some of the reporting tools
we offer on our portal

173
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,980
that's important to them, right?

174
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,537
So we sort of attract them
with the right messaging

175
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:52,937
to influence them to click that button

176
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:55,230
to get into the program.

177
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,350
But the journey doesn't
end there, as Kunal said.

178
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,360
And there's that second
layer of influencer,

179
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,090
the traveler actually has
to still book the trip,

180
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,920
and put that into their cart.

181
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,500
And that's where the technology
piece was really important.

182
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,990
We wanted that to be super simple.

183
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,950
So essentially, you just
link your work email address

184
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,170
to your business account,

185
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,514
and your discounts show up
automatically in your app, right?

186
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:22,830
So we wanted to leverage the existing B2C

187
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,426
and traveler ecosystem that
already exists at United.

188
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:29,160
So they book the exact same
way they've always booked.

189
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,510
They just kind of click

190
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,965
a business travel button

191
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:35,100
versus the personal travel button, right?

192
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,050
And we do have amazing technology,

193
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,575
if you guys are not United flyers,

194
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:41,370
we do have the number one app out there.

195
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,959
So I highly recommend (laughs)...

196
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,792
(Kunal laughs)

197
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:44,700
- Time to fly.
- First of all, flying United

198
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,200
and downloading the app if you haven't,

199
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,783
it's truly amazing and world class.

200
00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:51,319
And again, as a traveler, we're not trying

201
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,962
to reinvent the wheel for you,

202
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:55,277
but you get those discounts,
you get access to all of

203
00:07:55,277 --> 00:07:57,390
that program through the tools

204
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,190
and channels you already are using.

205
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,500
- Amazing, and so, you
know, I'm sure a lot

206
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,850
of folks here are thinking, you know,

207
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,790
as you talked about
technology, you know, take us

208
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,057
behind the scenes in terms
of maybe some of those,

209
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:12,480
I don't know, kinks, or you know, some

210
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,890
of the challenges you might have run into,

211
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,380
or some of the key success
factors as you were thinking

212
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,750
of executing on this technology, right?

213
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,910
What were some of those
learnings that you had?

214
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,326
I know, my opinion, you went

215
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:25,065
through this process, is
probably the most patient

216
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:27,495
and best in class way
of going through this.

217
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:28,372
- Oh, thank you.

218
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:29,740
- But may maybe you can
share a little bit more

219
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,130
with the audience in
terms of, you know, some

220
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,160
of those things that
don't make the newsreel.

221
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,010
- Yeah, no, absolutely, and
there's a lot of lessons there.

222
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,540
I'm sure there's some
things I'll share with you

223
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,130
that are not gonna be super surprising,

224
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,510
but it's amazing how you
can lose sight of it.

225
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,010
Number one is, again, it kind of goes back

226
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,390
to telling that story.

227
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,846
So we built the story, we
built an airtight story,

228
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:55,108
and we told it over and
over and over again,

229
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:57,124
I cannot tell you the number

230
00:08:57,124 --> 00:08:58,982
of times I've presented the same slides

231
00:08:58,982 --> 00:09:01,620
at different levels at organization.

232
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,090
I know it's not ideal, but obviously

233
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,020
United is a giant company,

234
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,555
a lot of us probably
work at giant companies,

235
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:08,640
but it's just being consistent
in the storytelling,

236
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,640
and at all levels and at
different parts of organization.

237
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,270
So by the time that we
got that funding approved,

238
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,210
everyone was bought in from the DT team

239
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,173
that was building the
technology, to the finance team

240
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:21,930
that was funding the technology,

241
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,220
to of course, the sales team

242
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,988
that was gonna implement this technology.

243
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:26,836
Everyone knew what it was.

244
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:28,980
And a slight nuance to this too

245
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,793
that I was actually
reflecting on recently,

246
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:34,500
we kind of internally branded this thing,

247
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,920
and I wasn't necessarily thinking
that's what we were doing,

248
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,680
but I realized that was a key, you know,

249
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,150
a key factor in our success.

250
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,550
We called it a small business
demand center, right?

251
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,520
We gave it a name that was
very clear, very definitive of

252
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,648
what it was, and it was
meant to be an internal name

253
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:53,100
to help define this new capability.

254
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,390
And every time I talked about it,

255
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,150
I talked about it's not a
technology, it's not a platform,

256
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,013
it's this new capability.

257
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:01,650
So I think that was another
key factor in the success.

258
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,470
And of course once we got
the funding, we kept telling

259
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,640
that story, and we continue

260
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,220
to tell the story of that success.

261
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,130
I would say the second factor is,

262
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,078
don't wait for all the pieces

263
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,606
to be perfectly in place to start, right?

264
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:18,704
We had to start somewhere, we, you know,

265
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:23,430
had really grand visions of
building four ML algorithms

266
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,550
that were gonna help us target
and segment the customers

267
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,743
and decide the next best action.

268
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:31,092
But the reality is, we weren't
gonna build all of them

269
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:33,000
and then start, right?

270
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,950
We had to start somewhere.

271
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,479
So also, the portal was gonna
have all this functionality,

272
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:40,470
but to be perfectly honest,

273
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,060
we are two years into the launch,

274
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,124
and we're still building
out that functionality.

275
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:47,713
But we had to start somewhere,

276
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,702
and we're slowly scaling,
slowly optimizing,

277
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:52,410
slowly tweaking.

278
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,840
And the beauty of that
approach is we now have

279
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,255
an installed user base of real customers

280
00:10:57,255 --> 00:10:59,649
that are providing real-time feedback.

281
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,910
So we're not training
our algorithms on sort

282
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,879
of a hypothetical data that
we bought from a third party,

283
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,880
we're training it based on
what's actually happening,

284
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,340
and what our customers are actually doing.

285
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,900
And sure, we've had some learnings,

286
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,790
and I'll kind of talk
about it in our closing

287
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,690
and some of our improvements.

288
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,370
We've learned that what we went out with,

289
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,410
we went out with three options.

290
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,243
Well guess what?

291
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:21,572
People are, 90% of our customers,

292
00:11:21,572 --> 00:11:23,580
are choosing one of those options.

293
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,884
So clearly, we, you know,
weren't as differentiated

294
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:30,030
or distinctive in those
options as we thought we were.

295
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,760
But I'm still so happy to be learning live

296
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,252
and have the ability to adapt,

297
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:38,310
because it is also giving
us the credibility to ask

298
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,070
for more funding and to ask
for additional investment,

299
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,140
because we can say that we're bringing

300
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,250
high quality incremental revenue,

301
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,440
and not just in our hubs,
from our spokes as well.

302
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,190
- You know, personally,
in just being a small part

303
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,376
of this journey with you guys,
I think one of the things

304
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:57,667
that stood out to me was the patience.

305
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:02,310
You know, the patience that
this is not a week long exercise

306
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,161
or a month long exercise
or even a few months,

307
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:08,668
it took a lot of fine
tuning of these algorithms

308
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:11,210
for the targeting to actually work.

309
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,410
You know, I know that
there were some, like,

310
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,167
you didn't see success immediately.

311
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,910
There was some success,
pockets of success,

312
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,640
but then you stayed the course.

313
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,223
It felt like leadership

314
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:24,720
and just cross-functional alignment,

315
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,300
and commitment to the cause
sort of was a key aspect.

316
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,105
I know it might sound theoretical,

317
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:31,284
but in reality that was important

318
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,900
as everyone believed in the outcome

319
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,760
and said, "Hey, let's stay the course,

320
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,593
and let's stick with it."

321
00:12:36,593 --> 00:12:38,130
Is that a fair representation
of what happened?

322
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,916
- That's a really fair representation.

323
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,180
And my other piece of advice here

324
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,420
is be really clear on ultimately

325
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,520
what is that metric that
you're measuring, right?

326
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,540
So we did go out

327
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,493
and say, "Hey, finance give
us X amount of dollars,

328
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:54,540
and we're gonna give you 100 million,

329
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,130
bajillion dollars," right?

330
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,390
And at the end of the day,

331
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,940
we did not deliver on a year one number.

332
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,860
And we had to go in front of finance,

333
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,245
and we had to explain the conversation,

334
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:07,013
and it was actually one of the
best meetings I've ever had,

335
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:08,514
because we went into

336
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:11,165
that meeting saying we did
not hit our objectives.

337
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,430
But what really matters?

338
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,070
It's not the revenue
that's flowing through,

339
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,745
it's not the number of
accounts that we've signed up,

340
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:23,268
but it's the fact that these
are incremental customers

341
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:26,820
that are, what we call in
our business "high yield",

342
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,590
which, you know, just
means they paid a lot

343
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,848
of money for the plane ticket.

344
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:34,050
(chuckles) And so we focus on that metric

345
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,570
that we are bringing in high yield,

346
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,456
incremental revenue into the system.

347
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:41,910
That definitely still more than paid back

348
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,440
the investment that we made on the money.

349
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,492
So we didn't hit our goal in
terms of the number accounts,

350
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,574
we didn't hit our goal in
terms of the overall revenue.

351
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:51,600
But ultimately, what finance cares about

352
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,850
is high quality incremental revenue,

353
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,933
and we got that.

354
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,494
- So of course, I mean we're here

355
00:13:57,494 --> 00:14:00,990
at re:Invent, technology is
obviously the cornerstone of

356
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,057
what happened here, but I
don't think it would be,

357
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:06,930
I think it would be unfair to say

358
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,360
that this was only a technology effort,

359
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,150
'cause I, at least just
from having seen this again,

360
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,049
from our lens, the team
that you had in place,

361
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:16,590
the operating model of

362
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,960
how you worked with
technology, revenue management,

363
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,050
other functions, just
overall there was much

364
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,340
more than just the technology.

365
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,380
You know, can you talk
a little bit about some

366
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,020
of those other enabling
factors for success?

367
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,116
- Yeah, absolutely.

368
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:31,680
In fact, one of the elements of our,

369
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,300
the funding that we asked for,

370
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,400
was a project we did with you guys

371
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,229
to help us build the team, to
write the job descriptions,

372
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:39,830
to write an operating model

373
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,580
of how this team was gonna work

374
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,310
within the broader organization.

375
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,490
And we still obviously
have fruit from that.

376
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,320
So that was a really
important part of it, right?

377
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,947
It wasn't just, we got this headcount,

378
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:53,280
and then we're done, we
wash our hands clean.

379
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,660
We really had to think about

380
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,519
how does this new team work
within the existing structure,

381
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,607
and what are those SOPs
that we're all aligned to.

382
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:03,554
And the other thing I would say is,

383
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:05,550
it's really, really important

384
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,477
to hire the right person
to lead that team, right?

385
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:12,300
There is, you know, a
very specific skillset

386
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,430
when you're launching something brand new.

387
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,143
That person has to be collaborative.

388
00:15:16,143 --> 00:15:19,140
They also have to be
really comfortable working

389
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,199
in gray areas just in general,

390
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,200
I think that's the number one
thing I evaluate these days.

391
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,960
Like, are you able to work in gray area?

392
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,717
'Cause there's no more black
and white in this world.

393
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:33,270
So that was really important.

394
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:37,170
And someone who has an insane
amount of ownership, right?

395
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,140
Someone who's gonna break down
barriers and make it happen,

396
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,940
because it's really challenging.

397
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,250
It is really challenging,
especially when you start.

398
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,510
So that would be my other tip.

399
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,760
If you're building out a
new capability like this

400
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,690
to address SMB potential, be
really, really thoughtful of

401
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,870
who you put at the helm of
that kind of organization.

402
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,065
- That's right.

403
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:57,090
And she is great.

404
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,950
She knows who she is, but she's great.

405
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,540
And I do think overall
ownership of this program,

406
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,210
and you know, you talked
a little bit about SBDC

407
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,250
and the branding, but you know,

408
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,417
one of the things I've
I've heard you say is,

409
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:13,128
"Hey, it's not just a
technology, it's a capability."

410
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:15,720
It feels like this is one of those things

411
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,640
that all these three pieces have to sort

412
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,018
of work together for it to really-

413
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:20,397
- Four pieces, Kunal.

414
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,500
- All four pieces, four pieces,

415
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,790
but all the pieces have to work together

416
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,623
for this to really work well.

417
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:27,060
- Absolutely.
- Fantastic.

418
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,550
All right, so you know, we
have a few more minutes.

419
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,740
I was just looking at the time,
we have a few more minutes.

420
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,630
So, Jane, maybe if we can
close with what's next, right?

421
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,740
SBDC of course is yielding
tremendous value to United,

422
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,480
and targeting the right customers.

423
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,160
It's taken time, but you know,

424
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,976
you're of course hitting your stride now,

425
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:49,140
but I don't think we can walk
past a booth here without

426
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,180
talking about agentic AI,

427
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,378
or some of the innovations
that are on the horizon.

428
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:55,987
So maybe, can you share a little bit

429
00:16:55,987 --> 00:16:58,668
about where SBDC goes from here?

430
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:01,590
- Yeah, absolutely, I can mention
of, you know, three things

431
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,030
that we're continuing to tweak on.

432
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,590
I already touched on a couple of them,

433
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,785
but I'll just expand on it.

434
00:17:05,785 --> 00:17:09,990
Number one, like I said, we
did learn that the products

435
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,130
that we put out in front

436
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,300
of our customers did meet one
segment of the opportunity,

437
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,800
but missed a pretty big one.

438
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,380
And so we spent a lot of
time trying to address that.

439
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,560
So we've essentially satisfied the people

440
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,450
that are just wanting straight discounts

441
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,680
on their tickets, right?

442
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,180
They don't care about anything else,

443
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,300
I'm just trying to save the
bottom line for my company.

444
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,560
So we have a plan for that,

445
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,760
that's been really successful.

446
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,503
That's the one that 90% of our
customers are signing up for.

447
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:37,514
But there's a segment of
customers we're learning

448
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,010
that are really into the experience

449
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,106
and into the freebies, right?

450
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:43,260
So they wanna be earning the freebies

451
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,952
and the points that they
can redeem for free things.

452
00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:48,615
And that was not something
that we had the technology

453
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:50,634
to build into the portal initially.

454
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:52,445
We had a feeling that was going

455
00:17:52,445 --> 00:17:53,910
to be the case, to be honest,

456
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,070
'cause we clearly understand
our customers well,

457
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,894
but we also knew that technology-wise,

458
00:17:57,894 --> 00:18:00,060
we weren't gonna be able
to launch in in time.

459
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,773
So we chose to launch with
a discount only program,

460
00:18:02,773 --> 00:18:05,610
but having a pretty good
sense that we were gonna have

461
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,690
to do this follow-up work.

462
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,550
And that's exactly what we're doing.

463
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,640
And we just launched, we just
announced that we're going

464
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,810
to launch that phase of
the plan mid of next year

465
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,880
where our customers
will be able to sign up.

466
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,470
And they don't receive discounts,

467
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,373
but they slowly earn benefits

468
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:24,573
and rewards as they travel with United.

469
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:27,330
The other piece we talked about is

470
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,320
the algorithms, right?

471
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,240
We're continuing to build them out,

472
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,190
and now we're getting to a phase of it

473
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,297
where it's learning from
actual customer behavior,

474
00:18:36,297 --> 00:18:39,109
which is really exciting,
versus kind of hypothetical data

475
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:41,525
that we're buying from a third party.

476
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:44,400
And the next algorithm we're working on is

477
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,833
that Next Best Action algorithm,
which is essentially going

478
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,217
to recommend a marketing action

479
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:53,820
to the digital marketing team for a lead

480
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,302
that's coming into the platform,

481
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,020
based on where they're coming from

482
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,985
and what they've engaged with

483
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:01,320
from a content standpoint to date.

484
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,449
And what we know from past
customers in terms of what drove

485
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:09,120
what was most likely to
drive the conversion, right?

486
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,520
So that algorithm is incredibly important,

487
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,121
and is the final algorithm
of what ZS had proposed

488
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:18,062
to us at that time, that we
are in the process of building.

489
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:20,911
And finally, of course,
you know, gen AI, we have

490
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,950
to talk about a chat bot.

491
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,520
We did introduce a chat
bot to the platform.

492
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,530
To be honest, we only have two individuals

493
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,680
that are servicing these
10,000 of customers

494
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,450
that are coming into our portal.

495
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,060
And so chat bot just
makes that more efficient.

496
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,650
But the chat bot is just as good

497
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,060
as the information we've put in it,

498
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,985
it's not generative, it's not very smart.

499
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:43,964
And so we are noticing
that things are escalating

500
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:46,680
to human quite often.

501
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,410
And so if we want to continue
to scale, we're gonna have

502
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,470
to improve the generative
abilities of that chat bot

503
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,710
to address more of the
questions that are coming in.

504
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,380
So again, we can continue to
scale with the size of the team

505
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,715
that we currently have.

506
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,965
So I would say those are
three key initiatives

507
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:04,920
we're working on for 26.

508
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,753
- Very exciting.

509
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:07,500
And I, you know,
honestly, I think, for me,

510
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,443
the biggest takeaway was just the fact

511
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:13,200
that you invested in laying
the right foundation,

512
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,280
but realized that this

513
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,380
wouldn't yield value right off the bat.

514
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,158
But then continuing to stay the course,

515
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:20,109
leadership, investments, and all of that.

516
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:22,840
And then of course now,
sort of hitting stride.

517
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,840
So really inspiring story.

518
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,790
Thank you for sharing.

519
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,280
Jane, any final words or any tips

520
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,170
or advice for for the audience

521
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,760
before we close here?

522
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,200
- Before they drag us off stage,

523
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,489

524
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:37,500
No, I think,

525
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,500
my advice would just be tell
your story, be really clear

526
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,120
and tight on what your story is.

527
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,980
Tell your story over and over again,

528
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,340
and be really focused in
your story on the metrics

529
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,890
that matter to your broader organization.

530
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,645
- Fantastic, thank you very
much, thank you everyone,

531
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:52,690
I think we're right on time,

532
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,173
appreciate everyone's
time, thank you, Jane.

533
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:57,147
- Thank you, thank you so much.
