1
00:00:00,478 --> 00:00:02,519
Hey guys, uh, am I audible?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,570
Can you see the screen? Of course you can.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,220
So yeah, thank you, thank you for coming. I know it

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,310
is, uh, clashing with Werner's

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,390
keynote, so we appreciate even

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,810
more that you are here and chose us.

7
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:17,690
Uh, with that, I'll

8
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:18,940
give it to Ed.

9
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,250
Before that, sorry,

10
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,829
I forgot to introduce myself.

11
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:24,850
I'm Rahul Popot. I'm the senior solution architect

12
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:26,708
at AWS, um,

13
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,269
been with AWS for over close to 6 years

14
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:31,149
now, based out of New Jersey.

15
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,929
And yeah, uh, I'm with my colleague,

16
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:35,689
Ed. Hi,

17
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,048
good afternoon, everyone.

18
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:39,569
Uh, my name's Ed Schaeffer, also a solutions architect

19
00:00:39,569 --> 00:00:40,469
at AWS.

20
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:43,090
Uh, been with AWS for a little over

21
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,368
5 years based out of the, the Philadelphia

22
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:47,368
area, um, and this afternoon

23
00:00:47,368 --> 00:00:49,009
we're excited to talk to you guys about,

24
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,399
uh, how to build AI agents with,

25
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:53,719
uh, with serverless strands and,

26
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:54,990
uh, MCP servers.

27
00:00:56,168 --> 00:00:56,868
Uh,

28
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,228
throughout the, uh, session today,

29
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:01,689
we'll talk a little bit about what Agentic

30
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:03,689
AI is, um, how you

31
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,799
can build AI agents using

32
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,629
strands,

33
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,730
how to integrate, uh, external

34
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,168
and third-party tools.

35
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,859
Uh, some deployment options,

36
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:17,709
uh, we'll be focusing on serverless technologies

37
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:19,909
today, um, walk through

38
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,000
some of the architecture and workflows,

39
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:23,689
and, uh, we'll get into

40
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:25,790
a live coding demo

41
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:26,769
which

42
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:29,510
we've made enough sacrifices and,

43
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:30,189
uh,

44
00:01:30,698 --> 00:01:32,790
and prayers to the demo gods today, so

45
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,930
hopefully everything works out,

46
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:36,609
um. So,

47
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:37,959
yeah, let's start off of,

48
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:41,379
you know, understanding why do we need an AI agent,

49
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,838
right? LLMs are are pretty powerful.

50
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:46,879
Um, we can get a lot of things done with

51
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,870
uh large language models today,

52
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,760
but they're passive,

53
00:01:51,058 --> 00:01:53,540
right? Out of the box, an LLM

54
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,079
will.

55
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,189
Take your request,

56
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:58,250
generate some response,

57
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,609
document,

58
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,540
texts.

59
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,549
Picture,

60
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:05,168
uh, audio, whatever it is, um,

61
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,388
and give it back to you, but it's

62
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:09,308
limited in the sense of,

63
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:11,069
uh, of its knowledge

64
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:12,469
and LLM

65
00:02:12,808 --> 00:02:14,550
is only aware of

66
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,929
the data and the knowledge that

67
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,990
was fed into it during the training process,

68
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,558
so it's, it's just a single snapshot,

69
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,909
uh, point in time,

70
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:25,479
um. It doesn't

71
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,618
have any awareness of what's going

72
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:30,000
on in the world or

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,240
necessarily context about your specific use

74
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,808
case. So that's where

75
00:02:34,808 --> 00:02:37,149
AI agents um come into play.

76
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:38,669
They can help,

77
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:40,819
uh, take action,

78
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:43,349
where an LLM is normally

79
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:44,669
locked in its silo.

80
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:47,479
An agent will allow

81
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,659
your model to

82
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:51,389
reach out to access external

83
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:52,028
systems,

84
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:54,618
to access external APIs,

85
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,429
um.

86
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,088
To conduct actions and

87
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:00,679
perform tasks, uh, on your behalf and

88
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,629
really give you the opportunity to build

89
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,909
more robust, uh, workflows

90
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:06,909
and

91
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,330
really make your life a lot easier.

92
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,229
Is, is anyone, um,

93
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:13,710
just a show of hands, has anyone used,

94
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,439
uh, any AI agents or automated

95
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,389
workflows

96
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:18,250
recently?

97
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:21,379
Nice. Few hands, few hands, awesome.

98
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,099
Um, yeah, I know there's a lot of, uh,

99
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:26,460
examples out there of just simple

100
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:29,020
daily improvements, right? I have,

101
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:31,399
uh, an agent that kicks off every morning,

102
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,838
scrubs through my Outlook calendar,

103
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:36,479
gives me a report of everything, checks the weather,

104
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,939
and just kind of gives me a, a quick daily briefing,

105
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,860
um, things that would take

106
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:42,979
not a ton of time in the morning, but

107
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,419
just a few seconds

108
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,758
or a few minutes that saves me is, uh,

109
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,500
is pretty, uh, pretty great.

110
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,379
You know, at the, the heart of

111
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,409
every, uh, every AI

112
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:56,020
agent

113
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,538
is what's called the, the uh the agentic

114
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,599
loop. And this is what really enables

115
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,419
the intelligent.

116
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,719
Uh, autonomous behavior. It's through a

117
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,979
cycle of, uh, reasoning,

118
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:09,399
tool discovery and selection,

119
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,879
uh, tool execution, and then finally

120
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,719
response generation.

121
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,580
And really it starts with

122
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,189
a prompt, right? So it starts with the,

123
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,939
the information that you're feeding into,

124
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,100
um, into your

125
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,829
LLM based application,

126
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:25,540
um, that invokes the agent.

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,178
The agent then cycles through.

128
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:31,358
Uh, invokes the model, um,

129
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,579
you know, conducts reasoning to understand what is

130
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:34,480
this request?

131
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:37,129
And what do I need to do to satisfy

132
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:37,920
this request.

133
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,000
Um,

134
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:41,519
the agent will then look at the

135
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:44,059
series of tools that are available to it, you

136
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:44,850
know, like a,

137
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:47,220
uh, like a carpenter building a

138
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,480
bookshelf, right?

139
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:50,920
What about, what do I have available? I have,

140
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:53,699
uh, measuring tape, a saw, hammer,

141
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:55,319
nails, uh, what have you.

142
00:04:55,738 --> 00:04:57,959
The agent will look at everything that's avail that's available

143
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,790
and decide which tools to use

144
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,738
and when.

145
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,178
Throughout this loop, uh, the agent

146
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:04,798
will,

147
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:05,759
uh,

148
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:08,238
execute each tool,

149
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:11,019
receive the information back, and then kind of look

150
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,059
back on itself and say, all right, I, this is what I

151
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:15,480
have, my context has been updated.

152
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,319
What do I need to do next?

153
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:19,399
Uh, to satisfy this final,

154
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:21,869
uh, this final end result, do I need to do anything

155
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:23,410
else? Do I need to use another tool?

156
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:25,899
And then if so, execute that tool,

157
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:28,500
bring the information back, and just continue through

158
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,819
that process of execution,

159
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:33,199
reevaluation until the final

160
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,199
goal is, uh, is reached.

161
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:41,160
Now, um,

162
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:43,809
you know, we saw quite a few of you, uh, are using

163
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:46,100
agents, and using some, some, uh, automated

164
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,850
workflows.

165
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,709
Uh, who here has, uh, has built

166
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:50,889
their own agent before?

167
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:54,329
Couple of hands.

168
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:56,829
Um. You know, is it, was

169
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:58,829
it easy? Was it a little bit difficult

170
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:00,829
to get, get started, see some,

171
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:03,290
some, uh, some head shakes, not, not so easy.

172
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,559
Uh, fortunately,

173
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,928
in July, uh, of this year,

174
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:10,338
we released, uh, Strand's Agent

175
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:11,798
as an open source project.

176
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,420
Uh, Strands Agent SDK is

177
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,559
an open source,

178
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:18,278
uh, Python and now a TypeScript framework

179
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,838
that, uh, dramatically

180
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,850
simplifies the process of,

181
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,259
uh, of building an agent.

182
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:26,928
And it's um it it's built

183
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,528
on kind of a simple premise

184
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,149
that you should be able to

185
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:31,910
uh

186
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,428
to build a production ready agent

187
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:35,910
in just a few lines of code,

188
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,129
right? We shouldn't take you.

189
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,290
Months of coding and

190
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,269
deep knowledge and deep expertise

191
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:44,629
to be able to

192
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:47,410
get started and build something to

193
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:49,689
uh to start testing uh your your

194
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:50,369
use cases.

195
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,259
Um, you know, strands is

196
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:54,040
simple to use,

197
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,798
and really eliminates the need for,

198
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:59,519
uh, for building complex agent,

199
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,160
uh, orchestration,

200
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,660
um, and, uh, and defining

201
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,639
complex workflows,

202
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:06,720
uh, by actually embracing

203
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,959
a kind of model first

204
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:10,139
methodology.

205
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,730
Uh, strands rather than

206
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,769
forcing you to define your,

207
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:17,209
uh, your orchestration and your workload patterns

208
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:18,108
will actually use

209
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:21,230
the, uh, state of the art LLMs

210
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,790
to conduct the reasoning

211
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,108
and planning and, uh, and

212
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:28,569
workflow, uh, uh, workflow

213
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:29,889
design, um.

214
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:32,209
It uses everything to to plan,

215
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,899
to change thoughts, to call tools,

216
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:37,209
and to, uh, you know, kind of reflect back

217
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,290
on uh on what's been received,

218
00:07:39,678 --> 00:07:41,790
and uh what's been re uh achieved.

219
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:44,019
So,

220
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,009
um,

221
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:47,769
for those of you that, that watched, uh, Swami's

222
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:48,548
keynote yesterday,

223
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:51,389
we kind of mentioned there's 3 components

224
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:52,949
to every agent.

225
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,509
Um. Does anyone know

226
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,309
what those components are?

227
00:07:58,608 --> 00:07:59,769
I wanna shout out.

228
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,639
Say that again. Resources?

229
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,459
Yep. Any other?

230
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,920
Maybe it will help if you go back to the agentic loop

231
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,019
diagram, maybe it gives some hint.

232
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:16,689
Yeah, what do you think the agent needs here? What

233
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,528
are the three things it needs to operate?

234
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,369
Yes, model access.

235
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,829
Yep. prompt,

236
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,069
yes, kind of defining the system prompt

237
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:29,629
and persona for the agent, yep,

238
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:32,229
and I heard resources or or tools,

239
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:33,129
tools, right?

240
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:38,889
Perfect, perfect, so um.

241
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,399
You know, with, with strands,

242
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:44,048
um. You're

243
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:46,668
able to use any model that

244
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,229
is, uh, that supports tool usage,

245
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,989
um, that can be, uh, through

246
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:53,548
Amazon Bedrock

247
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:55,879
and, uh, using anthropic

248
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,009
cloud uh cloud models,

249
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:00,529
um, open API, etc.

250
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:02,389
um, as long as your models

251
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:03,750
support,

252
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:05,308
uh, tool execution,

253
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,320
strands, uh, the strands framework, uh,

254
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,349
will, uh, will work and will support

255
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,629
your use case.

256
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,940
And let's look at a,

257
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,000
what a simple agent looks like

258
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:18,239
with uh using the strands framework.

259
00:09:20,048 --> 00:09:20,960
So we have here

260
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,599
You know, the first thing we need is a prompt.

261
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:26,739
Um, so we're, we define, uh,

262
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,178
you know, invoking the,

263
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:30,779
uh, the agent class, we define a system

264
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:31,759
prompt, just saying,

265
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:33,678
you're a helpful assistant,

266
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,219
um, you provide concise

267
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:36,820
responses.

268
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:40,529
Now, what you don't see here is

269
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,668
a model defined, right? So we, we

270
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:43,469
do need a model,

271
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:45,940
but with strands, if you don't

272
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,489
define

273
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:49,129
uh that model or model provider,

274
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,009
by default, it will uh

275
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,830
it will use Bedrock as your model

276
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,090
provider, um, and we use

277
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,320
anthropic cloud, uh cloud

278
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,668
4 sonnet, right, as your

279
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:02,849
as your default model.

280
00:10:03,609 --> 00:10:04,590
And just uh

281
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:06,229
sorry to interrupt if

282
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:08,849
just so you know, we will actually be seeing the code,

283
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,389
we'll be coding, deploying and stuff.

284
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:12,928
We're showing you the sample code here. It doesn't mean

285
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:14,969
this is the only code talk we'll do about,

286
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:15,830
talk about,

287
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,389
um, so this is,

288
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,729
we cannot show all the capabilities while

289
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:21,849
doing the live coding today. So these are some of the

290
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:24,219
capabilities and the concepts

291
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:25,950
which you want to show before you go into the code.

292
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,099
Yeah, sorry.

293
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,250
Yup, perfect.

294
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,639
Um, so in this example,

295
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:33,538
it's, you know, pretty simple.

296
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,678
We're essentially creating

297
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:38,139
a basic chatbot, right?

298
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,158
Uh,

299
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:42,178
you're, we're not providing any, any

300
00:10:42,178 --> 00:10:43,139
tools right now.

301
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:44,158
We're just

302
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,580
providing an interface for an

303
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,580
end user to interact with a, with

304
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,840
a large language model.

305
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:50,899
The agent

306
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:53,320
will, uh, will invoke the model,

307
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:55,779
and then get a response based on whatever was, was

308
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:56,359
passed in.

309
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,460
Now if you take a look a little deeper,

310
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,639
um, you know, this is a code example of

311
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:07,219
defining your model provider

312
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,019
and your specific model.

313
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,009
Um,

314
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,558
so there are a series

315
00:11:12,558 --> 00:11:14,678
of, uh, supported model providers

316
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:16,739
with, uh, with strands SDK,

317
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:17,820
um,

318
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,200
Bedrock,

319
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,719
SageMaker.

320
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,678
Um,

321
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
other third party, uh, third

322
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,619
party providers, uh, Gemini,

323
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,099
uh, OpenAPI, and, and more.

324
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,820
Uh, once you define your model provider,

325
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:33,879
uh, you'll pass in the model ID.

326
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:35,619
So if you're using Bedrock,

327
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:38,450
check the Bedrock documentation or

328
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,519
through the CLI or API, you can

329
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:43,229
get the list of the, uh,

330
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:45,759
of the proper string for your, uh, for your

331
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,859
model identifier.

332
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,298
Um, and you can further customize

333
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:51,639
your, uh, how your agent is

334
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,058
using and invoking that model, um,

335
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,340
by introducing,

336
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,158
uh, hyperparametters and

337
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:00,239
other customizations to, you know, fine

338
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,979
tune your, your specific use case.

339
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:04,729
Just like you saw before,

340
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,529
uh, the agent will

341
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,048
invoke the model,

342
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,808
and, uh, and get a response.

343
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:14,469
Quick example I did mention

344
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:17,369
you can use third party model providers,

345
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,928
uh, other than uh providers other than Bedrock,

346
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:22,029
other than Sagemaker, um, if your

347
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:24,070
use case, uh, fits that you know,

348
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:26,408
in, uh, in Matt's keynote on

349
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:28,779
Tuesday it kind of emphasized the importance

350
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:29,330
of

351
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:31,668
model choice and flexibility,

352
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,469
right, not, uh.

353
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:36,259
Uh, not every model

354
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,658
fits every use case.

355
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,259
Sometimes there are, you know, there are models

356
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:40,798
that work,

357
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:43,320
uh, for certain use cases better than others,

358
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:45,619
um, you know, maybe it's, it's, uh,

359
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:47,009
you know, a specific,

360
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:49,298
uh, type of generation, specific

361
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:51,450
task, uh, maybe there's a, a

362
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,298
price performance, uh, component.

363
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,500
With strands, you have the flexibility

364
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,639
to uh to make that choice, uh

365
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,918
to tune your agent, and to

366
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:03,200
configure it in a way that meets your needs

367
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
and your use cases uh as you

368
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,798
see fit.

369
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,489
So,

370
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:13,428
without tools,

371
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:16,048
um, like I said before, an agent is

372
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:18,149
just kind of a fancy chatbot.

373
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:19,190
Um,

374
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:20,229
it will

375
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:23,080
receive the prompt, uh, from the end user,

376
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,489
send it the LLM.

377
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:26,009
There are no

378
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,869
tools, no other external connections

379
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:29,619
available for it.

380
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,288
So all it can do is, uh,

381
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:33,928
all the LLM can do is,

382
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:36,590
uh, use the information, use the, the knowledge

383
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,428
that it has, and return your response.

384
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:40,788
What you see here

385
00:13:41,048 --> 00:13:43,349
is, you're defining a simple

386
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:46,369
uh weather tool where every day

387
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:47,250
is sunny,

388
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,609
um, which is nice. I am based in

389
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,928
the Philadelphia area, and it is always sunny

390
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:52,989
in Philadelphia.

391
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,048
Um.

392
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,320
So with this,

393
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,038
uh, we're using the tool decorator

394
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,599
uh to basically tell strands that

395
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,960
this is a tool.

396
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:03,969
Um,

397
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,840
that decorator essentially acts as a wrapper

398
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:08,700
uh around this Python method.

399
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,440
Um, it will extract some

400
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,548
of the available metadata, uh,

401
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:14,500
from the function.

402
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:15,558
Uh,

403
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,058
the, uh, the dock string, if there

404
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,739
are, uh, any type hints,

405
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:22,029
um, all that information bundles it

406
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,379
up into an open API

407
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:25,399
compatible spec,

408
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:28,298
that the agent will then use

409
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:28,859
to, you know,

410
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:29,798
understand

411
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:32,619
what tools are in its toolbox,

412
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,219
and how to use it, what inputs are

413
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:35,840
expected,

414
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:38,178
um, and even what the

415
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,298
output format, uh, should be.

416
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:45,379
Um, so, you know, this is

417
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,859
just one example

418
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:47,940
of

419
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:49,739
defining a custom tool.

420
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,279
Um, you know, in this case, we're using a

421
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,058
decorator.

422
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:55,678
Um, we are, uh, also

423
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:57,840
passing it in, uh, to your agents. So when

424
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,899
we initialize the agent,

425
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,859
um,

426
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:01,979
in our code,

427
00:15:02,298 --> 00:15:03,580
we define

428
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:05,879
what tools are available to it.

429
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,479
Um, you see the weather agent here, um,

430
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,788
which we're defining cust uh defining custom

431
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:12,869
in this, uh, in this block of code.

432
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,469
Um, you also see,

433
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,308
uh, the calculator,

434
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:18,808
uh, tool mentioned, uh, in the

435
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:20,808
code here. Um, this comes from

436
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:22,469
the, uh, the built-in,

437
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:24,509
uh, set of tools that Strands has,

438
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,808
uh, uh, natively out of the box.

439
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:28,099
So you have some,

440
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:30,570
uh, some pre-built tools available like

441
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,629
calculator,

442
00:15:31,918 --> 00:15:32,460
uh,

443
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,788
local file,

444
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,200
um, uh.

445
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:37,840
Uh, local file interactions, file system

446
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,869
interactions,

447
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:40,590
uh, streaming data,

448
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:43,879
uh, API, REST API, HTTP,

449
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,719
uh, requests, things like that.

450
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:48,129
Um, but, you know, we're giving it

451
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:50,769
a, a smaller set of, um.

452
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,538
Uh, of tools available so we can do it's

453
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:56,038
one, specific task of,

454
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:56,979
uh.

455
00:15:57,788 --> 00:15:58,969
Math calculations

456
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:00,269
and weather prediction.

457
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:03,029
Um,

458
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:03,879
but,

459
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:06,389
you know, there are other

460
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:08,788
systems that we might want to integrate with,

461
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:11,210
um, in, you know, in a business environment.

462
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:13,639
A lot of times there can be

463
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:16,219
hundreds, there can be thousands of systems

464
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:17,440
that you need to integrate with.

465
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:19,599
And you know those could use

466
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:21,928
a variety of different methods.

467
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:23,200
Some can be

468
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,619
uh the REST APIs, there

469
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:27,558
could be SOAP APIs,

470
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:29,479
uh, WebSockets,

471
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,558
SQL, Oracle,

472
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:33,359
any, any number of things.

473
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:34,210
Um.

474
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,658
To build custom integrations

475
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:39,899
for all of those different use cases

476
00:16:40,178 --> 00:16:42,279
and ensure that every model

477
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,558
that you could possibly use,

478
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:45,379
uh, can

479
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,200
interact with those integrations is, it's a pretty

480
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:50,719
heavy undertaking, right? Um.

481
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,960
So how do we make that easier?

482
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:56,899
How can we build integrations

483
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,658
for all the systems that we have,

484
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:00,149
make them functional,

485
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:02,440
and make them easily available to

486
00:17:02,658 --> 00:17:04,219
um all of our agents?

487
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,699
With that

488
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,949
The solution is

489
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:10,417
MCP.

490
00:17:10,718 --> 00:17:12,917
How many of you have heard of Model context

491
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:14,198
Protocol or MCP?

492
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:17,289
Nice. How many of you have used it?

493
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:20,430
OK, so

494
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:23,348
anybody can tell, tell us like what

495
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:24,549
kind of problem it solves.

496
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:28,608
Please.

497
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:33,219
Go ahead. It

498
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,689
provides a common interface. Murray.

499
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,279
or the model can actually speak

500
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:40,348
in that language

501
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,650
exactly API.

502
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,039
What, what was the problem before that, if

503
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:45,739
I can ask?

504
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,519
Those were walled gardens you didn't have access to the guts

505
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,750
of whatever you're interacting.

506
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:53,400
Exactly.

507
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,239
Thank you for that. Uh,

508
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,318
so yeah, for everybody in the room,

509
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,640
uh, quickly, MCP is an open source

510
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,239
standard

511
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,019
for connecting AI applications. Earlier,

512
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:05,559
think of it as, uh, microservices talking

513
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,539
with the rest APIs. You need to know the

514
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:10,618
spec, what method is it a

515
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:11,479
get or post,

516
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:13,039
what parameter it needs.

517
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,880
There was a standard, and that's how you communicated

518
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,328
with different microservices. These days, AI

519
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:20,689
agents need to talk to such tools,

520
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,078
and they need such standards too. And that's

521
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:25,618
what MCP is. MCP is basically

522
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,400
open source so that every, every tool

523
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,479
provider and every AI

524
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:31,259
assistant

525
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,259
can talk to each other in a unified language.

526
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:35,588
Uh,

527
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,930
for example, if, as you can see, uh,

528
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:40,130
AIA assistant needs access to

529
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,789
sometimes local files, sometimes databases, sometimes

530
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:43,410
remote.

531
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:44,979
The remote

532
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,660
service or MCP's tool

533
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,739
for that matter, and you need such,

534
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:51,259
such common

535
00:18:51,868 --> 00:18:53,459
spec, which everybody understands.

536
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,430
Uh, think of it as like a USB-C port for

537
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,670
AI applications, but why we are talking about

538
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,608
AMCP today,

539
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:01,608
most importantly is because

540
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:04,979
In real life applications, any ISP

541
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:07,199
providers where you talk to the softwares,

542
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
and if they are implementing their

543
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,880
service as an MCP server.

544
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:15,150
How do your AI assistants, if you're building

545
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,348
an AI agent, how do you

546
00:19:17,348 --> 00:19:18,108
talk to them?

547
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,828
So with strands, because specifically we are talking

548
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:22,910
about strands today, Strands has a built-in

549
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,650
integration with MCP servers.

550
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:27,848
It comes with all the native

551
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:28,969
MCP client,

552
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:31,328
uh, definition, so you don't have

553
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:33,469
to. Adhere to the spec, go to the

554
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:35,559
anthropic website and read the spec

555
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:38,229
and design all those uh hardcoded boilerplate

556
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:40,410
code, that it does it for you,

557
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:42,640
and we'll see it in action in our code

558
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,539
today. Uh,

559
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:45,640
virtually,

560
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:46,709
uh, as you can see.

561
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:49,059
Imagine you have

562
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,229
3 on the left-hand side, 3 AI

563
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:54,269
assistants, and which, which needs to talk

564
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:55,328
to multiple

565
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:58,299
service providers or, uh, tools on the right-hand

566
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:00,348
side. If it is,

567
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,660
let's say tomorrow you add, instead of

568
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,799
cloud core, tomorrow you want to add something else,

569
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,219
let's say Quiro for example,

570
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:08,729
and that also wants to talk to get or

571
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,729
that wants to talk to Google Maps.

572
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:11,799
Without MCP,

573
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,170
it will be like M N problem.

574
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,068
With MCP basically it becomes you

575
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:19,309
implement it once on the server side or AI

576
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:20,039
assistant side,

577
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,009
and same thing,

578
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,549
the server, the MCP server provider or

579
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,630
the tools provider implements it once,

580
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:27,949
so it becomes N + N problem rather

581
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:28,489
than M N problem.

582
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,250
And this is huge. That's why.

583
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:34,519
Every startups these days,

584
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:36,910
ISPs are going to this

585
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,618
MCP protocol

586
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,180
way of doing things,

587
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,469
providing their services.

588
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:43,400
So

589
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:45,880
Ed briefly talked about how do you integrate

590
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,900
AI agents with multiple tools. Some

591
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,719
are built-in,

592
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,719
uh, strands like

593
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:52,328
whether API call he mentioned.

594
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:55,660
Then there was also a custom code, what you

595
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,900
write, Python code, and you do at the rate

596
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,219
tool decorator and that becomes a tool, but

597
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:01,739
that was still everything was local.

598
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,059
Now with MCP, how do you integrate MCP

599
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:07,209
tool which are hosted somewhere else remotely,

600
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,568
maybe in your on-premise applications,

601
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:11,959
servers or EC to or

602
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,039
lambda functions.

603
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,479
How do you integrate those?

604
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,299
So what Strands does is it gives you the

605
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:18,519
MCP client,

606
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,019
uh, multiple transport layer, it

607
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:21,920
supports, uh,

608
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,088
STDIO for local connectivity.

609
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:27,098
Here we are using, uh, streamable, oops.

610
00:21:30,358 --> 00:21:32,430
Here we are using a streamable STTP

611
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,598
client. This is mainly used for having

612
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:36,559
the stream streamable response

613
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:39,199
and uh the URL you see is typically

614
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:41,559
in real world, it will be like API gateway URL

615
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:43,559
or load balancer kind of URL

616
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,039
fronted by your MCP server. So when your

617
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,039
MCP server is hosted somewhere, of

618
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:48,979
course they expose an

619
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:51,598
uh proxy layer, and this is that URL

620
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:52,660
which you'll see in action.

621
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,029
Once you have the client initialized, just

622
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:57,279
like any other uh code, this is still a Python

623
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,059
code as you can see.

624
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,750
You this line list tool sync

625
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,289
is basically gives you what all

626
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,719
tools this MCP server provides. Typically

627
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:07,789
a server does not provide just one functionality.

628
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,250
They provide many functionality. For example, in GitHub,

629
00:22:10,368 --> 00:22:12,000
if you talk to GitHub MCP server,

630
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:14,509
it doesn't just let you to

631
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:17,289
get clone, it also lets you to get commit, get

632
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:18,588
push multiple

633
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:21,078
features, right? Multiple function calls.

634
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:23,430
And this list list tool

635
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,789
is basically gives you all the tool,

636
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,088
uh, which AI.

637
00:22:27,588 --> 00:22:29,608
Assistant can understand and call.

638
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:31,578
And this will help LLM

639
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,348
to decide what tools you need to call and in

640
00:22:34,348 --> 00:22:36,588
which order. And that is how

641
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:37,289
it is making

642
00:22:37,828 --> 00:22:40,029
the AI agent more powerful, basically.

643
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:43,108
I think there's also a very powerful feature there

644
00:22:43,108 --> 00:22:45,489
with the, the, uh, list tools function,

645
00:22:45,858 --> 00:22:47,209
um, mainly

646
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:50,068
if you're building MCP servers maybe

647
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,229
within your own organization and different teams

648
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:54,430
are building tools to expose to to other

649
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,180
teams. Um,

650
00:22:56,828 --> 00:22:58,939
each team that owns the MPC server,

651
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,630
um, or MCP server,

652
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,299
uh, dude, they just have to update their endpoint,

653
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:06,660
right? Your agent will dynamically.

654
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,420
Uh, when connecting, we'll dynamically

655
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,400
load that list of tools,

656
00:23:11,818 --> 00:23:14,699
and as new tools or new functionality

657
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:17,140
becomes available, it will automatically

658
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,140
understand, hey, I have these new features, I

659
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,338
have these new things that I can do. You don't

660
00:23:21,338 --> 00:23:22,000
have to

661
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,318
redeploy your side of the

662
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:26,568
application, rebuild, uh, uh,

663
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:28,750
reintegrate libraries or anything like that.

664
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,539
Uh, it's, it's as soon as they deploy and

665
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:33,660
update that tool list, uh, it's ready for your use

666
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,959
and ready for for integration.

667
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,578
Right. So

668
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:41,618
now you have AI agents, which is a Python

669
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:43,729
code. You have MCP server somewhere

670
00:23:43,729 --> 00:23:44,920
running. Um,

671
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,838
we'll show it in lambda today.

672
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,828
Uh, but why we chose Serveless today,

673
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,049
uh, to build this? It can be on

674
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:54,199
EC2, it can be on, on-premise.

675
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:57,250
But just like any other application, AI

676
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:59,509
agents are just Python code at the end of

677
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:01,380
the day. So how do you want to run it?

678
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,009
You should only run it

679
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,989
or basically pay for it when

680
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:07,568
somebody is using it. You don't want to run it

681
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:08,608
on a platform where.

682
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,130
You're paying for 8 hours when nobody is using your

683
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,170
AI agent, right?

684
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:14,568
So that is where, uh, you have the

685
00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:15,348
paper use

686
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:17,189
kind of, uh, functionality with

687
00:24:17,699 --> 00:24:19,729
Servalis at the peak usage,

688
00:24:19,848 --> 00:24:21,848
uh, let's say Black Friday, you have an AI

689
00:24:21,848 --> 00:24:24,259
assistant who is helping you to do some shopping.

690
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:26,689
On Black Friday, you, you want to scale that

691
00:24:26,689 --> 00:24:28,818
high, right? And with Servalis,

692
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:31,269
it happens out of the box and it

693
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,279
goes up and goes down based on your peak

694
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,709
usage. Again, security

695
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,759
and observability is built in just like you might

696
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,828
be aware of with any other application.

697
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:41,209
There's no fancy stuff.

698
00:24:41,469 --> 00:24:42,529
It stays with

699
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:44,348
Sales and the AI assistants,

700
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:45,828
you get it out of the box.

701
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:48,390
All the cool matrix is what you get, like

702
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,689
how much time it is taking, what's the duration

703
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:53,469
if something fails, uh, how do you go and debug

704
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:56,348
about it. And

705
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:58,689
this is exactly what we'll be building today. Uh,

706
00:24:58,828 --> 00:25:01,049
so we, as you can see, this architecture has

707
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:02,670
two blue boxes.

708
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:04,578
So the smaller blue box,

709
00:25:04,858 --> 00:25:06,930
which one, this is called MCP server,

710
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:09,390
we might not have enough time to build this, uh, from

711
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,390
scratch, so we have already deployed this

712
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,539
part. So, there's a lambda

713
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:15,769
function, MCP server, uh,

714
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:17,848
and this lambda function has a very

715
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:20,420
complex. Implementation

716
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,799
of MCP server, it can roll a dice.

717
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:24,789
So,

718
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:28,098
But the important part is not the functionality

719
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:30,199
of it. What we are trying to show is, how

720
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:32,338
do you secure your MCP server. Tomorrow, if you want

721
00:25:32,338 --> 00:25:34,608
to build your own MCP server,

722
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,920
how do you secure it? You don't want any

723
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:39,660
AI agent agent or assistant to DDoS

724
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,189
it, right?

725
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:41,318
So that's where

726
00:25:41,848 --> 00:25:44,519
we'll show how you secure it using lambda authorizer.

727
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,140
If you do not pass a proper auth

728
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,680
token,

729
00:25:47,939 --> 00:25:49,699
you cannot call your MCP server.

730
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,150
This is how the real world applications are

731
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,368
implemented these days.

732
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:56,449
Lambda authorizes is one way, of course you can have

733
00:25:56,449 --> 00:25:57,588
a token and

734
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,088
many other ways of securing it, but

735
00:26:00,088 --> 00:26:01,910
this is one way which we'll be showing you today.

736
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:03,989
And just a quick show of hands, uh,

737
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:06,608
who here is familiar with building on, uh,

738
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,689
on lambda or, or has experience building lambda

739
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:09,910
functions? Perfect.

740
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:11,150
Thank you so much.

741
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:14,828
Uh, the second part which will mostly

742
00:26:14,828 --> 00:26:16,289
we'll be building today is

743
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:18,969
this bigger blue box, which is the

744
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:21,430
agent using strands. Again,

745
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:23,848
we will be implementing this on lambda,

746
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:25,868
uh, fronted with API gateway.

747
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:28,348
So when the end user is, uh, sending

748
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:30,209
a request or the user prompt,

749
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:31,750
this AI agent,

750
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:34,029
uh, as we saw in the agentic loop,

751
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,568
it will talk to the model. Uh,

752
00:26:37,118 --> 00:26:37,900
of bedrock,

753
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,489
it can be anything. It cannot, it just

754
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:42,598
doesn't have to be bedrock. It can be Open APAI.

755
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,059
It can be Gemini, anything. That's the power of

756
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:45,640
strands.

757
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:48,809
This LLM will help you, will

758
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,009
help this AI agent to come up with a plan.

759
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:53,568
OK, based on your user request, you

760
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,680
need to call one tool, 2-tool, or

761
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,650
3 tools, whatever is implemented here.

762
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,489
So first tool, let's say if the user is only asking

763
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:01,160
about weather,

764
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:05,239
you only need tool number 1, which is built-in STTP_request.

765
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,529
Go to the website, a third-party website,

766
00:27:07,608 --> 00:27:09,150
crawl it, give me the weather.

767
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:12,150
But if, say, the user request

768
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,410
is not just about tool, but also,

769
00:27:14,848 --> 00:27:17,170
uh, a lot of walking is happening in Las Vegas,

770
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,328
how should I commute today? Should I walk? Should I take

771
00:27:19,328 --> 00:27:19,910
a cab?

772
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,789
So that's where we have a custom tool

773
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:24,828
called commute advisory, and it will, of

774
00:27:24,828 --> 00:27:26,509
course, check how the weather is.

775
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:29,170
If it is raining, it will not suggest you to walk

776
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,568
without an umbrella.

777
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,930
If it's raining, you don't want to ruin your, uh,

778
00:27:33,348 --> 00:27:34,588
super stylish gold jacket.

779
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,049
Uh, yeah, of course.

780
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:39,338
And the third tool, which we'll show today is,

781
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,459
uh, the integration with the MCP tool. So

782
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,769
how this AI agent,

783
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,559
for some reason, if I'm walking, uh,

784
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:48,160
based on the commute advisory of the AI tool,

785
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:50,680
because we're in Las Vegas, we need to

786
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:52,608
roll a dice, at least.

787
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:55,140
So this is the 3rd MCP tool, which we'll

788
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,439
call today to roll the dice and see how

789
00:27:57,699 --> 00:27:59,900
AI can intelligently do the reasoning

790
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,059
and come up with the steps, which tool to call

791
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:03,078
in which order,

792
00:28:03,338 --> 00:28:05,309
uh. And yeah, so,

793
00:28:05,689 --> 00:28:07,930
any questions before we dive into the code

794
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:08,489
for this one?

795
00:28:10,578 --> 00:28:12,920
Cool. I think before we

796
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:15,098
go into the code, just one last slide

797
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:15,719
to

798
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:18,098
go to the workflow. What you should keep in mind before

799
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:20,219
you see the code so that it makes more sense

800
00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:21,430
when we start building.

801
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,328
I'll take this while you prep over there.

802
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:26,650
All right, so, um,

803
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:29,108
yeah, let's look at the example that

804
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:31,009
we'll be, uh, we'll be walking through,

805
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,348
um, end to end,

806
00:28:33,098 --> 00:28:35,608
uh, it's really gonna demonstrate kind of a simple agent that,

807
00:28:35,618 --> 00:28:37,489
uh, you can check the weather,

808
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:40,229
uh, determine what you

809
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:42,858
should wear and how you should, uh, uh,

810
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:44,930
for your commute, how you should travel,

811
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:47,088
um, and like Raul said,

812
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,568
because we are in Vegas, we might as well

813
00:28:49,568 --> 00:28:50,509
roll some dice.

814
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,959
So, we'll give our agent

815
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:56,078
uh a pretty simple prompt. Um,

816
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,400
how should I commute today?

817
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,229
And

818
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:01,608
we're telling it, hey, I'm in Vegas,

819
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:04,150
let's, let's roll the dice, gamble

820
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,088
for me, what are my, what are my lucky numbers,

821
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:06,969
um.

822
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:10,338
You know, notice we're not saying.

823
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:13,680
Uh, we're not asking about the weather.

824
00:29:13,989 --> 00:29:14,640
We're not saying,

825
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:17,209
tell me how I should commute based on the

826
00:29:17,209 --> 00:29:19,519
weather. It's gonna figure that out for us.

827
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:23,759
Um, and we're, uh,

828
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:26,489
like I said, we're letting the tool, uh,

829
00:29:26,608 --> 00:29:27,920
we're letting the agent decide

830
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:30,118
what tools should be executed,

831
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:31,858
and, uh, and when.

832
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,809
And then based on the information that it's

833
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:35,519
receiving,

834
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:36,539
um,

835
00:29:37,328 --> 00:29:39,348
we'll, uh, we can provide it some information

836
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:40,549
on what a

837
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,989
comfortable range should

838
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,049
be and, uh, you know, good

839
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,430
modes of transportation

840
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:48,170
for, for different scenarios.

841
00:29:48,848 --> 00:29:49,949
Um, and then,

842
00:29:50,328 --> 00:29:52,729
uh, those two, the,

843
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:55,130
uh, the weather and the commute will

844
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,250
be built with, uh, custom tool

845
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,459
integration, uh, like we saw before using

846
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:01,189
the tool, uh, decorator.

847
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,568
Um, and then for the MC,

848
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,449
MCP integration,

849
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:08,189
we have, uh, the MCP server running

850
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:10,709
a, uh, a dice roll tool.

851
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:14,689
Uh, when the agent completes its

852
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,858
loop, executes all the, the, uh,

853
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,150
all the tools available,

854
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,049
uh,

855
00:30:19,489 --> 00:30:21,890
does its reasoning and determines it has

856
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,789
everything it needs,

857
00:30:23,328 --> 00:30:24,750
we should get a result

858
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:26,608
showing the weather.

859
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,828
And uh and how we should uh

860
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,650
how we should commute.

861
00:30:31,818 --> 00:30:33,219
So let's build,

862
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,098
well. That's

863
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:41,318
Earth Right.

864
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:44,318
All right, so

865
00:30:44,699 --> 00:30:46,289
let's take a quick peek

866
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:47,598
at the.

867
00:30:49,229 --> 00:30:51,439
Uh, MCP server, the small blue box

868
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,939
which we saw in the architecture.

869
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:55,229
So this is our, uh,

870
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,838
remote third party tool, right?

871
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,500
We're not

872
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,549
building this, uh, this MCP

873
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:04,098
server directly into our strands,

874
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:05,500
uh, our strands agent.

875
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:07,818
It's, you know, running off to the side.

876
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:10,608
Within this.

877
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:14,400
Within this code,

878
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:16,709
um, you know, we have

879
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,068
A

880
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,630
Simple function defined

881
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:21,779
to parse

882
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,338
our uh our dice response.

883
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:25,769
This is where,

884
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:28,430
um, we're basically invoking,

885
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,750
uh, Bedrock as the

886
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,250
uh as the back end to actually execute

887
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,150
sort of essentially random number

888
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,930
generation. Um, this could easily

889
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,309
be some other

890
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:40,578
API,

891
00:31:40,848 --> 00:31:42,969
some other method that will,

892
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:45,348
uh, that will generate that, uh,

893
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:46,989
uh, that response.

894
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:52,630
Here on line 47,

895
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,170
um, we're building what's essentially

896
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,729
the entry point for, uh, for

897
00:31:57,729 --> 00:31:58,309
our agent.

898
00:31:58,689 --> 00:32:00,029
Um, this is

899
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,489
the tool that the agent will

900
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:03,989
directly invoke.

901
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,229
Um, we're using,

902
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:08,430
uh, the MCP tool decorator,

903
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:10,828
uh, to denote that it's

904
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:12,068
1, being,

905
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,868
uh, being delivered through

906
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:15,068
MCP,

907
00:32:15,328 --> 00:32:16,809
and 2, it's a tool.

908
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:19,380
Within our dock string,

909
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:21,529
we're giving us some basic information

910
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:23,949
that saying that this is, uh,

911
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:26,130
this is a tool that will roll dice.

912
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:31,009
We'll go through just to answer

913
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:33,130
your questions, so we are also showing

914
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,400
here Dynamo DB.

915
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:36,848
We don't need it, uh, here, whatever

916
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:38,088
we record or roll a dice,

917
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:40,189
we're storing it, but the idea is

918
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:43,549
you can use this kind of architecture

919
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,719
to do the state management, uh,

920
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:46,769
within your MCP server.

921
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,299
Yep, um, and in this scenario, you know,

922
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,858
we're we're storing the,

923
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,289
uh, the result of that, uh, of that dice

924
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:55,108
roll into Dynamo DB

925
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,420
built into strands. There are other

926
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,500
options for,

927
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:01,049
uh, for persisting

928
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,765
conversation and, and, and context. Uh,

929
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:06,104
uh, for, for memory and session management,

930
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:08,924
so you can use Dynamo DB, you can use S3,

931
00:33:09,005 --> 00:33:10,025
you can use some others,

932
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:12,125
um, in memory for, uh, you know, for,

933
00:33:13,045 --> 00:33:15,483
for storing that, uh, that contextual

934
00:33:15,483 --> 00:33:17,223
data and reusing across,

935
00:33:17,684 --> 00:33:18,943
uh, across sessions.

936
00:33:20,189 --> 00:33:20,818
Um,

937
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,828
Now one thing we don't

938
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,358
want to happen with this, uh,

939
00:33:25,608 --> 00:33:27,078
this MCP because it is

940
00:33:27,729 --> 00:33:30,170
extremely sensitive. We don't want just

941
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,250
anyone to be able to go out and roll dice, that

942
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,108
would be crazy.

943
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:35,750
Um, we are with our,

944
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,189
uh, API gateway,

945
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:39,150
um, using a simple,

946
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,868
uh, lambda-based authorizer.

947
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,489
Um, for those of you who are, uh, familiar

948
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,789
with developing applications on lambda

949
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:48,949
and using API gateway, this should look,

950
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:50,390
uh, pretty familiar.

951
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,660
Um, in this case, we are,

952
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,479
uh,

953
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:56,529
API gateway will send,

954
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,019
uh, uh, uh, authorization

955
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:01,318
headers, uh, and bearer tokens into,

956
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,150
uh, this lambda function.

957
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,059
The lambda function will,

958
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,519
uh, will parse and validate

959
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,159
the token against our, uh,

960
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,199
against our algorithm. In this case,

961
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:13,139
uh, again,

962
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:14,628
super secure,

963
00:34:14,978 --> 00:34:17,500
uh, we're checking to see if our token is

964
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,300
quote unquote good token.

965
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:20,860
If it's not good token.

966
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,789
Kick it out. It's a bad response. You're not

967
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:24,550
authorized,

968
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:25,458
um,

969
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,208
simple use case,

970
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,829
uh, clearly it's you can use any

971
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:31,949
other, uh, identity provider that

972
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:32,789
you may have.

973
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:35,510
Um, most identity providers

974
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,628
that, uh, that have some integration or, or

975
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:39,989
some, uh, uh, examples with

976
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:42,510
API gateway or with lambda authorizers

977
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,059
will have a boilerplate code on, uh,

978
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,349
that you can, you can place in here and

979
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:50,050
have, uh, real security versus,

980
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:51,010
uh.

981
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:54,197
Yeah, versus ours super strong.

982
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:56,489
Yeah, the most secure MCP can ever make.

983
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,510
Um, yep, and then at the end, uh,

984
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,539
once everything is validated

985
00:35:04,878 --> 00:35:06,260
as, uh, as good,

986
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:08,780
um, or if it is, uh,

987
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:09,878
if it's denied,

988
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:12,378
we're passing back the IM policy

989
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:13,059
of either,

990
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,648
uh, uh, allow or

991
00:35:15,648 --> 00:35:17,179
deny for this particular resource

992
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:20,039
that gets kicked back to the, the client,

993
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,418
and, uh,

994
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:23,878
API gateway can determine whether or not it can,

995
00:35:23,918 --> 00:35:24,978
uh, it can move forward.

996
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:28,668
Yeah. Just like any other

997
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,728
application or lambda function,

998
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,148
uh, you want to test it before you expose

999
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:33,369
it to any AI agent, right?

1000
00:35:33,628 --> 00:35:34,728
So let's quickly

1001
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:37,728
test if this dice roll works

1002
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:40,228
by itself or your MCP

1003
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:41,530
tool works by itself.

1004
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,369
Um, so with

1005
00:35:47,628 --> 00:35:48,228
So,

1006
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,829
in CPR the Anthropic provides a tool

1007
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:53,188
called Inspector, uh, to test your MCP

1008
00:35:53,188 --> 00:35:55,059
servers. So once you run that,

1009
00:35:55,668 --> 00:35:57,668
It gives you a nice little postman kind

1010
00:35:57,668 --> 00:36:00,570
of UI. When

1011
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,389
you say yes,

1012
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:07,148
So

1013
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:09,969
So What

1014
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:12,250
it does is it gives you, as you can see, this

1015
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,289
nice little UI, it comes out of the box. This is

1016
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:16,449
the very basic way of testing your

1017
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:18,269
servers when you build it.

1018
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:20,228
So let's try to connect

1019
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:22,719
to our dice roll server and see before even

1020
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,610
AI agent can talk to it.

1021
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:26,829
Let's see if this works by itself standalone.

1022
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:28,530
Oops, it doesn't.

1023
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:32,619
And as you can see, it says.

1024
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,918
A user is not authorized to access this

1025
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:38,679
resource. Any guesses? why?

1026
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:42,889
Not a good token.

1027
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,099
Exactly. Did you use bad token.

1028
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:46,550
It is a bad token,

1029
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:49,128
not a good idea. You can't use bad token. Only

1030
00:36:49,128 --> 00:36:49,648
good token.

1031
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:51,739
Let's see.

1032
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,570
Try to connect again. Cool.

1033
00:36:55,898 --> 00:36:56,559
So now,

1034
00:36:56,938 --> 00:36:59,659
only authentic AI agent,

1035
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:01,860
which we will build on strands, can call this if

1036
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,800
they pass good token.

1037
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,559
So what are the tools it supports? This

1038
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,188
can support multiple tools,

1039
00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:09,599
but right now it is only supporting one tool

1040
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,239
called dice roll.

1041
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,958
So let's see if if it works.

1042
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:21,489
So I'm not saying one dice. I'm saying in a

1043
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,728
natural language, roll a dice. So

1044
00:37:23,728 --> 00:37:25,809
we are calling, we have to convert this into

1045
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:28,329
one dice somehow because we know LLM

1046
00:37:28,688 --> 00:37:30,389
should be able to figure it out for us.

1047
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:31,869
So when you run this,

1048
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:32,969
uh, tool.

1049
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,648
And there's lambda cold start here.

1050
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:38,809
It just once.

1051
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:42,780
So as you can see, we said a dice,

1052
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:45,188
it figured out, oh, you're asking for 1,

1053
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:47,500
and I rolled 2. And because it is just

1054
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,099
1, the sum is 2.

1055
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,478
If I say

1056
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:51,619
roll.

1057
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:54,378
3 days for me.

1058
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:00,469
It rolled 3 dice

1059
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:03,409
And the sum is 15. So this is the one

1060
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:05,530
functionality which our MCP serve is working,

1061
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:07,648
tools are working. Now let's get back to the

1062
00:38:07,648 --> 00:38:08,750
AI agent building part.

1063
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:14,179
So as you saw in the

1064
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,800
building agent, there are 3 core components.

1065
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,958
One is the system prompt, one is the tools,

1066
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:19,800
one is LLM.

1067
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,438
So the system prompt is basically what you can do.

1068
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:25,360
What is your personal agent, you are a doctor, engineer,

1069
00:38:25,478 --> 00:38:26,750
uh, travel agent,

1070
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,898
whatever you are.

1071
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:30,800
Here we are clearly saying you are weather commute

1072
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,989
and dice rolling assistant.

1073
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:34,878
And give some system prompts and the

1074
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:35,978
important thing here is

1075
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,570
these are the tools I have access to.

1076
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,199
You, Mr. LLM, help me figure

1077
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,139
out what

1078
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,878
tools I need to call for this particular

1079
00:38:44,878 --> 00:38:46,789
request which user is asking me for.

1080
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,119
So, and in, in what order?

1081
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,199
So once you have that, we start with the base tool.

1082
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,438
Of uh STTP request, which is in belt

1083
00:38:55,438 --> 00:38:57,519
with strands, and the commit advisory tool,

1084
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,728
which is just our custom code. Uh, it

1085
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:01,969
can be based on the weather information, what we get,

1086
00:39:02,438 --> 00:39:04,570
uh, you can say whether you should walk or not. It

1087
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,699
can be anything. You can just simply say,

1088
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:10,889
He can always

1089
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,699
walk in Vegas.

1090
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,619
This is not a good idea, but the goal

1091
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,489
is, this is your code,

1092
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,760
and at the rate tool decorator will make it

1093
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:21,820
a tool, basically, which AI

1094
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:23,219
assistant understands.

1095
00:39:23,938 --> 00:39:24,478
So

1096
00:39:24,878 --> 00:39:27,579
we'll keep some logical implementation

1097
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:29,039
here, not changing this part.

1098
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,750
But now you have custom tool, which is a commut

1099
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,989
tool, and now you have one built-in

1100
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:37,418
tool which is a weather API tool. Let's start with that.

1101
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:39,938
We are not calling MCP. Why? Uh,

1102
00:39:40,148 --> 00:39:42,500
because what if your remote

1103
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,590
ISP providers is down for

1104
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,590
some reason. Maybe they're running on some other cloud

1105
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,250
which is down.

1106
00:39:47,909 --> 00:39:48,989
So in that case, your AI

1107
00:39:49,378 --> 00:39:51,668
agent should still be able to work with the limited

1108
00:39:51,668 --> 00:39:53,909
functionality. It should not just say, OK, I cannot do

1109
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:55,369
anything because I cannot roll a dice.

1110
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,429
So what we are trying to do is if you can connect

1111
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:58,949
to.

1112
00:39:59,449 --> 00:39:59,989
remote

1113
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,329
server MCP server, sure, I can

1114
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:03,849
add more tools to this,

1115
00:40:04,128 --> 00:40:06,188
to the base tool, but if not, I can still

1116
00:40:06,188 --> 00:40:08,590
work with the base tools. This is one of the best practices

1117
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:11,449
of making your AI agents

1118
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:13,489
make sure that when you're dependent on the

1119
00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:15,719
third party tools you have some proper

1120
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:16,550
error handling,

1121
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:18,929
uh, in place, otherwise your agent

1122
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:20,389
is like confused. Oh, I cannot

1123
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,708
call this method.

1124
00:40:22,148 --> 00:40:24,329
Uh, I'm useless. You don't want to do that.

1125
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:28,239
Um, so now there are 3 important things.

1126
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:29,909
First, we'll define the,

1127
00:40:30,438 --> 00:40:32,438
we'll create an agent. We, for that, it

1128
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:33,539
needs a model,

1129
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:35,918
uh, LLM access. So let's see, and

1130
00:40:35,918 --> 00:40:38,159
of course, we'll use white coding. That's cool. Everybody

1131
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:38,878
uses this.

1132
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,489
So

1133
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:44,489
We can say, OK, model equal

1134
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:46,309
to Novaro, OK?

1135
00:40:46,688 --> 00:40:49,090
Uh, that's fine. I want to use Novaro

1136
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,570
model instead of default cloud

1137
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,148
Sonnet

1138
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,510
4.5.

1139
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,320
Then you can say, OK, uh, for

1140
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:59,179
starting an agent, I say, OK, I

1141
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:01,280
need an agent where the system prompt is

1142
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:02,478
what you saw here.

1143
00:41:03,438 --> 00:41:05,510
And then model is this

1144
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,898
model, which we defined,

1145
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,719
and the tools is all tools, which is a combination of

1146
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:11,898
MCP plus uh local

1147
00:41:11,898 --> 00:41:13,929
tools. Once you have

1148
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,110
all these agents defined, let's make a call

1149
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,648
uh to this agent.

1150
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:20,389
Now we have this code in a slice where you're

1151
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:23,000
actually building an agent just with a couple of lines

1152
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,550
of code.

1153
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:27,219
So let's try to deploy this.

1154
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:30,938
We have created

1155
00:41:31,398 --> 00:41:32,458
some shortcut.

1156
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:38,449
So that it builds, uh,

1157
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:39,519
while it is building.

1158
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,449
We are using SAM template

1159
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,449
for building, uh, but

1160
00:41:44,989 --> 00:41:46,070
anybody knows what SAM is?

1161
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:50,039
Exactly.

1162
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:52,648
So do you have that clicker thing? Oh, sorry,

1163
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:53,360
yeah, no worries.

1164
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:56,059
So what it is doing is, uh, you

1165
00:41:56,059 --> 00:41:58,139
can use cloud formation, you can use CDK,

1166
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:00,250
you can use SAM. We are using SAM because it's

1167
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:00,800
easier

1168
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:03,239
for this kind of, uh, demo,

1169
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:04,860
but you can also use Terraform.

1170
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,360
That is not the main

1171
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:09,429
thing what we are trying to show here.

1172
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,458
So while it builds, what it is doing is it is deploying

1173
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:14,860
your strands-based AI agent on lambda.

1174
00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:17,239
It is creating an API gateway in front of it.

1175
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:19,378
And as you can see in this code,

1176
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:21,398
We also give the

1177
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,978
URL for the MCP server to connect

1178
00:42:23,978 --> 00:42:26,519
to. So this is where we have already deployed

1179
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:29,000
an MCP server. This is the API gateway URL.

1180
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,300
Back of it is MCP server running on

1181
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,449
lambda, which is the dice roll. All right,

1182
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:35,619
now we have 5 minutes left and we have 5 minutes

1183
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,878
to test our AI agent. Let's see if it works.

1184
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,070
Fingers crossed,

1185
00:42:41,378 --> 00:42:42,610
fingers crossed. I have faith.

1186
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:47,059
All right. So let's do the

1187
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:49,148
individual test first, rather than giving the full prompt

1188
00:42:49,148 --> 00:42:50,889
and see if individual tools are working.

1189
00:42:55,668 --> 00:42:56,418
Let's just

1190
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:58,719
call test weather. So what it is saying

1191
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:00,949
is, I'm calling my AI agent with this prompt.

1192
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:01,860
How is the weather

1193
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:02,938
in Las Vegas?

1194
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:04,949
And it failed.

1195
00:43:08,429 --> 00:43:10,898
Hell. You know what, uh,

1196
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:13,750
I'll just copy this code because we don't have time to

1197
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,530
debug, otherwise, I would love to debug with you.

1198
00:43:16,688 --> 00:43:18,148
Maybe I miss some.

1199
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,099
Syntax here.

1200
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:33,789
What about the, uh, does the dice roll?

1201
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,539
Yeah, I would be just.

1202
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,119
Try to, no, but it goes to the

1203
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:40,559
strength agent itself.

1204
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:48,070
What was that?

1205
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,280
Oh, we

1206
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,489
did not make enough sacrifices to the demo gods

1207
00:43:57,489 --> 00:44:00,469
today. But

1208
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:02,510
yeah, we still have a few minutes. I think we can

1209
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,530
still test it. Uh, any other questions

1210
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:06,349
you want to walk through it?

1211
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,699
Let's see.

1212
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,590
So this is the total code for creating

1213
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,708
an MCP server dice roll. As you can see, it

1214
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:18,019
is like 70 lines of MCP,

1215
00:44:18,228 --> 00:44:19,510
sorry, SAM template.

1216
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:21,949
It's very much similar to any other lambda function

1217
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:23,550
or API gateway dynamo AP.

1218
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:28,679
Oh, that's fine.

1219
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:31,739
I don't think I broke the stable,

1220
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,659
OK. The,

1221
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:36,918
uh, so with, with, uh, with SAM,

1222
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:39,378
uh, SAM is an extension of cloud

1223
00:44:39,378 --> 00:44:39,958
formation,

1224
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,378
um, so it allows you

1225
00:44:42,378 --> 00:44:43,719
to you know simplify

1226
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:46,300
your your templates a little bit, specially for

1227
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,340
you know for serverless uh technology

1228
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:48,958
specifically,

1229
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,260
um, so we are in this

1230
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,300
template defining just a

1231
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:53,918
simple

1232
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:55,409
API event

1233
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,958
with MCP as the path

1234
00:44:58,378 --> 00:44:59,000
and

1235
00:44:59,418 --> 00:45:02,019
a very simple token authorizer

1236
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:02,938
that's uh.

1237
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:05,989
Reference down here as a uh

1238
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:06,719
as a function.

1239
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:09,500
No

1240
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:12,418
fancy special configurations,

1241
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:13,599
uh,

1242
00:45:13,918 --> 00:45:16,070
typical out of the box API

1243
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:16,619
gateway.

1244
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:18,739
Fairly standard.

1245
00:45:19,409 --> 00:45:25,869
Yeah We

1246
00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:29,250
are just about 10 seconds, 54.

1247
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:30,869
All right,

1248
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:32,648
try that again. Careful of this table.

1249
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:34,208
What's that?

1250
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,648
table's a little uh

1251
00:45:35,989 --> 00:45:38,239
oh yeah. Seen some abuse

1252
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:40,889
this week. All

1253
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:42,969
right. So how is the weather

1254
00:45:42,969 --> 00:45:44,969
in Las Vegas? Let's see if the agent can

1255
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:45,668
figure it out.

1256
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:53,849
So it might be initializing two lambda right now. One is

1257
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:55,469
the agent and one is the

1258
00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:56,429
other one.

1259
00:45:56,849 --> 00:45:59,010
So what it is saying is today is sunny weather. This

1260
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:01,610
is real time. This is live. If you can maybe verify

1261
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:03,659
from your phone. So this is sunny weather,

1262
00:46:03,688 --> 00:46:04,909
54 °F,

1263
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,389
3 miles per 2nd,

1264
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:07,570
3

1265
00:46:08,128 --> 00:46:09,530
MPH from the northwest wind.

1266
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,668
So how about, I know the weather, but

1267
00:46:12,668 --> 00:46:14,849
I'm not asking you about the

1268
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:17,050
weather. Just tell me about the commute.

1269
00:46:17,628 --> 00:46:18,309
So now,

1270
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:21,070
AI agent will figure out that it also

1271
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:21,849
needs to call

1272
00:46:22,269 --> 00:46:24,090
weather API or weather tool

1273
00:46:24,668 --> 00:46:26,978
because it, it, it has access to all the tools.

1274
00:46:27,099 --> 00:46:28,849
It cannot randomly say, OK, you.

1275
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:31,309
You just bike or walk today. So what it

1276
00:46:31,309 --> 00:46:33,179
did was it first figured out the weather.

1277
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:35,668
It says, OK, it's sunny, uh,

1278
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,918
no chance of precipitation, so making

1279
00:46:37,918 --> 00:46:38,978
it ideal for

1280
00:46:39,438 --> 00:46:41,599
walking and biking here. If you choose to drive,

1281
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:42,840
remember to wear sunglasses.

1282
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,389
So let's do one,

1283
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,228
bigger like, uh,

1284
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:49,449
using all tools.

1285
00:46:50,668 --> 00:46:52,409
So let's say if I say test all.

1286
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,579
So what the prompt here is, how

1287
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,739
should I commit today and also roll two dice, which

1288
00:46:57,739 --> 00:46:59,789
we saw in our workflow in the,

1289
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,829
in the presentation.

1290
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:03,619
And let's see in the real world, how the AI agent

1291
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:04,449
talks to the LLM

1292
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:05,668
and figures out.

1293
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:08,019
So it says, if you see here, it says

1294
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:09,760
it called three tools

1295
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:12,179
weather, then commute and dice roll. These

1296
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:13,159
are the exact

1297
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,219
tool names like dice roll,

1298
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:17,059
HTTP request and commute,

1299
00:47:17,378 --> 00:47:18,918
and what is the response? It's saying.

1300
00:47:19,688 --> 00:47:20,429
This is the weather.

1301
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:23,050
Based on the condition, you must.

1302
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,619
You should commute.

1303
00:47:25,898 --> 00:47:28,119
Uh, your commute should be straightforward. Additionally,

1304
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:29,590
you asked me to roll two dicees.

1305
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,079
6 and 2 is the total, so

1306
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,199
totaling to 8.

1307
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,639
So it actually called 32s in the

1308
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:37,260
sequence without us telling

1309
00:47:37,878 --> 00:47:40,148
what, what, what to call in which order. So

1310
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,389
to answer your question, sir,

1311
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:43,898
this is how it will determine, uh,

1312
00:47:44,398 --> 00:47:44,938
and

1313
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,800
if you like the.

1314
00:47:47,918 --> 00:47:48,478
Session.

1315
00:47:48,918 --> 00:47:51,199
So we are asking AI agent,

1316
00:47:51,398 --> 00:47:53,250
how was the session because we almost finished it.

1317
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:56,280
So we are asking, uh, will I, will we

1318
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,360
get 5 stars from you all? Let's see if we can

1319
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,139
figure that out.

1320
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:04,610
What do you guys think? Will we get 5 stars from you

1321
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:07,090
guys? Yeah,

1322
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:08,110
so let's see.

1323
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:10,929
Let's see what the agent says.

1324
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,478
I cannot predict the exact review, but I'm

1325
00:48:14,478 --> 00:48:16,550
sure it will be amazing. If not 5

1326
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:18,639
stars, at least the agent will give it a solid

1327
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:19,340
thumbs up.

1328
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,059
Uh,

1329
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:22,829
keep going and have fun with it.

1330
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,300
Thank you for having us.

1331
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:26,239
Thank you and thank you for joining.
