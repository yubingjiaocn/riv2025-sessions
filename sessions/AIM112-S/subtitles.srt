1
00:00:02,588 --> 00:00:04,709
Alright, hello everyone, thank you and

2
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:06,038
welcome to our session.

3
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:08,368
We really appreciate you being here with us today

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:11,179
on your last day of reinvent. How's

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:12,169
it going out there?

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,648
You still have the same energy you brought to day one?

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,510
Yeah, OK,

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,789
so, hi, I'm Joel. For this session we're gonna

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,829
do something pretty different than

10
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:23,769
you would normally see

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,440
in a lot of these sessions

12
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:28,030
because, um, I, I, I'm with

13
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,269
GLA. We're gonna talk about AI

14
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,870
and Glean and fun things like that, but

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,529
I don't think that's nearly as interesting as talking to

16
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:36,908
smart people who are in the process of deploying AI

17
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:37,950
or have deployed AI

18
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:40,609
and talking to them about what they've seen, done,

19
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:41,630
and know.

20
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,060
So, um, I'm just looking at how many people

21
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,179
are here in this room.

22
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:47,228
We're gonna ask some questions

23
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:49,728
of these, of our illustrious panel here

24
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:51,630
who I have introduced themselves in a second,

25
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,168
um, and we've got some prompts for them to start

26
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:56,090
talking about it, but I would love your feedback.

27
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:58,368
We have one little problem which is,

28
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,389
I don't have a mic to go hold to you,

29
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,889
so if you have a, and I can't really see you very well

30
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:04,088
because it's very bright,

31
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,010
but.

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,680
I would love you to have the opportunity

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,709
to ask questions of our panel as well

34
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,120
so if you have something like that, you can either step

35
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,439
forward or if you shout it loud enough I can hear it. I'll

36
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:14,980
repeat it

37
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,500
so that so that everyone can hear it well

38
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,459
but um

39
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,838
with that I think let's get started and

40
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:22,918
talk a little bit about who's who. So maybe

41
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:24,918
um Marcel we can start with you and we can do

42
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,000
just a quick introduction as we go down the

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,939
line. Absolutely,

44
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,599
uh, Marcel Pivotal, I'm a solutions

45
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,760
architect with Glenn.

46
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:34,879
Um, I've been on the

47
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,058
technology space for about 20 something years

48
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:39,778
doing a lot of networking implementation

49
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:41,579
across multiple hyper scalers.

50
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,359
Um, I was for about 5 years,

51
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,870
uh, in AWS doing traditional

52
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,459
machine learning implementation and

53
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:50,719
for the last 2 years,

54
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,198
uh, doing

55
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,849
generative AI workflows,

56
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,058
uh, across multiple verticals with

57
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:58,739
AWS and with Glen.

58
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,790
Nice to meet you all.

59
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:02,730
Good afternoon,

60
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,278
everyone. I am Rohit Bala Subramanyan.

61
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:06,588
I'm with Deloitte.

62
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,629
I have been with Deloitte for

63
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,449
about 28 years now,

64
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:12,508
uh, which flew in a flash, I guess.

65
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,929
I've grown up in technology, just

66
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:16,889
like uh the illustrious panel here.

67
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:19,899
I've done a bunch of things, as you can imagine, beginning

68
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:20,758
with ERP,

69
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,580
data warehousing, and business intelligence when that

70
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,319
was a big thing.

71
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,139
Uh, I've helped stand up our big

72
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:28,000
data business.

73
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,990
I helped run our cloud business,

74
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,879
and now I'm looking to

75
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:34,419
bravely take the charge into

76
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:36,778
selling services around AI and Agentic

77
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:39,020
AI. Very happy to be here and

78
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,258
looking forward to this conversation. Absolutely.

79
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:43,460
Thank you. Um, good afternoon,

80
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,050
everyone. My name is Ravia Mamou, Senior

81
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,550
Director at uh Docusain.

82
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,129
Um,

83
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:50,050
my experience,

84
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,649
you know, goes along the same way,

85
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:54,409
with the other two gentlemen, 20+ years.

86
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:57,199
I started in the database

87
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,758
technology, so, so very well.

88
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:01,830
Uh, burst with the, the database technologies,

89
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,118
data platforms.

90
00:03:03,788 --> 00:03:05,830
In the last few years when, you know,

91
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:07,210
the whole thing about

92
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,028
G A into pictures, so me and my team have

93
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:12,330
reskilled ourselves to deploy

94
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,990
many pervasive AI tools and capabilities

95
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,610
to the company

96
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:17,610
and building the agents

97
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,349
and deploying the solutions

98
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,349
itself to the company. So we'll talk more about

99
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,179
that. So

100
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,588
for, for those of you who are who are are interested,

101
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,038
this is how we sort of set this up. Ravi

102
00:03:29,038 --> 00:03:31,159
is in the middle of deploying right now

103
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,740
and working with his team and leading them

104
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:34,349
to really doing AI

105
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:35,219
for real,

106
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,679
for DocuSign in a meaningful way.

107
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:39,088
And Rohit

108
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,979
has seen it done a bunch of times

109
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,860
at Deloitte across a bunch of customers

110
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,219
and Marcel

111
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,258
has seen it done.

112
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:49,500
With AWS systems very extensively

113
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:52,028
so this is why we've brought these folks

114
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:54,069
in to to sit with you and

115
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:56,149
to talk through some of the questions we have. So let's start

116
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:57,368
with our first prompt here

117
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:59,088
and let's talk about uh

118
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:02,169
about the popularity of

119
00:04:02,588 --> 00:04:03,929
let me see if I can make that happen.

120
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,520
Let's talk about the popularity of

121
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,899
AI and where it's going right now. So here's

122
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:10,879
a quote from Gartner

123
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,490
about, uh, enterprise software applications

124
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,819
including agentic AI. And so I guess my

125
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:16,639
question would be

126
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,720
maybe we can start with you, Rohi, right? Like.

127
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,778
Are you seeing people today

128
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,819
really deploying

129
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:26,619
AI across?

130
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,600
10%, 5% of their decision making?

131
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,798
How, how pervasive is it today

132
00:04:32,798 --> 00:04:35,079
in, in where people are using? It's a great

133
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:37,139
question, and I'll give you um

134
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,019
a couple of

135
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,540
thoughts on that, right?

136
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,358
We As you would expect

137
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:44,278
as a professional services firm,

138
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:45,910
we work across

139
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,439
a whole host of industries and

140
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,319
in my role,

141
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,369
you know, I play across industries.

142
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:52,588
So, when I look at

143
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:54,509
this question,

144
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,470
I absolutely see

145
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,009
AI in different forms,

146
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:00,329
not just agentic,

147
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,439
Machine learning,

148
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,660
plus plus plus, now to agentic

149
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:05,959
playing in

150
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,399
life sciences.

151
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:10,178
Uh, we see it clearly in financial services,

152
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,238
banking and insurance.

153
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,879
Um, so yes, it is pervasive

154
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,709
across industry and industry sectors.

155
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,519
The,

156
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:21,108
the interesting thing is when I looked at

157
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:23,420
this quote here, about

158
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,100
33% of

159
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,410
software applications, enabling 15%,

160
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:29,420
you know,

161
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,259
are we there as yet?

162
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:33,519
I don't think so,

163
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:36,189
right? But I definitely think

164
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:38,199
that Agente is here to

165
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,170
stay and grow,

166
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,988
and this will only, you know, gather

167
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:43,069
momentum as we come.

168
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:44,910
But so, to sum up,

169
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,569
pervasive across

170
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,829
industry sectors with certain sectors leading.

171
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:52,798
And this is definitely the the the trend

172
00:05:52,798 --> 00:05:53,459
that we see.

173
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:56,670
So, Robbie, I mean, obviously you're,

174
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,420
you're in the thick of things

175
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,019
at DocuSign.

176
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:04,428
We, we all sort of are thinking our, our peers

177
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:06,509
are doing it, our competitors are doing it, our employees are

178
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:07,928
doing it whether we like it or not.

179
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,769
Um,

180
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:11,829
uh, what, what do you, what are your

181
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:12,420
goals here?

182
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:14,488
Like how much of

183
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:17,149
work do you think AI is gonna be able to take over

184
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:19,189
for your team? How realistic is it that it

185
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:20,329
will be able to take it over

186
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,189
meaningfully soon?

187
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:24,699
Yeah, I'm, um, you know, I'm just not going to

188
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,699
talk just for me and my team

189
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,939
because we have been working

190
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,980
with um a lot of different

191
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,949
organizations within Tussain.

192
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,720
I'll just, um, see what I'm, I'll

193
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,220
just say what I'm seeing,

194
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,298
you know, within,

195
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:40,488
um, the organizations, right? So,

196
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,059
so definitely, I see the shift.

197
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:45,738
Yeah, a lot is happening and if you look at

198
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,759
like, you know, a few years before,

199
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:49,449
there were a lot of hesitations,

200
00:06:49,738 --> 00:06:50,838
right, to use

201
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:52,869
the AI because, you know,

202
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,559
what we are uploading,

203
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:56,980
what the, you know, models will do and things like

204
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,139
that, right? Uh, we have come a

205
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:01,220
long way, but, um, if you

206
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,379
look at it, we are actually said that,

207
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:05,778
oh let's do the, you know, AIA

208
00:07:05,778 --> 00:07:07,819
first mind mindset strategy,

209
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,290
right? And with that, what

210
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,420
we are saying,

211
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:14,290
everyone in the company or, you know, my

212
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,048
team also,

213
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:16,009
that

214
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,329
whatever you do, you know, how can

215
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:19,230
you think of

216
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:20,488
doing fast with the AI?

217
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,399
Right, now, having said that, you know,

218
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:25,889
I know these percentages may have come up with,

219
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:27,139
uh, some surveys,

220
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,720
but, but, you know,

221
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:31,059
will, will we, will we be there at

222
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,528
that percentage? I don't know,

223
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,000
but the shift is definitely happening, happening,

224
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:37,678
and we have deployed a lot of tools

225
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:40,338
and we also have built a lot of

226
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:40,920
tools

227
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,569
and we are in the thick of

228
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:46,319
developing the agents for multiple,

229
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:48,899
you know, business processes and so on. So I

230
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:49,858
see the shift is happening.

231
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,369
But one thing that I want to highlight with

232
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:53,189
respect to

233
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:54,470
um

234
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,309
the autonomous agents,

235
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:57,410
you know,

236
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,470
that's where

237
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,730
I think we are thinking a lot, can that be

238
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,790
really autonomous?

239
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:03,350
And

240
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:05,548
I'm not seeing that right now

241
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:08,088
on the agency that we're building, but can we go

242
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,278
there? We believe it can be,

243
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:13,449
but um for that, I think a lot of LLMs

244
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:14,709
are actually maturing

245
00:08:15,048 --> 00:08:15,709
and when we

246
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,178
see the shift is happening from maybe

247
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:20,730
from probabilistic to deterministic

248
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,769
model. You know, we, we'll be able to

249
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,189
take those decisions very confident

250
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:26,588
confidently is what I'm thinking.

251
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,850
You know, I see that there's, there's actually

252
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,309
a, a semantic challenge

253
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:33,609
with this emerging space of AI

254
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:34,969
around this term autonomous.

255
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:36,149
So, um,

256
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,609
I, I know that it can mean two things. One

257
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:41,070
thing it can mean that the agent is actually

258
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,450
taking action and doing stuff without human intervention.

259
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:46,019
Um, but there's also a second way just for

260
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:48,298
everyone here that people, um, in the AI

261
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:50,928
space are using it and that is as a, uh,

262
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,099
agents that are able to sort of think and

263
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,288
plan for themselves and evaluate their work on their own,

264
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,639
but they still require human intervention too,

265
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,729
um. So,

266
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,269
um, Marcel, I guess my question for you

267
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:04,849
is. Is autonomous

268
00:09:05,548 --> 00:09:07,548
like true autonomy where it does everything

269
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,548
without human intervention? Is that to, to

270
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,788
Robbie's point, he's like, mm not so sure on

271
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:13,779
that. What, what are your thoughts there?

272
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:16,308
Yeah, what I, what I've been seeing across multiple

273
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:17,649
customers is

274
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:19,769
focusing on the business outcome,

275
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,369
uh, and

276
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:23,359
depending on the level of the agent,

277
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,149
you may have some level of

278
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:26,989
complete automation.

279
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:29,788
But the reality is that today human

280
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:31,918
in the loop is critical, evaluation is

281
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:32,519
critical,

282
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:34,840
making sure that you, the

283
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,440
outcome that you're receiving

284
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:37,750
is validated,

285
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,469
uh, so not only through a pilot

286
00:09:40,469 --> 00:09:42,719
phase but also when you move that into

287
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,840
production, you need to have a pipeline

288
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,340
that you're able to make sure

289
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,000
that your agent is behaving as expected

290
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:51,500
and as that progresses

291
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,529
and you earn more trust,

292
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,099
then you may be coming into an autonomous

293
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:56,759
agent.

294
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,820
Um,

295
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,340
but I will say

296
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:02,038
I have seen few use cases

297
00:10:02,158 --> 00:10:04,168
that are completely autonomous and,

298
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
and few that we might be comfortable

299
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,399
with allowing to run without

300
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,000
human overview.

301
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,979
Yeah, thank you for that. I'm gonna try this

302
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,038
button again here. I may need to stand up.

303
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:17,200
So, you were all talking a little bit

304
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,538
about, you talked about trust and we were talking about

305
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,000
several other components here. There's a quote from

306
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,629
our CEO founder, right,

307
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,320
but about organizational complexity

308
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,000
being the biggest challenge. So,

309
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,080
so

310
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:32,009
Oh, so Robbie,

311
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:34,729
organizational complexity or clicker complexity

312
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:36,590
being a big bottleneck, um.

313
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,489
How are you addressing this idea of

314
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,869
true transformation, right?

315
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:45,989
Because it's such a people-based, trust-based,

316
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,330
behavior-based

317
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,139
item, and

318
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:52,580
How complex an organization is and how an

319
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,558
organization works is like the thumbprint of that org,

320
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:55,668
right? How,

321
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:58,219
how are you thinking about organizational complexity

322
00:10:58,219 --> 00:10:58,879
versus

323
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,320
model,

324
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,019
like your technical coolness of

325
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:04,219
what's going on in AI.

326
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:07,219
Yeah, so definitely, right, I think, um, you

327
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:08,369
know, some of you,

328
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:11,000
you know, maybe coming from startup to

329
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,019
mid-size versus uh very, you

330
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,808
know, large size organizations.

331
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,479
I truly believe that the complexities,

332
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,609
you know, proportional to, in my opinion,

333
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:21,859
the size of the organizations, right?

334
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:24,298
Um, but having said that, I just want

335
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:26,298
to go back where we started the

336
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:28,298
journey. So at that time when, you

337
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:30,928
know, Open a GPT model 33.5

338
00:11:30,928 --> 00:11:32,200
was released.

339
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,668
You know, there was only a very small team,

340
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,178
you know, going back and exploring what is

341
00:11:37,178 --> 00:11:37,908
it about

342
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,369
and you know how can we use that effectively and

343
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:42,849
so on, but very soon every

344
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:44,849
single team started to play around and

345
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:45,570
things like that

346
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:47,950
that that brought a challenge

347
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,830
which is basically,

348
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,109
you know, how many tools are there for the same,

349
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:53,570
you know, for, for solving the same

350
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,629
type of the problem,

351
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:57,129
you know, multiple teams would come back

352
00:11:57,129 --> 00:11:59,250
with the different products available in the market.

353
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:02,269
So one is the clear boundaries

354
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:03,469
of who wants what,

355
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,279
right? So that's the, that's one of the things,

356
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:08,519
you know, is helping us. Otherwise,

357
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:10,009
it's kind of the, you know,

358
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,019
everyone is trying to do everything.

359
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:14,369
But the second one was that also brought

360
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:16,609
other challenges. OK, so we

361
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:18,700
brought multiple different tools out there,

362
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:20,629
but how do we take those tools,

363
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:22,889
those tools to the, you know, the teams

364
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:24,729
or other organizations and so on.

365
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:27,099
And the challenge what we have seen is,

366
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,769
oh, can you give me a blueprint of

367
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,590
when should I use which models? I'm getting confused.

368
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:33,729
OK, you are using,

369
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:36,109
you know, Google Gemini, when should I use

370
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:38,178
it, or Notebook Gla, when should I use it?

371
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:39,570
Or we have built our own,

372
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:41,908
no, um, you know, internal kind of the

373
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:42,548
JGPD

374
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,029
with all the models available. So when should I use

375
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,418
it? Then we are actually,

376
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:49,428
we were actually exploring enterprise

377
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:50,330
search tools.

378
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:52,798
Um, which is actually very interactive,

379
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,340
personalized, and things like that, right? So when

380
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,450
we are bringing that many tools to the

381
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,460
users, they were really confused as

382
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,250
well, right?

383
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,820
And the other aspect of it is,

384
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,259
um, you know, how do you enable them?

385
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:06,619
How do you train them,

386
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:08,759
and how do you develop the

387
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:11,379
responsible AA policies

388
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:12,558
and things like that. So,

389
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,259
those were, you know, some of the challenges

390
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:16,340
that what we have seen.

391
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:18,769
In the organization, but on the other hand, the

392
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:21,070
models we look at it, we started with 3.3,

393
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,288
3.5. Now, we are seeing

394
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:24,759
all the way up to 5.1,

395
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,489
then Gemini Gemini 3, so

396
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,389
it's evolving very fast, but

397
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,428
sometimes, you know,

398
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:31,869
these complexities

399
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,190
preventing us to, you know,

400
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:35,989
run at the same speed.

401
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:38,190
So I think we had to be,

402
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,109
you know,

403
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:41,330
aware of the fact that.

404
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:44,009
You know, the training is needed, you

405
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,210
know, the, you know, multiple approval

406
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,269
is needed across

407
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:50,009
security, legal, and things like that. So, if

408
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,210
you take care of that, I think this complexity

409
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,808
can be minimized to some extent.

410
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:56,928
So one of the aspects of organizational complexity

411
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:59,109
that I've seen a lot is, and, and

412
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:01,200
probably Marcel you've, you've seen this too, is

413
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:03,700
who owns what part of what tools,

414
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:05,950
who's willing to give you API access to

415
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,950
their walled garden of tools, and that's

416
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,759
inside an organization, right?

417
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,109
Um, you might say, oh well, I think that SAS

418
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:12,969
tool is owned by

419
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,048
that department now I have to go ask them

420
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,629
if I can get access for my AI

421
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:19,489
tools because I'm trying,

422
00:14:19,788 --> 00:14:20,928
uh, uh, I'm

423
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:23,229
trying to synthesize these things together and to a

424
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,090
certain extent the.

425
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,700
The AI initiative becomes the

426
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,418
forcing factor of

427
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:31,798
an integrated workflow that probably should have been

428
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:32,750
there beforehand

429
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,479
but isn't because people are busy and they're working

430
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:37,009
in their own, their own groups, right?

431
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,599
Absolutely. So I can add 11

432
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,759
example right when we recently came with

433
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,019
the MCP strategy,

434
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,519
right. So where do we host it? Who wants

435
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,538
it? Who will create the custom MCP servers

436
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:48,678
and things like that? So

437
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,739
a lot going on there. So yeah,

438
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,219
I'm a strong believer that, um,

439
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:54,678
organizational,

440
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:55,779
um, technical

441
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,879
technical

442
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:59,710
complexity mirrors organizational

443
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,479
complexity. So

444
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:03,820
the tools are there and normally as you

445
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,158
go and implement those

446
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:07,719
you will implement it as your

447
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:10,178
organization growth so you will have data silos

448
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:12,440
you will have governance problems so

449
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,298
security is your best friend.

450
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:17,029
On this situation, you need to

451
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,908
work with security from day one

452
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,269
to be able to go across those

453
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:23,389
data silos and those accesses

454
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:25,090
so you will be able to share

455
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:28,070
that context into uh

456
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,369
your agentics, you know,

457
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,109
the frontier models,

458
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:33,808
they move real quick like every other month

459
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:34,820
we have a new model,

460
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,489
but what really holds you down

461
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:40,340
is the complexity that you have on your

462
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,469
organization and how you bubble up that

463
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:44,369
data into the models.

464
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,779
So, Rohit, I know you've seen,

465
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,918
because you've come from a data and analytics space

466
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,979
where every team has their data.

467
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,000
How do we convince teams to work

468
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,460
better together, how to integrate

469
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,000
and allow for the synthesis of their stuff, that

470
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:02,288
that was what makes AI work? Absolutely.

471
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:04,739
I mean, you hit the nail on the head when you talked

472
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:06,599
about, use the word synthesis, right?

473
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:08,298
EI

474
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:10,619
And agentic especially.

475
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,658
is not about

476
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:15,820
Bolting an AI solution to a

477
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,048
legacy.

478
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:18,840
scenario.

479
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,440
It's actually about reimagining

480
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,479
workflows, reimagining

481
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,038
processes,

482
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,399
and so when you, and that's really when you

483
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,058
get the

484
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,298
true bang for the buck and the true

485
00:16:29,558 --> 00:16:30,690
value uplift.

486
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:31,869
And so,

487
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,859
by definition,

488
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:37,450
Reimagining or re-engineering

489
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,109
processes

490
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:40,450
to judiciously put in

491
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:41,590
AI.

492
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:43,450
Involves

493
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:45,408
business stakeholders,

494
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,279
has to involve data stakeholders,

495
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:51,428
has to involve technology, has to involve

496
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,739
almost every part of an organization,

497
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:56,509
right? So by definition,

498
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,090
there's got to be a very strong

499
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,639
AI or analytics strategy

500
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,828
which calls out the active

501
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:07,529
participation of all of these stakeholders

502
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:08,848
in various

503
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:11,910
levels of degree across the life cycle of.

504
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,650
Even a use case implementation.

505
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,180
So, we've

506
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,338
also learned, you know, after stumbling

507
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,559
in the first few

508
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:21,348
years,

509
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:23,838
we've also learned, uh, you know, how

510
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:24,500
to refine

511
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,469
our professional services,

512
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,180
the strate the strategic part of what we offer.

513
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:30,858
And one of the things we

514
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:32,699
keep front and center

515
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,670
is,

516
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:36,000
you know, a strategic approach to

517
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,739
roadmaps.

518
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,229
A strategic approach to

519
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,689
business value capture right at

520
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,769
the beginning in terms of defining what

521
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:45,269
the success criteria are,

522
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,250
a very strategic and comprehensive

523
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,630
approach to making sure that

524
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,549
multiple stakeholders are gonna be part of the plan,

525
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:54,719
and then you go about delivering it.

526
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,348
You know, I'll hark back to the

527
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:59,608
33% and the 15%

528
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:01,750
numbers which were all positive and it's all good,

529
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,469
but we also know

530
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,250
that. You know,

531
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:07,269
what, what was this? As of last year,

532
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,368
some 90% of,

533
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:10,348
uh, yeah,

534
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,019
projects were failing.

535
00:18:12,348 --> 00:18:14,400
And There are many reasons for

536
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,630
that, but I think right at the core,

537
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:19,000
the reason was that, you know, all

538
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,239
the different pieces that needed to play

539
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:23,338
nicely to actually make this a success

540
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,108
wasn't in place in different organizations.

541
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,189
That realization is coming now,

542
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,779
which is why we're seeing the uptick in these numbers

543
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,219
and which is why we're seeing some greater implementations.

544
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,559
Yeah, the, the research is very, very clear

545
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,640
here that AI does better

546
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,199
when it is fed the right relevant context.

547
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,818
And that that context does not exist in one

548
00:18:42,818 --> 00:18:44,858
system. And so we have a real

549
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,900
problem where the technology is

550
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,229
forcing the change in the

551
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:50,739
organization, because

552
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:53,098
the answers you get from AI if it's based on

553
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,680
one tool, one data set, one silo,

554
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:58,338
are not super useful.

555
00:18:58,618 --> 00:18:59,279
And so

556
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,608
we end up having, if we're talking

557
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,618
about really implementing AI

558
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:05,939
and really transforming orgs towards AI

559
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:08,439
now we have to make a very

560
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:09,318
different.

561
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,939
Business decision about how we operate,

562
00:19:12,189 --> 00:19:12,818
which is

563
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:15,559
hard. It's way harder than paying

564
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,959
some vendor some money to get AI,

565
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:19,479
right? Like, like paying some vendor to

566
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:21,920
get some money to get AI is relatively trivial.

567
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:24,400
Um, I will say this, this is, this

568
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,519
is an important point that I think this slide brings up for

569
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,640
me, and maybe we'll see a show of hands

570
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,920
out there and I'll try and do this. Um, who

571
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,279
thinks OpenAI has the best LLM

572
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,180
model right now?

573
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,890
OK, no hands. All right,

574
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:40,390
uh, Google and Gemini, like anybody?

575
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:42,868
Yeah, I got a couple of hands,

576
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:44,689
uh, Claude,

577
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:45,598
anthropic?

578
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,009
Anybody? I see a couple of

579
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:50,088
years, yeah, so I always ask that question and then I say, OK,

580
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,250
in 18 months who do you think is gonna have

581
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:52,799
the best model.

582
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:56,199
We don't know, and

583
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:58,289
everybody chuckles, right, because we, we don't know. And

584
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:00,390
so I think one thing to think about this too is

585
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,729
if you over rotate on which model, if

586
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:03,299
you spend

587
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:05,709
a ton of money buying a model,

588
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:08,209
you will almost certainly be disappointed

589
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:10,368
because we are in a horse race and you're

590
00:20:10,368 --> 00:20:12,368
betting on who's gonna win, and that means a

591
00:20:12,368 --> 00:20:13,390
lot of people. People are gonna lose.

592
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:15,969
And so when you're deploying this, I think Robbie,

593
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:17,088
like you're talking about

594
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,108
multiple tries and how we get it in multi-threaded

595
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:22,219
and and wrote it around the

596
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:24,509
organization, right? It's really important to be

597
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:26,828
open and have an open ecosystem

598
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:28,108
so that you can choose it.

599
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,848
AI is not done.

600
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,189
The innovation is not done. It's accelerating and

601
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,189
so that's just one takeaway from

602
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:36,199
here. Now we

603
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,318
talk and it just works like a charm this time

604
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:39,250
by the way. I don't

605
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,328
you have the magic touch, um.

606
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:45,269
So, so here's a quote from HBR right

607
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:47,500
about compatibility issues and data silos.

608
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:48,390
So.

609
00:20:49,368 --> 00:20:51,729
This process redesign, I think we've been talking

610
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:53,529
about quite a bit.

611
00:20:54,578 --> 00:20:55,930
But how are,

612
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,078
how are Marcel, how are you seeing.

613
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:02,170
This idea of needing to interconnect all that

614
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:02,868
data working

615
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,949
technically,

616
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:06,608
right, because that's a non-trivial technical challenge

617
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:07,269
as well,

618
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:09,689
yeah, absolutely. I, I think that a

619
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:11,979
few, a few things here. One is,

620
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:14,410
um, you have the traditional connectors

621
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,529
that connects to your data sources in.

622
00:21:16,713 --> 00:21:17,564
Test all that data,

623
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:19,805
you know, kind of merge that together

624
00:21:20,265 --> 00:21:21,414
and give you context,

625
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:23,743
uh, but in the last few

626
00:21:23,743 --> 00:21:25,785
months we have seen MCPs

627
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,743
coming into place,

628
00:21:27,104 --> 00:21:29,265
tools coming into place, actions,

629
00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:30,364
so

630
00:21:30,674 --> 00:21:33,305
almost every service out there that has an API

631
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:34,884
they are able to connect.

632
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:37,463
There are AI AI systems that

633
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,703
are being built

634
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,104
for that communication to work,

635
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:42,005
um.

636
00:21:42,449 --> 00:21:44,130
Now if we talk about legacy systems,

637
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:46,650
everyone has legacy systems in here and

638
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,029
they may don't have an API to be exposed

639
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:51,489
or they, they may have some kind of, you

640
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:53,890
know, legacy configuration and technical

641
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,989
depth that hasn't been worked on.

642
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:58,789
Then you definitely need to work around maybe

643
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:00,858
configuring some kind of wrappers APIs

644
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:02,858
around that and making sure you figure it

645
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:04,900
out, you know, how do you expose that

646
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,019
data into the uh

647
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:08,108
AI systems,

648
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:10,858
but as it is today and I, I

649
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:13,279
believe that more and more tools will become available.

650
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,809
You have multiple options

651
00:22:16,088 --> 00:22:18,439
to interconnecting to your data sources,

652
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:20,588
so you have a full view

653
00:22:21,328 --> 00:22:24,029
of how your enterprise data works

654
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:26,489
and that is kind of the context

655
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:28,838
key that you are able to pass

656
00:22:28,838 --> 00:22:31,410
to all of your agentic workflows

657
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,799
and AI workflows,

658
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,029
you know, the better the context,

659
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:36,880
the better the response,

660
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,348
you know, uh,

661
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,789
models, the LLM models,

662
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,309
they are raw, they understand.

663
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:45,868
A lot of different things

664
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,650
we are looking into enterprise context.

665
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:49,348
That's why

666
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,549
bridging these data silos is key

667
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,750
to be able to have good success.

668
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:57,328
And of course, uh, so everyone has just done

669
00:22:57,328 --> 00:22:59,269
that and we're in a great state now, right?

670
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:02,088
No, we are far, far away from that and

671
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:04,150
that's why MCP just came out a few

672
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:06,269
months ago we saw

673
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:09,150
a need in the market of how to integrate

674
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,289
and expose these tools to have access

675
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:11,828
to these

676
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,009
data silos in a different way.

677
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:16,430
You know, you bring up an excellent point

678
00:23:16,689 --> 00:23:18,430
and I'm gonna tie this

679
00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:20,969
back a little to what we just spoke about which

680
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:22,979
is. The real value

681
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:25,098
of AI coming when you reimagine

682
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:27,239
workflows, and workflows,

683
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:30,098
for the most part live in operational

684
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:30,959
systems.

685
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,000
What we're also seeing

686
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,650
is, in some cases, a

687
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,640
reluctance

688
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,529
For many reasons, but a reluctance

689
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,529
to

690
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:42,410
give access

691
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:44,588
to operational systems.

692
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:46,489
They are really guarded, right?

693
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,868
They're the, they're the jewels, and so no one wants to

694
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:50,709
give you access. So this

695
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,469
actually creates a tension,

696
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:54,750
if you think about it. On one side, we're talking about

697
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,789
agents, which can, you know, work in

698
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:58,868
a reimagined process. On the other

699
00:23:58,868 --> 00:24:00,549
side, we're saying, no, no, no, all that is good,

700
00:24:00,868 --> 00:24:02,209
but don't touch my system.

701
00:24:03,078 --> 00:24:05,410
And funnily enough, at

702
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,150
least as an interim state,

703
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:10,130
what we're seeing in a few organizations

704
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,229
across industries

705
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:12,509
is

706
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:13,549
the

707
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,088
I won't call it the re-emergence, but the reimportance

708
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,670
of things such as a data lake

709
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:22,209
which we thought, listen, is gonna be passe

710
00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:24,539
because now we're going into AI and agentic AI

711
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:25,568
lakes are gonna,

712
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,118
you know, go away.

713
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,199
No, they're not,

714
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,828
because in many organizations they're saying hang on.

715
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,549
Yes, you need data

716
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,078
because you need to get to context for your AI

717
00:24:35,078 --> 00:24:35,969
to really work.

718
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,160
We will get you the data from our systems

719
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,618
and then you run that off of your lake in some

720
00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:43,719
way, shape or form. Very interesting. So there are

721
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:46,059
all these interim architectures

722
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,858
which we are actually living through right now.

723
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,828
I, I think,

724
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,858
I think there's a a mistake

725
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,279
that, that I've made and that I've seen made

726
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,660
in the media, which is

727
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,519
people don't want to give up their, their

728
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,759
special operational data because they're

729
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:00,559
afraid their jobs are.

730
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:01,714
go away or whatever.

731
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:03,915
But I, I think psychologically

732
00:25:04,255 --> 00:25:06,494
that misses the fact that we've been training those

733
00:25:06,494 --> 00:25:08,836
teams that own mission critical operational data

734
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:11,056
to be incredibly secure about it,

735
00:25:11,415 --> 00:25:13,165
very worried about its availability,

736
00:25:13,455 --> 00:25:15,076
very worried about um

737
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:17,714
whether or not it's accurate, correct, and ready,

738
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:20,195
and it's almost that they don't trust

739
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:22,605
us to take it out of their

740
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,695
operational arm because they've had beaten into

741
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:26,061
them. For the last decade,

742
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,641
make sure it's perfect, make sure it's always working, make sure it's

743
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:30,682
always available, make sure the data is clean,

744
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:31,780
and they can't

745
00:25:32,161 --> 00:25:34,311
trust us to do it. I, I think it's

746
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:36,401
less about, oh no, my job's gonna go away and

747
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:37,061
more about

748
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:39,481
this data is really important to our company.

749
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:40,442
Let's work together,

750
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,082
make sure that all that knowledge that you know

751
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:45,770
that you have, bring it into the AI ecosystem.

752
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:47,961
Yeah, Robbie, what I was trying to add

753
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:48,981
was I think.

754
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:50,680
I agree with you.

755
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,180
I think there's one set of folks like what you said,

756
00:25:53,608 --> 00:25:54,930
right? They want the operation data,

757
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:57,559
but then probably there's some security

758
00:25:57,939 --> 00:25:59,400
or or fear

759
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,739
on, on the job, uh, and so on.

760
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:03,598
But the other set I have

761
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:05,750
seen, what I have seen is that.

762
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,489
Probably, you know, they,

763
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:09,559
I mean,

764
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:10,799
the,

765
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,078
they're not into the A world

766
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,969
and hence they are really, really afraid

767
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,019
and probably they feel it's risky to

768
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:19,459
expose my data to the AI

769
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:22,180
and you know, with all the models

770
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,170
that we work with, we clearly

771
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:26,969
You know, have a policy. I think it is

772
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:28,630
putting the message as well saying that

773
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:31,250
no models will train using the enterprise

774
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,078
data and so on.

775
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:34,489
The other aspect is basically, you know.

776
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:37,400
Everybody going through the responsible AA

777
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,640
policies and trainings will also

778
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,660
help to alleviate

779
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,279
some of the problems that you are raising and so on. So, bring

780
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,858
them more awareness, in my opinion,

781
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:46,019
automatically,

782
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:47,598
they feel that, OK.

783
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,759
Well, and

784
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:51,000
we have this huge bias here.

785
00:26:51,358 --> 00:26:52,439
You're an AI expert.

786
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:53,920
You're an AI expert.

787
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:56,318
You're an AI expert. We're like, why are you not

788
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:56,858
helping us?

789
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:59,519
And they, and, and, but you also

790
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,219
quoted that a lot of these projects failed

791
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,348
number. I don't know if it's 90. Well,

792
00:27:03,818 --> 00:27:05,920
like we could have a long discussion about whether or not that number is

793
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,959
correct, but I think the specter of failure is,

794
00:27:08,118 --> 00:27:10,118
is weighing over their heads too. Like why should we

795
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:11,459
trust you and we.

796
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:14,519
What I think we see at Glean is that there are two

797
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:16,640
sets, if you just look at segmenting

798
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,750
people who are interested in us into two groups.

799
00:27:19,318 --> 00:27:19,858
There's

800
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,479
those who are looking for a great AI solution

801
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:24,479
that come to us, cause they love our AI solution.

802
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:28,078
But the majority are people who are looking for a

803
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:30,098
solution, and it may or may not have

804
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,868
AI in it, right? And

805
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,959
we as AI experts immediately leap to

806
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,380
the AI is the solution

807
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:37,509
answer,

808
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:39,880
but uh they're just trying to solve a problem, they're

809
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,078
trying to solve a business problem, and, and we're like AI

810
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:44,199
AI AI, and they, I, I think there's some trust

811
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:44,959
we lose there too.

812
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,299
Do you want any questions from the audience?

813
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:49,910
Yeah, uh, so we just passed the halfway

814
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,529
mark here.

815
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:53,150
So, um, I do wanna encourage you to ask

816
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,189
any questions. So if anybody's got

817
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:57,189
them, probably the best way to do is

818
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:59,189
to holler them loudly,

819
00:27:59,588 --> 00:28:00,789
and then I'll repeat them.

820
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:02,608
If anybody's got any specifically,

821
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:04,989
we've got a whole bunch of these slides with quotes on them, so we

822
00:28:04,989 --> 00:28:05,969
can go all day,

823
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,430
but, uh, we wanna make it as useful to you as

824
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,088
possible.

825
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:12,239
All right, well don't be a stranger.

826
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:14,779
holler or come right up here and, and, and, and

827
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:17,219
ask us as, as we, um, as

828
00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:19,170
questions arise in your head, we'd be happy to do it.

829
00:28:19,618 --> 00:28:21,699
So, I want to pivot a little bit

830
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,739
to this next one because this is one

831
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:25,818
that's close to me as a Glean

832
00:28:25,818 --> 00:28:26,400
person.

833
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:29,469
Um, that I think is a change

834
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:31,769
in what the industry is thinking about when they're thinking

835
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:32,309
about AI.

836
00:28:33,489 --> 00:28:35,009
So Glen has built this

837
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:37,430
tool that allows people to very quickly and

838
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,059
efficiently make agents.

839
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,380
And yet when we look at the agents

840
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,459
which get the most use across our

841
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:45,299
customer base,

842
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:48,299
they're ones that have been built by specialists

843
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:49,279
over years.

844
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,759
Now, I built, I, look, I work at Glean, I

845
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,858
have agents I run every day that do all kinds of cool tasks

846
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:56,328
for me. It's very nice. I would love to show it off. It's fantastic.

847
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:59,118
But these really transformational

848
00:28:59,118 --> 00:29:01,250
agents take time and work.

849
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,858
And so from this McKenzie study, I think it's really

850
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:04,769
interesting to think that like,

851
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:06,759
An individual

852
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,039
employee

853
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,739
is looking at a future where they can

854
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:12,900
use AI to make a recurrent

855
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,400
workflow or to make their life easier,

856
00:29:15,818 --> 00:29:18,380
but that is seldom transformational

857
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,739
for an organization.

858
00:29:20,348 --> 00:29:22,640
So Robbie, how do you think about like, who

859
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,709
do you let build agents? How do

860
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:25,489
those agents,

861
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:28,150
would you think about them being shared or if they're being

862
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,588
shared, or are you there yet? Like, like

863
00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:31,828
how do you think about

864
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:34,229
who you let do that? How do you promote it to the

865
00:29:34,229 --> 00:29:36,400
whole org, where does that innovation come from?

866
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,910
That's a, it's a thorny question that builds on our

867
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,930
idea of like organizational change too.

868
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:41,868
Yeah, absolutely.

869
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:45,068
Uh, as I mentioned, right, so I have been

870
00:29:45,068 --> 00:29:46,439
on the AI journey,

871
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,799
specifically JA journey for the last, you

872
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,380
know, 3 to 4 years now,

873
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:51,559
and,

874
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,328
you know, when we started it, I could see,

875
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:56,439
you know, the reluctance to use the AI

876
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:59,759
and partly because they, we don't know, partly

877
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:02,049
because they are really afraid to use and so on.

878
00:30:02,588 --> 00:30:05,009
Compared to where we started, you know, now,

879
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:07,239
you know, when I'm talking to the business people,

880
00:30:07,358 --> 00:30:08,309
their interactions,

881
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,900
actually they are very well.

882
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:13,289
Now in developing Google Gyms,

883
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:14,410
I'll go to the agents

884
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,949
and that's where they started, right,

885
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,459
because the glean, the glean agents is

886
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:20,328
a recent, recent things for us,

887
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,709
but they are, there are some good people

888
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:24,009
from the business side I see

889
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:26,588
who created the gyms and, and then

890
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:28,009
shared the gyms also across

891
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:29,828
their organizations and so on.

892
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,670
And, and so we do have that internal

893
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,719
version of the J GPD kind,

894
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:35,660
um,

895
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:38,029
GPT that we developed even there

896
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:39,529
I think people started doing that.

897
00:30:40,598 --> 00:30:42,640
When, when, when it comes to this one, there

898
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,959
are, you know, two types of agents

899
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:45,759
that we can build.

900
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:48,420
One is that no core agents is what I think

901
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,699
that Glen is is very good at it.

902
00:30:51,598 --> 00:30:52,660
And there are,

903
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:55,489
you know, high code agents

904
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:57,618
or the medium code agents, so that's where the

905
00:30:57,618 --> 00:30:59,650
sort of the crew A platform things seem to come

906
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,920
into the picture. But you know, for

907
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,078
that we need a lot of IT teams,

908
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,318
right? Who has uh the programming

909
00:31:06,318 --> 00:31:07,279
knowledge of,

910
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,838
um, you know, going through multiple workflows

911
00:31:09,838 --> 00:31:10,838
and things like that.

912
00:31:11,598 --> 00:31:12,449
But I see,

913
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:14,848
you know, the business side is learning these type

914
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:15,598
of the,

915
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,390
you know, agents building is on the rise,

916
00:31:18,848 --> 00:31:21,000
right? And I, you know, I, I

917
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,088
could clearly see them, they're trying to,

918
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,250
you know, come to me or my

919
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,519
team. Hey, this is the idea that I have it,

920
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:28,608
you know, can I run,

921
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,880
run it through the agents and so on. So,

922
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,029
so definitely

923
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,469
I see the, the changes happening

924
00:31:34,608 --> 00:31:35,890
in the right direction.

925
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,549
But sometime, you know, we might need to help to some

926
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:40,630
extent, but one thing that I really

927
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,469
wanted to highlight

928
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,529
is basically,

929
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:43,789
you know, whoever

930
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:46,469
is actually building the skill set

931
00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:48,509
specifically around the prompt and how

932
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:49,660
the context works,

933
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,910
the intricacies of the model, how do they,

934
00:31:52,189 --> 00:31:54,390
you know, use the model for various purposes

935
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,430
with this specific context, I think they

936
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,489
are going to be the king.

937
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,969
And I have literally seen

938
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:02,650
the business is also trying to,

939
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,509
you know.

940
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,358
Bring the use cases and develop the agents.

941
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:09,459
So how many people out here have actually built

942
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:10,598
an agent themselves?

943
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,949
It's really OK. Oh good, lots of hands.

944
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:16,568
Excellent, yeah, I, I do. I think you're right. Like there's kind

945
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,689
of a pro code way of looking at this and a no

946
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:20,209
low code way of looking at this.

947
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:22,910
One thing, you know, I wanna highlight basically,

948
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:25,170
um, I was thinking that, um,

949
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,489
you know, my, my specific, I

950
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:29,568
don't want to name the organizations, I was thinking that

951
00:32:29,568 --> 00:32:31,559
they are never going to be building the agents,

952
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,324
but. They themselves are coming

953
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:36,785
forward and then say, yeah, they are more sensitive

954
00:32:36,785 --> 00:32:38,814
organizations and they say Ravi, you know, tell me how do

955
00:32:38,814 --> 00:32:40,404
I build it. I want to use it and things,

956
00:32:41,104 --> 00:32:41,884
which is a good sign

957
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:44,384
compared to where we started and things like that. But

958
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:46,384
as I said, it's a long way to go in

959
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:49,203
the journey. So, Rohit, how do you see

960
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:49,904
organizations?

961
00:32:51,088 --> 00:32:52,670
Structuring themselves

962
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:55,449
to build, I guess, for lack of a better term,

963
00:32:55,489 --> 00:32:57,608
an agent pipeline from sort of like

964
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:58,910
ideation to

965
00:32:59,328 --> 00:33:01,368
like, have you seen that and, and, and how do you see

966
00:33:01,368 --> 00:33:03,828
them sort of structuring how they work? Absolutely,

967
00:33:03,969 --> 00:33:05,709
and I'll first answer

968
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:07,328
the question that you asked,

969
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:10,088
uh, literally is a billion dollar

970
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,049
question, which is who should be building your agents?

971
00:33:12,848 --> 00:33:14,150
And the answer is

972
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,568
Deloitte Consulting Professional Services.

973
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,598
Oh wow. No, we

974
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,640
really are top, uh, on the top

975
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,640
right of the Gartner quadrant, look us up, but

976
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,380
that was a joke.

977
00:33:25,118 --> 00:33:27,098
Um, you know, when I look at.

978
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,588
But when I look at um

979
00:33:31,939 --> 00:33:32,900
this quote,

980
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:35,449
um this is actually a peek into

981
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:36,309
the future,

982
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,108
but it's not just a random peak.

983
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:42,519
There are these few promises

984
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,118
that agentic AI come with.

985
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,318
The first promise

986
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:49,209
is Abstraction of

987
00:33:49,209 --> 00:33:49,769
complexity.

988
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:52,660
So whenever we're talking about building a

989
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,979
complex solution,

990
00:33:54,338 --> 00:33:56,900
there's technical complexity, architectural

991
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,199
complexity, coding complexity, what have you.

992
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:00,739
And so,

993
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,469
this promise of being able to abstract

994
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:04,229
that out

995
00:34:04,588 --> 00:34:06,269
is huge, number one.

996
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,438
The second thing is,

997
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,989
when you build a solution, as probably

998
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,599
almost all of you know,

999
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,590
we usually involves

1000
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,889
all kinds of data and lots and lots of

1001
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,079
data. So,

1002
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,849
autonomous data management

1003
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,030
is another promise

1004
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,429
of agentic AI.

1005
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:25,989
And then last but not least,

1006
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,789
What these agents really do

1007
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,469
is they plan,

1008
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:31,829
they reason,

1009
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:33,429
and they execute.

1010
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:36,329
If you take all these three things

1011
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:36,918
together,

1012
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,429
it naturally leads you to

1013
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:42,050
a situation where users can leverage

1014
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,128
these promises, as I call them.

1015
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,239
And now maybe in the future, even

1016
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:49,090
even communicate in just

1017
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:50,699
natural language,

1018
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:53,760
focus on higher value tasks such as

1019
00:34:54,378 --> 00:34:56,639
business requirements and business logic.

1020
00:34:57,668 --> 00:34:59,800
Of course there's a place for human in the loop in all

1021
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,378
of this,

1022
00:35:00,878 --> 00:35:02,929
but you know, you see where I'm going with this, an

1023
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:04,378
evolution to where

1024
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,898
more and more

1025
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:08,099
business side employees

1026
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,478
will be able to create these kinds of

1027
00:35:10,478 --> 00:35:12,820
solutions. Are they gonna create super complex,

1028
00:35:12,918 --> 00:35:14,958
uh, solutions? Is that gonna happen next

1029
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:16,989
year? Neither, I don't think so,

1030
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,809
but this is a very futuristic,

1031
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,280
but a very plausible look at, you know,

1032
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,510
how things are gonna evolve. Yep.

1033
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,750
So Marcel, when you've looked across companies that are

1034
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,458
doing this.

1035
00:35:27,938 --> 00:35:29,519
How much trust

1036
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,898
does a company have in letting an

1037
00:35:31,898 --> 00:35:33,989
individual build an agent and

1038
00:35:33,989 --> 00:35:35,398
do autonomous

1039
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:36,699
things,

1040
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:39,500
or well, or, or individual things with,

1041
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:41,188
with corporate data.

1042
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,789
Uh, I mean, are, are they letting her do that?

1043
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:46,030
Are they letting every rank and file person do it? I mean, we're

1044
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,489
a glean, so they let us all do whatever we want with agents

1045
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,708
because we're playing with it all day long. But what

1046
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:52,010
are you seeing out in the real world?

1047
00:35:52,269 --> 00:35:54,409
Yeah, there are two different perspectives. One

1048
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:55,128
is

1049
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:57,789
let it loose and start creating agents,

1050
00:35:58,228 --> 00:36:00,349
and the chances are that it will

1051
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:02,148
become a problem in the future,

1052
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:04,579
uh, duplicate agents, agents

1053
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,769
without the real context, without the real authorization.

1054
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,478
And the second one is put in some

1055
00:36:09,478 --> 00:36:11,340
kind of governance in place,

1056
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,800
um, but just taking

1057
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,820
a step back,

1058
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:15,659
um,

1059
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,389
the way I approach on my

1060
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:20,519
conversation with customers is like a kind of a three

1061
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,878
step approach. One is enablement.

1062
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:25,579
You need to enable these business users

1063
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,918
what is the concept of building agents goes

1064
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:29,878
back to how to create a prompt,

1065
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,869
what are the best practices,

1066
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,878
you know, having like internal documentation,

1067
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,958
uh, internal library of best prompts.

1068
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,300
Then the second one is about

1069
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:41,938
having guardrails in place, technical

1070
00:36:41,938 --> 00:36:44,219
guardrails into what doc, what

1071
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:46,599
access are you giving these um

1072
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,139
employees to create these agents, what

1073
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:50,599
will be the data sources,

1074
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:52,639
and then the third one is

1075
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:54,719
business users.

1076
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,500
Have so much knowledge about these processes

1077
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,699
and workflows they've been doing this on a daily

1078
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:01,739
basis across multiple

1079
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:04,059
solutions open an Excel spreadsheet,

1080
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,559
then going into a CRM,

1081
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:08,219
putting all that together, doing pivot tables

1082
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:09,478
so there is

1083
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,119
so much knowledge of how

1084
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:14,510
to implement these

1085
00:37:14,918 --> 00:37:17,019
that the understanding of the how

1086
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:18,260
a human will do it

1087
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:20,820
needs to be implemented on the process of

1088
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,760
creating an agent.

1089
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:22,659
Every time

1090
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,398
I'm talking with customers,

1091
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,840
as soon as they start talking about the business

1092
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,519
outcome,

1093
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,000
my first question is like how would a human

1094
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,079
do it? Can you walk me through how one of

1095
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,079
your employees do it and then we

1096
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,938
can start talking about the technical

1097
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,849
parts of how to do it,

1098
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,429
uh. So that will be,

1099
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:42,458
I think that the, the three main components

1100
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:43,168
of how to

1101
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:44,329
enable

1102
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,590
business users to start creating

1103
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,219
agents

1104
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,128
and of course

1105
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:50,860
having the guardrails um and

1106
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,929
the security.

1107
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,128
I go back to

1108
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,128
security team is your best friend.

1109
00:37:55,668 --> 00:37:57,829
The earliest you get them into the

1110
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:00,329
process, the more quickly you will move,

1111
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:02,619
um, uh, implementing

1112
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:03,559
uh agentic AI.

1113
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,889
That's, that's, that's a truism of business process automation.

1114
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,059
Can you do it once,

1115
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:10,550
because if you can't do it once I can't automate it, right? Like

1116
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,929
it doesn't work like that. Yeah, Ravi, let me just add it because

1117
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,610
right now I'm in the middle of developing

1118
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,398
an agent

1119
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,898
sharing governance strategy

1120
00:38:20,438 --> 00:38:23,179
because this year has been the, you know, agentic

1121
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:25,539
world and so on. So the,

1122
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:27,559
the real problem is,

1123
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,019
you know, not deciding who

1124
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,780
can create the agents

1125
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,378
but what the agent can do

1126
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,260
and who it will be shared with.

1127
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:38,969
Is it going to be shared with 5 to 6

1128
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:41,010
people just as a digital

1129
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,579
assistant for themselves,

1130
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,139
or is it going to be shared at the

1131
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:47,168
department level, like 2 to 3000

1132
00:38:47,168 --> 00:38:48,289
people will use it,

1133
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:51,208
or is it going to be shared at the company

1134
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:53,458
level where, you know, 7 or 10,

1135
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:55,849
tens of thousands of people can use it and things

1136
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:57,978
like that? But that's where I think

1137
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:58,809
you know

1138
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,679
my friend Marshall says, right,

1139
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,458
security is the number one friend for you

1140
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,340
but not just security, right? So

1141
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:06,898
if somebody's going to develop

1142
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,438
an agent for HR for hiring

1143
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:11,398
process or recruitment or whatever, right,

1144
00:39:11,909 --> 00:39:13,889
the performance lighting and things like that,

1145
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,300
that's becoming.

1146
00:39:15,648 --> 00:39:17,719
You know, a, a bigger topic,

1147
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:19,969
right, because now how do you ensure

1148
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:21,969
that it's not hallucinating? How do

1149
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:24,050
you ensure that it's not biasing, or

1150
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,128
can the manager take the agent and

1151
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:27,059
run with that

1152
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:29,648
and then just write it just like, you know, what

1153
00:39:29,648 --> 00:39:32,030
the agent give the answer? What if it was wrong?

1154
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:32,929
And

1155
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,489
I, I think that a lot goes in

1156
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:37,570
the agent sharing, so it's not

1157
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,208
about just who can create it.

1158
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,820
But where the complexity comes in,

1159
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,500
who are you going to share with and what's

1160
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,929
the process you have around,

1161
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:46,958
um,

1162
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:48,219
you know, the

1163
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,750
the coalitioning governance and so on. I, I

1164
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,329
love what you're saying there because I think

1165
00:39:53,188 --> 00:39:55,269
when I think about it philosophically, right, so first of all you

1166
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:57,309
have to have guardrails so nobody breaks anything. I think

1167
00:39:57,309 --> 00:39:58,869
that's the baseline, right?

1168
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,300
But, uh, philosophically I think about

1169
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,349
it like a software person. I think what

1170
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:05,550
we, we have to do is think about this as we're

1171
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,750
creating software assets.

1172
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:08,809
And Glen subscribes to the,

1173
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:11,539
we're not better than anybody else mentality

1174
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:13,559
when we're doing this. We ask a lot of questions of our

1175
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,760
customers that lets us know what we should build,

1176
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,320
so that we're building things that are useful, and

1177
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,590
that's the same mentality we have to bring here,

1178
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,820
right, which is

1179
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,938
What are they, to Marcel's point, they

1180
00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:27,458
know what's needed, they know how it works.

1181
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,099
It is impossible to pretend

1182
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:32,039
that me as an IT person

1183
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:34,780
who's who's inserted into this department

1184
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,860
is gonna magically be a genius in the department,

1185
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:39,179
right? So, so I liked what you said about

1186
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:41,300
who's its shared with, Robbie, I think that's really important,

1187
00:40:41,378 --> 00:40:43,378
right? We need the innovation on

1188
00:40:43,378 --> 00:40:44,599
the individual side

1189
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:47,262
to. identify what needs to be done and to

1190
00:40:47,262 --> 00:40:48,702
build that prototype.

1191
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:51,311
But then we also need someone who is an

1192
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:53,501
expert to look at that prototype,

1193
00:40:53,961 --> 00:40:55,731
harden it, refine it,

1194
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:58,202
and promote it to the organization in a way

1195
00:40:58,202 --> 00:40:59,163
that it is then

1196
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,902
usable and shareable and repeatable.

1197
00:41:02,103 --> 00:41:04,422
And I don't think we can get away with either

1198
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:05,643
half, but I think

1199
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,932
organizations fail when they assume the

1200
00:41:08,585 --> 00:41:10,746
user in the business will independently create

1201
00:41:10,746 --> 00:41:12,746
it and it'll work out great. I think that's a

1202
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:14,945
failure mode, but I think the other failure mode is IT

1203
00:41:14,945 --> 00:41:16,525
will make it and push it into your org,

1204
00:41:16,824 --> 00:41:18,864
and that is another failure mode, right? Like these

1205
00:41:18,864 --> 00:41:21,016
two sides have to work together. You, you, you're

1206
00:41:21,016 --> 00:41:22,485
just spot on it. That's where

1207
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,726
the, the governance structure,

1208
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:26,916
you know, we are in the process of creating it.

1209
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:28,815
Yeah, you know, like just to

1210
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,215
like in the traditional model,

1211
00:41:31,746 --> 00:41:34,385
like you said, it was IT creating

1212
00:41:34,385 --> 00:41:36,585
solutions and rolling them out in the business using them.

1213
00:41:37,398 --> 00:41:39,418
Here, we're going all the way to the

1214
00:41:39,418 --> 00:41:40,840
other end of the spectrum

1215
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:41,789
and saying

1216
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,079
business is gonna create

1217
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,079
and, you know, and then all the,

1218
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,079
everything that we spoke about in terms of governance, etc.

1219
00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:49,079
comes into play.

1220
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:50,559
I really think,

1221
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:53,280
you know, as we get to maturity,

1222
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,159
in this particular AI case,

1223
00:41:56,628 --> 00:41:58,659
um I think we will probably

1224
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:00,688
end up with some kind of an

1225
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:02,280
organizational construct where you have,

1226
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,878
for lack of a better term,

1227
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:05,958
an AICOE.

1228
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,789
Which is more of an enabler in

1229
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:10,849
organizations. So you still have business

1230
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:12,648
side employees building stuff,

1231
00:42:13,228 --> 00:42:15,378
but it is in a very governed way

1232
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:17,769
with the right tooling and the right processes.

1233
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:20,289
And everything that goes with it and then we're seeing that

1234
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:21,769
in a ton of our customers, right?

1235
00:42:22,168 --> 00:42:24,409
We're seeing that there's, there's an AI expert who works

1236
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,039
alongside the business expert to,

1237
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:28,458
to just first of all identify it.

1238
00:42:28,688 --> 00:42:30,969
Um, there is some interesting thoughts

1239
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:33,039
here though that, that, uh, that AI

1240
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:33,708
is bringing.

1241
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:36,750
So we have an agent that we, we run internally

1242
00:42:36,918 --> 00:42:39,329
these days which is what agent should I build agents.

1243
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:41,708
It looks at all the things I do all day in

1244
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,750
the context of what I'm up to, and it says,

1245
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,829
hey, you might want to identify the

1246
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,128
following workflows that you did yesterday.

1247
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:50,469
That's a really interesting thought that

1248
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:52,329
AI is now being used

1249
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:54,228
to make that AI go,

1250
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:56,750
right? And Marcel, you mentioned prompts too.

1251
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:59,148
So quick show of hands, who's taking prompt

1252
00:42:59,148 --> 00:43:00,128
engineering classes?

1253
00:43:01,429 --> 00:43:02,619
OK, we got some hands up.

1254
00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:03,889
Great. Why?

1255
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:08,889
Well, well,

1256
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:11,570
who's familiar with the term prompt engineering?

1257
00:43:11,978 --> 00:43:13,989
OK, all the many, many hands. Alright.

1258
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,309
So prompt engineering is

1259
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:18,590
learning how to write, to write and ask

1260
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,628
the correct questions of AI to get the

1261
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:22,789
correct answers back, right? So that's why we take prompt

1262
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:24,090
engineering. Um,

1263
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,869
so why is AI so dumb that it can't ask

1264
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:28,869
you to clarify when you give it something

1265
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:29,929
that's ambiguous?

1266
00:43:30,389 --> 00:43:31,769
Well, it, it can be.

1267
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:34,148
And so this next generation of AI that we're

1268
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:35,219
seeing is actually,

1269
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,389
um, when you write a bad agent.

1270
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,909
There's a possibility that that agent then says, you know,

1271
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,938
you didn't write me very well.

1272
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,000
Can we clean me up and fixes it

1273
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:45,969
or writes itself?

1274
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:49,199
Yeah, uh, this ambiguity is becoming

1275
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:51,320
critical even on the foundational

1276
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,019
models

1277
00:43:52,398 --> 00:43:54,438
today when you do create a prompt and

1278
00:43:54,438 --> 00:43:55,829
send it to a foundational model,

1279
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:58,360
one of the first steps they run is

1280
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,760
how ambiguous is this question? How

1281
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,719
can I improve it?

1282
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,898
What is really the content and the intent

1283
00:44:04,898 --> 00:44:06,260
of the end user

1284
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:09,019
and that's what normally is passed to the LLM

1285
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:10,300
to create the response.

1286
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:12,760
So more and more we're working on

1287
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,458
trying to

1288
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,050
break that ambiguity around

1289
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,579
how the prompt is created.

1290
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:20,128
Yeah, when you ask questions of an AI,

1291
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:21,478
the first thing it should do is.

1292
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,878
Interrogate the question you asked and

1293
00:44:23,878 --> 00:44:25,929
figure out what you're looking for and know more about

1294
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:28,159
you so there's a whole context angle there that's, that's

1295
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:29,228
really super important.

1296
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:31,559
All right, so we're coming up towards the end

1297
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:33,559
here, so all your many

1298
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:34,699
questions are flowing in.

1299
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,369
If you have any, please feel free to ask them.

1300
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,760
Um, like I said, I, I put in so many

1301
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,789
quotes here we could go for the next week if,

1302
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:43,208
if you're willing to sit with us.

1303
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:45,559
Um, so let's talk a little bit about value

1304
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:46,099
first,

1305
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,559
um, in the last say 10 minutes

1306
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:49,659
of what we have here.

1307
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,199
So, KPMG did a

1308
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:54,320
little bit of a study to figure out when

1309
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,519
we're gonna see the results of AI and, and its

1310
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:58,559
value, and they said it's achieved

1311
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:00,418
incrementally. I think as

1312
00:45:00,918 --> 00:45:02,918
AI biased people sitting here on the

1313
00:45:02,918 --> 00:45:04,938
stage talking AI we're all like, yay, AI

1314
00:45:04,938 --> 00:45:06,898
is the answer, there's some magic there.

1315
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,559
How do you view Robbie in your org?

1316
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:13,389
Measuring, quantifying.

1317
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:17,148
Value that you actually get and

1318
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:18,179
how do you

1319
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:20,628
properly set expectations upwards

1320
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:23,148
that this isn't a panacea or a magic

1321
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:25,329
wand? Like, how do you think about

1322
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:27,360
conveying that knowledge both down into the organ,

1323
00:45:27,409 --> 00:45:28,958
up into, to management?

1324
00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:31,369
Yeah, I mean, this is one of the most

1325
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:32,349
challenging

1326
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,030
uh task today.

1327
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,909
I am actually asked to build a dashboard.

1328
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:41,289
That will say the value the

1329
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:43,369
tools are bringing to the organization. I'm

1330
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:45,260
really, really struggling, right,

1331
00:45:45,648 --> 00:45:46,550
because today,

1332
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,010
you know, most of the tools that what we

1333
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:51,168
built it are, um, you know, what

1334
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:53,489
we purchased and rolled out

1335
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:55,530
are actually very good in telling in

1336
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:56,269
terms of

1337
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,050
the effective utilization.

1338
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,090
OK, how many people are using it, how

1339
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,168
long they used it,

1340
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:03,360
and so on,

1341
00:46:03,648 --> 00:46:04,789
but he doesn't tell

1342
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:07,688
what for they used it because we are not supposed to

1343
00:46:07,688 --> 00:46:09,489
go and look at what people are doing it,

1344
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,250
or, you know, how, you know, what

1345
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,469
value it brought it

1346
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:15,188
and things like that. So

1347
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,728
we are still brainstorming specifically on this

1348
00:46:17,728 --> 00:46:19,849
topic. Um, I, I don't think that my answer

1349
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:22,039
is, you know, going to be very, very helpful,

1350
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:24,168
but, but some, you know,

1351
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,269
if he knows, you know, somebody maybe.

1352
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:28,719
I'm eager to learn as well. Well, we

1353
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,659
have a hard time generally as an industry measuring

1354
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,599
productivity.

1355
00:46:31,878 --> 00:46:33,679
So the first question for this should always be,

1356
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:36,269
so how do you measure productivity without AI?

1357
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:38,340
I can deploy AI and we can

1358
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:40,679
see if it changes that number, and then people are like, Well, I don't

1359
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:42,800
really know that either, right? So yeah, sorry, right.

1360
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:46,969
I was going to add to what you said, which is

1361
00:46:47,699 --> 00:46:49,739
This entire notion about

1362
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,938
Value measurement.

1363
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:54,989
On tooling

1364
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:58,409
I feel when it comes to AI energetic

1365
00:46:58,409 --> 00:46:59,000
AI

1366
00:46:59,648 --> 00:47:00,228
is

1367
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:02,050
is not the right question.

1368
00:47:02,648 --> 00:47:03,510
That we're looking at.

1369
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:06,418
If the entire premise

1370
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,099
of AI is to

1371
00:47:09,398 --> 00:47:12,119
re-engineer business processes,

1372
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:14,639
then all those use cases that you're gonna

1373
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:15,500
identify

1374
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:18,699
should have a very robust

1375
00:47:19,438 --> 00:47:20,898
set of KPIs

1376
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:23,719
built in right, even before you start building

1377
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:25,800
anything, to say, here is how I'm going

1378
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,478
to measure value uplift.

1379
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,800
And so the value uplift is

1380
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,228
from a business perspective,

1381
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,208
measured that much more

1382
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:36,889
easily,

1383
00:47:37,148 --> 00:47:38,570
quote unquote, right?

1384
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:39,889
As opposed to saying,

1385
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,628
hey, how's my tooling doing

1386
00:47:42,628 --> 00:47:45,030
and is that really a measure of value.

1387
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:47,329
So, I think that is huge.

1388
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:48,648
Um,

1389
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:51,800
and, and we are actually, what we do is we embed

1390
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:54,360
change management just in its

1391
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:55,119
entirety,

1392
00:47:55,478 --> 00:47:57,530
you know, value is just one part of

1393
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:59,128
it. It is,

1394
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:00,438
it is the

1395
00:48:00,929 --> 00:48:03,090
upskilling. It is actually

1396
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,228
a target state operating model which looks

1397
00:48:05,228 --> 00:48:06,969
very different from what you have today.

1398
00:48:07,938 --> 00:48:08,860
It is,

1399
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,340
how do I communicate and make sure

1400
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,500
that people are A, not freaked out,

1401
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:15,978
and B, they're truly, truly, you know, users

1402
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:18,059
are truly adopting once you start rolling

1403
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:20,059
things out. So, there's a whole host

1404
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:21,679
of threads

1405
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:22,800
which goes into

1406
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:25,099
change management, specifically when it comes to

1407
00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:25,739
AI

1408
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,418
and agentic AI.

1409
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:30,030
And that as a part of our

1410
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,110
approach is front and center.

1411
00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:33,949
So very, very

1412
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,530
purposefully when we stand up

1413
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:39,228
teams to develop AI

1414
00:48:39,228 --> 00:48:41,039
solutions in different organizations,

1415
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:43,550
we actually call it the right side and the left side of

1416
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,628
the brain working together where we

1417
00:48:45,628 --> 00:48:47,208
have business teams.

1418
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:49,969
With change management value and all of that,

1419
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,349
and technology teams working hand

1420
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,668
in hand with the organization's

1421
00:48:54,668 --> 00:48:56,849
users and other teams as well. You know, I think

1422
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:58,458
I think

1423
00:48:59,389 --> 00:49:01,519
sometimes this business value focused

1424
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:03,599
consulting gets a bad name because it's,

1425
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:06,159
can be a little soft and we're all nerds, so we're like,

1426
00:49:06,438 --> 00:49:08,539
so that's great, but how do you automate it, right? Like,

1427
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:11,079
um, but it's so important in AI

1428
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:13,119
because of the synthetic nature of what AI

1429
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,188
is doing that's really important and to your point. Point Marcel you're

1430
00:49:15,188 --> 00:49:17,429
talking about we need to make sure we're talking to security

1431
00:49:17,429 --> 00:49:19,550
when we get started we also need to be, I

1432
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,289
think talking to the business as well,

1433
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,148
setting the right expectations,

1434
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,750
uh, not only from the technical perspective but

1435
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,789
from the business perspective and

1436
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,168
from leadership perspective,

1437
00:49:29,628 --> 00:49:31,369
um. I have

1438
00:49:31,688 --> 00:49:33,809
had multiple conversations that leadership is

1439
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:36,090
a one full adoption of AI

1440
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,909
agentic solutions

1441
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,239
and it's like, but what, what,

1442
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:42,369
how are you measuring that just by clicking on

1443
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:43,030
an agent

1444
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:45,418
or the value that that agent is giving you

1445
00:49:45,648 --> 00:49:47,728
and if you're gonna measure the value, what are you

1446
00:49:47,728 --> 00:49:50,239
really looking to it? Let's go back to KPIs

1447
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,809
or is about time saved

1448
00:49:52,809 --> 00:49:55,188
is about the quality of the outcome.

1449
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:57,619
It's also a feedback loop that

1450
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,739
needs to be put from the end user

1451
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:01,800
perspective. We need that feedback from the

1452
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,099
end user is like, is this agent really

1453
00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:05,699
helping me on my workflows?

1454
00:50:05,978 --> 00:50:06,978
How can I improve it?

1455
00:50:07,728 --> 00:50:09,769
Oh, is hallucinating.

1456
00:50:09,889 --> 00:50:12,168
How can I reduce that kind of hallucination?

1457
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,530
So there's also need to be a feedback loop from

1458
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:16,648
the agent, from the user and user

1459
00:50:16,648 --> 00:50:19,188
perspective for us to be able to measure,

1460
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:21,570
uh, better the quality of what we're building.

1461
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:24,429
OK, lightning round because we're almost done here.

1462
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:27,128
OK, Robbie, so we have all these people

1463
00:50:27,128 --> 00:50:29,418
here and they're all thinking about AI.

1464
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:31,789
Uh, what's the one thing they should all

1465
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:34,228
know about slash worry about slash do?

1466
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,208
Can you repeat the question? Yeah, so, so if

1467
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:39,369
there's one thing that you would want all these people to take

1468
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,489
away so that they could be successful when

1469
00:50:41,489 --> 00:50:43,648
they do AI, like what's that one

1470
00:50:43,648 --> 00:50:45,929
thing, and you have to, you have to encapsulate it in like 30

1471
00:50:45,929 --> 00:50:48,050
seconds, and you're allowed to pass to Rohit to make him

1472
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,128
answer first if you want, you know, I'm good. So

1473
00:50:50,128 --> 00:50:52,070
one day, you know, it is definitely

1474
00:50:52,769 --> 00:50:54,929
adding value, so you have to take a little

1475
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:56,949
bit of risk to that. But at the same time,

1476
00:50:57,059 --> 00:50:58,110
make sure that you have

1477
00:50:58,449 --> 00:50:59,889
enough guard rails built in.

1478
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:03,769
I would say focus on business value.

1479
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:05,628
This entire

1480
00:51:06,128 --> 00:51:08,228
uh genre of

1481
00:51:08,228 --> 00:51:10,648
technology, if you will, when it comes to AI energetic

1482
00:51:10,648 --> 00:51:12,289
AI machine learning,

1483
00:51:12,688 --> 00:51:14,728
I mean, the focus has to be on

1484
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,789
Truly on solving business problems,

1485
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:20,239
and that's really when you look at it from a business

1486
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:22,599
lens, is when you'll truly be able to do

1487
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:23,958
a whole bunch of things,

1488
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,179
including actually

1489
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:28,179
success of your use cases and your re-engineering.

1490
00:51:28,648 --> 00:51:30,849
As well as measure value, so value,

1491
00:51:31,168 --> 00:51:32,510
value, value, I said 3 things,

1492
00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:34,679
OK, Marcel, you're last at the company whose

1493
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,128
tagline is work AI that actually

1494
00:51:37,128 --> 00:51:37,869
works.

1495
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:40,188
Absolutely start small,

1496
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:43,050
make sure that you have governance in place.

1497
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:44,418
Make sure that you understand,

1498
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:45,978
understand your context.

1499
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:48,648
Don't index too much on

1500
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:50,090
what is the model you're using,

1501
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:52,610
but what is the enterprise data

1502
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,449
that you have.

1503
00:51:54,019 --> 00:51:56,469
And that you have guardrails and governance

1504
00:51:56,469 --> 00:51:58,668
around that, but start small and

1505
00:51:58,668 --> 00:51:59,610
bring security

1506
00:51:59,869 --> 00:52:01,590
from day one, bring security from day one.

1507
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,510
So look, I, I wanna say thank you to

1508
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:06,579
everyone who managed to make it here on day four who

1509
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:07,489
came to join us,

1510
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:10,949
um, so thank you so much. We're at booth 1333

1511
00:52:10,949 --> 00:52:13,030
if you're back at the Venetian today, which should only take

1512
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,769
what, an hour in a cab, so you're good.
