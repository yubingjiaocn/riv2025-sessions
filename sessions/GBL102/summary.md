I understand you'd like me to summarize this AWS session, but the provided transcript only contains generic placeholders like "(presenter speaking in foreign language)" without any actual technical content, timestamps, or specific information about the session topic.

The transcript shows:
- A 52-minute video duration
- Opening phrase "Let maximize your learnings at re:Invent!"
- One word "Innovation" 
- Closing phrase "Thank you for your great session"
- Audience applause at the end
- Everything else is marked as "(presenter speaking in foreign language)"

To create a meaningful technical summary in Chinese as requested, I would need:
- Actual spoken content or proper subtitles with technical details
- Specific timestamps for when topics are discussed
- Information about the speakers and session title
- Key technical concepts, services, or solutions presented

Could you provide the actual transcript content with the technical details and real timestamps? That would allow me to create the comprehensive Chinese summary you're looking for.
