I understand you'd like me to summarize this AWS session, but the provided transcript only contains generic placeholders like "(presenter speaking in foreign language)" without any actual technical content, timestamps, or specific information about the session topic.

The transcript shows:
- A 52-minute video duration
- Opening phrase "Let maximize your learnings at re:Invent!"
- One word "Innovation" 
- Closing phrase "Thank you for your great session"
- Audience applause at the end
- Everything else is marked as "(presenter speaking in foreign language)"

To create a meaningful technical summary in Chinese as requested, I would need:
- Actual spoken content or translated text
- Specific timestamps 
- Technical topics and key points discussed
- Speaker names and roles
- Concrete AWS services or solutions mentioned

Could you provide the actual transcript content or a version with the foreign language portions translated? This would allow me to create the comprehensive Chinese summary with proper timeline and technical details you're looking for.
