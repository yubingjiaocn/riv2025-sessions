1
00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:03,220
we're ready Hello

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,889
everyone. Hope

3
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:07,440
your rain event has been great.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,099
My name is Gu Yu. I am a senior solutions

5
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:11,640
architect supporting

6
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,159
the AWS Social responsibility

7
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:15,679
and Impact modernization.

8
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:18,579
Hi everyone, I'm Nathan Pathak. I'm a technical

9
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:19,829
account manager at AWS

10
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:22,219
and part of the sustainability team for almost 2

11
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:22,760
years now.

12
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:25,638
And thank you so much

13
00:00:25,638 --> 00:00:28,030
for joining our session on sustainable

14
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,100
computing for climate solutions.

15
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:34,590
In today's session, we're going to first of all

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,490
talk about climate challenges

17
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:39,109
and the complexity of solving climate

18
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:39,868
challenges.

19
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:42,750
We're also going to talk about why HPC

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,289
or high performance computing is important

21
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:47,509
in solving climate challenges.

22
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,560
After that, we'll dive a little bit deeper

23
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,889
into some patterns in terms of

24
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:54,810
sustainable HPC workload

25
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,418
and then followed up with a case study from

26
00:00:57,418 --> 00:00:59,029
the University of Oxford

27
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:01,450
to see how they're applying some of these

28
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,450
practices into their HPC

29
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,109
workload.

30
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,069
Then we'll summarize with some next steps.

31
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:09,189
But before we get started,

32
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,609
by show of hands, how many of

33
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:13,769
you have been impacted

34
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,849
by climate change over the past few

35
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:16,388
years?

36
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,739
Looks like everyone has been impacted.

37
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,150
All right, Nitin, I saw that you got

38
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:23,668
impacted.

39
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:26,028
Can you share your experience and

40
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:28,028
how it felt like and what did you have

41
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:29,069
to do to adapt?

42
00:01:29,418 --> 00:01:31,838
Certainly, so I live in a part of India.

43
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,010
It's called New Delhi, and every winter

44
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,028
we have a concern that when the temperature starts

45
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:38,388
dipping. There's a lot of smog

46
00:01:38,388 --> 00:01:39,088
in the air,

47
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:41,668
so it's low visibility, dusty

48
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,709
particles, and the AQIs get really high.

49
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,058
The pollution gets really high,

50
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,769
so we have to live with

51
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:49,739
air purifiers all the time, and it becomes problematic.

52
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:51,969
People have problems with breathing,

53
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,739
breathing, and they're going outside. So this becomes a

54
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,870
challenge almost every year, and we

55
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,388
hope,

56
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,028
we hope there's some solution for that.

57
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:01,948
Yeah, and it probably doesn't help with the health equity

58
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:04,418
and different types of socioeconomics

59
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:06,870
it doesn't. It certainly doesn't.

60
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:09,449
I'm sure some of you are experiencing

61
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,629
some of the similar

62
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:12,808
challenges as well

63
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:14,330
with climate challenge.

64
00:02:15,588 --> 00:02:17,979
We're having more and more extreme weather

65
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:20,300
events. For example, our summers are getting

66
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,419
hotter and lasting longer,

67
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:24,899
which not only reduces yields

68
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:26,058
for major crops,

69
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,419
but also but also leads to

70
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:32,669
death. Our

71
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,750
hurricane is lasting longer and

72
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,278
intensifies faster,

73
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,909
which makes it very difficult for fast

74
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,808
disaster recovery efforts.

75
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,669
In some parts of the world,

76
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,389
increased precipitation leads to

77
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:47,088
flooding.

78
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:50,368
In other parts of the world, decreased

79
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,229
precipitation leads to drought,

80
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:54,308
which impacts food security.

81
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,729
And now we have wildfire.

82
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:00,830
Wildfire season is lasting longer

83
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:01,899
and

84
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,849
it's leading to damages

85
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,149
that's not only in property but

86
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:08,949
also leads to air pollution.

87
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:14,319
I have the opportunity to work with many

88
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,399
customers that are tackling some of these

89
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,300
challenges.

90
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:19,838
At AWS Social Responsibility

91
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:20,679
and Impact,

92
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,639
our vision is to improve lives

93
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,379
every day.

94
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:27,349
And we believe that cloud and AI

95
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,349
technologies are powerful

96
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:29,990
tools

97
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:30,808
to help

98
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:33,229
build solutions that tackle some

99
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:35,338
of these challenges in health,

100
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:37,069
education, and climate.

101
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:41,028
But building climate challenge,

102
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:43,610
building climate solutions is

103
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:44,889
difficult.

104
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:45,949
In fact,

105
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:48,849
climate challenge is very complex

106
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:50,569
because first of all,

107
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,770
The climate system itself is

108
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,469
complex.

109
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,919
As we know, there are different components

110
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,618
in the

111
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,118
climate system. We have the atmosphere

112
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:01,889
with the air.

113
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,399
We have the hydrosphere with the water, the

114
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:06,058
lake, the ocean.

115
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,669
We have the cryosphere with the ice.

116
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,159
We have the lithosphere, the land,

117
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,778
and we have the biosphere, the living beings,

118
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,199
we are part of it.

119
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,829
And these 5 components interact

120
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,988
with each other in very complex

121
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:23,048
ways which makes it very difficult

122
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:25,509
to understand the impact

123
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:26,670
of any intervention.

124
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:32,459
Apart from the complex climate

125
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:34,980
system, we also have a very

126
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,358
complex human society.

127
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,678
This is not just socioeconomic,

128
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,040
political, cultural, and also

129
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,238
because climate change is a global

130
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:46,829
issue. Communities,

131
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:49,149
regions are impacted very

132
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:49,928
differently.

133
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:52,649
So there are also disagreements in terms

134
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:55,129
of the best way to adapt and mitigate.

135
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,699
And then the urgency makes

136
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,660
solving climate challenges

137
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,319
even more difficult because now

138
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,540
we have to evaluate the

139
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,338
long-term and short-term trade-offs.

140
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:12,399
Scientists tell us that we have a limited

141
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,399
window to make unprecedented

142
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,798
headway in order to keep our

143
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:18,879
global temperature rise to below

144
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,778
1.5 °C.

145
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,528
And as we are taking action now,

146
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,928
we also have to evaluate the

147
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:27,928
impacts in the long term

148
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,329
to make sure that our efforts are

149
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,149
sustainable.

150
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:35,459
The good news is that we are making

151
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,959
progress. We're

152
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,309
making our buildings.

153
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,028
Greener.

154
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:44,108
We're taking more into consideration of

155
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:46,410
sustainable building practices

156
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:48,298
from building design,

157
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:50,798
the type of materials that we're using

158
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,649
to build our buildings,

159
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:54,988
the type of energy we're using

160
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,509
and when and how we're using the

161
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:59,928
energy. When

162
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:00,838
it comes to energy,

163
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:03,399
we're using more renewable energy,

164
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:05,000
wind, solar,

165
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,738
geothermal, hydro, and more.

166
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:11,269
When it comes to food supply,

167
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:14,189
we're applying more sustainable agriculture

168
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:15,069
practices

169
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:17,649
so that we can reduce water waste

170
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:19,769
as well as improve soil

171
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:20,389
health.

172
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,540
And we're also electrifying our

173
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,699
transportation sector so that

174
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,319
we can reduce the emissions from harmful,

175
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,500
reduce the harmful emissions from

176
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,040
conventional combustion engine.

177
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:41,220
In order for all this to work effectively,

178
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,629
we need technology.

179
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,389
Technology enables and accelerates

180
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:47,559
climate solutions.

181
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,600
Now, as solutions architect or

182
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,139
researcher or innovator,

183
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:56,319
as we are translating into

184
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,358
climate challenge

185
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,428
into kind of technical requirements,

186
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,879
we really need our technology staff

187
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,379
to do 3 things

188
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,420
and do and do 3 things very well.

189
00:07:07,798 --> 00:07:09,220
First of all, in terms of data.

190
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,720
Data is important in

191
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,629
any system,

192
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,329
but it's extremely important

193
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:18,850
in Building a climate solution

194
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:21,730
because, as we mentioned earlier,

195
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:24,028
climate system is extremely complex.

196
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,809
So in order to understand the complex system,

197
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,009
we need data from

198
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:30,290
different sources.

199
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,869
So this could be data from supply

200
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,149
chain data to understand carbon footprint.

201
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:37,988
This could be satellite imagery to

202
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:39,509
understand vegetation index.

203
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:41,009
This could also be

204
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,149
the sound of the ocean to understand

205
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:46,290
ocean noise pollution, right?

206
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,480
So these data

207
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,259
needs to come from various sources and

208
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:52,838
some of them can be very large.

209
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,879
But the ability to acquire

210
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,778
high value

211
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,980
is extremely important.

212
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,449
And secondly, we need a storage

213
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,028
option, a storage solution

214
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:07,689
and because our data is from

215
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,689
different types of sources and can be very

216
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,139
large, our storage needs to

217
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:13,750
be able to accommodate that.

218
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,540
And also because these data can be

219
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,858
large, we also need to be able to retrieve

220
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:20,899
the data easily and efficiently

221
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:21,480
as well.

222
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,579
So now we have the data and we

223
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:26,338
store the data.

224
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,178
Now we can actually understand the patterns

225
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:31,220
behind the data. So the third

226
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,759
component is compute.

227
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,979
We need our technology stack to be

228
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:36,869
able to.

229
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:40,000
Do large scale data processing,

230
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,558
simulation

231
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:44,099
so that we can understand the patterns

232
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:44,918
behind the data.

233
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:48,440
And I hear that Newton has some recommendations.

234
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,099
And we have, we have a technology stack

235
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:55,239
that can help you

236
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,879
to build solutions

237
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:59,298
towards finding the solutions for

238
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:00,479
your climate problem.

239
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:03,259
Have you heard of high performance computing, a show of hands,

240
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:04,529
and have you been using it?

241
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:05,519
Certainly

242
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,019
it is an amazing and efficient way of

243
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:10,038
how technology can interact with one another

244
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:12,158
in order to provide us an infrastructure

245
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:14,219
and a setup that will help us conduct

246
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,538
our research, that will give you solutions

247
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:18,599
for complex problems and

248
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,719
specifically problems related to climate research.

249
00:09:21,558 --> 00:09:23,769
I've been an HPC admin myself for a large

250
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:24,629
part of my career.

251
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,479
And I know this is extremely useful.

252
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,119
However,

253
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:31,070
there's one problem with it.

254
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:34,609
An HPC grid usually consists of hundreds

255
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:35,908
and hundreds of servers.

256
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:36,989
That would mean

257
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,330
it can consume loads of energy.

258
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,908
Setting this up is never easy.

259
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,149
Even though it is the right tool set for our solution,

260
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:47,710
it might not be the easiest and the most

261
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,739
sustainable way to do it in

262
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:51,048
an on-premises setup.

263
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,090
Thus,

264
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,428
there needs to be a fine.

265
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:55,869
That's where AWS comes in and

266
00:09:55,869 --> 00:09:57,950
sees how it can help you for the next one.

267
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,229
When it comes to sustainability,

268
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:06,269
we also follow the shared responsibility

269
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:06,849
model.

270
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:09,629
You might also, you might already be familiar

271
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:11,918
with the shared responsibility model of security,

272
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,969
but in terms of sustainability,

273
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:16,609
AWS is responsible for

274
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,418
sustainability of the cloud.

275
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:21,190
So that means our global infrastructure, including

276
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,129
our data center,

277
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:24,099
our electricity supply,

278
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:26,428
servers, cooling, building materials,

279
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:27,330
and so forth.

280
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,658
Customers, you

281
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,599
are responsible for sustainability

282
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,489
in the cloud,

283
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,320
so that's your workloads, right.

284
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:39,690
Region selection,

285
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:41,729
how you're using your data,

286
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:43,428
how you're storing your data.

287
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:46,668
And if you're working on machine learning workloads,

288
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:47,840
that could also mean

289
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,038
what type of model you're choosing,

290
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,739
how you're building your model,

291
00:10:52,058 --> 00:10:54,058
how you're deploying your model and

292
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:56,139
writing your inferences and scaling

293
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:56,859
your model.

294
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,580
Now diving a little bit deeper into sustainability

295
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,840
of the cloud and our AWS global

296
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,500
infrastructure.

297
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:08,908
And then AWS

298
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:11,029
continues to relentlessly

299
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:13,070
innovate our infrastructure to

300
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,710
build the most secure,

301
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,609
performing, resilient and sustainable

302
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:18,529
cloud

303
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:20,330
for our customers worldwide.

304
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:24,239
We have 120 available zones

305
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,379
in 245 countries and

306
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:27,379
territories

307
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,070
across 38 geographic

308
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:30,719
regions.

309
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:34,389
And according to an Accenture study,

310
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:37,979
Workloads on AWS is up

311
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:40,139
to 4.1 times

312
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:42,279
more efficient than on premises.

313
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,658
How we're able to achieve that is through

314
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:48,899
our data center

315
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:51,649
design. Which is

316
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:53,129
enhanced for

317
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,710
tomorrow's AI tech uh AI workloads.

318
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,158
So one way we evaluate data center

319
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:01,200
efficiency is to use this metric

320
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,538
called power usage effectiveness

321
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:04,879
or PUE.

322
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,979
And the PUE,

323
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:10,119
a lower POE indicates a more efficient,

324
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,379
uh, data center and a POE

325
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:13,279
one is perfect.

326
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:16,798
So as you can see, our HBS

327
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:18,798
global infrastructure have a

328
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:21,000
POE of 1.15 which

329
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,080
outperforms on-premises average

330
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,139
as well as public cloud industry

331
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:25,700
standard.

332
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,979
We did that through optimizing our data

333
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:30,918
center design

334
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:33,519
with 46%

335
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,979
reduced mechanical energy as well

336
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:38,058
as 35% less embodied

337
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,000
carbon in the concrete that we use.

338
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:43,899
And with that,

339
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:46,000
by just bringing your workloads

340
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,969
to AWS you are already benefiting

341
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,418
from the carbon reduction.

342
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:54,629
And depending on the region where your workloads

343
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:56,700
are running, uh, you will receive

344
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,440
different

345
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,558
benefits in terms of energy efficiency

346
00:13:00,859 --> 00:13:03,279
and by optimizing your workloads

347
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:05,460
on AWS, which Nain we'll talk

348
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,450
about in a little bit,

349
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,899
you will be reducing carbon footprint

350
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:09,558
even more.

351
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,200
So, I want to watch.

352
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:15,729
Now AWS has been playing its part in

353
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:18,090
order to make things more efficient for you, the infrastructure

354
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,399
more efficient for you by various means.

355
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,869
Now, we also don't leave it there.

356
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,619
We'll provide you enough material so how you can

357
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:28,320
improvise your, improve your workloads

358
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:29,500
and go buy it.

359
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:33,250
And this thing you might have heard of your solution architects,

360
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,879
and it's a very common thing from AWVL arched framework.

361
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,210
It was built on 5 major principles,

362
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,239
operational excellence,

363
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:43,599
performance efficiency, reliability, security,

364
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,219
and cost efficiency.

365
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:48,690
When we added the sustainability pillar

366
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,950
to it in 2021,

367
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:53,070
our focus was to have a standard framework

368
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:56,000
which our users can utilize and

369
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,250
implement the same strategies to their workload,

370
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:00,548
to the architecture, to continue to improve

371
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,548
and reduce their overall carbon emissions.

372
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,479
Then when we go around following these practices,

373
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,969
reviewing our workloads against these

374
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:10,969
best practices, against these pillars, we are able

375
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:13,048
to identify and improve

376
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:14,349
our overall workload setup.

377
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,099
The sustainability best practices lie

378
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:20,149
around these six foundational pillars

379
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:22,460
which we call the cornerstone for any of

380
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,469
the any of the architecture which we will define

381
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:27,149
for you. So when we are thinking about sustainability

382
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:29,308
of our workloads, we'll talk about the region

383
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:31,529
selection, alignment to demand, data,

384
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:33,899
hardware and services,

385
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,428
our software and architecture, and most importantly,

386
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,629
process and culture. That is what we do within

387
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,750
ourselves. In addition to that, we

388
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,969
also have a customer carbon footprint tool.

389
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,178
We have been using our billing and billing dashboard

390
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:47,918
regularly

391
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,830
to visualize how much, how much costs are ongoing.

392
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:53,219
This also helps you to get a

393
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:55,340
reflection of where your carbon

394
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,538
emissions are also going for your workloads. This

395
00:14:57,538 --> 00:14:59,538
will give you a breakdown based on the regions

396
00:14:59,538 --> 00:15:01,580
and the services and overall usage

397
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,038
per account so that you will have clarity

398
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:05,200
of the kind of

399
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:08,219
things you have done for your carbon emissions and where is it going

400
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:10,259
and what you probably should consider in

401
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:12,259
order to go forward, have a proper measuring and

402
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:12,840
reporting tool.

403
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:15,269
Now with this we have this ability

404
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,989
to visualize what we have.

405
00:15:17,408 --> 00:15:19,450
Now we go back to the HPC and go back

406
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,750
to how AWS can help you

407
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:24,330
get to a sustainable high performance computing

408
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,629
setup, and the building blocks

409
00:15:26,918 --> 00:15:28,969
for sustainable high performance computing setups

410
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:29,908
are as follows.

411
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:32,928
I'm just showcasing this divided into three common

412
00:15:32,928 --> 00:15:35,038
layers. The first one being the cohort,

413
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,168
the the the framework, something

414
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:38,750
where the foundation lies, which is

415
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,739
where the storage will be in terms of file systems

416
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:42,729
and where.

417
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:45,798
Our network will be. So we have

418
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,038
Amazon FSX for luster,

419
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,349
for luster-based computing,

420
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,779
and elastic fabric adapter that will help you for

421
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,779
high fast speed network

422
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,719
interface for your HPC cluster.

423
00:15:57,599 --> 00:16:00,000
Then we'll go for the compute and our scheduling

424
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,320
services, and we have options of AWS

425
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,330
Pallel cluster, AWS batch,

426
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:06,389
and AWS parallel computing Service.

427
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,830
I'll dig a big deep dive. I'll

428
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,840
do a deep dive down on this to

429
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,719
get you where we can utilize each of these. And

430
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,759
finally, how do we visualize, how do we interact with the

431
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,259
system? And we have the Amazon DCV

432
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,219
and we have the

433
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,548
research and engineering studio on AWS

434
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,840
that can be utilized for you to visualize

435
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,298
and work with your workflows.

436
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:30,509
Now we go back to the, the, the aspects

437
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:33,099
which Guy spoke about, the key areas and avenues

438
00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:34,288
that we want to

439
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,710
focus on as we build solutions

440
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,729
on for for our climate research.

441
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,229
The first one is data.

442
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,418
And data is pivotal for any kind of research, specifically

443
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:44,798
when we are doing climate research.

444
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:47,479
We need a lot of data from various sources

445
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:48,759
that can be,

446
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:51,058
that can give us the most accurate results.

447
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:54,259
And if that data is not good

448
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:56,269
for us, it will give us, it will not give

449
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:57,529
us good enough results.

450
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,769
It will be any kind, it will be

451
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:03,190
stored across coming from various sources and

452
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,229
it will be populated in various places,

453
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,890
and we need to utilize the same.

454
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,489
There's one concern with this.

455
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,009
The data which we might need for research

456
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,910
will be in exabytes and exabytes overall,

457
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:18,269
and that will cost emission. Storing all

458
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:19,670
that data will cost emission.

459
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,868
That means we will have our storage resources

460
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,890
consuming all these data stored coming from

461
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,588
various sources, storing

462
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:29,199
our storage systems and using it over

463
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:29,900
and over again.

464
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,809
Another aspect to this is the data transfer.

465
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,400
Most of the customers we have worked with who

466
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,439
want to reduce their carbon emissions tend to

467
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,568
neglect the emissions

468
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:43,559
coming from data transfer from one

469
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,598
source to source to a destination.

470
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:47,140
That's a key aspect of carbon emissions which is going around,

471
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:48,969
and we need to reduce the same.

472
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:51,989
The key thing which will come out from there is

473
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,858
that the data is reusable,

474
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:55,689
and we need to find out ways

475
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,219
on how to do it.

476
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:59,630
Well, AWS has found one way of how to do it for

477
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,650
you. By creating an open

478
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,930
data on AWS.

479
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:05,608
Now this platform has

480
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:08,549
data coming from various sources, research facilities,

481
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,868
various types of research, be it nonprofit

482
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:12,900
organizations, scientific organizations, multiple places

483
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,160
correlated to the data in a single place, and using

484
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,989
AWS data exchange, you have access to them.

485
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,910
Along with that, one good thing comes over there,

486
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,318
it is ready to use on the fly. You don't

487
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:24,328
need to download it to your

488
00:18:24,328 --> 00:18:26,509
or transfer it to your storage

489
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:28,650
accesses, your storage devices. You don't

490
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,650
need to move it to your SD buckets. You can keep it

491
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,750
there, so the major chunk of data is

492
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,809
just available. You can start to use it on the

493
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:37,318
fly, use it for reset purposes,

494
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:39,769
and get on the next, get on with your development

495
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:41,848
part. So once we have the data

496
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:42,489
part sorted,

497
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,930
next is the storage.

498
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:45,939
While we conduct our research,

499
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,559
we will require file systems and we'll also require a lot

500
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,799
of artifacts which will develop out or spin out

501
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,818
from our research

502
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:53,459
and how do we manage this.

503
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:57,118
As those artifacts will again be of

504
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:59,430
a huge volume, we need to first identify

505
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,608
data access patterns,

506
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:02,489
and we need to ensure that

507
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:03,890
we are able to

508
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,469
reduce our usage in that front as

509
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:08,650
well. While we're using

510
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,509
Amazon S3.

511
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,219
We specify that there

512
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,680
are life cycle policies that we can certainly utilize.

513
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:17,380
Now these life cycle policies help in

514
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,449
order to move data from

515
00:19:20,588 --> 00:19:22,858
used very frequently

516
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:23,890
to not used at all.

517
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:26,500
And by this, and even from there further

518
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,640
deleting them when there's something that is not being used.

519
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,880
Now understanding this aspect that

520
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:33,380
considering the raw data, the source data is available for

521
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,430
us. The computers can be

522
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,868
readily available for us.

523
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,289
We don't necessarily have to store

524
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:41,750
unnecessary data, and we can get rid of it to

525
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,910
ensure that we are keeping our costs

526
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,789
in check and keeping our ambitions in check as well.

527
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,189
Next part is the file system.

528
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:54,000
Now for an on-premises high performance

529
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,759
computing setup,

530
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,439
we require a file system which is very

531
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,640
fast, very efficient, and we have to

532
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,059
replicate something similar for

533
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,098
for our AW services as well.

534
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:05,598
And that's where Amazon FSX for Luster came

535
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:06,118
into the picture.

536
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,318
It provides great benefits such as intelligent tiering,

537
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:12,160
which moves data from one type of storage

538
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,618
tier to another. It will help you to reduce your emissions.

539
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:17,799
It will also help us with life cycle management, automated

540
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,009
lifecycle management, so that you can clean up data

541
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:22,279
as well. And

542
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,519
the data archival along with the integration

543
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:26,588
with S3 will help you move your artifacts in the

544
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:27,799
right place, right position as well.

545
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:30,459
Overall, when it combines together.

546
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,140
Amazon Amazon FSS for

547
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,299
Luster provides high performance file

548
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,380
system for your high performance computing.

549
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:40,328
And can reduce your storage footprint as

550
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:42,449
compared to standard data center by up to 50%.

551
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,390
That's a huge differentiation in

552
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,529
terms of sustainability, in terms of

553
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:50,348
benefiting from carbon emission efficiency.

554
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,239
And the final component, compute.

555
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,739
Now this is where AWS has been really

556
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Doing a lot of innovation and making strides

557
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,900
on how we can benefit the power of cloud

558
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,068
in order to conduct the research for high performance

559
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:08,078
computing. Like I said, a normal cluster

560
00:21:08,078 --> 00:21:09,279
will take up to hundreds

561
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:12,068
of servers at least to get started for various workloads.

562
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,719
We have, I spoke about three solutions. We'll

563
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:17,140
start with this AWS parallel cluster.

564
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,719
Now if you're coming from an HPC background and you

565
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:21,858
have your open MP and MPI-based workloads

566
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:24,039
and you want to replicate the same

567
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:24,640
on cloud,

568
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,279
this is a good starting place for you.

569
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:28,939
It will provide you the scheduler that will

570
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,838
be integrating that will integrate

571
00:21:31,098 --> 00:21:33,098
with our auto scaling mechanism with

572
00:21:33,098 --> 00:21:35,380
our clusters with our with our in servers

573
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,539
and instances that can scale up and scale down

574
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:38,650
based on requirements,

575
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:41,019
and we have seen that by using AWS

576
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:41,739
parallel cluster.

577
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:44,019
It can reduce carbon

578
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:46,140
carbon footprint by up to 57%

579
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,559
from a standard HPC

580
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:51,059
workloads. So that means it is efficient.

581
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,239
It integrates well with AW services such as

582
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,358
Luster, EC2,

583
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:55,459
EFA, and

584
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,118
NICE DCV for visualization purposes and

585
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:00,400
gives you a good platform for you to conduct a

586
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,598
research. If you already have your workloads already

587
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:05,029
built for on premises, and just

588
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,078
bring them on the fly and start using them.

589
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:10,949
The next part is the AWS batch.

590
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,219
An AWS batch can be extremely efficient for your

591
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:15,130
high performance computing scheduling system,

592
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:17,039
provided if you have

593
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:19,420
loosely covered workloads or your workloads are already

594
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,439
on containers or you're building something on containers,

595
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:23,618
and you want to run them on a parallel computing part.

596
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,799
This will give you a provision of having a job schedule

597
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,519
that will reduce,

598
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,910
will do the scheduling part itself,

599
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,338
and it will also help in reduction of compute

600
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:33,598
time by up to 60%.

601
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,019
And as we reduce the compute time, we will be

602
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:38,858
able to see it also the resources

603
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,739
are used for a shorter period of time. That means your efficiency

604
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,959
increases in terms of your emissions.

605
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:46,949
And the last one.

606
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,949
Let's say you're just getting started. You're just a

607
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:51,949
researcher who has not have any experience

608
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:53,989
of any kind of HPC or a container workload,

609
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:55,449
and you want to get started towards

610
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:58,130
building a carbon intelligence orchestration system.

611
00:22:58,588 --> 00:22:59,459
In this scenario,

612
00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:01,529
AWS parallel computing system

613
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:04,549
service can be really useful for you as it does

614
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,549
all the heavy lifting work for itself. You don't have

615
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,670
to worry about what kind of computer you want to keep in place.

616
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:11,078
It will not have to worry about how you will do scheduling.

617
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,439
You just build your job, build your research,

618
00:23:14,189 --> 00:23:16,299
uh, research algorithm your codes and stuff, and it

619
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:18,380
will just be deployed from the best

620
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,000
usage in the most efficient way

621
00:23:20,838 --> 00:23:22,670
that will help reduce your wait time. It will,

622
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,180
it will be easily, easy to set up and

623
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,180
prioritize. You can just focus towards your research

624
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,910
and not worry about the infrastructure part.

625
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,618
So all the, all of these combined will give you a

626
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,059
core area

627
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,410
of the compute platform that can be utilized

628
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,439
for a research part.

629
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:40,229
Next, we'll talk about the instances.

630
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,880
AWS has been working a lot on the

631
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,049
instances which are focused towards high performance

632
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,130
computing and accelerated computing aspects. We

633
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,170
have instances which are HPC optimized, that

634
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,209
will be efficient while we are conducting

635
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:53,568
research and running our jobs for HPC-based

636
00:23:53,568 --> 00:23:55,838
setup. And also for accelerated computing

637
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:58,049
where we might require graphical intensive workloads

638
00:23:58,049 --> 00:23:58,559
as well

639
00:23:58,858 --> 00:24:00,959
where like an example which we'll probably show

640
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:03,118
we'll have that showcase as well where graphical

641
00:24:03,118 --> 00:24:05,509
based results needs to be

642
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:07,180
also managed so we have

643
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,199
instances which are developed for the same as well.

644
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,380
Guy initially spoke about sustainability of the cloud,

645
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,509
and AWS has been doing a lot of work

646
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:16,489
on this fronts.

647
00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:19,549
When it comes to efficient silicon,

648
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,750
and that means the chip design, we come from the bottom

649
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,068
up, we start working on the chip

650
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:24,939
design aspect as well,

651
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:26,420
so where we can

652
00:24:26,828 --> 00:24:27,789
improve on that.

653
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:28,739
And

654
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:31,068
our three key chips which have been

655
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:33,108
utilized, one Graviton, which might have

656
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:35,219
been the most common for any compute purposes,

657
00:24:35,469 --> 00:24:37,640
they're extremely power efficient. They're up to 60%

658
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,449
more power efficient

659
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,368
than a standard

660
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:40,838
EC-2 of a similar,

661
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,358
similar family.

662
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:45,150
For a lot of our research

663
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,509
we require model training, model optimization,

664
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:50,269
and for that we have our inferentia

665
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:51,130
and cranium,

666
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:53,598
and inferentia was specifically built

667
00:24:53,598 --> 00:24:54,130
for

668
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,509
being more giving you better performance

669
00:24:56,509 --> 00:24:57,689
per the power per watt

670
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,189
in terms of the utilization. That

671
00:25:00,189 --> 00:25:02,189
means and as we grow to newer models

672
00:25:02,189 --> 00:25:04,348
of influentia as we have gone to infringentia 2,

673
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,118
influential 3.

674
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:07,529
It keeps improving in terms

675
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:10,009
of the power efficiency for

676
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,009
each and every time it conducts

677
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:13,539
any inference and optimization,

678
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:15,890
and tranium for any training purposes, it

679
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,368
can give up to 25% better energy efficiency

680
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:20,568
than any standard easy to instance of the same

681
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:22,729
kind. And as we keep developing a newer

682
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,789
version, the focus always remains how

683
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:27,318
tranium can be used for training your

684
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,368
models at a faster pace and be

685
00:25:29,368 --> 00:25:30,380
more efficient pace as well.

686
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,009
Now I spoke about all these materials. Now how will

687
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:36,170
it look like when you are really building

688
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,049
it all into a play?

689
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,809
How all of this will come together?

690
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:40,709
I'll give you a sam

691
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:43,029
few sample diagrams if you, in case in any

692
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:45,209
of these three fronts you want to utilize AWS

693
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:46,789
parallel cluster, AWS

694
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,309
batch, or AWS

695
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:51,789
uh parallel computing service. Any of, in

696
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:52,729
any of these scenario.

697
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:55,459
And architecture will look something like this.

698
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,890
Uh, let's say that you are just a res you are a researcher

699
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,229
who's conducting climate research

700
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,769
and you want to utilize parallels, so that

701
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,949
means you already have jobs which are from HPC based

702
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:07,108
from open MP or MP based jobs.

703
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:09,979
Over here you require a nice DCV setup,

704
00:26:10,489 --> 00:26:12,608
so that's something for your visualization perspectives, how

705
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,509
it will interact with your head node and your queue.

706
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,430
You will have auto scaling. You will create queues

707
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,500
for your requirements based on, it might be a high

708
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,828
memory queue or a GPU-based queue or a compute-based

709
00:26:21,828 --> 00:26:24,250
queue and set this up in your VPC

710
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,949
and over there, FSX Fluster will be your file system

711
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:27,989
interacting with your.

712
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,390
Various compute nodes

713
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:32,969
and you will be able to interact with this and

714
00:26:32,969 --> 00:26:33,709
have the

715
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,959
and run run and schedule your jobs.

716
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,328
The one benefit of pilot trust is, like I

717
00:26:38,328 --> 00:26:40,328
said, if you want to manage things yourself, if you

718
00:26:40,328 --> 00:26:42,029
want to identify which kind of

719
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,309
computer resources you want to keep,

720
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:47,160
this gives you a flexibility of choosing those resources.

721
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:50,170
So if you have a more customized job which requires specific

722
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,250
understanding which you want to do, take

723
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,250
control in your hand, you can utilize parallel

724
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,328
cryst in that scenario.

725
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:59,318
Next we go to AW's batch, and this,

726
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
like I mentioned, is going to be a similar setup. The

727
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,640
only difference is if you have more loosely coupled

728
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,640
or container-based workloads which will

729
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,439
run in parallel.

730
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:09,088
AWS batch will be a solution for you as

731
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:11,130
you can start to run your containers, deploy them,

732
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,709
and they will run in parallel

733
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:13,549
across

734
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:16,088
for these various queues and do the

735
00:27:16,088 --> 00:27:18,239
work for you. The job scheduling part will be managed

736
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,118
by AWS batch,

737
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:21,529
so the scheduling part is completed. Your only

738
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:23,568
part is running the jobs and having this set up there

739
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,049
again. You have an option of choosing what

740
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:28,108
kind of instances you would like on the back end.

741
00:27:28,328 --> 00:27:29,009
So that's

742
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:31,430
one more control you will have in your hand.

743
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:34,989
And the third part is the AWS parallel computing

744
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:37,098
service, and this is where we need the least operational

745
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:38,150
overhead altogether.

746
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,689
We are only focusing on submitting our jobs

747
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:43,068
and letting them work on the back end, so all the

748
00:27:43,068 --> 00:27:45,029
part of managing the cluster,

749
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:47,549
managing the compute resources, managing any kind

750
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:49,750
of resources will be handled by AWS and Parallel

751
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,469
Computing Service,

752
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:52,910
and you will be only focused on developing your job

753
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,108
codes, developing your solutions and building

754
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:57,108
them same, so you will get the information in,

755
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:59,709
get it done, and once you have the artifacts ready, you're

756
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:00,328
happy to go

757
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:03,098
in this. So this is what AWS

758
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,568
HPC architectures could look like,

759
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:06,029
and now we'll take a look at

760
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:08,719
what it could lead, what kind of

761
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,739
research it could facilitate, and for this

762
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:12,318
we have an example of a case study

763
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:13,259
where

764
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:16,299
we'll you will talk about how University of Oxford

765
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,979
has been benefiting towards this.

766
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,000
Thank you. So,

767
00:28:22,358 --> 00:28:23,900
I'm going to tell you a story.

768
00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:27,939
The story starts in the Indo-Gadantic

769
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,199
region, so that's in the India,

770
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,650
Pakistan, and Bangladesh

771
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,098
area. Air pollution

772
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:36,199
is a big problem.

773
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:37,880
Li Tian will tell you all about it.

774
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:40,989
In fact,

775
00:28:41,368 --> 00:28:43,449
this is one of the most polluted

776
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:45,068
areas globally,

777
00:28:45,568 --> 00:28:47,729
with pollution level exceeding the

778
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:49,930
WHOO standard by up to 10

779
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:50,549
times.

780
00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:52,269
And that leads to

781
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:55,170
over 2 million premature deaths annually.

782
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:58,078
But because

783
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:01,078
There is no precise data in terms

784
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:02,939
of where the pollution sources are.

785
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:05,969
The efforts to address this

786
00:29:05,969 --> 00:29:08,709
crisis has been hindered for decades.

787
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,920
One of the main pollution sources is

788
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,180
a brick kiln.

789
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:19,199
Brick kilns are kilns that are

790
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:21,358
used to make bricks,

791
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,199
and in the process of making bricks,

792
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:26,779
the kilns emit dangerous

793
00:29:27,219 --> 00:29:29,818
pollutants such as carbon dioxide

794
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:31,219
and particulate matters.

795
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:35,910
And because of the rapid rise

796
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,029
of real

797
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:38,578
estate industry.

798
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:42,348
There has been a lot more vehicles

799
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:45,140
that have been built, and a lot of them are operating.

800
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,618
Without without regulation.

801
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:51,318
Now, enters APA

802
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:54,068
or the Air Pollution Asset

803
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:55,229
Level detection,

804
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,809
which is a research

805
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,689
project from the Smith School of Enterprise

806
00:29:59,689 --> 00:30:02,049
and Environment at the University of Oxford.

807
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,729
So APA believes

808
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:09,049
that clean air is a fundamental

809
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:09,828
human right.

810
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,699
They, they

811
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,858
envision

812
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,078
communities that are free from.

813
00:30:16,699 --> 00:30:19,059
Air pollution and they believe that

814
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:21,259
clean air should be prioritized for the

815
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:22,858
current and future generations.

816
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,519
So how they plan to do that is

817
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,219
they want to detect all the bras

818
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:31,019
in the Indoggenic region.

819
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,078
And that covers 1.5 million

820
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:35,959
square kilometers of land.

821
00:30:37,108 --> 00:30:39,150
And after detecting all of them, they

822
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,449
want to create a map,

823
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,289
an interactive dashboard

824
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,769
so that communities can understand.

825
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:48,439
Where they are and so that they

826
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:50,539
can make more data-driven decisions.

827
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,739
Now for researchers, when you start

828
00:30:53,739 --> 00:30:54,759
working on the research,

829
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:57,279
the first step is to start looking

830
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,358
at some of the data and then maybe

831
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,559
use the local machine to run

832
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,039
some analysis, do some geospatial data

833
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:06,189
processing, run uh build some machine learning

834
00:31:06,189 --> 00:31:06,759
models.

835
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,680
As they are working on this project, they realized

836
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,920
that local machines couldn't handle the scale

837
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,019
of data storage,

838
00:31:13,598 --> 00:31:15,799
processing, and machine

839
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:16,779
learning workloads

840
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:19,318
because they are working with millions of

841
00:31:19,318 --> 00:31:21,400
data points from different types of

842
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,420
data sources.

843
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,068
Now the main data that you're, they're using

844
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:28,750
are satellite imageries.

845
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:32,180
They choose satellite imagery because

846
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,660
satellites offer consistent

847
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,818
wide area and historical Earth

848
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:39,098
observations so that it can help them to

849
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:41,318
understand the region that they are studying.

850
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,088
And there are different types of satellite imageries.

851
00:31:45,348 --> 00:31:46,930
Um, a lot of them are

852
00:31:47,189 --> 00:31:49,348
publicly available such as the Sentinel

853
00:31:49,348 --> 00:31:51,549
2 and Lancesat

854
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:53,608
projects. There are also some sala

855
00:31:53,608 --> 00:31:55,630
imageries that are, uh,

856
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,789
require, uh, that are commercially

857
00:31:57,789 --> 00:31:58,410
available.

858
00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:04,858
There's also the difference between low

859
00:32:04,858 --> 00:32:06,858
low resolution satellite imagery

860
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,838
and high resolution satellite imagery.

861
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:11,680
So if we're looking at brake hills with

862
00:32:11,689 --> 00:32:13,969
low resolution versus high resolution,

863
00:32:14,358 --> 00:32:15,799
you see the clear difference.

864
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:18,858
If we're looking at the ones that are towards

865
00:32:18,858 --> 00:32:20,979
your right, those are the ones with

866
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:23,459
lower resolution at 10 m resolution.

867
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,858
Brake hills look like an orange

868
00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:26,559
blob.

869
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:29,459
You're with a bunch of pixels.

870
00:32:30,598 --> 00:32:32,640
You probably wouldn't be able to

871
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,709
confidently say that this is a

872
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:36,759
brick hill. This, you can just say

873
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:39,239
this is might be an orange oval

874
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,019
object, right?

875
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:43,969
Versus if you're looking at the higher resolution

876
00:32:43,969 --> 00:32:46,358
satellite imagery on the left

877
00:32:46,818 --> 00:32:48,959
at the 0.5 m resolution,

878
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:51,858
you can confidently say this is the Brick

879
00:32:51,858 --> 00:32:54,719
hill. But

880
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:57,039
the higher resolution satellite imagery

881
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,259
can be expensive.

882
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,719
So what the researchers did is they started

883
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:02,818
out with

884
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:05,439
low resolution imagery

885
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:07,180
using Sentinel 2.

886
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:11,959
So they built a random forest classification

887
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:13,900
model to identify

888
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:15,930
orange oval

889
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,019
objects

890
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:19,059
and here is one

891
00:33:19,838 --> 00:33:21,039
object being identified.

892
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,920
So this is the potential

893
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:26,799
bra kill. s

894
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,449
As we know, because for the low resolution

895
00:33:31,088 --> 00:33:33,549
satellite imageries, we cannot confidently

896
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:35,509
say that this is actual a brick kiln.

897
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:38,068
The result is they identified

898
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:40,578
31,000 brick kilns in Pakistan,

899
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,368
which is

900
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,588
a lot more than how many there actually

901
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:46,789
are. So they understand that there are

902
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:48,309
a lot of false positives.

903
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,989
But what they then did is to

904
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,969
use these identified.

905
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:55,930
Objects

906
00:33:56,189 --> 00:33:56,848
as

907
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:00,269
potential brake hills for

908
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:01,838
further analysis.

909
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:06,390
They then acquired the sala imageries

910
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,849
for only those areas that are identified

911
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:09,929
and then.

912
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,849
Acquire the right high resolution imageries

913
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:16,228
and then um run a high

914
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:17,610
resolution workflow

915
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:18,969
to

916
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:21,869
understand the locations

917
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:23,090
of the exact

918
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:25,610
uh exact uh bra hills.

919
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:28,688
So here they are annotating

920
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:30,829
uh the brakis using uh

921
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:33,090
with high resolution satellite imagery

922
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:35,539
and then run computer vision models in order

923
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:37,750
to identify where the brake kilns actually

924
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,320
are. Now

925
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,219
with that, they are able to

926
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,639
create an interactive

927
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,800
map of where all the brake hills are

928
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,639
in the region.

929
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,949
As well as some other pollution sources

930
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,139
such as boiler,

931
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,219
steel, and

932
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:56,280
and primary

933
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,050
energy generation sources such as coal, fossil

934
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,519
fuel, and more.

935
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:03,918
And if you are clicking into each

936
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:06,119
of the assets, you will be able to

937
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,219
understand also

938
00:35:07,478 --> 00:35:08,579
the um

939
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,340
the the actual

940
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,000
impact of these pollution sources

941
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,320
and this really helps the community to

942
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,719
understand their areas

943
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:18,250
better.

944
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,878
And they are expanding their work in Africa as

945
00:35:20,878 --> 00:35:23,199
well to help communities

946
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:23,739
there

947
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,978
to make data-driven decisions.

948
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,539
So tying this back to

949
00:35:31,978 --> 00:35:34,300
some of the best practices and patterns

950
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,159
that Newton has shared with us before.

951
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,179
For the APA solution,

952
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:40,938
in terms of data, they use open data

953
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,000
as the foundation of their analysis.

954
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:44,389
They use Sentinel 2

955
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:47,458
from the open data registry for

956
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:48,119
uh

957
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:50,119
so that they don't have to store the data.

958
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,610
And then storage, the analyze

959
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,438
the

960
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
data access pattern and only store

961
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,938
the data that's needed.

962
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,628
And in terms of compute,

963
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:03,369
they run their low resolution workflow

964
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,449
and high resolution workflow on

965
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:06,289
EC2,

966
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,760
but they understand that for different types

967
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,010
of workflows they require

968
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,889
different resources. For example, the low

969
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:16,083
resolution work. Flow will require

970
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,324
more compute and the high

971
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:21,414
high resolution workflow will require

972
00:36:21,414 --> 00:36:24,364
more memory, so they are optimizing,

973
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,994
they choose their EC2 instances

974
00:36:27,445 --> 00:36:29,445
accordingly in order to use the

975
00:36:29,445 --> 00:36:30,625
right tool for the job.

976
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:34,485
As a result,

977
00:36:34,853 --> 00:36:37,324
they were able to process 1.2

978
00:36:37,324 --> 00:36:38,945
million satellite imageries

979
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,224
and saved

980
00:36:40,644 --> 00:36:43,344
over 17,000 compute hours.

981
00:36:44,228 --> 00:36:46,269
With up to 80% reduction in

982
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,619
infrastructure costs as well as 90%

983
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:50,989
reduction in monitoring time and task

984
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:51,969
run time.

985
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,648
Solomon, the machine learning and

986
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,360
deep learning specialist has said,

987
00:36:59,648 --> 00:37:01,510
we started with a social goal

988
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:03,349
and AWS was a means

989
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,469
to reach that goal.

990
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:10,148
So what's next for the APEC group is that

991
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:12,349
as you already saw, they are expanding their work

992
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:14,500
in the Africa region to help the

993
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,949
communities there to understand air pollution

994
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:18,809
problems better as well.

995
00:37:20,628 --> 00:37:23,050
They also launched a volunteer program.

996
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,878
Along with an app

997
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:28,478
for the on the ground uh pollution

998
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:29,000
reporting.

999
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:32,769
That will help them to capture additional data

1000
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:35,208
points to create more comprehensive

1001
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:36,929
map of pollution sources.

1002
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:40,429
And they are also looking to leverage additional

1003
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:43,070
AWS services such as Bedrock

1004
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:46,269
uh for geospatial foundation models.

1005
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,909
So now we're going to talk about

1006
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,349
next steps, a little bit of summary, Nin.

1007
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,840
Absolutely. Sure.

1008
00:37:58,918 --> 00:38:01,099
Now we'll talk about the things that we learned,

1009
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,079
what we have key takeaways from this.

1010
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:04,179
First of all,

1011
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,800
high performance computing doesn't

1012
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,898
require those huge data centers

1013
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,360
powered by thermal energy.

1014
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:12,978
We can get it done sustainably.

1015
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,429
We have ways and means for it and utilize.

1016
00:38:16,938 --> 00:38:18,938
If that's a concern that how you will set up

1017
00:38:18,938 --> 00:38:20,989
and most importantly, the speed of it.

1018
00:38:21,378 --> 00:38:23,579
You don't need to wait to get your

1019
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,809
high performance computing clusters up

1020
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:26,398
and running.

1021
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:27,438
You can get it done

1022
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:29,458
very quickly in a matter of minutes,

1023
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,030
get it up for you, and start with your

1024
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,219
research. That's something very useful for you.

1025
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:37,719
The next part is identifying the

1026
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:39,829
data sources and data transfers.

1027
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:42,559
We don't have to keep moving data

1028
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,958
from one source to another. We don't have to worry about storing

1029
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:47,090
all the data which we need for our research at

1030
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,320
various places. We don't have to worry about those costs.

1031
00:38:49,489 --> 00:38:51,208
We don't have to worry about those emissions.

1032
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,938
We have everything in a single place that we can just

1033
00:38:53,938 --> 00:38:56,489
directly go ahead and use, utilize the scalability

1034
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:58,648
and the flexibility the cloud has to offer, that AWS

1035
00:38:58,648 --> 00:38:59,349
has to offer.

1036
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,349
The Third thing is understand the data access pattern,

1037
00:39:03,398 --> 00:39:05,438
the requirements, what kind of file system you

1038
00:39:05,438 --> 00:39:07,619
will require for your computing cluster.

1039
00:39:07,918 --> 00:39:09,918
It is important to have that set up

1040
00:39:09,918 --> 00:39:10,659
in place.

1041
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:13,438
It might not be the case that a shared file system, a standard

1042
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:15,599
NFS-based file system like an EFS, might

1043
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,750
be the best solution. We need faster solutions.

1044
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:19,958
We have solutions for them. If you need a slower

1045
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,030
solution, there are things available which are more effective

1046
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,820
for you. Choose and identify the same.

1047
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,239
You have the ability and flexibility to manage that

1048
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:26,760
on your own.

1049
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:29,519
And the performance requirement. What kind of compute

1050
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:31,539
do you want to do and how much effort do you

1051
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:33,719
want to do in order to manage that cluster for

1052
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,978
yourself? Add these elements together

1053
00:39:36,398 --> 00:39:38,458
and finally choosing the right tool for the job.

1054
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:41,418
Does your workload workload require a good

1055
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,119
stereographic setup for your 3D imagery

1056
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:44,780
process as well?

1057
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,438
If you that's a, that's a requirement, certainly

1058
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:49,869
utilize nice DCB and Research Engineering studio

1059
00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:51,820
for AWS in that capacity.

1060
00:39:52,378 --> 00:39:54,708
If using an HPC accelerated

1061
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:56,820
instance will be the right solution for

1062
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,030
you, utilize parallel cluster and add it

1063
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,668
over there.

1064
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,909
And finally, if you just want,

1065
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,550
don't want to add to any of these elements, utilize

1066
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,128
ABS parallel computing service.

1067
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:08,510
Understand your requirements. What is the goal for

1068
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,579
you? What's your business use case? When do you want to achieve

1069
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:11,849
it? What's the speed and cost

1070
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:13,300
consideration comes into the picture.

1071
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:14,550
Analyze all of them.

1072
00:40:14,918 --> 00:40:17,039
And you can find out the solutions exist

1073
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,398
and you can easily go in and also there's

1074
00:40:19,398 --> 00:40:21,599
an ability for you to just try out these

1075
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,719
things as well and which works fits best

1076
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,840
for you and try to start using the same as

1077
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,949
well. And for that we have

1078
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:30,110
a few more resources that can be helpful.

1079
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:30,909
For example,

1080
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:33,269
for example, we have.

1081
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,219
You. To

1082
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,628
deliver to you something

1083
00:40:41,889 --> 00:40:43,909
that you can rely on and then ultimately

1084
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,500
verify, which is why people.

1085
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:53,260
verification. She's

1086
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:58,300
representing the review.

1087
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:04,119
This is a new initiative that we're

1088
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:06,409
to showcase how we're using AI to

1089
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:08,898
help solve humanity's most pressing

1090
00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:09,458
problems.

1091
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:11,780
If you want to learn more about how our

1092
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,320
customers are doing so, check out this page.

1093
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:16,260
