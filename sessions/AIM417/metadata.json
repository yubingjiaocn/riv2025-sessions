  "title_cn": "I understand you're referencing an AWS re:Invent 2025 session about sustainable computing for climate solutions (AIM417). However, I don't have access to the specific content or details from that session.\n\nCould you provide more context about what you'd like to know? For example:\n\n- Are you looking for information about AWS sustainability initiatives?\n- Do you need help implementing sustainable computing practices in your AWS environment?\n- Are you interested in specific climate-focused AWS services or features?\n- Do you have questions about optimizing your AWS infrastructure for environmental impact?\n\nOnce you clarify what you're looking for, I can provide relevant guidance on AWS sustainability best practices, carbon footprint optimization, or climate-focused solutions.",
  "abstract": "High Performance Computing (HPC) is crucial for solving complex environmental challenges such as air pollution and extreme weather forecasting, yet HPC workloads are traditionally computationally intensive. This session explores patterns and key AWS services like AWS Batch, ParallelCluster, EC2 Spot Instances, Graviton processors, FSx for Lustre, and Cloudwatch that help optimize the balance between computational performance and environmental sustainability. Attendees will explore a real-world example of how researchers from University of Oxford are using sustainable HPC solutions for community air quality improvement through large-scale geospatial data processing and machine learning.",
