1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,740
- Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,990
Thanks a lot for coming in today.

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,330
I appreciate all of you being here.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,740
My name is Nits Jeganathan,

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,560
and I'm the product
lead for AWS Transform,

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,413
and joining me today
is Srinivas Singaraju.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,880
Please introduce yourself, Singaraju.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,882
- Hello, everyone.

9
00:00:19,882 --> 00:00:21,632
I'm Srinivas Singaraju with IDEMIA,

10
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:26,007
focusing on technology
transformation at IDEMIA.

11
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,950
- Yeah, and joining me also is Rahul Chugh

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,810
and he's an SA in AWS.

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,310
Please introduce-
- Yeah.

14
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,715
Hi everyone, I'm Rahul Chugh.

15
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:39,715
I'm AI Acceleration SA, so
I essentially help partners

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,890
to accelerate migrations
and modernization on AWS

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,770
using AI and GenAI technologies.

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,753
- Excellent. All right, thank you.

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,080
So today we are gonna be talking about

20
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,430
how our customers, IDEMIA,
have used AWS Transform

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,100
to break down the technical debt

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,230
that they have built over 25 years.

23
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,850
While we are walking through this journey,

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,400
we'll also like explain
the new capabilities

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,950
that we are introducing into AWS Transform

26
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,600
for .NET as well.

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,433
Okay?

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,430
Just before we get into this, I wanna like

29
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,130
kind of get a show of
hands from all of you.

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,610
How many of you know about
AWS Transform for .NET?

31
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,340
This is our agentic AI
service we launched.

32
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,700
Okay, that's a few of you, and some of you

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,250
are like fairly new, so
I'll kind of set the context

34
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,380
a little bit and then we can, you know,

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,280
dive into some of the new
capabilities that we have added.

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,150
So the first thing that I wanna talk about

37
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,660
is why does customer wanna modernize

38
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,190
their .NET applications, right?

39
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,020
Like from Windows to Linux.

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,510
And a lot of customers
who have applications

41
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,292
that are written in .NET Framework,

42
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:52,530
they are like 20 plus years old,

43
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,030
and a lot of these legacy applications

44
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,430
can run only on Windows, and
that is preventing customers

45
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,400
from taking advantage
of the new technologies

46
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,460
and flexibility that is available to them

47
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,050
by moving to Linux.

48
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,640
Like if you move to Linux, you can run it

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,220
on different instances, whether it is x86,

50
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,710
or even Graviton instances.

51
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,810
You can run them as
containers, take advantage

52
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,000
of the scalability in that sense,

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,640
or like you can run
them as Lambdas, right?

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,950
And just running it on Windows

55
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,020
kind of prevents you from doing that.

56
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,090
So that is one of the
reasons why customers

57
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,979
want to move out of, you
know, Windows ecosystem,

58
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,150
but there are other advantages too.

59
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,010
Some of the significant ones is definitely

60
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,100
the operating cost reduction
because the licensing costs

61
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,050
that they have to pay
for the Windows licenses

62
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,570
is no longer applicable,
so they're able to save

63
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,180
up to 40% on some applications, right?

64
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,150
And just by moving to the
latest versions of Windows,

65
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,810
that number like 1.5 to 2x,
that's coming from Microsoft

66
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,440
because of the complete
performance upgrades

67
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,177
across the entire stack, right?

68
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,940
The SDKs, the libraries,
all of those are improving,

69
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,850
so just by moving from .NET Framework

70
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,580
to .NET 8.0 or .NET
10.0, you are expecting

71
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,460
to see up to 2x performance improvement.

72
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,028
And finally, I think the
point that I talked about

73
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:12,000
is there's a scalability, right?

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,550
Once you can run it on
Linux and as a container,

75
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,840
you have a world of options.

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,600
You have a lot more options
of like how you wanna scale,

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,670
how you wanna build new capabilities.

78
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,440
All of those open up to you.

79
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,850
So that's one of the reasons.

80
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,670
What we have seen is up
to 70% of our customers

81
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,370
who are running Windows on AWS today,

82
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,050
they're increasingly adopting Linux

83
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,813
for their Windows
ecosystem of applications.

84
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,010
All right, so that sounds great, right?

85
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,340
But then what is preventing customers

86
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,550
from actually transforming
their applications?

87
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,950
But it is not exactly
straightforward as that, right?

88
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,160
So for example, in order to
port your legacy applications,

89
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,660
you wanna first analyze the code,

90
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,850
identify incompatibilities that are there

91
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,550
between the previous version
and the current versions,

92
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,370
and the longer the
version, like for example

93
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,310
Framework 3.5 and you
wanna move to .NET 8.0,

94
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,960
a lot of those libraries are stale.

95
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,700
You need to find different libraries,

96
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,310
different mechanisms of
doing some of those things.

97
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,930
And then you have to port the code,

98
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,300
and finally validate and deploy.

99
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,255
Even though it is showing this

100
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,600
as a single streamlined workflow,

101
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,670
it is never that straightforward.

102
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,570
Each one of these is
a loop and developers,

103
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,090
as you know, you go make a change

104
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,670
and then all of a sudden
there is 200 builders, right?

105
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,170
And then you have to go back and fix it,

106
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,510
then the libraries are wrong, so it just

107
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,270
is a very cumbersome and, you know,

108
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,150
undifferentiated heavy
lifting for our customers,

109
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,370
because they would rather
wanna spend this time

110
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,180
on focusing on the core competencies

111
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,620
of building new capabilities
rather than trying

112
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,690
and maintaining old
code, which they may not

113
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,300
fully understand, because
the folks who wrote this code

114
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,220
no longer there or they have moved on

115
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,570
to something else, right?

116
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,200
So it requires collaboration
across multiple organizations

117
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,230
and it just is very slow progress.

118
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,670
And this is exactly where AWS
Transform for .NET comes in.

119
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,530
For folks who are not familiar with it,

120
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,750
this is the first agentic AI experience

121
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,780
for transforming your .NET
Framework applications

122
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,210
to .NET 8.0, and now we are supporting

123
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,310
to .NET 10.0 at scale.

124
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,920
So essentially, like if you
have hundreds of applications,

125
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,784
thousands of applications,
we are supporting those

126
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:23,730
in an agentic workflow
model where we are shifting

127
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,970
the developer's role
from that of an executor

128
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,620
to a reviewer, right?

129
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,250
So it's a human in the
loop reviewing off the code

130
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,370
that is being transformed, and
how we are able to do that,

131
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,370
we have a .NET domain expert agent

132
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,540
that we have built on our own
using open source projects

133
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,930
and all of our learnings that
we have done over many years,

134
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,700
and we are using that as a mechanism

135
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,830
to form a unified web experience

136
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,050
where customers can
point to the repositories

137
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,050
and we'll do all the transformation,

138
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,980
you know, like developers can review it

139
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,803
before they deploy to their
production and ground.

140
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,256
So just by doing that, right,
customers can essentially

141
00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:09,750
offload some of the tedious
tasks that I was talking about

142
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,047
and they can achieve
acceleration of up to 4x,

143
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:15,240
and this is some of these
numbers that we have seen

144
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,713
by working with customers.

145
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,087
We launched the service in preview

146
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:24,120
in re:Invent of last year
and we launched the service

147
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,650
in general availability in May 15 of 2025.

148
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,260
So in the last six months,
customers have been

149
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,870
playing around with it
and transforming at scale

150
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,990
and they've been porting
hundreds of applications

151
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,640
and they are boosting
application performance,

152
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,740
scalability, and things like that as well.

153
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,490
So what has changed?

154
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,020
Maybe I'll just touch
upon what has changed

155
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,220
from the GA to now.

156
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,964
It's been six months, right?

157
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:49,800
There are things that we have learned

158
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,820
from talking to customers,
understanding what capabilities

159
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,008
that they wanna go and
build this product further.

160
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:58,920
So one of the first
things that we have done

161
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,340
is expanding support to .NET 10.0.

162
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,680
And Microsoft has released
a new .NET version,

163
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,720
and you know customers,
now they don't want

164
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
just to go to 8.0, they wanna go to 10.0,

165
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,990
so we are supporting that.

166
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,260
And more importantly, they
wanna support .NET Standard,

167
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,070
because most of the customers
with a large legacy,

168
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,190
you know like a real estate portfolio,

169
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,180
they would wanna actually
do it incrementally.

170
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,040
So they don't wanna break compatibilities

171
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,740
with their .NET Framework
application section,

172
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,410
and if you don't wanna move everything

173
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,510
in one go to .NET 8.0 and you wanna keep

174
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,850
some of the applications in Standard,

175
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,530
that allows you to actually do
it in an incremental fashion.

176
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,140
So the strangler fig
pattern instance, right?

177
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,410
So that's why we added support
for .NET Standard as well.

178
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,880
And more importantly, if you think

179
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,330
of your .NET Framework applications
as a three-layered cake,

180
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,170
what we have done at GA was
transforming the middle layer,

181
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,150
the business logic, but customers

182
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,420
couldn't get their UI ported.

183
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,520
Like we know most of the
Framework applications

184
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,130
were written on web forms
and they didn't have

185
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,500
an exact straightforward
way to transform that.

186
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,930
So what we have done
now is we have enabled

187
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,870
the same agentic workflow for
transforming your web forms

188
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,054
to Blazor and this allows
customers to transform

189
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:20,040
a lot of these legacy
applications in one go, right?

190
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,550
And also the Entity Framework
and ADO, ORM support,

191
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,908
essentially what happens
is that if your code

192
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:27,600
was written for database
access in Framework

193
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,450
with Entity or ADO.NET, we are able

194
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,420
to port those corresponding
changes to the .NET 8.0 as well.

195
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,060
This is one of those things
where if we didn't do this,

196
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,790
customers have to go manually
go make these changes,

197
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,740
and with the agentic experience,

198
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,818
customers are able to
take advantage of that.

199
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:47,318
And that is only the
feature capabilities, right?

200
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,530
But there is also the developers.

201
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,717
Like we've been talking
with a lot of developers

202
00:08:51,717 --> 00:08:54,660
and one of the things that they
have provided feedback to us

203
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,680
is that they wanna see that
once the transformation begins,

204
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,100
they wanna be able to
provide fine-grain inputs.

205
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,660
They wanna be able to customize it.

206
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,450
They wanna be able to nudge
it in a specific direction.

207
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,070
So to support that, what we have done

208
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,220
is we have provided an
editable transformation plan.

209
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,080
So what is the transformation plan?

210
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,455
Rahul will show a demo of how this works,

211
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,370
but essentially it's a high-level flow

212
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,530
of all the steps that
the agent is gonna take

213
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,380
to modernize your application portfolio

214
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,570
and customers will be able to say

215
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,520
like, "Okay, make this choice.

216
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,760
Go to this version instead
of the other version."

217
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,260
Those kind of changes, like you know,

218
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,510
that recommendation is
going to come there.

219
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,790
And then also, you know,
they wanna understand

220
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,010
how much time it's gonna take.

221
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,200
Rather than being a black
box, be more transparent.

222
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,710
Give me more feedback on
exactly how long you're taking,

223
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,960
which builder are you stuck on?

224
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,120
Those kind of details, we
are now providing those

225
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,770
to customers as well.

226
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,490
And also, finally, they
wanna be able to use

227
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,990
a coding assistant of their choice.

228
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,670
Let's say they're using Kiro.

229
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,590
They wanna be able to continue the work

230
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,230
that AWS Transform has
done, take it to Kiro,

231
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,006
finish those changes, and then try again,

232
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:07,620
so fix issues and do it
in an iterative format,

233
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,140
and we are enabling those
kind of functionalities today.

234
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,670
There will be a transformation plan

235
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,440
with the next steps as a markdown,

236
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,320
which you can directly feed
to Kiro, complete the job,

237
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,020
and then run the transformation again.

238
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,030
And finally, one of the things that we had

239
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,130
was it's available in two experiences.

240
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,800
Whether you start in
web or whether you use

241
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,880
Visual Studio IDE, you can
see the work that is happening

242
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,500
across both of these together.

243
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,210
So now there is no longer the separation

244
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,460
of if I'm doing the work in IDE,

245
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,530
I cannot see what's happening
on the web experience

246
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,700
and vice versa.

247
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,760
So it is now one unified workspace

248
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,000
for your teams to collaborate together.

249
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,190
So those are the functionalities
that we have added,

250
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,160
but enough about what the potentials are.

251
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,685
I wanna have one of our customers
who have used this service

252
00:10:54,685 --> 00:10:58,020
show you how they have used AWS Transform

253
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,020
to solve their problems,
and that would act

254
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,880
like a guidance for some of the challenges

255
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,670
that you yourself may
face and how AWS Transform

256
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,813
can help you there.

257
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,980
I'll invite Srinivas to kind
of share those details here.

258
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,813
Srinivas?

259
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:14,640
(crowd clapping)

260
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,623
- Thank you, Nits.

261
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,770
So we at IDEMIA, we service 45
plus DMVs across the country.

262
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,440
Any one of you who has a driver's license

263
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,450
in the United States, the chances are

264
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,680
that we would've touched your life

265
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,140
in some or the other form.

266
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,060
This particular solution that we took

267
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,460
through the transformation process

268
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,620
is one of the critical products

269
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,860
that we offer as a service,
and that's for certifying.

270
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,500
As you enter the DMV, you
go through a knowledge test,

271
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,410
and then a skills test,
and then kind of, you know,

272
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,030
you go through the whole process

273
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,070
of getting your driver's license.

274
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,278
As part of that, this product
was built sometime back

275
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,273
and the legacy state was like a typical

276
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:04,530
monolithic application
that we have been deploying

277
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,530
for a while with a thick
client WPF-based application

278
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,960
and then .NET Framework 3.5
with a SQL Server database

279
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,620
as the backend.

280
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,420
Nothing fancy, but kind of, you know,

281
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,740
a critical application.

282
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,350
As we started embarking on the journey

283
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,400
of trying to scale it up
across multiple customers

284
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,420
and multiple types of users
that we had to cater to,

285
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,430
we started realizing
that there are gonna be

286
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,203
some significant challenges.

287
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,500
These are some of the challenges,

288
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,490
not just all-encompassing,
that we encountered

289
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,740
that we needed some answers for.

290
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,200
As we started ramping up, we realized

291
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,180
that the technical debt was piling up

292
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,300
with outdated infrastructure architecture

293
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,020
based on .NET Framework
that was no longer scalable

294
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,020
and limiting us from
being able to containerize

295
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,690
and kind of move to the next level.

296
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,780
Additionally, we started encountering

297
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,910
higher cost of ownership
from a performance

298
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,780
and the legacy applications
that were running

299
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,870
on a Windows environment
and could not be ported

300
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,940
into a Linux setting.

301
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,450
And we also started seeing
some security challenges

302
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,430
that we needed to address.

303
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,580
Particularly with the
space that we operate in,

304
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,500
compliance is a big thing that we need

305
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,160
to be very careful about
because we deal with PII

306
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,640
on a continuous basis,
and also making sure

307
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,130
that not only we're compliant
with the regulatory standards,

308
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,980
but we also need to be ahead of all those

309
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,110
nation-state actors that
we need to worry about.

310
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,770
So kind of we needed to think
about what we need to do.

311
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,040
And it also started kind of
as we started scaling up,

312
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,890
we started noticing some
customer satisfaction issues

313
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,000
were starting to creep up.

314
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,910
So customers started
complaining that, "Hey,

315
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,950
the performance is not at the level

316
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,830
that we are looking for
or we were hoping for.

317
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,567
What can you guys do about that?"

318
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,540
When we started thinking about, okay,

319
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,170
we need to start transforming
what we are doing right now.

320
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,780
So we realized that kind of, you know,

321
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,960
from a technical debt perspective,
what are we looking at?

322
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,710
The manual deployment
process was taking longer

323
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,194
than what we were hoping for.

324
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:26,490
The incompatibility with the
lightweight Linux containers

325
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,450
that we needed to address,
and also the auto scaling.

326
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,460
We were setting up the environments

327
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,220
for like kind of, you know,
the worst-case scenario

328
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,650
but not using it on a regular basis,

329
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,260
which meant that the cost of ownership

330
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,517
was obviously kind of
going through the roof.

331
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:48,517
And the restricted
integration for CICD pipelines

332
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,597
that we wanted to bring bear.

333
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:55,410
The cloud-native
capabilities that the team

334
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,590
was hoping to leverage, we were
not able to get any of that

335
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,903
in place because of the
legacy architecture.

336
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,240
Additionally, we also started noticing

337
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,210
that kind of, you know,
there were some 32-bit

338
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,007
versus 64-bit inefficiencies
that we needed to address

339
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,880
and memory management
and garbage collection.

340
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,000
Those of you who are familiar
with .NET applications

341
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,540
and who have used the
older .NET Frameworks,

342
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,100
you would've definitely experienced

343
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,370
these kind of pain points
on a continuous basis.

344
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,880
And if you ask me what
kept me up at night,

345
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,070
there were occasions where
I had to jump on calls

346
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,900
to figure out what was going on,

347
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,690
and our team was not too happy about that.

348
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,800
The end of life of Windows 2012 server

349
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,230
also kind of accelerated the process

350
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,620
that we needed to
transform our application.

351
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,597
And also, as I mentioned,
the overprovisioning

352
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:57,360
of EC2 instances and then
the amount of storage

353
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,430
that we had to overprovision.

354
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,560
I have my colleague also here

355
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,320
who kind of lived that nightmare with me.

356
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,470
We kind of started thinking
what can we do, okay?

357
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,500
And 99% of the time we started realizing

358
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,920
that majority of the resources
were actually sitting idle

359
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,590
and we needed to address that debt.

360
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:20,190
The higher capacity
needed during usage peaks,

361
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,460
which were not uniform
but kind of, you know,

362
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,260
we saw the ebbs and flows of that

363
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,323
that we needed to deal with.

364
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:31,080
As we started looking at
these problems, we realized

365
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,173
that we needed to tackle them
sooner rather than later.

366
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,100
As I also mentioned,
couple of other things

367
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,370
in terms of the security
challenges that we encountered.

368
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,900
The TLS 1.0 versus TLS 1.3 support

369
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,660
that was limited in terms
of what we were having

370
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,660
in .NET 3.5 and obsolete
code access security

371
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,530
versus the modern .NET
8.0 Framework security.

372
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,400
That was something that
we were looking for.

373
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,432
The weak authentication schemes
that we had to deal with.

374
00:17:06,432 --> 00:17:11,340
Minimal protection for CSRF and, you know,

375
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:16,340
stack trace being very poor
in .NET 3.5 versus .NET 8.0,

376
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,130
and insecure token storage practices

377
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,260
that we had to kind of deal with

378
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,123
as part of the 3.5 architecture
that we had in place.

379
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,860
So with that kind of, you
know, we set some goals

380
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,140
for modernizing our application

381
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,478
and the service that we were
offering to our customers.

382
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:42,478
We started talking to some
partners, Cloudhedge and Amazon.

383
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:46,500
We realized that we need to containerize

384
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,560
as quickly as possible, moving it

385
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,340
to a lightweight Linux container model.

386
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,937
We needed to improve our security posture,

387
00:17:55,937 --> 00:17:58,950
bring down the total cost of ownership,

388
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,760
and more importantly, be
able to go cross-platform,

389
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,713
which was limited the .NET
3.5 that we were experiencing.

390
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,590
How did we achieve that?

391
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,490
We started talking, as I said,
to Cloudhedge and to Amazon

392
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:18,990
and realized this is the
ideal application state

393
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,343
that we needed to get to.

394
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,330
As we can see, we started
getting a little bit

395
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,945
more cloud-native, which
was not the case previously.

396
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:32,280
We needed to host it in a
multi-availability zone model,

397
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,010
which was not the case previously,

398
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,710
particularly containerizing
that and kind of using

399
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,290
the ECRs for managing those containers

400
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:45,290
and then the EKS to store our containers.

401
00:18:45,714 --> 00:18:48,870
And we also, as a part of the journey,

402
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,870
we started, before the
availability of the SQL Server

403
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:58,050
Transform platform, we
started kind of migrating

404
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,050
some of that into Postgre's Aurora SQL.

405
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,530
So as we started doing that, we realized

406
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,070
that kind of, you know,
there's gotta be a better way,

407
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,090
and that's when we talked to
Amazon about the AWS Transform

408
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,189
being the right platform for us

409
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,639
to take us to the next level.

410
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:19,650
Think of it that each and every area

411
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,540
that we're talking about
has like kind of a codebase

412
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,500
that's, you know, unique to
each DMV that we need to deploy,

413
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,230
and when we kind of
factor in across 45 DMVs,

414
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,740
that's not a simple task,
either for the development team

415
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,230
or for the SRE team on our side.

416
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,720
So that's when, with this architecture,

417
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,560
what we started noticing was that close

418
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,610
to four times efficiency, as
Nits had already pointed out

419
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,680
in his presentation.

420
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,791
What we realized is like, you know,

421
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,360
that the team started seeing
that kind of efficiency

422
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,183
as we started transforming
to the target state.

423
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,050
The results that we
achieved as part of that

424
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,230
were like kind of, you know,
the most important thing

425
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,514
for me was to improve the resiliency

426
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:12,270
and the uptime availability.

427
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,270
With using EKS containers across multiple

428
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,910
availability zones, it
has helped us actually

429
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,380
to kind of have a better uptime

430
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,549
and improve on the
performance bottlenecks.

431
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:30,270
As a matter of fact, as
we started doing that,

432
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,740
we realized that we were running into

433
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,740
a little bit of issues on
moving it into GovCloud.

434
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,895
We successfully kind of overcame that

435
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:39,060
and deployed it into GovCloud,

436
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,598
which was a huge step forward for us.

437
00:20:41,598 --> 00:20:45,998
The four times faster piece,
the application transformation,

438
00:20:45,998 --> 00:20:49,290
previously the team gave me an estimate

439
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,940
of almost like, per DMV we were looking

440
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,950
at close to six months.

441
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,740
So overall to transform
the entire application,

442
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,840
we were looking at orders of magnitude

443
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,433
of like two to three years.

444
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,288
I'm sure every one of you here knows

445
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:07,500
that we don't have that kind of luxury,

446
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,390
'cause technology keeps changing

447
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,430
and we need to cater to
the needs of our customers

448
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,050
on a continuous basis.

449
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,599
So with AWS Transform,
it actually helped us

450
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:20,370
complete the transformation
of the application layer

451
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,270
in less than like kind of
quarter of that timeframe.

452
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,730
So that's a huge thing for
us, because kind of, you know,

453
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,490
the longer we sit in the older platform,

454
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,590
it not only is increasing my costs,

455
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,740
it's also like kind of
keeping up the security holds

456
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,863
on a continuous basis
that we need to deal with.

457
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,670
The reduced total cost of ownership.

458
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,628
We started realizing that we're gonna get

459
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:47,853
about like at least 30% in
terms of cost reduction.

460
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,020
If we had to provision those
extra resources previously,

461
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,570
now with the auto-scaling properties

462
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,030
that I can kind of set efficiently,

463
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,360
we're able to actually
recognize that 30% savings

464
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,560
in terms of the dollars
that we're spending.

465
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,360
The modern deployment
practices like being able

466
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,230
to kind of go to the
CICD pipeline efficiently

467
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,584
that was lacking previously,
now we're able to reduce that

468
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:17,970
by 35% by reaching the time...

469
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,960
The time taken is reduced by 35%.

470
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,320
And more importantly, security.

471
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,770
I'm sure all of you kind
of have gone through

472
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,450
some sort of a security nightmare

473
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,450
as you're kind of building
your applications.

474
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:38,430
With .NET 8.0, we can leverage
the newer security features

475
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,840
that .NET 8.0 offers, particularly
migrating our application

476
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,030
from a 32-bit to 64-bit and be able

477
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,490
to kind of take care of all those CVEs

478
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,610
that we had to deal with
previously proactively

479
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,400
using the .NET 8.0
Framework kind of, you know,

480
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,263
is a huge win for us.

481
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:02,270
So this is a reaction from our director

482
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,080
of software engineering.

483
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,490
He had to deal with this
nightmare application for years,

484
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,160
and this is verbatim what he said.

485
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,160
As we kind of leveraged AWS Transform,

486
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,630
it helped us speed up
the full transformation

487
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,630
by four times and more
efficiently host the software

488
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,450
on a Linux versus a Windows server.

489
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,730
What does it mean for us
from a business standpoint

490
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,330
is that now I can actually
take this application

491
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,110
and kind of go to a true
software-as-a-service model,

492
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,693
which we could not do previously.

493
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,760
That's kind of in a nutshell
what we have been through

494
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,660
as an AWS Transform partner
and Cloudhedge partner,

495
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,940
and Rahul is gonna take us through

496
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,539
how he helped us
transform our application.

497
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:55,655
- Thank you.

498
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:58,405
(crowd clapping)

499
00:24:02,055 --> 00:24:02,903
Plenty of time, yeah.

500
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,320
All right, let's see how
that magic actually happens,

501
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,930
how the AWS Transform works.

502
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,030
It actually is pretty simple.

503
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,910
So it goes through three steps.

504
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,300
So first is analysis
followed by transformation

505
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,413
and then validation.

506
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:31,250
So as part of analysis, a
.NET agent is essentially

507
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,460
a deep domain expert and its intelligence

508
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,850
is built on top of Amazon bedrock models

509
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:39,933
that we have trained.

510
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,523
It enables code integration from GitHub,

511
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:49,740
Bitbucket, GitLab, and a
few more other sources,

512
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,753
wherever your code resides today.

513
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,580
The way analysis works is
it starts with at first

514
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,610
identifying the .NET
version of the project

515
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,930
that you have out there.

516
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,760
It determines what are
different project types

517
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:09,680
that are there and then
it looks at the code

518
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,830
and the dependencies
between different projects

519
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,170
and between different repositories

520
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,243
that you have provided it to analyze.

521
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,340
So once the analysis completes,

522
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,906
it gives you a pre-transformation
analysis report,

523
00:25:27,906 --> 00:25:32,820
and using that report, you can look at

524
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,651
what are the different things
that will be transformed

525
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:38,220
during the whole process?

526
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,050
And you can look at the complexity as well

527
00:25:42,815 --> 00:25:46,143
for different projects that
are out there in your solution.

528
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,410
So based on the codebase dependencies

529
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,800
and the business
objectives that you state,

530
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,703
it delivers you a tailored
transformation plan.

531
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,080
So basically that's where you jump

532
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,150
into the transformation phase.

533
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,570
So this transformation
plan you can actually edit.

534
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,630
So it gives you some default plan.

535
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,113
You can add on top of
it what you want to do,

536
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,270
literally in plain English language.

537
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,126
It's LLM behind the
scenes, which understands

538
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:28,030
what needs to be done and it
transforms the code for you.

539
00:26:29,307 --> 00:26:32,400
The transformation can handle
different project types.

540
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,850
It can handle your WCF
projects, Web API projects,

541
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,463
console applications, test projects,

542
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:44,810
and it basically offers you to put

543
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:48,766
some repository level configuration,

544
00:26:48,766 --> 00:26:53,766
and you can provide third party
packages dependency as well

545
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,550
for the whole transformation to work

546
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,783
and complete eventually.

547
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,810
So in this transformation process,

548
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,730
it first transforms the code.

549
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,560
It tries to build it.

550
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,050
If it doesn't build, it tries to fix it,

551
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,690
and that keeps on happening
over and over again

552
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,860
in a loop behind the scenes
till you have a project

553
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,233
where, you know, it cannot no more do

554
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:21,093
any other thing out there
using AI at that moment.

555
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,780
So once that transformation completes,

556
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,930
it generates a transformation
report for you.

557
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,840
So in that transformation
report, it shows you

558
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,183
what all things have been transformed,

559
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,243
why things have been transformed,

560
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,120
and it gives you another
report, which is NextSteps.md,

561
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,570
basically a markdown file which tells you

562
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:49,950
what's actually not
transformed and it gives you

563
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,320
certain steps on how you can, you know,

564
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,480
further transform it.

565
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,390
Or another thing that you can do

566
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,319
is you can again run
the whole transformation

567
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,810
based on the knowledge
that you have right now.

568
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,639
Let's say, you know, some
dependency injection failed

569
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:09,060
that you have implemented.

570
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,830
Next time when you are
again running the Transform,

571
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,830
in your transformation steps, you can add

572
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,610
a custom step out there to
run a dependency injection

573
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,810
in a certain way so that
this time, you know,

574
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,354
that part of the project
is also transformed,

575
00:28:28,354 --> 00:28:30,060
and you can keep doing
that over and over again

576
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,610
however many times you want to.

577
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,953
So once the transformation completes,

578
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,470
it basically generates a new
branch where all the code is

579
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,965
and you can merge it into
your production branch.

580
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:47,460
So as part of that transformation,
you know, when it ends,

581
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,170
it generates all that reports.

582
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:54,170
The next step as of this
journey is validation.

583
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,440
So AWS Transform, it automatically runs

584
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,240
your unit tests as well and it tells you

585
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,160
based on those unit tests as well

586
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,440
how much it succeeded, what's failed,

587
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,820
and it tries to fix that as well

588
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,313
as part of your whole
transformation plan itself,

589
00:29:13,005 --> 00:29:16,190
or whatever it can.

590
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,340
It also generates Linux
readiness report for you

591
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,940
which you can review and
see if there are further

592
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,747
changes needed in the code at that time.

593
00:29:27,747 --> 00:29:30,270
So that is another thing
that you can validate.

594
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,660
It generates a natural
language transformation summary

595
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,260
for you, which is again, you
know, a very detailed summary

596
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,380
of all the changes that are there,

597
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,660
all the build issues
that it has identified

598
00:29:44,935 --> 00:29:47,700
for you to review, and
then again, you know,

599
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,113
you can further optimize.

600
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,510
So once the transformation completes,

601
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,430
it also generates an email for you.

602
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,460
So what basically that means is let's say

603
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,730
you start a transformation
and it tells you, you know,

604
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,040
it's gonna take three hours, let's say.

605
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,980
You don't have to sit
in front of your system.

606
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,813
You can leave it.

607
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:10,863
Once you get the email,
you can work on it.

608
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,010
So it basically is headless,

609
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,200
so behind-the-scene
transformation happens.

610
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,990
You don't have to, you
know, keep your screen open

611
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,463
or keep the project open.

612
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:23,970
It happens for you and you
can load that transformation

613
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,170
once you get that email.

614
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:31,477
Let's quickly look at a
demo out there for the same.

615
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,300
So we have two experiences here.

616
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,023
So first experience is
actually in the console,

617
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:46,497
and in the web console, when
you start AWS Transform,

618
00:30:48,606 --> 00:30:51,930
you can create a job
there for transformation.

619
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,360
And the way to create a job,
obviously you can click on

620
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,484
Create job, but then at the same time

621
00:30:57,484 --> 00:30:59,609
you can chat with AWS Transform

622
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,433
to create some of these jobs for you.

623
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,550
So here you can either chat with it

624
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,400
or you can click on the guided experience.

625
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,996
So let's select Windows
Modernization, because .NET

626
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:17,846
is part of that, and then you
select .NET transformation.

627
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,920
So once you select what kind of job it is,

628
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,076
you need to supply it the code.

629
00:31:26,076 --> 00:31:26,909
How do you do that?

630
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:30,270
So either you can upload
it through an S3 bucket

631
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:34,209
or you can use AWS CodeConnections.

632
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:35,310
So the way AWS CodeConnection works

633
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,520
is there's a separate,
on AWS console itself,

634
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:43,503
you can go and configure your
GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket.

635
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,010
You can supply the credentials there.

636
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,630
It is going to integrate there.

637
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,960
And here in the web console,

638
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,543
you provide details about that connector.

639
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,320
So once that connector is configured,

640
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,650
AWS Transform is able to pull
all different repositories

641
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:09,033
that are out there in
your GitHub or GitLab,

642
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,859
whichever source-code
repository you're using.

643
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:16,740
So all these repositories are pulled,

644
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,130
and then you can select
the specific repositories

645
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,990
that you want to modernize.

646
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,210
The way to do it is, let's say, you know,

647
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:29,210
I want to modernize this
one, Bob's Used Bookstore,

648
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,390
and then I know there's
a dependent repository

649
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,710
API test there.

650
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,080
So I would select both those repositories

651
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,080
so that when transformation
happens, it is able

652
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,230
to find those correlations
between repositories

653
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:46,953
and is able to transform
the whole codebase better.

654
00:32:51,584 --> 00:32:54,060
So once you have supplied
these repositories,

655
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,800
there is another kind of dependency,

656
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,620
which is NuGet packages.

657
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,500
So these NuGet packages, you can either

658
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,570
supply those private NuGet packages

659
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,860
through Azure Artifact
store or you can actually

660
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,860
upload these packages through
the web console itself.

661
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,410
So this is, you know, one of
the most requested feature

662
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,860
that we had when we
had our product in beta

663
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,380
where a lot of customers,
they had these private

664
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,840
NuGet packages and they
wanted to, you know,

665
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,610
ensure when they're transforming,

666
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,210
those dependencies are resolved,

667
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,550
and now we are able to do that.

668
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,810
So once we have done that, you can review

669
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,893
all the dependent repositories
are configured correctly,

670
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:45,120
you can ensure all the dependent packages

671
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,670
are configured correctly, and then you can

672
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,070
approve and start that transformation.

673
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,550
So when the transformation
starts, it generates

674
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,760
a lot of logs for you, and
you can see all of that.

675
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,090
It is pretty verbose and shows you

676
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,040
all the things that it is doing.

677
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,460
You can, again, you know, you
have an option to sit there

678
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,890
or you can close it and come back

679
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,293
and start working on the
transformation again.

680
00:34:13,475 --> 00:34:17,900
So here, you know, when I was
doing this transformation,

681
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,210
here you can see one of
the projects succeeded

682
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,923
and one of the projects failed.

683
00:34:26,446 --> 00:34:27,780
So the repositories which succeeded,

684
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,300
it shows what all is succeeded,

685
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,680
and then whatever is
failed, you can actually

686
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:38,580
talk to the console
itself in natural language

687
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,270
and it can tell you what
all things you can do.

688
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:46,770
It also generates a next-steps
markdown file for you,

689
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,508
which will have all
that information for you

690
00:34:49,508 --> 00:34:51,780
which you can, you know, again use

691
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,880
and again run the transformation

692
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,100
or fix a few things and
run the transformation.

693
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,460
Or you can use, if,
you know, AWS Transform

694
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,970
is not able to transform
after a certain point,

695
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:07,920
you can use other code
companions like Kiro

696
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,553
to continue the work of
transformation and complete it.

697
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,300
So this was our web console experience.

698
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,220
We have another experience, which is in

699
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,830
the Visual Studio IDE.

700
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,050
So as a .NET developer,
this is the default IDE

701
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:31,890
that all .NET developers use.

702
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:36,870
And you can install AWS
Toolkit with Visual Studio 2022

703
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:41,247
or Visual Studio 2026
and you'll get option

704
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,400
to transform there.

705
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,673
So here, you know, I'm starting
with a project out there,

706
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,820
which is on .NET Framework 4.8,

707
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,880
and I've installed AWS Toolkit out there.

708
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,770
So before I can start the transformation,

709
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:03,770
I need to configure AWS Toolkit
for AWS Transform to work.

710
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,110
So for that I can again go in

711
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:10,740
and the way, you know, I had set it up

712
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,807
with web earlier using
IAM Identity Center,

713
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,490
same thing you need to do here.

714
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,400
You basically give it
Identity Center credentials,

715
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,400
it is all set up, and then you
can start the transformation.

716
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:26,910
To start the transformation,
you can either put a solution

717
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,013
or you can put a project.

718
00:36:29,013 --> 00:36:30,540
So you can right click on
your solution, let's say,

719
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,083
and then you just say, you
know, start the transform.

720
00:36:36,013 --> 00:36:38,370
So when you do that, it basically

721
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,783
gives you two options here.

722
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:42,630
So you can see the workspace here,

723
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,760
and the second option that you see here

724
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,440
is what's the version you want to get to?

725
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,450
So currently we support .NET 8.0.

726
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,920
We also support .NET 10.0.

727
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,603
We support .NET Standard as
well as the target framework.

728
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,019
So how does workspace help?

729
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:04,110
So these workspaces that are out there,

730
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,449
let's say you have a team
of developers out there

731
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:09,240
and they all eventually want to work

732
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,003
on certain thing in the transform process.

733
00:37:13,654 --> 00:37:16,830
So every transformation job that runs,

734
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,080
it runs in a workspace and that workspace

735
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,150
can be shared with multiple people

736
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,000
and multiple people can then
work on that transformation.

737
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:30,723
So again, you know, when
the transformation starts,

738
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,840
it starts with analysis
and it analyzes everything,

739
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,590
and at the end of analysis, it generates

740
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,793
an assessment report.

741
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,900
So you can, again, it's
the same kind of report

742
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,970
that you saw earlier with the web.

743
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:51,540
So you can look at this
report on complexity

744
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,133
of this transformation.

745
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,380
You know, a lot of times
it helps with estimation,

746
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,900
like when you're estimating how much time

747
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,720
it's gonna take to eventually, you know,

748
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,730
do the rest of the work that will be left.

749
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:10,470
So it's always helpful to look at all this

750
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,670
initial assessment
report that is out there.

751
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:19,260
And once your transformation completes,

752
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,193
it auto-generates a report for you,

753
00:38:22,193 --> 00:38:23,610
which is the whole transformation report

754
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,790
on what has changed in
your transformation,

755
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,280
why it has changed in your transformation.

756
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,333
And it also generates a
next-steps file for you,

757
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,540
which contains all the things
about if something has failed,

758
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,363
what are the steps that
you can take to fix them?

759
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,600
Or it it might have,
you know, certain things

760
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,170
where it might not be
able to suggest to you

761
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,060
what you need to change,
but then you still need

762
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,960
to take some action.

763
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,663
So you can analyze them, and then again,

764
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,510
change your transformation plan,

765
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,070
run that transformation again,

766
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,473
and you can keep on
doing that incrementally.

767
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:11,610
So once you have completed
the whole transformation,

768
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,193
at that time, all the
files that are out there,

769
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,350
you can start merging.

770
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,630
You can either, you know,
look at them one by one,

771
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:22,803
compare them and then pull
them onto your system.

772
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,880
You can say click on save
changes for a particular file

773
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,910
and it will basically merge out there.

774
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,890
Or you can select everything, select all,

775
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:36,300
and do a single much easier option,

776
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,670
but then you can still
review each and every file

777
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,343
that is out there and what is changing.

778
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,970
And at the end of the transformation,

779
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:47,763
you can see newer framework.

780
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:50,565
That's our goal.

781
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:52,763
With that,

782
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:03,690
let's move to and see the full
stack Windows transformation,

783
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,690
the new features that we
have released, how they work.

784
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,733
I'll invite PM for the product.

785
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:14,190
- Okay, thank you, Rahul,
and as well as Srinivas

786
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,964
for that walkthrough.

787
00:40:15,964 --> 00:40:17,310
(crowd clapping)

788
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:20,250
So what we have seen is now
for the .NET side, right?

789
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,710
Like so the .NET transformation, you know,

790
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,767
for how we are moving
customers from .NET framework

791
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:27,480
to .NET 8.0 or .NET 10.0.

792
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,050
Now, if you look at it
from a customer-objective

793
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:31,950
point of view, right?

794
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,691
Like if you wanna migrate
your legacy applications,

795
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:38,280
think of it as a three-layered cake.

796
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,230
We are now supporting web forms to Blazor

797
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,450
from the UI framework point of view.

798
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,190
We are supporting from the middle tier

799
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,410
for .NET Framework to .NET 8.0,

800
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,040
but that alone doesn't help
them complete the whole story.

801
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,040
So what we have launched today in GA

802
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,440
is a full-stack modernization agent.

803
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,900
So now we are able to
handle .NET Framework

804
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,110
to cross platform, web forms to Blazor,

805
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,900
but more importantly
now we are supporting,

806
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,990
if you have SQL Server, we are using

807
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:11,010
the same agentic experience
to actually transform them

808
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:15,480
into Aurora PostgreSQL Server as well.

809
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,720
So the main advantage of
this is that like customers

810
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,060
who have all of these legacy applications,

811
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,170
they can use the same mechanisms
they are used to for .NET

812
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:28,233
to start modernizing
their SQL servers as well.

813
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,970
And after that, once you have transformed

814
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:36,150
your entire application
stack, we are supporting

815
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:39,000
deploying those into a sandbox environment

816
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,427
so you can validate
the whole thing, right?

817
00:41:41,427 --> 00:41:43,890
And this is one of the
big pieces of feedback

818
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,330
that we have gotten from customers

819
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,660
is I wanna be able to, you know,
like take this application,

820
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,600
test it that it's working
fine, and now that we have

821
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,800
full-stack capability of transformation,

822
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,200
you can actually put it in an environment

823
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,790
and test the functionality.

824
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:03,120
This is gonna help accelerate customers

825
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,327
modernizing into the newer .NET 8.0,

826
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:08,853
.NET 10.0 kind of level.

827
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,063
And one final piece is
that this whole service

828
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:16,680
is completely free for you to use, right?

829
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,650
Like this whole experience
in AWS Transform

830
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:23,520
for the Windows ecosystem
is free to use today.

831
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,130
And so yeah, we are
definitely looking forward

832
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,590
to seeing more use cases
that's coming, you know,

833
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:32,213
you can build and how we can
assist you on this process.

834
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,670
So the same sequence that
we had for .NET, right?

835
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,980
Like we have exactly a
similar flow here as well.

836
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,238
We are gonna do an analysis
and then we are gonna be like

837
00:42:44,238 --> 00:42:47,340
identifying the database
schemas, the tables,

838
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,010
the views, and the indexes that you have,

839
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,863
and then we are gonna start the migrating,

840
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:57,330
like those schemas and all
the database-related items,

841
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:00,750
but more importantly
we are gonna also make

842
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,600
corresponding changes in the
application code as well.

843
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,760
So that means now you do
not actually have to go

844
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,500
make changes to the application.

845
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,750
So we identify the dependencies

846
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:13,050
between your .NET applications
and your SQL Server

847
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,080
and we as we migrate to Postgre's target,

848
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,700
we will make the corresponding changes

849
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,900
in your application code.

850
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,260
So you get a fully transformed
stack as part of this,

851
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,480
and then we'll help
you validate and deploy

852
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,100
in a new environment.

853
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,990
So this is the functionality
we launched today

854
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,640
and I wanna make sure that like all of you

855
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,130
are able to at least get
a sneak peek at this.

856
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:37,020
There is a session that we
are hosting tomorrow at 1:30,

857
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,530
and we have that information
on this in the next slide,

858
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,810
and we would love to have you there

859
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,730
and, you know, understand
a little bit more

860
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:49,380
and see what you can build
and take it from here, okay?

861
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,230
Yeah, and the interactive
demo which Rahul showed,

862
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:55,080
you can actually get it from that QR code,

863
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,033
and more you can see from our website.

864
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,780
And the session that we
are talking about tomorrow,

865
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,940
the full-stack SQL modernization,

866
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,970
there is a builder session
that you can actually get it,

867
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,760
and also there is, you know,
like a breakout session

868
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,960
where we will be talking
about this as well.
