1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,380
- Yeah.
- Cool.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,393
- [Speaker 1] Break a leg.

3
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:06,000
- (sighs deeply) Hey, everybody.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Thank you for coming this afternoon.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,660
My name is Jason Levin.

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,750
I am the director of
partnerships for Luma AI.

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,750
And today, we are here to talk about

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,200
the path to multimodal
artificial intelligence.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,030
If that is not what
you're here to talk about,

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,580
then you are in the wrong room.

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,183
So,

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,382
language models like
Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude,

13
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:33,750
they are incredibly capable.

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,660
Most of us probably use
them every single day.

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,230
But they don't understand
the physical world.

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,660
They don't know how people move,

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,750
how objects interact, how light behaves.

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,960
And so if AGI is gonna
interact with the real world,

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,300
the place where we all live and breathe,

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,780
it needs to understand visual
and spatial intelligence,

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,000
not just linguistic intelligence.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,293
So humans, we think visually,
and AGI has to as well.

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,980
So at Luma,

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,910
our mission is to build multimodal AGI.

25
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,670
And we build video models because video

26
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,820
is the closest representation
of the real world

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,653
that we can teach to an AI model.

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,380
When we say "multimodal AGI,"

29
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,460
what we mean is models that
can generate, understand,

30
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,940
and ultimately operate
within the physical world,

31
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,280
from a product sitting on a shelf

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,010
to a character walking through a scene,

33
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,280
or even a robot navigating a home.

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,410
But building these models

35
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,650
requires enormous amounts of compute.

36
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,200
Thanks, that's where
AWS comes and helps out.

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,413
And it also requires
world-scale training data.

38
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:51,570
So that's why we are proud to announce

39
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,470
that we recently raised our
$900 million Series C round,

40
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,270
and this funding allows us

41
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,360
to train the next generation
of multimodal models,

42
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,050
models that truly
understand motion, physics,

43
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,660
spatial reasoning, and continuity,

44
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,970
because AGI is multimodal

45
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,893
and the training data, the
dataset, it's reality itself.

46
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:18,810
When a model can keep
a character consistent,

47
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,050
understand spatial depth,
simulate particle physics,

48
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,010
follow instructions, and
maintain continuity over time,

49
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,170
that's a form of world understanding.

50
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,810
This is the foundation of multimodal AGI.

51
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,660
That's why we created Ray3.

52
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,210
That's our state-of-the-art
video generation model.

53
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,290
Video isn't just images in motion.

54
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,222
Video encodes physics, cause and effect,

55
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:47,220
timing, behavior, camera
movement, and context.

56
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,310
And a system that can generate
and reason about video

57
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,390
is building an internal model
of how the real world works.

58
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,770
Ray3 is our most advanced
step towards that goal.

59
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,750
To walk you through the
model's capabilities,

60
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,233
text-to-video, image-to-video,
dynamic motion,

61
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:08,233
HDR and EXR output, keyframes,
reasoning, there's a ton,

62
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,070
I'm gonna hand things over
to our resident expert.

63
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,890
So please welcome Davicho Barona,

64
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,143
who will take you through Ray3 in-depth.

65
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,760
- Thank you, Jason, I appreciate that.

66
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,470
Thank you guys for being here.

67
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,000
Before I go too much further,

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,730
I really want to touch on
just a couple of the things

69
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,330
that make Ray3 really special
and that make it stand out

70
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,660
from all the other rest of
the video models out there.

71
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,020
Number one is the Ray3
reasoning model, and this is,

72
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,030
I'll touch on this a little
bit deeper in a minute,

73
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,050
but this is a model

74
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,220
that judges and refines its
own output in real time,

75
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,320
trying to match your instructions

76
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,380
without you even necessarily
looking after it.

77
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,210
And then the ability of Ray3
to export HDR and EXR files

78
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,260
directly out of Dream Machine
is also super special.

79
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,160
A lot of VFX teams out there
and compositing artists

80
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,970
and post-production teams rely
on this kind of file format,

81
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,330
and it's something that
stands out and stands apart

82
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,130
from all the other models out there.

83
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,970
And I want to touch on some
of the model's strengths.

84
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,260
These are sort of the bright spots,

85
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,010
some of the places where
we see Ray3 really shining

86
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,410
and really standing out here,

87
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,120
starting with physics simulations,

88
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,663
particles, fluids, explosions,

89
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:28,800
the way that Ray3 is able to deliver

90
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,730
really high motion fidelity
and really stable simulations,

91
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,150
natural flow of particles,
coherent fluids,

92
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,290
and really consistent and
punchy explosions on-screen.

93
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,200
Then moving to world motion,
understanding, exploration.

94
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,470
This is the way that Ray3 kind
of travels through the world,

95
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,110
and just showing really
strong spatial reasoning,

96
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,590
maintaining true depth,
perspective, seamless motion,

97
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,320
really stable sense of
scale, and just coherent

98
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,660
across all kinds of
different environments.

99
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,330
Then character anatomy, action, animation,

100
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,820
different art styles,
just the way that Ray3

101
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,370
is able to preserve anatomical accuracy,

102
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,370
expressive movement,
fluid action sequences,

103
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,250
keeping characters really
consistent, believable,

104
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,690
and just the really punchy

105
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,560
and exceptional performances on-screen.

106
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,510
To close-up details, lighting effects.

107
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,770
The way that Ray3 is able

108
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,170
to preserve those really fine details,

109
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,220
clear textures, surfaces,
all kinds of lighting,

110
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,320
handling reflections, glows, shadows,

111
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,790
all while staying really consistent

112
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,010
and true-to-life in that sense.

113
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,050
Here's a quick reel that
I want to show you guys.

114
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,730
This encompasses a lot of those points

115
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,590
that I just mentioned here.

116
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,699
Let's just watch this together.

117
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:42,449
(dramatic music)

118
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:47,198
(piano dings softly)

119
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:49,781
(air whooshes)

120
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:53,447
(piano dings softly)

121
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:55,973
(dramatic music crescendos)

122
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:59,639
(rhythmic drumbeats)

123
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,413
(piano dings softly)

124
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:07,279
(piano dings softly)

125
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,112
(thunder crashes)

126
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:13,938
(piano dings softly)

127
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:17,688
(dramatic music accelerates)

128
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:22,345
(piano dings softly)

129
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:26,331
(piano dings softly)

130
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:30,559
(piano dings softly)

131
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:35,839
(dramatic music continues)

132
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,448
(piano dings softly)

133
00:06:47,861 --> 00:06:50,694
(pulsating music)

134
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:54,900
And you actually just watched

135
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,730
a bunch of the different functions

136
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,170
of Dream Machine here in one.

137
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,570
You saw some image-to-video,
text-to-video,

138
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,310
some keyframe animations,

139
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,830
and even some of the sound
effects that you heard there,

140
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,710
I created directly in
Dream Machine as well.

141
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,530
Now I want to touch on
some of the new features

142
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,990
that Ray3 brings into play,

143
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,810
starting with the HDR and EXR outputs.

144
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,190
This is a huge step forward

145
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,560
and no other model does this natively.

146
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,490
And again, the way that it
exports HDR and EXR files

147
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,240
allows a lot of different
pipelines out there

148
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,230
to have a lot more
control over the output,

149
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,680
exporting anywhere from
10- to 16-bit EXR files

150
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,750
and allowing those compositing artists,

151
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,060
post-production folks, VFX artists,

152
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,370
to control those layers of color

153
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,970
unlike any standard video
generations out there.

154
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,380
Here, just a quick example here,

155
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,320
the raw flat HDR output
here on the bottom left,

156
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,153
and then just push

157
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:53,070
into a couple different
color space examples here,

158
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,650
in this case, like, the
day mood, night mood.

159
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,880
And this is by being able

160
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,250
to edit those different color layers,

161
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,660
which is not a standard feature

162
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,600
of any other video generator out there.

163
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,850
And then moving on to that reasoning model

164
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,530
that I alluded to before,

165
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,140
the way that it's able to reason its way

166
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,350
through your generation,
judging its own output,

167
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,030
refining its own output,

168
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,640
all by understanding your instructions

169
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,420
and try to accomplish
the best result possible

170
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,460
without you necessarily even being there.

171
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,210
It annotates on its own and
finally comes up with a result

172
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,090
that it feels fits your
instructions the best,

173
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,846
and then will upscale that,

174
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:34,770
allowing you to sort of be hands-off

175
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,493
and saving some credits
in your experimentation,

176
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:39,420
if you will.

177
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,290
From there, touching on the
visual annotation mode here,

178
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,260
something that's really, really
cool for creators to use,

179
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,300
supporting the ability for anybody

180
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,090
to just sketch or scribble
directly on-screen,

181
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,900
telling the model what elements
to move where, when, how.

182
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,880
And for example, onscreen as you can see,

183
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,090
directing that fish, "Go this
way," or as you saw before,

184
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,640
bringing in that UFO element from the top,

185
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,490
moving the cow up in a
certain direction, et cetera,

186
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,740
and that cat jumping from stone to stone,

187
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,920
all while you're literally
just onscreen annotating

188
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,703
with your mouse or your
Wacom pad, for example.

189
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,650
From there, another really
awesome feature of Ray3

190
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,860
is this draft mode.

191
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,270
And draft mode allows you

192
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,450
to create these low-res 360p previews

193
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,450
before actually committing
to a high-res upscale,

194
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,040
allowing you to kind of
stay in that creative mode

195
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,950
a lot more seamlessly and
conserving your credits

196
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,830
and being able to experiment
a whole lot faster

197
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,530
than with your standard 720 or 1080.

198
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,670
And then you can upscale into
those other resolution modes

199
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,173
within Dream Machine as well.

200
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,720
From here, touching quickly

201
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,240
on the compatible features of Ray3,

202
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,650
starting with image-to-video,

203
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,220
of course, turning static
visuals into cinematic motion.

204
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,590
Text-to-video, we all are
very familiar with this,

205
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,120
bringing your ideas to life

206
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,740
through your written instructions.

207
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,860
Modify Video, the ability
to transform videos

208
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,420
by either editing a start frame

209
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,640
or just with a simple prompt as well.

210
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,740
Extend, keyframes, and loop,

211
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,560
extend being the ability to
extend the length of your videos

212
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,060
by five seconds at a time,

213
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,210
either at the beginning or
at the end of the video;

214
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,290
keyframes, transitioning
from one frame to the other;

215
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,560
and then loop, being able
to seamlessly create,

216
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,760
or to create videos

217
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,793
that are seamless and
endless loops as well.

218
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,210
Just touching on that
image-to-video aspect here,

219
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,043
as you can see,

220
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:37,050
this was my original keyframe
image down here, left.

221
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,130
And then just looking
at some of the motion

222
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,837
that that keyframe is hinting at.

223
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:44,520
And the model is picking up on this.

224
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,410
I'm not using any prompt
when I'm creating this,

225
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,670
just feeding it the image

226
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,260
and letting the model do its thing.

227
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,180
And as you can see,
there's kind of this motion

228
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:56,790
that is inherently built into this image

229
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,730
that you can tell the
video is picking up on

230
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,120
where even those like,
particles on the sides

231
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,470
that are moving fast

232
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,810
and the beard and the hair

233
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,210
kind of moving really
gently in that breeze,

234
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,740
those lightning bolts showing

235
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,410
that delicate kind of
endings to them as well,

236
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,060
even down to those reflections

237
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,660
on that like, wet skin surface there.

238
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,890
Doing a great job here

239
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,070
with that image-to-video instruction only.

240
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,860
Then touching on the
text-to-video aspect of things,

241
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,500
here I'm using a really short prompt.

242
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm just controlling the details

243
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,770
that are really important to me,

244
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,290
like the shot type, macro close-up,

245
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,730
the subject, a rattlesnake,

246
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,890
in that moment where it's about to strike.

247
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,800
And I'm, all the other details

248
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,390
that are missing from my prompt,

249
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,990
I have more trust that an
advanced model like Ray3

250
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,850
is gonna come up with
those details on its own

251
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,190
in a way that's really pleasing to me.

252
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,860
And so in this case,
it's doing really well

253
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,680
with kind of super-short, direct prompt.

254
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,510
And then touching a little bit further

255
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,340
on that prompt adherence piece,

256
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,330
Ray3 is really improving those
instruction understanding,

257
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,210
and adapting to all kinds
of different prompt style,

258
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,860
different prompt lengths as well,

259
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,040
and just showing really accurate
results and being reliable

260
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,320
with all kinds of
different style of prompts,

261
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,020
whether it's that super-long,
story-style prompt

262
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,240
that maybe you get out of an LLM,

263
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,820
where it has all kinds of
color, very, very detailed,

264
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,920
it's doing great at those long prompts,

265
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,260
down to kind of a concise version of that

266
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,870
on the right top side over there,

267
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,030
where it's like the one
to three sentence prompt,

268
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,320
doing great there.

269
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,150
Over to the bottom left here,

270
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,460
that kind of laundry
list style of a prompt,

271
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,980
where you're just kind of
rattling off those keywords,

272
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,140
doing great with those
kinds of prompts as well.

273
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,120
And then over to that really short prompt

274
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,040
that you saw in action before.

275
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,620
I kind of tend to live
over on the right side,

276
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,550
between the one and three
sentence style prompt.

277
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,630
That's just kind of my preference.

278
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,640
But Ray3 doing great at understanding

279
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,550
all kinds of different
prompt styles as well.

280
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,790
Then touching on modified
video, a really cool feature.

281
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,860
Here, I'm just showing a side-by-side

282
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,180
of this basic Newton's cradle video here,

283
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,510
where, by just editing the start frame

284
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,490
or by giving it a basic prompt,

285
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,180
I'm able to edit that video
and isolate certain objects,

286
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,340
for example, those metal spheres,

287
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,040
changing them into something
completely different

288
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,773
very quickly and very efficiently here.

289
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,150
From here, I want to touch on
that keyframe interpolation,

290
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,180
that start and end frame animation,

291
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,260
where it's just doing great
at transforming these stills

292
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,180
into truly dynamic sequences

293
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,110
and generating these really
smooth, natural transitions.

294
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,050
And it just feels super
seamless and cinematic,

295
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,210
and it feels really natural.

296
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,250
And as you can see down
here on the bottom left,

297
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,290
my start frame and my end frame,

298
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,480
and then these interpolation markers

299
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,100
that I'm kind of testing against,

300
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,990
starting with that seamless scale shift.

301
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,260
As you can see, that start
frame is a medium shot

302
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,240
and the end frame is a closeup shot,

303
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,520
and it's going from one to
the other really seamlessly

304
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,353
making it seem

305
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:06,450
like it's truly a single
shot from the beginning.

306
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,250
Then that material fidelity,

307
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,630
going from these sort of
hard edges in his armor,

308
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,200
to this like translucent,
very like ethereal look

309
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,300
in that closeup and doing
it really naturally,

310
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,300
really feels like it was
like this in a single shot.

311
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,990
The lighting continuity,

312
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,840
again, not over-brightening,
not darkening,

313
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,270
just keeping it really true to
my original instruction here

314
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:33,780
in these keyframes.

315
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,140
The cinematic flow, again, it
feels like it's a single shot.

316
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,790
And even with that camera movement

317
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,370
as it zooms in to that closeup shot,

318
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,740
it kind of even jolts back a little bit,

319
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,220
making it seem like it's
truly part of a single shot.

320
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,240
The structural coherent,

321
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,670
nothing is really falling apart here.

322
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,680
All the lines, all the
different elements here

323
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,480
are staying together really well.

324
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,160
And then the color harmony,

325
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,000
I did pick two frames that
are sort of similar in color.

326
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,050
But I just want to showcase

327
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,610
how it doesn't deviate from that.

328
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,760
It truly holds true to the color

329
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,240
that came with those keyframes.

330
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,850
Then touching on advanced style adherence

331
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,190
and the way that Ray3 is able to excel

332
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,320
at this image-to-video feature,

333
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,810
preserving that original
keyframe look and feel,

334
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,660
the vibe that comes built
within that keyframe,

335
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,520
and just doing it really well

336
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,225
across all kinds of different motion,

337
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,170
across all kinds of
different styles as well.

338
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,690
And then putting it up against
these aesthetic markers here,

339
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,220
just to point some of these out,

340
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,370
the lighting, again, not
brightening it, not darkening it,

341
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,700
just staying really true
to that original keyframe.

342
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,920
The camera effects, that
shallow depth of field.

343
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Even as the camera slightly
zooms in on his face,

344
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,850
you can still see that that
focal plane is staying true

345
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,010
according to that original keyframe,

346
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,260
and the bouquet lighting in the background

347
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,060
looks really exactly the same

348
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,880
as what the instruction told it to.

349
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,740
The film grain and that texture

350
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,800
looks really, really
accurate to that keyframe.

351
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,120
It's not over-sharpening it,

352
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,160
it's not making it look very AI-ish,

353
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,410
it's not making it look
too kind of Photoshoppy.

354
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,230
It's really keeping true
to that original keyframe.

355
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,980
The moody atmosphere, really
reading this keyframe.

356
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,600
And I'm not using a prompt here either.

357
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,320
This is just image-to-video
without any reinforcing prompt.

358
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,960
And it's picking up on
that kind of like intensity

359
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,640
that's built into that keyframe

360
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,590
and doing a great job translating that,

361
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,990
not changing that too much at all.

362
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,950
The color palette,

363
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,500
also something really
important in this case,

364
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,840
where you can see those
blacks are very muted,

365
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,400
the highlights are also muted,

366
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,080
and here it's staying true to that.

367
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,340
It's not darkening those,

368
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,080
it's not making it look like something

369
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,170
other than what that
keyframe is telling it to.

370
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,220
The surface details,

371
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,620
those droplets of sweat maybe on his face,

372
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,180
the raindrops in the background,

373
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,550
even down to those
individual hairs as well,

374
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,650
everything is staying really intact.

375
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,587
The retro aesthetic, I'm a huge fan

376
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:57,180
of like old-school kung fu movies,

377
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,590
and so I generated this keyframe

378
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,030
to sort of test against that.

379
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,350
Holding up really well.

380
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,140
It truly looks like this
was still shot on film.

381
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,000
It's got that true 1970s kind of look here

382
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,510
and I absolutely love the way

383
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,540
that it holds true to that input.

384
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,020
And here, talking about
the video extend feature.

385
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,780
Before I play this video,
I just want to point out

386
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,090
that this original keyframe that I used,

387
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,730
you can see that that warrior is standing,

388
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,340
already standing at the top of that cliff.

389
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,860
But as you look at this
starting frame here,

390
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,240
he's actually climbing up.

391
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,350
And I'm just trying to point out

392
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,960
that you can extend before or after,

393
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,900
at the tail or at the head of the video.

394
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,670
And as I play this, just take a look

395
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,940
at how smoothly and how fun
this sequence can really be

396
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,300
as he sort of flips off that
cliff, turns into this eagle,

397
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,290
and then goes across that valley
back over to this mountain.

398
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,300
He continues to climb up this hill

399
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,120
and then gets picked
up by the snow leopard,

400
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,840
apexes this hill, and then
it completely switches over

401
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,645
to a whole new scene,
seamlessly going down

402
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:05,400
and kind of immersing you
into a whole other scene here.

403
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,340
And for this video, I made this in a day.

404
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,170
Mind you, I'm not a VFX artist.

405
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,430
And it took me about 90 different videos

406
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,070
to kind of put it together in
a way that I really liked it.

407
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,530
And that translated to about 90 bucks.

408
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,110
There is no way that I
could do this in a day

409
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,400
with any traditional tools,

410
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,090
and certainly not with
a $90 budget either.

411
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,870
And then finally, touching
on that video loop aspect,

412
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,540
starting with this keyframe
down on the left here,

413
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,390
I'm creating a seamless looping animation

414
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,280
that really, you cannot tell

415
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,110
where it starts or where it begins.

416
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,090
It's just taking you through this journey

417
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,470
without even knowing that
this is actually looping.

418
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,180
I was a GIF animator, like
close to 10 years ago now,

419
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,830
and I would've absolutely killed

420
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,270
to have this kind of control

421
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,880
and these kind of tools back then.

422
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,330
So all of that, I will
switch it back to Jason.

423
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,250
But just to give you kind of an insight

424
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,260
into all the different features

425
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,753
and all the different
capabilities of Ray3.

426
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,160
- Thank you very much, David.

427
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,690
- You bet.

428
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,554
- So,

429
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:15,480
now that you've seen

430
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,090
what happens behind the scenes with Ray3,

431
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,980
let's take a look at what it's capable of

432
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,350
in the hands of professional
technical artists.

433
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,540
We have a a short sizzle video here

434
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,380
so that you can kind of see

435
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,393
what the range looks like on Ray3.

436
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:30,593
- [Film Narrator] When
you close your eyes,

437
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,403
what do you see?

438
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,183
When we talk about reality,

439
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,283
how do you know what is real?

440
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:48,400
Or what is simply

441
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:50,786
your imagination?

442
00:19:50,786 --> 00:19:55,786
Imagination? Imagination? Imagination?

443
00:19:58,472 --> 00:20:02,139
(intense music crescendos)

444
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,256
Now, open your eyes.

445
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:11,756
(soaring adventure music)

446
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:20,964
(soaring adventure music intensifies)

447
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:28,140
(climactic musical beat)

448
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,280
- So for enterprises, this
isn't theoretical anymore.

449
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,930
This is real and in-market,

450
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,540
and video generation
is the first real step

451
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,550
towards multimodal AGI.

452
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,320
It's already transforming

453
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,220
how companies create product
videos, campaign assets,

454
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,550
cinematic scenes, and
world-scale environments.

455
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,350
So let me show you what this looks like

456
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,270
across the industries that we serve.

457
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,420
We're gonna go through
some cool use cases.

458
00:20:55,051 --> 00:20:57,420
Across every brand that we work with,

459
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,220
we hear the same thing:

460
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,853
It's that content demand has
outpaced human production.

461
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,700
Video production still costs

462
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,310
thousands of dollars per finished minute,

463
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,980
social platforms keep
increasing the pressure,

464
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,660
and two-thirds of major brands

465
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,961
have already rebuilt
their production pipelines

466
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:17,490
in just the last four years.

467
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,300
Models that understand the
world visually and physically

468
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,460
unlock a path to producing content

469
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,223
at the speed that modern
media requires of us.

470
00:21:28,157 --> 00:21:32,310
People now expect content
that speaks directly to them,

471
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:36,480
their tastes, their culture, their region,

472
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,620
but brands need 10 times more
video assets per campaign

473
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,305
to deliver that level of personalization.

474
00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:44,880
They simply can't keep up.

475
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,310
You can't build teams
fast enough for this.

476
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,430
So this is where generative
video goes from nice to have

477
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,143
to existential advantage.

478
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,640
And one of the first questions
that we get from enterprises

479
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,640
is ownership, copyright, and data safety.

480
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,990
So we built Luma Enterprise
around these three guarantees:

481
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,760
Protected inputs and outputs,

482
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,280
your data sits in a walled garden;

483
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,950
full commercial ownership
of everything you produce;

484
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,050
and indemnification on what you produce.

485
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,553
Luma has your back legally.

486
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,380
And Enterprise is produced
with Luma in two key ways.

487
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,050
As we've already touched
on, there's Dream Machine,

488
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,290
which is our web and iOS SaaS platform.

489
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,180
And you can access all of our AI models

490
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,320
through that platform.

491
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,530
And then you can also access
each of our models such as Ray3

492
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,403
through direct integration by
API for high-volume pipelines.

493
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:37,980
So let's start

494
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,110
with one of the most
immediate areas of impact,

495
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,660
consumer packaged goods and e-commerce,

496
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,510
near and dear to my heart personally.

497
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,940
So creative teams tell us

498
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,980
that the hardest part isn't the finals,

499
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,740
it's exploring enough ideas quickly.

500
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,100
And Ray3 lets you generate
dozens of directions,

501
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,510
refine, remix, and then produce
fully realized video assets

502
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,100
from those explorations.

503
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,360
As you can see here,

504
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,890
you know, we've got this same hoodie

505
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,600
across a bunch of different models,

506
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,840
in different scenes, different
backgrounds, different poses,

507
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,570
all generated with AI in
a fraction of the time.

508
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,180
This would typically require
multiple photo shoots.

509
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,030
It would be a very expensive process.

510
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,900
With one product photo,

511
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,050
brands can instantly generate
product lifestyle photos.

512
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,790
So something that used to require a shoot,

513
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,040
location, lighting, and a full crew

514
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,650
can now be done sitting at your laptop,

515
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,633
any time of day, anyplace.

516
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,020
We're also able to reframe videos.

517
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,200
So every platform requires
different aspect ratios:

518
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,261
TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn,
YouTube, YouTube Shorts.

519
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,720
For content teams,

520
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,150
this is a big burden and a big bottleneck.

521
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,700
So Ray3 lets you reframe a video

522
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,440
to any aspect ratio you want.

523
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,920
It will maintain composition,
lighting, shot intent,

524
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,810
while adapting to 9:16, 16:9,
4 by 3, and plenty of others.

525
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,730
And some of the cool things about it are

526
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,910
it will dynamically
outpaint the missing content

527
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,340
based off of the context of the video,

528
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,720
or you can give it a text prompt

529
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,910
and tell it what you would
like in the missing space.

530
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,290
Something else that's cool that you can do

531
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,110
is you can drag the subject of the shot

532
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,850
into different parts of the frame

533
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,650
so that you can change what the subject is

534
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,090
or change how it's positioned.

535
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,310
So if you want to go
from a center frame shot

536
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,740
and then turn it into a
Quentin Tarantino-style,

537
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,300
you know, one-third video shot

538
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,340
where you've got three people in frame,

539
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,810
or for marketing teams,

540
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,880
if you want to free up
some space in that shot

541
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,070
to put marketing language superimposed,

542
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,883
it allows you to do that as
well, which is really powerful.

543
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,340
From a single product shot,

544
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,070
we can produce multiple
hero angles, macro shots,

545
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,313
motion passes, and product
demos, as you can see here.

546
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,630
This compresses days of studio workflow

547
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,193
into literally minutes.

548
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,060
We can also reuse old
product shots as new assets.

549
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,940
This is huge for brands
with large archives.

550
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,850
Old photography becomes new campaign video

551
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,773
without any reshoots required.

552
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:26,130
Now let's talk about PDP.

553
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,840
For those that aren't
in the e-commerce space,

554
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,820
this is product display pages.

555
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,840
So PDP video lifts conversion rates.

556
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,320
Any brand in the room that
handles e-commerce volume knows

557
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,080
that product videos see a
click-through and conversion boost

558
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,670
over still images.

559
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,070
Ray3 creates seamless motion loops

560
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,260
from keyframe images of your products

561
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,960
so brands can enhance every SKU page

562
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,360
without needing new footage.

563
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,900
That's an immediate and easy
revenue bump for brands.

564
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,910
Large brands spend millions of dollars

565
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,390
on product video shoots,
and SMBs can't afford

566
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,023
to turn their entire product
catalog into videos, until now.

567
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,040
So here's a cool example

568
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,440
where, rather than
animating the whole video,

569
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,640
we've just told the model

570
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,530
we want to animate the
ocean in the background,

571
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,750
keep everything in the foreground static.

572
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,090
No problem, it can keep
the foreground static.

573
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,790
We've just added a little
bit of life to this image

574
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,610
for a product page to
increase our conversion rate.

575
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,930
That translates immediately

576
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,673
to increased bottom line revenue.

577
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,650
These apparel examples were created

578
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,690
from a single still frame each.

579
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,850
And these examples are one-shot examples.

580
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:36,960
These are not cherry-picked.

581
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,510
This is the very first
generation out of the model.

582
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,480
It adds natural body
mechanics, fabric motion,

583
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,670
camera drift and depth cues,

584
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,730
all while maintaining
brand-consistent lighting and color.

585
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,110
When people shop for clothing,

586
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,670
they want to see how the fabric moves,

587
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,410
how it drapes on a human body,

588
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,630
how it's going to look on a real person.

589
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,453
And this allows us to
simulate that really easily.

590
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,500
We can also do fast ad variants.

591
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,470
Performance marketing teams love this.

592
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:18,150
One product, many environments,
many styles, many moods,

593
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,070
each generating new creative

594
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,563
for A/B testing at a massive scale.

595
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,320
We can do demographic-specific
assets as well.

596
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,050
Localization is no longer a bottleneck.

597
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,540
Ray3 generates culturally-specific scenes

598
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,910
for different regions, different holidays,

599
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:42,090
different seasons,
without any new reshoots.

600
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,160
This is crucial for global brands

601
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,510
who need to distribute assets

602
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,973
across global market
segments very quickly.

603
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,960
We can also produce new complex scale.

604
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,690
And this is where world
modeling becomes really obvious.

605
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,730
Crowds, dynamic camera moves,

606
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,640
underwater worlds, complex environments.

607
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,410
These used to require huge
teams and huge budgets.

608
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:11,010
Now a single creator can
explore these concepts

609
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,570
at full scale.

610
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,920
It's incredibly empowering.

611
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,860
I love this ant example. This is great.

612
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,680
And we can replace the flags
in this with any team we want,

613
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,963
any corporate logo, even a made-up team.

614
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:41,040
So sometimes brands want precise control,

615
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,070
where an object should
appear, how it should move,

616
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,020
how the scene should flow.

617
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,720
We can interpret annotations,

618
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,640
just like a creative collaborator.

619
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,840
You can just speak to
it like another human.

620
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,393
- [Speaker 2] You should be able to do it.

621
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,430
(engine revs)

622
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,763
(bouncy tropical music)

623
00:29:06,372 --> 00:29:09,258
(water whooshes)

624
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:13,425
(bouncy tropical music continues)

625
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,983
(birds cawing)

626
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:23,340
- So all of this functionality

627
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,500
allows brands to create targeted ads

628
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,470
in a fraction of the time
and a fraction of the cost.

629
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,986
Here's an example for Adidas Floral.

630
00:29:30,986 --> 00:29:34,819
(singing in foreign language)

631
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:44,647
(water trickling)

632
00:29:44,647 --> 00:29:49,314
(singing in foreign language continues)

633
00:29:56,067 --> 00:30:00,317
- [Speaker 2] I'm gonna
switch you back after this.

634
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,232
- So in film and episodic production,

635
00:30:06,232 --> 00:30:09,300
we're seeing some of the
most exciting adoption.

636
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,560
Let's start with pre-production,

637
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,123
where speed matters the most.

638
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:14,820
Directors can now move

639
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,420
from script into storyboarding instantly.

640
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,410
We capture tone, emotion,
framing, and visual continuity.

641
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,210
You can see here, we're exploring concepts

642
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,220
for a bird getting lost in the woods,

643
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,690
finally finding its parents.

644
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,610
And we can explore dozens and dozens

645
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,140
of different visual concepts for this

646
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,050
before we settle on what
direction we want to go.

647
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,640
And not only that,

648
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,880
but Ray3 also understands
cinematic language,

649
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,140
not just images.

650
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,190
Orbit right, dolly zoom, roll left.

651
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,870
It understands camera instructions

652
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,853
and other native filmmaking language.

653
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:55,560
So this scene demonstrates
lighting realism,

654
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,690
atmospheric physics,
performance consistency,

655
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,293
world coherence, all hallmarks
of cinematic quality.

656
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,580
Here you can see how the dust particles

657
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,930
filter through the flashlight.

658
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,750
That is typically a very
hard shot to achieve.

659
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,450
And now, we can get the shot
just by prompting for it.

660
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,620
This is a cute one we threw in.

661
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,820
Everybody loves the
hamster in the race car.

662
00:31:31,143 --> 00:31:33,150
This one, with our animated pirates,

663
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,310
we were recently speaking
with a former Disney exec

664
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,230
who worked on "Pirates of the Caribbean,"

665
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,870
who told us that if they
had these kinds of AI tools

666
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,700
back then when they
were shooting the movie,

667
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,643
they would've saved over $20
million on production costs.

668
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,563
So animation is another area
where Ray3 reshapes workflows.

669
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,530
This 32-second animation

670
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:05,340
had a compute cost of just under $630.

671
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,240
It was made by a single
person in a single week.

672
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,840
Now for those of you that
don't know, get ready for this.

673
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,210
If you were using a
traditional animation workflow

674
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,840
with an animation studio, the
same 32 seconds of footage

675
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,460
would've cost between
$95,000 and $180,000.

676
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,130
It would require a crew of 14 to 20 people

677
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,870
and would take six to 12 weeks,

678
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,380
depending on iterations
and approval cycles.

679
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,857
Just think about that difference:

680
00:32:32,857 --> 00:32:37,857
$90,000 to $180,000 versus
$630, one person, one week.

681
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,113
That is an enormous difference.

682
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,210
(lighter clicks)

683
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,367
(air whooshing)

684
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,252
(footsteps tapping)

685
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:51,787
(car door clicks)

686
00:32:51,787 --> 00:32:52,620
(radio buzzes)

687
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,579
(dance music)
(person laughing)

688
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:56,328
(engines revving)

689
00:32:56,328 --> 00:32:57,883
(singing in foreign language)

690
00:32:57,883 --> 00:32:59,278
(crowd cheering)

691
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,308
(singing in foreign language)

692
00:33:01,308 --> 00:33:04,475
(tires screeching)

693
00:33:04,475 --> 00:33:06,508
(dance music continues)

694
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:09,258
(car screeching)

695
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:14,308
(helmet clicks)

696
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:19,410
- So Ray3 isn't just for
net new content either.

697
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,920
It's also a powerful VFX
and post-production tool.

698
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,740
Modify Video lets you relight, restage,

699
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,268
or retheme existing shots.

700
00:33:29,268 --> 00:33:33,420
This is a great example where
we've taken a flat CG render

701
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,790
and we've produced a fully-lit, cinematic

702
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,260
final pixel version.

703
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,390
And we can make that scene
look any way we like.

704
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:43,140
It can be a snowy blizzard, an
apocalyptic fiery hellscape,

705
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,533
a city, you know, bustling at
night, whatever we ask for.

706
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,420
This is a great example of
relighting, mood shifts,

707
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,400
and fine-tune selective adjustments,

708
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,500
like inserting logos or brands.

709
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,540
This task normally requires multiple teams

710
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,030
across multiple departments.

711
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,403
Now, one person can do it in an afternoon.

712
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,880
So here, Ray3 can interpret
hand-drawn sketches

713
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,260
or blocking passes

714
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,750
and it can use that to
generate final shots.

715
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,170
It dramatically accelerates
the production phase.

716
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,520
They had a lot of fun making these.

717
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,960
You know, you can see we've got,

718
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,720
we just sketched the outline
of a car over our model

719
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,890
and now they're driving a car.

720
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,330
We can restyle the shot.

721
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,843
We can turn a toy into a
fully realized, finished shot.

722
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,340
So our video-to-video pipeline

723
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,850
preserves the structure and
motion of the base video

724
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,270
while transforming its
style, theme, or subject.

725
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,730
And you can change the level
of imagination on it as well.

726
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,960
You can adjust the strength

727
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,544
of how readily it changes things.

728
00:35:01,544 --> 00:35:03,870
It's extremely useful for creators

729
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,880
that want to try multiple variations

730
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,680
of the same performance,
the same environment,

731
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,510
or different camera moves.

732
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,270
You can see we can pose
with a particular product,

733
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,610
we can turn John into a realtor there,

734
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,950
or we can completely change
the clothing on this model

735
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,810
as many times as we like.

736
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,183
- [Speaker 2] You have control.

737
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,290
- [Jason] So I'd like to draw attention

738
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,980
to how the depiction of
the sheep really snaps to

739
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,370
as soon as the actress goes
down onto hands and knees.

740
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,960
The model immediately recognizes

741
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,700
this person is dressed as a sheep,

742
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,380
we're gonna make them look as a sheep.

743
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,030
And with something as simple

744
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,960
as tying two shoes together
on an iPhone in your backyard,

745
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,723
you can turn that into a
high-octane police chase.

746
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,070
So speaking of high-octane,

747
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,993
let's talk about the gaming industry.

748
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,490
In gaming, Ray3 accelerates
the pre-production

749
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,223
and the ideation stages across genres.

750
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,830
Whether it's world exploration

751
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,330
or dungeon interiors

752
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:18,210
or high-intensity combat,

753
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,680
it handles spatial reasoning,

754
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,353
dynamics across very
different game aesthetics.

755
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,223
We can also reinterpret 2D sprite sheets.

756
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,840
It can expand on animations,

757
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,555
it can smooth motion cycles,
it can create new frames

758
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:38,755
that maintain the
original character design.

759
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,290
This is an example of
interpreting a text prompt

760
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,600
to display a targeted specific motion

761
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,640
with the sprite for 2D games.

762
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,600
We can make this orc

763
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,330
make any kind of movement
or action we ask it to.

764
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,213
This is huge for 2D game
production and mobile games.

765
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,890
So advertising is one of the verticals

766
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,460
where this technology is already
having an immediate impact.

767
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,540
What you're seeing here

768
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,480
are four completely different concepts,

769
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,330
different brands, different tones,

770
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,520
different visual languages,

771
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,430
all created in just a day.

772
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,280
Each of these could
easily pass as a TV spot

773
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,056
or a paid social hero asset.

774
00:37:20,056 --> 00:37:24,720
But the key point here is this:
These aren't AI experiments.

775
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,940
These are production-grade ads

776
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,100
created without crews, without locations,

777
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,153
without sets, props, cameras,
or post-production teams.

778
00:37:35,774 --> 00:37:38,520
So for agencies and brand studios,

779
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,820
Ray3 collapses the entire
traditional workflow pipeline.

780
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,010
There's no scouting,
there's no scheduling,

781
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,380
there's no retouching or compositing,

782
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,840
no expensive hero shoots.

783
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,820
It lets a single creative team

784
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,460
explore a dozen directions in parallel

785
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,280
and land on a polished, high-impact idea

786
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,010
in a fraction of the time
and a fraction of the budget

787
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,360
compared to a conventional
production pipeline.

788
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,380
So this sneaker commercial
is a great illustration

789
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,310
of what TV quality in 48 hours looks like.

790
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,860
Everything you see here,
the slow-motion kick,

791
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,533
the atmosphere, the dust
particles, the rim light,

792
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,980
it all normally requires
a full production team.

793
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,830
Here, a single creator produced
the entire spot end-to-end.

794
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,300
And for performance marketing teams,

795
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,620
this is a huge breakthrough.

796
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,290
You can launch dozens
of premium hero assets,

797
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,970
iterate on them instantly,

798
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,090
and then tailor every version
to a specific audience,

799
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,890
without ever shooting a second time.

800
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,525
- [Narrator 1] From the neighborhood

801
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:41,670
From the neighborhood

802
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,370
to the hardwood,

00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,350
to superstardom.
to superstardom.

805
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,090
They say you have to make waves

806
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,650
to be remembered.

807
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,000
I disagree.
I disagree.

808
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,254
When they told me
When they told me

809
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:56,719
to make the ground tremble,

00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,420

and walked on clouds

812
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,543
all the way to the top.
all the way to the top.

813
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,743
Step light.

814
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,100
- [Jason] Okay, this one is special,

815
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,200
because this one isn't just speculative.

816
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,570
This is a real commercial campaign.

817
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,230
This holiday spot was created
by Coca-Cola with Luma

818
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,810
in an incredibly tight turnaround window.

819
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,390
What made this possible wasn't just speed,

820
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,420
it was that Ray3
understands brand language.

821
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,580
So it understands the warmth, the glow,

822
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,440
the atmospheric winter feel,

823
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,650
and the emotional pacing
of a Coke holiday ad.

824
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,260
With traditional production,
this level of craft

825
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,330
takes large crews,
controlled environments,

826
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:43,530
specialized lighting, a long
post-production pipeline.

827
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,840
And with Ray3, a small team produced

828
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,370
a single, campaign-quality,
globally consistent holiday ad

829
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,550
at the speed that just
wasn't achievable before.

830
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,410
For global brands like Coke,

831
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:58,440
that time compression isn't
just operationally important,

832
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,423
it's strategically transformational.

833
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,213
- [Narrator 2] Hello, friends.

834
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:05,070
Today we are going to look
at something very special,

835
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,160
because, you know, they're
coming: the holidays.

836
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,993
- [Narrator 3] Welcome to the making

837
00:40:08,993 --> 00:40:13,140
of the Coca-Cola 2025
"Holidays are Coming" ad.

838
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,240
- [Narrator 2] It really feels
like this work is, you know,

839
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,610
actively shaping how
storytelling is evolving.

840
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,840
It shows Coca-Cola

841
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,990
really re-imagining the creative workflow,

842
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,266
especially in this AI era.

848
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,240
is really interesting.

849
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,112
They tried a few things out.

854
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:55,140
on this super-expressive hyperrealism,

855
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,158
really cinematic scenes.

- [Narrator 3] The big
question is probably

859
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,960
how a tiny team, like five specialists,

860
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,380
how they managed to churn
out and carefully refine

861
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,200
over 70,000 video clips.

862
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,710
- [Narrator 2] 70,000.

863
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,170
- [Narrator 3] Mm-hm, in just 30 days.

864
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,730
That level of precision suggests

865
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,430
the team had to go way
beyond just simple prompting.

866
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,720
- Yeah.
- Shaping the animals,

867
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,000
getting the texture right,
those big sparkly eyes.

868
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,150
- [Narrator 2] Exactly.

869
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,424
Okay, so let's get into

870
00:41:27,424 --> 00:41:29,940
this customized workflow they built.

871
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,560
- [Narrator 3] Right,
so it basically starts

872
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,393
with generative image models,

873
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,920
then it moves into these,
well, powerful video models

874
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,183
for the actual animation.

875
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,510
There's still a little post and
color tweaks, quick cleanup,

876
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,070
but the big shift is clear.

877
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,840
What we used to fix at the end,

878
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,270
we are now building right from the start.

879
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,910
- [Narrator 2] Post-production
is the new pre-production.

880
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,050
Advanced reasoning models

881
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:58,380
let artists plan and solve them early

882
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,490
and making scenes feel real
before production locks in.

883
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,870
- [Narrator 3] Last year was different.

884
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:07,260
Extensive post-production
fixes were required.

885
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,380
Wheels looked like they were
sliding instead of rolling.

886
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,610
Physics needed correction.

887
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,370
Logos had to be adjusted and repositioned.

888
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:17,850
Now, AI is enabling creators.

889
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,500
What used to be patching at the end

890
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,480
is now designing at the start.

891
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,190
- [Narrator 2] And they
needed a big toolbox

892
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,170
to handle 70,000 segments.

893
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,423
- [Narrator 3] A whole suite.

894
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,210
- [Narrator 2] Combining
human creativity with AI

895
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:33,120
to turbocharge expression and imagination,

896
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,030
giving creatives more
freedom, speed, and control

897
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,217
than ever before.

898
00:42:37,217 --> 00:42:39,360
♪ Holidays are coming,
holidays are coming ♪

899
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,710
- [Narrator 2] And that's real magic.

900
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,860
- [Narrator 3] Exactly.

901
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,360
- [Jason] So to close,

902
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,670
I want to come back to a broader look

903
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,200
at where we're heading.

904
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,440
So this reel highlights the
mission behind the technology.

905
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,280
What we're seeing is the
beginning of a major shift

906
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,040
from video generation as a creative tool

907
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,040
to video generation as
a world modeling engine

908
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,540
that empowers anyone

909
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,940
to produce cinematic-quality stories

910
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,803
without legacy production barriers.

911
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:10,991
- [Narrator 4] When we started Luma,

912
00:43:10,991 --> 00:43:12,027
(keypad clicking)

913
00:43:12,027 --> 00:43:13,860
the founding vision of the company was

914
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,560
if we are able to capture
and then simulate the world,

915
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,620
that would have an
immense impact on humanity

916
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,220
and what we are able to achieve.

917
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,000
And what DALL-E proved

918
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,510
was that from nothing,
you can generate images.

919
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:33,437
But in order to generate
and understand the world,

920
00:43:33,437 --> 00:43:35,087
we need to go way beyond.

921
00:43:35,087 --> 00:43:37,380
- [Narrator 5] It's
called the Dream Machine,

922
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,237
created by tech company, Luma.

923
00:43:39,237 --> 00:43:41,623
And it's available starting today.

924
00:43:41,623 --> 00:43:44,010
- [Narrator 4] Ray3 was
a very small glimpse

925
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:44,850
what the pinnacle

926
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:47,250
of the previous generation
of models looks like.

927
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,702
That's not enough.

928
00:43:49,702 --> 00:43:52,369
(intense music)

929
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,380
Our goal

930
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,033
is very simply, to solve

931
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,041
multimodal general intelligence.

932
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:08,940
(dramatic music ends)

933
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,240
- So this is what multimodal
AGI looks like in practice.

934
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,790
It's models that understand
the physical world

935
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:17,220
well enough to help us
create inside of it.

936
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,559
Thank you very much.
- When we started Luma,

937
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:21,686
the founding vision of the company was...

938
00:44:21,686 --> 00:44:22,894
(audience applauds softly)
