  "abstract": "High-performing engineering teams don’t stop at collecting logs and metrics. They turn observability into a competitive advantage. In this session, we’ll explore a four-stage maturity model that shows how organizations evolve from capturing telemetry to making business-critical decisions. You’ll learn how leading teams define SLOs, tie reliability to customer experience, and connect technical signals directly to revenue and growth. Whether you’re an engineer optimizing uptime or a leader shaping product strategy, you’ll walk away with a clear framework to align engineering performance with business outcomes. This presentation is brought to you by Coralogix, an AWS Partner.",
