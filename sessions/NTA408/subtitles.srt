1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,063
- Good morning.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,033
Welcome to re:Invent day three.
Who's excited to be here?

3
00:00:07,337 --> 00:00:09,090
(audience applauds)
Awesome.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,540
So show of hands, who out in the crowd

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,060
is multi-cloud today in your business?

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,210
Who's multi-cloud? Okay,
so we have a lot of them.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,290
So you're in luck.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,970
So today you're gonna hear
about a real life multi-cloud

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,770
story with a real customer, a real CTO

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,340
telling you about their
process to go through it.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,500
Good morning. My name is Rusty Grayson.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,720
I'm an AWS Account Principal,

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,753
and I'll be one of the ones
presenting to you today.

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,860
Here's a quick look at our agenda.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,990
After telling us about Crane Worldwide,

16
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,340
a billion dollar plus third
party logistics company.

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,840
Brandon Kuykendall, Chief
Technology Officer from Crane,

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,890
will give you a behind the
scenes look at the strategy

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,537
behind his organization's, move to AWS.

20
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,863
Akhil Melakunta, my colleague,

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,770
AWS Senior Solutions Architect,

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,330
will provide a deep dive
into how a joint team

23
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,620
thought or brought
Brandon's vision to reality.

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,620
We'll finish off the session
with some innovations

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,430
that Crane is bringing to
their business with agentic AI

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,293
and satellite communications.

27
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,250
So nobody likes cloud migration stories

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,880
that start off with
digital transformation.

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,710
So, we're not gonna do that today,

30
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,340
and nobody likes 17
bullet points on a slide

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,720
that nobody's gonna read anyway,

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,420
so we're not gonna do that either.

33
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,730
So let me tell you what happened.

34
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,150
Crane Worldwide, big logistics company,

35
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,670
moving stuff all over the world,

36
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,030
and they were spending money
on cloud infrastructure

37
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,630
that was not a valuable asset for them.

38
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,100
So they moved to AWS as
their primary cloud platform.

39
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,473
And when they did, they saved money,

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,240
they got faster and they
got more agile as well.

41
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,260
So you may be thinking,
Rusty, what is this another

42
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,930
cost cutting story where
they fired a bunch of people

43
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,283
and turned off the lights.

44
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,360
That's not what we're
gonna talk about today

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,260
because Crane got faster
and they got more scalable

46
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,480
and they're using satellites and AI.

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,490
So that's what you're about to hear.

48
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,590
And you're not gonna
hear about it from me.

49
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,810
You're gonna hear about it from Brandon,

50
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,513
the CTO, who actually did the work.

51
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,370
So here's the thing about
logistics, and I know this

52
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,370
because I asked them and they
told me, logistics is hard.

53
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,860
You've got ships, trucks,
planes, warehouses

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,290
all over the world, and
everybody wants to know

55
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,550
where their stuff is right
now, not in five minutes.

56
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,230
They want to know now.

57
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,170
And if Crane's technology can't tell them,

58
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,183
those customers are gonna go elsewhere.

59
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,500
So here's where it gets interesting

60
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,280
and we'll go over most of
this in the session today.

61
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,033
Crane made AWS their primary
cloud, and that's important.

62
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,900
Primary means most of their workloads,

63
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,550
most of their innovation
and most of their investment

64
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,983
in technology is now going to AWS.

65
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,063
But, and this is the real world talking,

66
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,500
they still operate in a
multi-cloud environment.

67
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,180
Some stuff runs on
Azure, some on OCI. Why?

68
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,973
Because that's how real enterprises work.

69
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,890
You've got acquisitions,
you've got vendor requirements,

70
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,160
you've got applications
that aren't worth moving,

71
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,303
at least not yet.

72
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,700
And you know what? That's okay.

73
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,900
The story today here is
not about cloud religion,

74
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,540
it's about making AWS the engine

75
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,910
that drives your business forward

76
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,833
while being smart about the rest.

77
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,970
So here's specifically
what Crane did with AWS.

78
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,403
First off cost optimization.

79
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,540
Real cost optimization,
where they reinvested savings

80
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,233
into modernization and
AI and into satellites.

81
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,274
Scale, Crane can now deploy
applications anywhere

82
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,380
in their network without
rebuilding everything.

83
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,353
And we'll show you what that
looks like on AWS today.

84
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,470
AI and a little hint, not the type of AI

85
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,123
that you ask to write a poem.

86
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,610
AI that optimizes supply chains

87
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,523
and predicts problems
before they even occur.

88
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,980
And finally, Amazon Leo,

89
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,290
Amazon's satellite network,

90
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,350
which means Crane can
now operate in places

91
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,240
where the internet
doesn't really exist today

92
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,683
in the middle of nowhere.

93
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,080
So what are you gonna learn
today in the next 50 minutes

94
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,610
in this session?

95
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,410
You're gonna learn four things.

96
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,380
Number one, how to migrate.

97
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,620
The real story, not the sanitized version.

98
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,760
How Crane and AWS moved as AWS

99
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,710
as their primary cloud platform

100
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,053
while keeping the other
clouds operational.

101
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,920
How they kept the business
running when they ripped out

102
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,383
the foundation and built it again.

103
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,683
Two, how to optimize.

104
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,510
What architectural decisions
did Brandon's team make?

105
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,130
What did they stop doing

106
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,623
that they thought they
needed to keep doing?

107
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,560
And here's the practical part,

108
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,743
how do you optimize in a
multi-cloud environment?

109
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,163
Three, modernize.

110
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,100
Containerization, serverless,
but more importantly,

111
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,620
how they got legacy applications

112
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,480
that people said were unmovable

113
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,480
and they moved them to AWS anyway,

114
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,930
where they could actually
do something with them.

115
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,890
And last, innovation,
the AI implementations.

116
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,350
We'll talk about that during this session.

117
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,270
The satellite part from Leo,

118
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,670
we'll talk about this in this session.

119
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,570
Most companies won't be
here for another two years.

120
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,970
Crane is there today,

121
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,270
and they're gonna tell you
what it's actually like.

122
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,880
So with that, I'd like to introduce you

123
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,640
to Brandon Kuykendall,

124
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,910
Crane Worldwide's Chief
Technology Officer.

125
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,523
Brandon. Thanks, Rusty.

126
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:57,040
(audience applauds)

127
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,520
- Okay, so let's start with who is Crane?

128
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,687
'Cause most of you guys
probably have never heard of us.

129
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:06,725
We're a 3PO, about a $3 billion
company that moves goods

130
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:08,370
around the world.

131
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,110
We're headquartered in Houston, Texas.

132
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,470
We were founded in 2008,
so a fairly young company.

133
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,890
We have over 150 offices
in 30 plus countries

134
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,410
around the world, about 4,000 employees.

135
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,490
We're privately held.

136
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,560
So we're very entrepreneurial as a company

137
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,170
we move fast, very, very fast.

138
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,870
And we use that as a
competitive advantage.

139
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,780
How does that play into why AWS

140
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,850
and why did we embark on this journey?

141
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,593
It was never about cost,

142
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,090
although we definitely
wanna be cost conscious.

143
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,880
It was about fueling
the pace of innovation.

144
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,470
We have to be able to move faster

145
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,120
and faster with more certainty

146
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,790
and are very, very secure, reliable,

147
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,340
and scalable infrastructure.

148
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,800
So that's what our aim and our goal was.

149
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,633
So why AWS?

150
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,970
Because their DNA is a lot like ours.

151
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,370
They're very, very entrepreneurial.

152
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,320
They like to move fast as well.

153
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,570
And they bring resources
and partner with you,

154
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,910
at least for us in a
way that we had not seen

155
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,830
with other providers.

156
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,760
So for Crane, we're customer
obsessed. A lot like AWS.

157
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,300
Our core values are integrity,
innovation, execution,

158
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,270
partnership, and ultimately results.

159
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,673
That's how we measure
everything is end results.

160
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,320
Okay, so I'll tell you guys a little bit

161
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,330
about the logistics landscape.

162
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,360
Most of you guys probably
aren't super familiar with it.

163
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,600
I have to thank our friends at Amazon

164
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,740
for really changing the game

165
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,470
and making my job a lot more difficult

166
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,540
because we constantly get the question of,

167
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,750
well, Amazon can tell me when
a package is on my porch.

168
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,130
Why can't you tell me, right?

169
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,110
So thanks a lot for changing the game.

170
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,720
Well, ours is a little
bit more complicated.

171
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,410
So we deal with multiple
modes of transport, right?

172
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,890
We're talking about air,
ocean, ground transportation.

173
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,440
We have warehouses all over the world.

174
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,240
We have to deal with the
complexities of tariff changes,

175
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,360
customs compliance, customs declarations,

176
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,420
all the way down to sometimes
partnering with our clients

177
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,520
to help them understand what materials

178
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,040
are actually in the
goods that they're moving

179
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,320
so that we can properly clear customs.

180
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,810
So as you can see, there's
a lot of documentation.

181
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,390
There's documents,
documents, more documents.

182
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,100
So our take on AI, at least for now,

183
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,500
is that it's best when
there's a human in the loop.

184
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,760
So a lot of what you'll hear
from us is deploying LLMs

185
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,120
to keep our logistics
professionals a loop,

186
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,400
make them more agile, ultimately faster,

187
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,680
and provide better
service for our clients.

188
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,310
We also have to track in real
time GPS throughout the world.

189
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,337
So a lot of data, a lot of data, right?

190
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:53,310
And we have to have an
infrastructure that can handle that,

191
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,190
especially in peak load times, right?

192
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,530
If you looked at our business,

193
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,370
there is a peak and our volumes
can sometimes go up 10x.

194
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,200
So we have to be able
to handle it every day

195
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,993
and scale to manage peak load.

196
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,040
Customs and tariffs, thank
you Trump administration

197
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,620
for making this much, much more difficult

198
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,390
for everybody around the globe.

199
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,640
But it did create an
opportunity for a lot of people

200
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,260
to really stand out and shine.

201
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,980
So what we have to do there is navigate

202
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,850
a growing complex network of tariffs,

203
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,580
customs regulations,
and filing appropriately

204
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,663
to keep goods moving.

205
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,840
Cost optimization.

206
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,260
When I say that, don't think
cloud cost optimization,

207
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,210
optimizing costs for our clients,

208
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,720
how we actually move their
goods throughout the world

209
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,290
and how we can save them
money most of all time

210
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,353
and predict and hit our service SLAs.

211
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,950
Which brings us to the
forecasting bit, right?

212
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,360
So Rusty's, right.

213
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,090
People don't want to just
know where are my things now?

214
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,780
They want to know, well, what
is gonna impact how my goods

215
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,930
move three months from
now, six months from now,

216
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,850
what are rates gonna be?

217
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,500
Is there gonna be political instability

218
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,880
that we should be on the lookout for?

219
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,520
Are there port strikes
that could impact the goods

220
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,230
that we need to move?

221
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,553
So a lot of complexity.

222
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,790
So our migration strategy,

223
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,190
what were we really trying to hit?

224
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,840
Provide rapid value to our clients.

225
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,490
We need to be able to move fast.

226
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,680
In order to be able to move fast,

227
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,923
we need to have an environment
that we can rely on,

228
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,270
from a deployment standpoint,
eliminate click ops

229
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,430
and human intervention, and
make things as repeatable

230
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,053
and consistent as possible.

231
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,890
That should help
accelerate our AI outcomes.

232
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,520
Because without being able
to move quickly, experiment

233
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,810
and ingest volumes of data,
you really limit yourself

234
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,270
from what you can do from
an agentic standpoint.

235
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,970
And then be ready for
growth in the future.

236
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,820
Obviously all of this has to
be in a secure, resilient,

237
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,143
and reliable environment.

238
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,780
So success factors for me, we
had to make absolutely certain

239
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,280
that we could deploy via code.

240
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,010
We took an engineering
first approach to everything

241
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,753
that we did during this migration.

242
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,590
To create reliability,
we had to be able to be

243
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,500
in multiple regions for
scalability and redundancy,

244
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,730
for business continuity.

245
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,980
And then where we could,
how do we modernize,

246
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,930
not just lift and shift, right?

247
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,520
Where could we actually take a look

248
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,920
and see where we could
use serverless options,

249
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,780
where we could reduce
some of the complexity

250
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,230
and simplify our environment.

251
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,680
The execution team.

252
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,343
So we had a lot of
expertise in other clouds,

253
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,930
but not a lot with AWS,
not to the same level

254
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,330
that we did with other providers.

255
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,430
So when we started,

256
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,970
I made it very clear
to our partners at AWS

257
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,920
that we were gonna need not only training,

258
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,350
which they put together
a tailored training plan

259
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,260
just for our staff, but
then we also wanted to take

260
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,133
the approach of professional
services would lead,

261
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,590
help our team get up to speed,

262
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,350
and then during the
transition we would flip

263
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,390
and we would lead and they would assist,

264
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,280
which is exactly what we did.

265
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,540
And then long term living
with managed services

266
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,140
to help us be able to cost arbitrage

267
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,340
some of the mundane patching and the like.

268
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,130
And then partnering with
them to create a patchwork

269
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,130
of support around the globe 24/7 365,

270
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,980
which is what we have in place today.

271
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,440
And then we wanted to push limits, right?

272
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,210
Anybody who works in our organization

273
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,700
knows we like to go fast,
we like to innovate,

274
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,080
we like to experiment.

275
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,300
And then ultimately we
want to take what wins

276
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,330
and get it to production
as quickly as possible.

277
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,320
And we do that in hopes
of creating an uncommon

278
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,400
client experience,

279
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,740
especially for clients
of logistics providers

280
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,910
who historically have
not innovated as quickly

281
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,103
as other verticals.

282
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,490
And some of that includes
real time visibility,

283
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,240
predictive optimization,
human in the loop workflows.

284
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,430
Again, I'm gonna keep
hearkening back to that

285
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,430
because for us, you saw the complexity,

286
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,280
there's just a lot that is
between the ears of people

287
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,960
who are specialists around the globe,

288
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,710
who know local regulations,
who know the carrier bases

289
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,720
that needs to be leveraged.

290
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,780
And so we attempt to
keep humans in the loop

291
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,300
at every step in the process.

292
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,840
And then we absolutely had
to have global scalability.

293
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,810
Like I said, we operate
in multiple countries

294
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,660
around the globe, over 150 offices.

295
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,880
So it was really, really important for us

296
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,530
to be able to scale out globally.

297
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,937
Okay, execution strategy,
I'm just gonna pull these up

298
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:44,190
so that you guys can see
those as we go through.

299
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,040
But automation, we took an
engineering first approach.

300
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,230
This was not lift and shift.

301
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,050
We wanted to eliminate all of our ClickOps

302
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,403
all of them, right?

303
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,080
And really the reason why is
so that we can have certainty

304
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,570
as we move fast, as we deploy,

305
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,170
we have a way to orchestrate deployment

306
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,900
and then we have a way to
quickly recover in the event

307
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,260
that we made a mistake, which
is inevitable it happens.

308
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,530
Reliability, uptime, uptime, uptime.

309
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,450
We're now judged just like

310
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,050
a lot of other solution
providers, SaaS companies.

311
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,690
We have uptime SLAs with our clients

312
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,330
for things like our APIs, our reporting.

313
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,890
So we had to make certain
that we could meet

314
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,050
those uptime requirements.

315
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,470
And then scalability, we
talked a little bit about load.

316
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,560
I'll just give you a for
instance that might resonate

317
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,350
when we're ramping up to
Christmas season, right?

318
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,620
There's a lot of goods that
come into the United States.

319
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,500
And so in August you'll
see a huge peak, right?

320
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,600
We have to be able to manage that peak

321
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,730
and it's different for
the different cycles

322
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,470
for different industries.

323
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,170
Business continuity
absolutely had to make certain

324
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,990
that we could hit our RPOs and RTOs

325
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,420
and that we tested those and
prove that we could hit them,

326
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,340
not just on paper.

327
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,250
And then modernization
obviously, where we could,

328
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,160
we wanna make things more simpler

329
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,260
and we wanna make things more resilient

330
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,613
using serverless compute.

331
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,900
And then latency. Latency
is a big one for us.

332
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,630
Akhil will go into some of
the latency requirements.

333
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,070
Just like a lot of you guys I'm sure

334
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,110
we have vendor applications,

335
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,240
some can handle latency better than others

336
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,310
and some have very strict
latency requirements

337
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,560
that we had to adhere to.

338
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,203
So with that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Akhil.

339
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,870
- Thank you Brandon for that
overview of how you came up

340
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,520
with the strategy for our team.

341
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,440
So the way we got started with Crane,

342
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,680
is we took what was Brandon's
vision and Crane's vision

343
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,270
of the migration strategy.

344
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,460
We started working backwards with them.

345
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,260
The reason them being on stage today

346
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,440
is some of the simplification
and efficiencies

347
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,510
that Crane achieved that you can take back

348
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,510
to your own environments
and apply them as well.

349
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,850
So we thought it is
valuable for you for us

350
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,410
to share this information today.

351
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,343
So let's dive in.

352
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,270
So working backwards
from Crane objectives,

353
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,580
we brought with four principles

354
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,500
that were very key in the way

355
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,510
that we have designed the migration.

356
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,000
We started off by deciding

357
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,070
that Crane would require
a foundational environment

358
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,210
with landing zone.

359
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,230
But lot of customers,

360
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,960
when we work with proposing landing zone,

361
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,810
the usual pushback we get
is there is an impression

362
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,880
that it is always a trade
off between security

363
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,470
and agility for teams.

364
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,380
Am I gonna create a more
secure foundational environment

365
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,480
where now my developers are restricted

366
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,310
that they cannot move fast enough.

367
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,740
That is not the case,
you'll see that in the way

368
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,020
how Crane was able to adopt landing zone,

369
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,720
but still was able to be
flexible enough to use

370
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,840
some of the partner solutions
that they were working with.

371
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,060
They wanted to operate in
three different clouds,

372
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,490
but still wanted a simple design.

373
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,860
So that's one of the major objectives

374
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,210
that we went back when we actually

375
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,100
designed their architecture.

376
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,310
They wanted to move into
AWS but wanted to move along

377
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,740
with AWS while their
team is getting trained.

378
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,780
So how did we pace that?

379
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,130
How did we train their team

380
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,800
and how they're leading of
some of those initiatives

381
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,870
are interesting for you to learn as well.

382
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,000
And modernization, like Brandon mentioned,

383
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,670
how do we not just migrate and leave?

384
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,680
How do we keep continuously modernizing

385
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,870
so they're future ready for scalability

386
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,763
and what's coming in their business?

387
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,220
So the overall migration
approach started off

388
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,280
by the AWS Professional
services team partnering up

389
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,080
with AWS solution architects

390
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,870
and some of the specialist
essays that we have.

391
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,730
We went in and we tried to discover

392
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,760
what is the lay of the land for Crane?

393
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,850
What is the landscape? What
is the consumption today?

394
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,860
Which translated into a cost analysis

395
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,380
of what are the spending right now?

396
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,600
Because when we are moving
from cloud to cloud,

397
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,110
usually the cost is not
a huge factor in savings,

398
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,420
but you're not comparing apples to apples.

399
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,030
So we would often go back
to this cost analysis

400
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,710
throughout the migration saying,

401
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,110
are we proposing the
right solution for them?

402
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,370
Are we making things better?

403
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,770
Are we moving them to a
more expensive solution,

404
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,740
whether it is compute
database or other things?

405
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,790
During the same period,

406
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,190
we have also handled
executive visioning sessions

407
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,430
with Crane team, you know, so
that the executive alignment

408
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,263
is in place.

409
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:19,410
And we also had trained technical
teams from Crane as well.

410
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,410
So they're along in the
journey of this migration.

411
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,350
So we went on to actually
mobilize some of the workloads,

412
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,360
which is where we started to plan.

413
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,920
So the planning phase started off

414
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,820
by actually designing their
landing zone environment,

415
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,350
creating an operating model,

416
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,530
understanding how Crane
operates in cloud today,

417
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,900
and sort of also visioning
how they would operate

418
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,613
for post migration as well.

419
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,050
So then the actual migration kicked off.

420
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,880
If you see the parallel lines up there,

421
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,850
those parallel lines mean
those are different waves.

422
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,950
We didn't just take a big bang approach

423
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,870
of moving everything all at a time.

424
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,940
We started picking each application,

425
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,460
building portfolio for that application.

426
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,430
What are the dependencies
involved, complexities involved

427
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,620
before we started moving applications.

428
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,650
So that helped us take the
learnings from each application

429
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,380
and take those learnings and
efficiencies into the next one.

430
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,980
So we are doing it more and
more efficiently as we progress.

431
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,760
And post migration we also optimized

432
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,110
some of those applications

433
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,110
and we continue to modernize them today.

434
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,230
So this is their landing
zone environment, right?

435
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,870
So they have a typical
architecture of control,

436
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,000
plane of management
accounts sitting on the top,

437
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,130
orchestrating multi account design,

438
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,930
enabling, creating accounts.

439
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,340
They have aggregated backups,
audit, logging, et cetera.

440
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,700
But what the flexibility part comes here.

441
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,660
Crane wanted a centralized
firewall control plane

442
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,660
where they control firewall
for all the traffic.

443
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,750
We were able to achieve that
and put that into the design.

444
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,840
And the whole infrastructure
as code foundation

445
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,360
for post migration was based off

446
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,550
of how well we implement landing zone.

447
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,850
So this was very critical
for us to implement.

448
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:08,250
So yeah, in the same process,
we had used automation

449
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,520
for any security configuration
remediations as well.

450
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,480
So any changes to configuration,

451
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,230
security aspects were all
remediated with automation.

452
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,640
At the end of the implementation,

453
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,250
what we were able to
achieve is a one stop shop

454
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,860
for Crane teams to deploy accounts

455
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,960
with a baseline accounts created.

456
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,610
A dev team or a data engineering team

457
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,990
wants to create an account.

458
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,720
They have a base account
structured with all the security

459
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,240
and governing policies
that are applied to it.

460
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,220
So that security posture stays standard

461
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,320
over a period of time.

462
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,580
So let me walk you through
some of the simplicities

463
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,600
that we achieved.

464
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,300
Usually customers, when
they try to implement

465
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,400
cloud migrations in AWS,

466
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,470
they at least operate in two regions.

467
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,590
So the way we set up
connectivity between regions

468
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:59,580
and VPCs is you connect
every VPC in each region

469
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,435
to a transit gateway.

470
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:03,450
Shat the VPCs can talk to each other.

471
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,000
Now you're trying to connect
two regions together.

472
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,550
And then we would set up
a transit gateway peering.

473
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,180
And then now the customers
have an on-premise environment

474
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,650
or another cloud environment.

475
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,990
We use direct connect for
this peering connections

476
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,140
to connect with so they can
connect to those things.

477
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,860
Then we learned Crane operates
in six different regions.

478
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,290
Now we were talking about
transit gateway connections

479
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,860
in each region, peering
connections between them.

480
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,840
The fun thing is transit gateway.

481
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,410
The routing between those
transit gateways look like this.

482
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,600
If we had implemented this.

483
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,870
This moved away from the
principle and our directive

484
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,220
that we got from Brandon's team

485
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,290
is we wanted a simple environment.

486
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,240
This doesn't look simple to me.

487
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,350
So that's we took a step back,
we went to a drawing board,

488
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,530
like how do we implement a
multi-cloud architecture design

489
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,090
that is still simple enough

490
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,090
that they can actually operate at scale?

491
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,040
That's when we started looking...

492
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,470
AWS had come up, you
know, around the same time

493
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,270
with a service called Cloud WAN.

494
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,070
This is a global managed WAN
network service that we have.

495
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,680
Where you can connect networks
from different regions

496
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,870
seamlessly without having
to manage the routing

497
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,703
between them.

498
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,230
When you create Cloud WAN,

499
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,900
we create what's called
a core cloud WAN network

500
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,350
that spans across all the
regions that you operate in.

501
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,470
And we manage the
connectivity between the VPCs

502
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,170
that you put in that core network.

503
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,020
Cloud WAN creates what's
called a core edge network,

504
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,670
CEN is what we call it.

505
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,280
We put it in each region
of where you operate.

506
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,860
So every VPC that connects into that CNE

507
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,340
can connect to any other VPC
that you put in that segment.

508
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,740
Now another thing that we
learned when we started off

509
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,110
the migration was Crane didn't have

510
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,650
a proper network segmentation
in their Azure network.

511
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,960
So that's where the feature of cloud one

512
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,570
to use network segments came into picture.

513
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,930
Let's say you have six
production VPCs in six, you know,

514
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,520
three different regions.

515
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,530
You can have one network segment,

516
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,600
you can call it a core network segment.

517
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,360
You can connect all those
VPCs into that segment.

518
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,520
And now you have achieved
not just connectivity

519
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,770
between those VPCs, you also achieved

520
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,560
the network segmentation
that you would require.

521
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,690
Now let me show you how we
actually implemented this

522
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,523
for Crane.

523
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,920
When we started connecting
two regions together,

524
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,840
we would create a production segment.

525
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,680
So every production VPC

526
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,640
that is in those two
regions now is connected

527
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,770
through production segment.

528
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:33,180
Now to the connectivity through
Microsoft and on premise,

529
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,930
we would create a direct connect
segment within Cloud WAN,

530
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,790
where the production
segment can now connect

531
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,720
to this direct connect using
direct connect segment.

532
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,060
Now, with that connectivity established,

533
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,820
we can connect with Cloud
WAN multiple regions

534
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,880
into Azure environment to any subscription

535
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,443
in a more simplified fashion.

536
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,860
Now, Crane operates in six regions.

537
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,620
They added a new region or a new VPC,

538
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,920
they just have to add those
VPCs into the segment,

539
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,660
and their connectivity is established

540
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,210
without having to manage or
update any routing tables

541
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,733
for transit gateways
or peering connections.

542
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,370
So post that implementation, we found out,

543
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,750
like Brandon mentioned,

544
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,060
they had a lot of vendor
specific applications

545
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,433
that required very low latency connection.

546
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,210
So we realized they were
connecting to Oracle Cloud,

547
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,310
which was located in Phoenix, Arizona,

548
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,610
and we didn't have an
availability zone located there.

549
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,740
How do we achieve a low latency connection

550
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,620
if we don't have an availability
zone in that region?

551
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,080
That's where we started
looking into local zones.

552
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,730
So Phoenix had a local zone.

553
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,240
So local zone is an area
of presence that we have

554
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,850
where we put compute,
storage and databases

555
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,870
in most highly populated
cities across the globe.

556
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,120
So we picked a local
zone that is much closer

557
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,280
to where the Oracle is sitting,

558
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,190
and we had directly, we were
able to establish connectivity

559
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,830
through Direct Connect into Oracle Cloud

560
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,423
with fewer network hops.

561
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,730
At post implementation,

562
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,070
we were able to achieve latencies
as low as two milliseconds

563
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,853
from AWS into Oracle Cloud.

564
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
So the big biggest
takeaway for customers here

565
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,390
is you can think about multi-cloud.

566
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,370
The biggest pushback
we get from executives

567
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,290
when we talk about multi-cloud is,

568
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,843
is it gonna get too
complex for me to manage?

569
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:26,433
For the sake of being, you know,

570
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,190
for the sake of being more flexible

571
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,960
or having more choices between cloud?

572
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,700
Am I compromising performance?

573
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,750
It's not really the case.

574
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,630
You can still operate
between multiple clouds,

575
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,810
have a simplified networking
and design architecture,

576
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,690
have a foundational environment
where you push automation

577
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,090
in the way that you operate
and still be performing

578
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:45,993
for your business.

579
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,390
Now let me show you how
Crane's posture looks today

580
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,270
post migration, when we
move the applications.

581
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,950
So every application that we move

582
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,770
with that foundational
environment now operates

583
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,900
has regional resiliency
that every workload now

584
00:27:03,178 --> 00:27:05,160
is can fail over between
availability zones

585
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,660
in that same region.

586
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,580
And they also have the ability to spin up

587
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,240
or bring the same application
backup in another region

588
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,553
if at all a region has to go down.

589
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,530
We use services like Elastic
Disaster Inquiry to replicate.

590
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,570
Most of all the critical applications,

591
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,890
and we use Terraform for any application

592
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,803
to be spin up for infrastructure
or core deployments.

593
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:34,530
So post migration, Brandon
spoke about time to market.

594
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,650
How do we make Crane's team more efficient

595
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,080
so that the time to market has improved?

596
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,730
It comes from two factors, right?

597
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,590
How fast can they deliver new
features to their business?

598
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,710
That comes from how well
they're governed between teams.

599
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,320
How fast can they take a business outcome

600
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,570
from their business,
deploy the infrastructure

601
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,000
that is required, develop the code,

602
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,920
and how do they push it fast enough?

603
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,950
I think automating all of
their both infrastructure

604
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,470
and code deployment
process into one repository

605
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,250
now enables them to act fast

606
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,303
and serve their customers much faster.

607
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,560
So, so far we have discussed the way

608
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,680
that they have migrated, you
know, now they're in AWS.

609
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,810
How did they approach migration?

610
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,510
Most customers who are new to AWS,

611
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,193
Crane was a customer who was new to AWS.

612
00:28:26,193 --> 00:28:29,040
When we work with them, we
usually do a lift and shift.

613
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,680
Let's take everything that
you have, let's put it in AWS

614
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,140
and let's think about modernization.

615
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,530
Brandon's directive to us
was, we need you to rethink

616
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,590
everything that you move over,
we need you to re-platform,

617
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,930
we need IAC, we need automation.

618
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,570
We don't want you to move
us from a VM to another VM

619
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,040
without adding value to us.

620
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,960
They wanted value from day one.

621
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,270
So that's where we took every application

622
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,250
that was forced from vendors,

623
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,990
you know, vendor specific applications.

624
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,993
We re-platform with automation,
moved them onto AWS.

625
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,440
Now the kicker is when Bannon mentioned

626
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,900
about how we wanted to
flip the team around

627
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,730
where his team takes more lead

628
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,550
and AWS takes backseat at a point.

629
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,370
That's where the refactoring, you know,

630
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,320
the time where we started refactoring,

631
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,970
that's where we have seen the shift.

632
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,770
Crane team came back to us and said,

633
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,290
we don't want you guys
doing all the work anymore.

634
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,970
We got trained, you know, we got,

635
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,010
you know, we have teams
now that are unscaled

636
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,950
they understand the environment
better for any applications

637
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,190
that Crane has built natively
within their business

638
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,290
that they want to move to more modern

639
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:35,100
cloud native applications
on AWS they wanted to do it

640
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,650
themself and they just
wanted AWS to be there

641
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,120
to just guiding them.

642
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,050
So think about a native
application built on Azure.

643
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,420
Even if they were using managed services,

644
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,820
like managed services for databases,

645
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,670
they would still want to move
into a managed service on AWS,

646
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,810
but wanted to use services
like serverless and B,

647
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:58,260
move off of SQL and even
move towards Postgresql

648
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,770
and have options like
global scaling enabled now.

649
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,330
So Crane team, as we have seen

650
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,370
have shifted from where we were leading

651
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,050
some of the migration initiatives.

652
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:10,020
Now they're designing how they
want to move those workloads

653
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,840
and also we're picking taking our advisory

654
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,900
during the process and have
really transformed the way

655
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,450
they're operating in cloud now.

656
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,740
At the end of it, what you
see now is Crane operating

657
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,040
more than 2,500 distinct AWS resources

658
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,880
with over 34,000 of Terraform
code return for them

659
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,400
with over 150 modules within Terraform

660
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,063
built to manage their environment.

661
00:30:34,063 --> 00:30:37,200
A foundational shift in the way
they were operating in Azure

662
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,200
towards an AWS where they have
taken their automation focus

663
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,720
as they move any workloads after.

664
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,370
Now they didn't stop there.

665
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,680
They started looking more
things that they can innovate

666
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,600
that can power from this migration.

667
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,500
I think Rusty now will walk us through

668
00:30:55,174 --> 00:30:57,630
what are most of some of
the forward looking outcomes

669
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,360
they're working with us. Rusty?

670
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,630
- Thanks Akhil.

671
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,080
Okay, so vision ahead.

672
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,140
So Brandon and Akhil
have talked to you about

673
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,810
a lot of the architecture
and what Brandon,

674
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,550
you know, what he wanted to do

675
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,840
and how we brought that to AWS.

676
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,640
So you know a lot about that so far,

677
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,680
but lemme just say this, I've known Crane

678
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,780
for about a year and a half or so,

679
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,960
and I can tell you one thing
they do not stand still.

680
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,690
So these couple of things
that we'll talk about,

681
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,490
and we've only got time
to highlight a couple,

682
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,183
but let's go over what
they're gonna build next.

683
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,350
So Brandon mentioned some
of this in his opening,

684
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,500
but the third party logistics industry

685
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,600
is just full of challenges.

686
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,070
You know, the complexities.

687
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,070
So all of these complexities
we looked at and we said,

688
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,470
hey, how can we go tackle
some of these complexities,

689
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,350
solve some of these
really important problems?

690
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,600
So I'm gonna summarize
just a few of them here

691
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,600
about what we went as our
direction to start solving.

692
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,650
So the first thing is
communications velocity.

693
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,650
So Crane is just constantly
talking with customers,

694
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,320
brokers, warehouses, operators
and drivers and all that,

695
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,760
you know, constant communication
creates dozens of messages

696
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,760
for each product that gets shipped.

697
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,750
Second, there's challenges
with predicting deliveries.

698
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,900
Yes, Crane can tell you
where your shipment is today,

699
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,330
but customers want to know
when is it gonna arrive

700
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,030
and can I start looking
out into the future?

701
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,130
Like Brandon talked about.

702
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,500
So third, and this one's really important,

703
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,890
Crane operates warehouses globally.

704
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,674
And if you think about
what they have to do,

705
00:32:49,674 --> 00:32:54,120
they've got to staff
warehouses efficiently.

706
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,620
If they don't have enough,

707
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,490
then you're gonna start creating
bottlenecks for shipments

708
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,010
that are coming through their pipeline.

709
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,660
But if they staff them too much,

710
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,660
then you're burning people and burning

711
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,223
the staff unfortunately, and
you're just wasting money.

712
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,570
So we wanted to make sure we
talked about warehouses too.

713
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,610
And then finally, just again,

714
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:23,100
the last one I wanted to highlight
is just manual processes.

715
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,050
So Crane teams are, you know,

716
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:29,610
just constantly manually
verifying documents,

717
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,460
cross-referencing data between systems,

718
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,970
making phone calls to
confirm and what is that?

719
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:39,120
That's really just a
not a lot of value add

720
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,830
in those particular activities,

721
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,590
but they're really necessary friction

722
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,740
that slows everything down
and introduces human error.

723
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,090
So Brandon and his team realized

724
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,530
that they wanted to take a crack at this.

725
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,400
So that's where we came
in with agentic AI.

726
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,880
So I'm gonna just very
briefly talk to you about

727
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,180
a few of the AI agents that
we are starting to build

728
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,140
with Crane.

729
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,810
So number one, the booking agent.

730
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,380
So the booking agent handles
the entire ordering process,

731
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,470
capturing requirements, checking capacity,

732
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:13,740
and confirming the order in seconds.

733
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,750
Second, the locator agent,

734
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,290
so the locator agent proactively
monitors every shipment

735
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,490
in real time answering the
"Where's my shipment question?"

736
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:24,663
in seconds.

737
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,780
The exceptions agent.

738
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,230
So the exceptions agent
instantly identifies issues

739
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,750
and either resolves them autonomously

740
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,100
or sends with context information

741
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,260
for a human to make a decision on.

742
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,350
So this is one that Brandon's
real passionate about

743
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,350
and exceptions handling is a really big

744
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,960
industry-wide issue that
we're hoping to solve

745
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,313
with agentic AI.

746
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,610
So next is predictor agent.

747
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,700
So predictor agents will
analyze historical data,

748
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,580
current conditions to forecast delay

749
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,023
in a particular shipment.

750
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,520
And then next the negotiator agent.

751
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,730
So this handles carrier negotiation

752
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,570
by analyzing market conditions,
historical performance

753
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:16,800
and capacity to secure
optimal pricing 24/7.

754
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,310
So really important to understand
this is just, you know,

755
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:24,180
five of the particular agents
that we've got identified now,

756
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:29,040
but with Amazon Bedrock
and Bedrock AgentCore,

757
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,340
we can see Crane adopting AI agents across

758
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,023
every part of their business.

759
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:38,440
So there's not enough in
this particular session

760
00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:43,500
to do a dive deep into their AI strategy.

761
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,860
But I wanna share with you
the three particular areas

762
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,700
that we focused on.

763
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,530
Number one, we're we're
focused on establishing secure

764
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,720
government access to foundation models

765
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,520
through Amazon Bedrock.

766
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,260
So this is absolutely critical

767
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,940
because Crane operates in
a highly regulated industry

768
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,440
with sensitive documents

769
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,563
and we couldn't have a
Wild West approach to AI.

770
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,410
Also, Amazon Bedrock provides
Crane with API access

771
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:17,520
to foundation models without
managing any infrastructure.

772
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,513
More importantly, it gives them
enterprise grade governance.

773
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:28,380
Second, we are building and
deploying AI agents securely

774
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,680
and at scale with a
quick path to production.

775
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,300
This is where Bedrock AgentCore

776
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,880
has been really transformative for us.

777
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,570
We can take a new use
case, prototype an agent,

778
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,930
test it with real data and
deploy it to production quickly.

779
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,723
And that's been game
changers for us and Crane.

780
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,050
And last, and this one's really important

781
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,810
was really just transformational for us

782
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,330
as we started talking about AI.

783
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,480
Is we have to use the data
that's there from Crane today.

784
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,420
So Crane has decades
of operational systems,

785
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,040
things like transportation
management systems or TMSs,

786
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,040
warehouse management systems or WMSs.

787
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,600
I've learned that, I think
y'all are teaching me

788
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,500
those terms, customs platforms,

789
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,530
carrier APIs and customer portals.

790
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,780
So short stories, we
couldn't rip and replace

791
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,680
all that stuff.

792
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,930
These are their systems
of records and they work

793
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,210
and we wouldn't wanna rip
and replace them anyway.

794
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:29,210
But the key part is
our AI agentic solution

795
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,853
had to work with their existing
platform so that was a must.

796
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,520
So this is the agentic AI

797
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:44,100
sort of call our architecture
that we're planning

798
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,570
moving forward.

799
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,090
So starting over at the left

800
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,010
is the front end applications layer.

801
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:55,010
This is where users will
actually interact with AI agents.

802
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,550
In the center there in the box
is Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

803
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,370
So this is where the intelligence will be,

804
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,250
where the AI agents actually operate.

805
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,383
Moving over to the right
between the AgentCore

806
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,030
and the data layer.

807
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,760
It's where we're building a
critical integration tier.

808
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,633
The AgentCore gateway, MCP
servers and custom tools.

809
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,630
And then if I could direct
your attention all the way over

810
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,490
to the right is that data layer

811
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,230
that we talked about just a minute ago.

812
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:29,970
So that's existing data
systems integration.

813
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,180
So systems that have been running
Cranes business for years.

814
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,960
So things like TMS/WMS, financial systems.

815
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,660
So these are the systems of record

816
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,560
and they'll continue to
operate just as they do.

817
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,830
So if there's one thing I could
encourage you to take away,

818
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,290
so our architectural
principles here are...

819
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,870
We're not replacing these systems at all,

820
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:55,050
we're augmenting them with intelligence.

821
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:58,140
The data will flow up through
the integration layer,

822
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,683
get processed by our agents
and insights will flow back.

823
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,710
So, what you're looking at here

824
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,743
is our agentic AI roadmap for Crane.

825
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,580
So the last innovation that
I wanted to bring up here

826
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,590
before we close out is...

827
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,683
Has anybody seen anything
on Amazon Leo this week?

828
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:25,320
So this is really exciting for us at AWS

829
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,170
and it goes beyond software and AI.

830
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,540
So one of the fundamental challenges

831
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,213
in global logistics is connectivity.

832
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,590
Crane operates warehouses,
distribution centers

833
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:41,370
all over the world in a
lot of remote locations.

834
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,320
So traditional internet connectivity

835
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,060
sometimes just isn't available.

836
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,130
Sometimes it's really expensive

837
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,320
or sometimes it's just not really good.

838
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,160
So that's why we're planning
to leverage Amazon LEO

839
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,800
AWS's satellite constellation.

840
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,930
It's gonna fundamentally change

841
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,063
how we think about connectivity for Crane.

842
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,110
So there's really four areas
that Crane is going to focus on

843
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,460
with Amazon Leo.

844
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,150
So first and foremost,
business continuity.

845
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,030
It's kind of an important
thing for a company like Crane.

846
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,340
So reliable internet that allows them

847
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,670
to establish robust backup
and recovery systems.

848
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:25,380
So that's kind of first and
foremost with Amazon Leo.

849
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,770
Second, weather resistant connectivity

850
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,440
during storms and severe weather events.

851
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,600
And for a logistics company like Crane,

852
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,253
that's really, really critical.

853
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,360
And then last Amazon Leo

854
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,750
provides comprehensive network redundancy.

855
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,720
So with enterprise
architecture best practices

856
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,340
and Crane does this,

857
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,360
they build in redundancy
all along the way.

858
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,360
So redundant servers, multiple
availability zones in AWS,

859
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,870
diverse network paths.

860
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:02,870
So Amazon LEO will now be part
of their redundancy strategy.

861
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,930
So it's not just another
connectivity option for Crane,

862
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,690
it's really a strategic enable for them.

863
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,150
So it ensures business continuity,

864
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,073
direct cloud connectivity as well.

865
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,410
So talk a little bit about
direct to cloud connectivity

866
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,943
with Amazon Leo.

867
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:28,690
This is really an
architecturally significant thing

868
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:32,070
for customers including Crane.

869
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:36,210
So when remote sites connect
to AWS, traffic typically flows

870
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:40,860
to the public internet, multiple
ISBs, internet exchanges

871
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,210
and network hops.

872
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,920
So what does that do?

873
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,660
It's gonna create latency.

874
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,620
Latency, potential
security vulnerabilities.

875
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,080
So Amazon LEO will change this.

876
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,900
Lower latency means that applications

877
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,250
that are in remote areas
will perform just as fast

878
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,910
as those that are in their
Houston headquarters.

879
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:05,670
So it's gonna be a real
game changer for them.

880
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,100
So remote sites will become extensions

881
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,340
of AWS cloud infrastructure.

882
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:15,900
So again, if we're implementing
or as we implement AI,

883
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,770
then those AI agents
can perform just as well

884
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:23,043
at a remote location as they
do in a major metro area.

885
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,140
So the last last thing is, you know,

886
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,260
Leo really is gonna provide
cloud grade connectivity

887
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,750
to places where it's never existed before.

888
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,813
So we're excited about
their plans with Amazon Leo.

889
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,920
So here I'm gonna pass it back to Brandon

890
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,920
and he's gonna give us a
summary of all the innovations

891
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,990
and the measurements
that his team undertook

892
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,513
on this move to AWS, so Brandon?

893
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,563
- Thanks Rusty.

894
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,270
So we have a rule in our organization,

895
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,970
if you can't measure
it, you can't manage it

896
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,470
and it probably didn't happen.

897
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,870
So we like stats, we like data.

898
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:06,420
So I'll just throw a few
things up for you here.

899
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,670
We talked about moving fast, right?

900
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:12,840
So we estimate that we've
increased our capability

901
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,140
to deploy by about 70%.

902
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,020
Largely because we've
taken a lot of click ops

903
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,000
out of deployment pipelines, right?

904
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,110
So we kind of estimate
over 10,000 operations

905
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,820
have been automated.

906
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,820
So now we're in a position
where we feel confident

907
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,860
with deployments, at least more confident

908
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,390
than we did before.

909
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,400
This was never about cost,

910
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,640
although I said we wanna be
good stewards of our resources.

911
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,120
So we ended up being about net neutral

912
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,190
even with the multi-cloud implementation,

913
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,380
which is a testament to the AWS team

914
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,570
and the design that they
helped us come up with.

915
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,910
And from a performance
standpoint, we talked about this,

916
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,590
but we measure our latency.

917
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,440
So sub two millisecond latency

918
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,590
for across cloud solutions is pretty good.

919
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:00,660
So we feel pretty confident about that.

920
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,570
And then from a security
standpoint, you know,

921
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:08,070
we measure drift now between
what we actually have deployed

922
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:11,400
and what our Terraform models
say should be deployed.

923
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,440
And so we can manage drift,

924
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,540
which helps us feel a lot more resilient

925
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,120
in our ability to be able
to push changes quickly

926
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,700
and know that from a security standpoint

927
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,200
no one's opened a door or a window

928
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,810
that we don't know about
and don't have sight on.

929
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:29,600
So with that, I will turn
it back over to you...

930
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,490
- Okay, so we just wanted
to finish the session off

931
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:36,990
with a few questions.

932
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,210
So Brandon, I've got one for you.

933
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,630
So undertaking a multi-cloud migration,

934
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,240
kind of, maybe it didn't
keep you up at night,

935
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,820
but maybe talk us through, you know,

936
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,930
sort of your mindset in going
into a multi-cloud migration

937
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,550
with AWS.

938
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,460
- Well it did keep me
up at night at first,

939
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,680
but you know, it was really about getting

940
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,680
to know the AWS organization.

941
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,090
Having confidence in our
ability to upskill our staff

942
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:08,460
and you guys helping us
create a training plan

943
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,030
and not only for, you know,
our staff to be able to learn

944
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:15,750
new skills, but then also
to help them be hands on

945
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,990
as we transition from
AWS leading the effort

946
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,220
to our teams leading the effort.

947
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,400
And we feel very, very
confident in our posture now.

948
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,590
So I think that was
probably more than anything,

949
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,600
look, the technical
things we could work out.

950
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,700
The cost we could work out,

951
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,590
but really having a firm foundation

952
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,500
that we felt really
confident moving forward

953
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,320
that we could administer largely ourselves

954
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,580
was really, really important.

955
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,660
- Yeah, awesome. Thank you for that.

956
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,760
And I do see some of the Crane folks,

957
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,830
folks on Brandon's team
out in the audience.

958
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,600
And I do have to say we couldn't
have done it without you,

959
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,130
so thanks for all your help.

960
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:49,050
Akhil, how about you? Any
questions for Brandon?

961
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,620
- Yeah, so Brandon, you work
with multiple cloud providers.

962
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,260
Probably wide variety of tech teams.

963
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,140
What stood out with the AWS
tech team that you worked with?

964
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,490
- I think it's the partnership.

965
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,560
Like I said, the DNA between our teams

966
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,003
is very, very similar.

967
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,970
You guys are very entrepreneurial.

968
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,520
You come up with ideas
like you talked about

969
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,120
with the VPC connections
for our backup to OCI

970
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,480
and the latency that we needed to hit.

971
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,320
So thinking outside the
box, staying on task,

972
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,320
and measuring everything,
moving very, very quickly

973
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,420
and then keeping the goal in mind.

974
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,120
It wasn't just a lift
and shift conversion.

975
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,960
We wanted to take this opportunity
to create an environment

976
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,230
that was more resilient, more scalable,

977
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,300
that we felt confident moving forward in.

978
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,340
And you guys, I mean
the partnership there,

979
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,200
I couldn't have asked for anything better.

980
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,460
- Awesome. Thank you Brandon.

981
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,050
Okay, so that ends our session.

982
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,090
We will be around here if
you have any questions,

983
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,553
but have a good rest of
re:Invent, thank you.
