1
00:00:00,519 --> 00:00:01,788
Thank you all for joining in.

2
00:00:02,119 --> 00:00:04,038
My name is uh Gurrinder Raju,

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:06,719
and I'm gonna be talking to you today about

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,060
how workspaces is powering the future.

5
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:10,919
Of work

6
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:14,948
And I'll be joined by a great cast of uh

7
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:16,809
speakers. I'll be joined by Ray,

8
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:19,769
who's gonna talk about what's new in workspaces

9
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:20,809
and what are the

10
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,309
newer capabilities that we added to the product.

11
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:26,638
That you should be excited about and incorporating

12
00:00:26,638 --> 00:00:27,478
in your workload?

13
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,429
I'll be joined by uh

14
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,630
Cody from Deloitte who is gonna talk

15
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,209
about.

16
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:36,029
How Deloitte uses workspaces at

17
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:36,810
scale,

18
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:39,348
and how workspaces enables Deloitte

19
00:00:39,348 --> 00:00:40,770
to meet the needs of

20
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:42,798
multiple different personas.

21
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:46,259
And uh I'll be joined by

22
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:48,700
uh Robert Green from Vision,

23
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:51,359
who's gonna talk about how Vision

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,060
is using, using multiple

25
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,139
workspace intelligence features

26
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,798
to build agentic capabilities

27
00:00:57,798 --> 00:01:00,079
and boost the productivity of their

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,740
end users and admits.

29
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:05,418
And towards the end, I'll come back to

30
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:07,909
the future of work and uh

31
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,299
have a discussion with you on what are the patterns

32
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:11,010
that are changing,

33
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,750
and what is that we are building to

34
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,829
define and drive the future of work.

35
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:19,209
Uh, you don't want to miss that out. Um.

36
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:22,230
And if you stay a little bit longer, I'll

37
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,269
be around to answer any of the questions and

38
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:26,418
maybe show you a cool couple demo demo

39
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:28,388
or two to see that what's cooking.

40
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,980
All of you have been going through an unprecedented

41
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,230
pace of change, and it's a little bit unique

42
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,829
to end-user computing because it's at the intersection

43
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,198
of so many things.

44
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,939
Computing, virtualization,

45
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:48,129
cybersecurity, data center exits,

46
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,469
agentic AI, you know,

47
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:53,448
uh, agents, frontier agents, productivity,

48
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:56,599
right? And uh.

49
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,359
I can relate to, I met

50
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,439
so many customers that we talked about there's just

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,430
too much changing,

52
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,439
right? And uh

53
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,698
let's pick up the first change

54
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:09,038
from this unprecedented pace of changes that you have

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,258
been tackling, which is the

56
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:11,860
increase in

57
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:15,419
On-premise virtualization software.

58
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,179
2X, 3X,

59
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:20,679
5X, 10X, in many cases more,

60
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,979
and this is creating real pressure on you to

61
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,558
accelerate the exit

62
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,979
of the data centers that you might still have

63
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,099
some workloads running in.

64
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:31,979
It doesn't stop there.

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,679
You have been tackling major

66
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,538
life cycle

67
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,879
events both on software,

68
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,939
operating system versions

69
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,240
and hardware versions.

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,020
And

71
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:48,770
it's very time-consuming and expensive,

72
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,439
especially when it gets coupled with

73
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:54,868
The, uh, the cost unpredictability

74
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:56,629
that I talked about in the previous slide.

75
00:02:58,538 --> 00:02:59,118
Keeps going,

76
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:00,179
you know,

77
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,599
Agentic AI is accelerating

78
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:05,649
across the entire industry and,

79
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:06,319
uh,

80
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:08,679
as you heard in Matt's keynote

81
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:11,020
and also Andy commented about it

82
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,659
is we at Amazon

83
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:14,819
believe that it's gonna

84
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:17,758
yield and deliver remarkable results.

85
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,058
And I see that in my own team, my

86
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:22,500
product and engineering teams.

87
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,308
Uh,

88
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:27,129
and have incorporated that in their daily work, and I'm

89
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:29,169
loving the increased pace that I

90
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:30,349
see on a daily basis.

91
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:35,149
All of you are being asked by your leaders

92
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:36,868
to incorporate agentic AI.

93
00:03:37,588 --> 00:03:39,710
So you are tackling this along with

94
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,990
the OS life cycle version events

95
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,819
and the

96
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,528
cost and predictability.

97
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:47,929
With great power comes great responsibility,

98
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:50,050
right? Like with the agentic AI increase, you

99
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,288
are having to tackle a

100
00:03:52,288 --> 00:03:52,969
new

101
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:55,558
surface area of uh threat

102
00:03:55,558 --> 00:03:56,469
vectors,

103
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:58,429
you know, um,

104
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,250
prompt injection.

105
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:02,258
Many of your

106
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,278
end users, many of your employees knowingly,

107
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,258
unknowingly,

108
00:04:06,558 --> 00:04:07,139
you know,

109
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:10,038
uh, leaking some of your confidential

110
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:12,439
information to chatbots or other

111
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,599
online GII tools, and

112
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,520
it's not good.

113
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,358
So you're having to rethink the tools you

114
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,139
use

115
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,699
to tackle these, right? Um,

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,420
it's a lot of

117
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,119
changes that you're adapting to.

118
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,480
I, I, I wanna show, do

119
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,480
a show of hands, right? Like, on how many of

120
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
you actually relate to it. Yeah, yeah, you're telling

121
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,500
me the story. That's how

122
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:37,879
my last 12 months or 18 months have been. Just

123
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,778
do a show of hands.

124
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:40,528
You know

125
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:43,778
Many hands showing up and then you're not

126
00:04:43,778 --> 00:04:46,059
alone, you know, and I'll chat

127
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:48,379
with you, I'll talk about on how workspaces

128
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:50,548
is enabling you to navigate the, the space

129
00:04:50,548 --> 00:04:51,319
of change

130
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,858
uh with the capabilities uh

131
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:55,660
uh that we have.

132
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,199
Before I do that, I'll just quickly refresh

133
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,100
your

134
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:03,678
mind about the portfolio of products

135
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,980
that we have under the Workspaces brand.

136
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,519
You have a full virtual desktop

137
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,369
available to you,

138
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:11,238
persistent, non-persistent.

139
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,040
You have uh application

140
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,119
only virtualization.

141
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,699
We have our own purpose-built streaming protocol

142
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,519
that we obsess on and keep investing in

143
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,730
to deliver a delightful end user experience.

144
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,519
We have thin client devices

145
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,009
for lightweight endpoints.

146
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,720
We have a secure browser. If all your end users

147
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,838
use SAS applications, it's a great option for

148
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:35,088
you. And then of course, uh,

149
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,939
you know, beyond all the.

150
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,619
Uh, native products that we have,

151
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,579
we also give you the capability with the

152
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,220
Workspace's core to bring your preferred

153
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,238
end user and admin experience,

154
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,399
uh,

155
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,178
to Workspace's infrastructure.

156
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,199
Let's go through one by one, a little more detail, right?

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,160
Start with desktops. Workspaces gives

158
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,199
you the option of Windows and operating,

159
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,509
Windows and Linux operating system choices.

160
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,619
Client OS, server OS,

161
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,439
we have the broadest selection of Linux flavors

162
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,220
across any cloud provider.

163
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:08,480
Um,

164
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,329
And then you can use them in multiple

165
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,569
configurations.

166
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:15,850
Tuning and tuning it for the workload

167
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,379
that you have with the persistent desktop,

168
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,019
with non-persistent desktop.

169
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:22,009
You can.

170
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,108
Uh, we are present in, uh, 20 regions

171
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:28,129
and counting. Over the next 9 to 18

172
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,290
months, you will see

173
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,928
that we'll be globally expanding, which means

174
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:34,309
that any new region that AWS launches

175
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:35,369
will also be present

176
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,608
at the day of the launch or soon after.

177
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,608
Uh,

178
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:42,920
We support the different identity choices

179
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,778
that, uh, you know, and then you can pick the identity

180
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:47,939
choice, whether it's a cloud directory or it's

181
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:50,040
a, uh, on-premise

182
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,559
directory,

183
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:53,220
and then we give you the option of a variety of bundle

184
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,379
sizes, whether it's storage, compute,

185
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,879
networking, and you can tune it to the needs that you have.

186
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,439
Um,

187
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:02,678
We support multiple differentiating features,

188
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,048
Amazon Global Accelerator, which routes

189
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:07,199
the end user traffic to the Amazon fiber as

190
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,108
quickly as possible,

191
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,750
and we have multi-region resiliency,

192
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:13,329
which gives you options for business

193
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:15,358
continuity and have a real tangible

194
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:16,449
disaster recovery plan.

195
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,028
So between persistent and non-persistent desktops,

196
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:21,709
varied bundle sizes,

197
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:24,660
global region availability and flexible identity

198
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,410
choices,

199
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,869
it's a very versatile, scalable

200
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:29,189
desktop infrastructure for you.

201
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,608
Let's move to application streaming. Not

202
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:35,988
everyone needs the full desktop experience.

203
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:37,670
Not one of your

204
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:40,309
end users need a start menu,

205
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:42,689
and many of your end users just work on a

206
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:44,470
select set of applications,

207
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:45,809
and

208
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,369
you can, you can use you can

209
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,548
use Workspace's applications,

210
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,269
previously called AppStream,

211
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,649
to give them an app-only experience and.

212
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,949
Tens of thousands of our customers

213
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:01,329
have used this to sacsify

214
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:02,709
their native applications

215
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,588
and make them instantly accessible

216
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:07,920
to their end users all over the world,

217
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:10,028
just like a web app, right?

218
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,588
And this model helps with the distribution

219
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:13,189
challenge.

220
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,988
No more complex software installations,

221
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,269
right, like a native app applications

222
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:20,269
become available just like

223
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:20,778
a URL.

224
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,949
Again, I talked about the disparate protocol.

225
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,988
Delightful end user experience is super important,

226
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:29,129
and this is the backbone of all the products

227
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:30,879
and services that you see here,

228
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:33,489
and we continue making foundational

229
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:34,279
investments.

230
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,038
This is our in-house,

231
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:38,710
our own DCV protocol.

232
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:42,067
We also give you choices for thin clients,

233
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:44,827
not only our own thin client, but from partners

234
00:08:44,827 --> 00:08:46,918
as well, and then this gives you the option

235
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:47,898
to decouple

236
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,398
the operating system from the

237
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:51,457
client device.

238
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:54,038
You can have a powerful desktop in

239
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:56,217
the cloud, and then you can have a very lightweight

240
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:57,447
thin client device.

241
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,398
I talked about the uh the secure browser.

242
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:03,969
This is this is very compelling,

243
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,129
and over time we have innovated on

244
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,489
very persona specific solutions,

245
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:09,570
right, and

246
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,048
secure browser starts at $7 a user

247
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:14,548
a month and for your end users

248
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:15,570
who are

249
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,928
primarily using SAS applications, this is

250
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:19,548
a great, great choice.

251
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,820
And of course,

252
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:24,879
All the other capabilities that I talked about.

253
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:27,928
We also give you the choice of bringing

254
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:30,178
your own preferred admin and end user

255
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:32,340
experience, and then make it run in the cloud

256
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,298
on AWS

257
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,599
and Workspace's reliant infrastructure.

258
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,320
So in summary, you get a comprehensive

259
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,558
toolkit of solutions.

260
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:43,259
Continue moving then, you know, how does

261
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:45,038
it talk, how does it help

262
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,658
solve the challenges that we talked about earlier,

263
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,989
you know. Workspace's

264
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,200
core gives you

265
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:53,989
access of the complete feature

266
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:55,099
set of your partner,

267
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:57,099
you know, and um

268
00:09:57,869 --> 00:09:59,989
You can bring your workload without

269
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:01,989
changes. So if you're getting pressure from your

270
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:04,029
leadership to accelerate data

271
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:06,029
center exit, this is a great, great tool

272
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:08,418
for you. Talked

273
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:10,500
about OS Lifecycle, hundreds

274
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,820
of thousands of end users are running

275
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,019
already on Windows 11

276
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:17,639
workspaces in the cloud on our services,

277
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,359
and uh

278
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,119
across the workspaces, pools and personal, both.

279
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,379
So,

280
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:26,099
we've enabled

281
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,259
these.

282
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:30,308
End users to onboard onto Windows 11

283
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:32,668
with our in-built migrate APIs,

284
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:34,950
moving from a previous version to a new version,

285
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:37,469
and many of these customers actually continue relying

286
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:38,849
on their previous hardware,

287
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:41,269
moving their full powered desktop to the

288
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:41,849
cloud

289
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,349
by keeping and keeping their endpoint and

290
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:45,529
client devices very simple.

291
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:49,529
Agentic AI accelerated agentic AI

292
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:50,330
adoption, right?

293
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,489
We, behind the scenes

294
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:54,070
have built

295
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:55,229
multiple

296
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:59,129
Intelligence capabilities, many of them

297
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:01,308
are visible to you, many of them are not visible to you,

298
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:03,928
and uh customers are leveraging

299
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:06,048
them. You'll see an example of that later today

300
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:06,849
when uh

301
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:11,090
when Vision talks about how they are using it to build Agentic

302
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,210
AI capabilities.

303
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,129
And then last, new cybersecurity

304
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:15,928
threat vector

305
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,908
surface that has emerged.

306
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,279
And then uh just to give you an example,

307
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,889
like a defense agency in Asia Pacific

308
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,190
rolled out secure browser to the tens of

309
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,489
thousands of users,

310
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:29,029
you know, to protect themselves against

311
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:31,428
threats like prompt injection and

312
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:33,469
uh you know, unintentional

313
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:34,570
leakage of data

314
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:36,379
through any of the chat chat,

315
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,259
you know, chatbots and GAI tools.

316
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,690
Pixel streaming gives you

317
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,489
ephemeral access to the browser,

318
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,950
which is completely isolated from the client

319
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,489
device,

320
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,859
and it gives you great protection against these

321
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:52,129
cybersecurity threats.

322
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,668
These are not the only challenges we help you with.

323
00:11:56,969 --> 00:11:58,830
We have been innovating for a decade.

324
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:01,379
And uh, you know.

325
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,129
Innovating

326
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,129
by

327
00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:06,840
introducing new pricing models.

328
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:09,710
Workspaces when GA in 2014, we launched

329
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,989
the RE model soon after that,

330
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,629
and uh we give you continued and

331
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,619
increased selection of both client OS,

332
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:19,450
server OS, Linux choices,

333
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:21,369
you know, and uh

334
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,820
as I said, we keep innovating based

335
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,168
upon the persona.

336
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:27,969
One size does not fit all, and we don't

337
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:30,168
want you to overprovision. To that, we launched

338
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:31,668
Tapstream in 2016,

339
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,269
and we launched uh Secure Browser

340
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:37,168
uh somewhere late 2020, 2021.

341
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:40,019
The pace is only accelerating.

342
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,908
You know, and if you look at the last 3 years,

343
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:45,190
there are so many favorite features that I have

344
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,048
that I've been very, very deeply,

345
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:49,908
uh, connected to in launching, right?

346
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:52,389
The selection keeps on increasing. We have

347
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:54,820
launched new versions of Linux, Rocky, Ral,

348
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,288
Ubuntu, launched uh Multi-region

349
00:12:57,288 --> 00:12:58,070
Resilience,

350
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:00,428
Amazon Global Accelerator for faster,

351
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:02,009
uh, you know, end user

352
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,609
experience.

353
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,580
And we launched Workspace's core.

354
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,178
A conferencing is optimized

355
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:10,820
across all major vendors.

356
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:15,719
What does it mean?

357
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,700
With this accelerated pace of innovation, we,

358
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:21,139
AWS is recognized as a leader in desktop

359
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,139
as a service by Gartner for the 2nd year in

360
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:23,739
a row,

361
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:25,928
you know, and uh

362
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,099
it's a

363
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,379
I would say it's a great testimonial to our capabilities

364
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:32,408
and obsession and our continued

365
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:34,869
perseverance in innovating in this area

366
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:35,889
for the last 10 years.

367
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,678
With that,

368
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,940
I will hand over to Ray, who will

369
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,090
go through some of these newer features in a bit

370
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,058
more detail.

371
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,619
And uh

372
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:47,570
thank you, Ray.

373
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,609
Thank you, thank you, Grinder.

374
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:52,690
All right. Hello. Good afternoon,

375
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:55,048
everyone. My name is Rai

376
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:55,590
Wang.

377
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:58,408
I lead one of the product management

378
00:13:58,408 --> 00:14:00,649
teams in Amazon workspaces

379
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:03,149
focusing on end user experience.

380
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:05,769
So today, I'm excited to share

381
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:07,940
with you uh some of the

382
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:10,250
uh recent launches that we

383
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,369
made this year.

384
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:16,330
Uh, you know, Amazon workspaces,

385
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:19,139
uh, service customers across different

386
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,048
industry segments,

387
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:22,460
right? So from assembly lines

388
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,139
to the trading floor, from hospitals

389
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,479
to the, uh, uh, government

390
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:28,519
agencies,

391
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,899
workspaces has become

392
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,259
the trusted solution for many

393
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:35,658
of our customers across a diverse

394
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:36,820
set of cases.

395
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,940
We're always looking to hear from

396
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,139
you and learn from our customers

397
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:44,509
about their unique needs.

398
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:47,058
So even after this session, we'll be happy

399
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:49,308
to talk to you about your needs,

400
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,219
how we can iterate on workspaces

401
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:54,418
to, to uh meet your needs better.

402
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,109
Right. As you can see from here,

403
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:01,109
organizations of all sizes

404
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,989
trust workspaces with their desktop

405
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:05,889
and application streaming needs.

406
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:08,859
These logos represent more

407
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:10,808
than just customers to us.

408
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:13,599
To us, they're our partners

409
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:14,979
in innovation, right?

410
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:17,558
They help us to continue to

411
00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:19,158
refine workspaces

412
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,418
to meet the evolving demands

413
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:23,580
of uh enterprise,

414
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:24,359
uh, modern

415
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,500
work, workplaces.

416
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,178
All right. So let's talk about our 2025

417
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:33,259
launches, right? 2025

418
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:35,700
has been a great year for our workspaces.

419
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,619
We made some headways across

420
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:40,979
security, performance, and usability.

421
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:46,178
All right, let's start, let's dive into

422
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,788
a few areas where we made some strides

423
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:51,038
this year. Let's

424
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:52,308
start with delivering

425
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,590
delightful end user experience.

426
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:57,580
what does that mean, right?

427
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,379
A delightful end user experience

428
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,399
to us means that the virtual desktops

429
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,178
and or the application should feel very responsive

430
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:09,200
and natural, just like the physical

431
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
one. If a user

432
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,479
can use their local laptop

433
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:14,399
to do something,

434
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,879
we feel like they should be able to do

435
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,879
the exact same thing, maybe even better

436
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,200
with their workspaces,

437
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,840
even under challenging network

438
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,928
conditions. So this

439
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:27,330
year, you know, to deliver this delightful

440
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,788
end user experience,

441
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:31,649
we first improved our peripheral

442
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:34,250
support. We launched generic

443
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,440
USB redirection for

444
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,529
some to help users use some of these

445
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,989
common uh USB devices

446
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:41,729
such as

447
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,469
payment devices or uh

448
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:47,149
uh barcode scanners

449
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:49,369
that takes care of a variety of use

450
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:51,609
cases that have peripheral needs.

451
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,408
We also added support for

452
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:56,048
webau redirection,

453
00:16:56,408 --> 00:16:59,090
uh, which allows users to use

454
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,129
security keys such as UBKs

455
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:03,678
or even Windows Hello

456
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:05,689
within their workspaces session.

457
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:09,969
And in addition, we have collaborated

458
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:10,809
with Wacom,

459
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,400
the industry's leading

460
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,489
professional drawing tablet maker.

461
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:18,098
Uh, to give professional

462
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:20,400
artists such as, uh,

463
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,759
visual effects artists or,

464
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:23,719
uh,

465
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:26,578
yeah, different professional artists,

466
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:28,890
uh, a way to use Wacom

467
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,059
tablets and all the special features they

468
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:33,900
have in their Wacom tablets, plus

469
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,039
their Wacom pens all within

470
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:38,880
their workspaces seamlessly

471
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,259
under ultra low latency, right?

472
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,598
So this is something called Wacom Bridge

473
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:45,420
that uh we have launched with them.

474
00:17:46,328 --> 00:17:46,868
Uh,

475
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,868
in addition,

476
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:50,289
right, for audio and video workloads

477
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:51,729
like web conferencing,

478
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:54,049
we have collaborated closely with

479
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:55,509
Microsoft this year

480
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:58,068
to launch a public preview

481
00:17:58,068 --> 00:17:59,189
of Teams

482
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:01,250
optimization for VDI.

483
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:05,729
This feature offloads the

484
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:08,420
team's audio and video packets

485
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:08,959
from

486
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,229
the remote workspaces host

487
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,209
to your local client and

488
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,420
significantly reduces the CPU and memory

489
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:16,979
consumption.

490
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,229
In addition to that, we also

491
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:23,430
improved international keyboard support.

492
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:26,029
Now, with special

493
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:28,430
languages like Hebrew or languages

494
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,630
with dead keys,

495
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,009
users can seamlessly type

496
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:34,140
whatever they want in their workspaces.

497
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,799
And lastly, we launched a feature called

498
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:39,068
client auto update.

499
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,098
This makes it super easy for

500
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:44,380
users to get the latest features

501
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,170
and security updates from workspaces

502
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,920
without any

503
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:50,098
administrative intervention.

504
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:52,459
All right.

505
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,838
On the networking,

506
00:18:54,348 --> 00:18:55,180
networking front,

507
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,680
uh, we also integrated with

508
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,279
Amazon Global Accelerator,

509
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:00,500
so AGA.

510
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,789
Uh, this dramatically improves

511
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:06,180
connection stability and performance

512
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,709
worldwide across the globe.

513
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:10,309
This means fewer dropped connections,

514
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:11,130
more

515
00:19:11,469 --> 00:19:13,680
smooth streaming experience, and

516
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,049
more consistent end user experience.

517
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,689
Even for remote workers living

518
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:20,289
in like challenging

519
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:22,009
network environments.

520
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:27,660
The second major, major area of

521
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,219
innovation for us is um

522
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:32,519
global selection and presence.

523
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,608
Our customers have told us that

524
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,049
they would like more flexibility,

525
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,400
especially regarding the compute

526
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,939
and storage options associated

527
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:44,459
with workspaces, right?

528
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:47,420
So they want to use the latest and greatest

529
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,219
from EC2 instances

530
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,779
that can exactly match their

531
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:53,900
applications need while keeping the cost

532
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,519
in check.

533
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:56,380
So this year,

534
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:59,269
we're happy to announce that we're, we have launched

535
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:01,588
175 new

536
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:03,818
instance types for workspaces

537
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:05,180
applications. Uh,

538
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:07,588
including the latest compute

539
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:09,809
optimized, memory optimized,

540
00:20:09,828 --> 00:20:11,848
and accelerated instance types.

541
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:13,880
For storage,

542
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,279
we also increase to up to

543
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,858
500 gigabytes of desk storage,

544
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,279
up from 200.

545
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,289
And most importantly,

546
00:20:23,568 --> 00:20:25,689
we launched a new feature that allows

547
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:28,029
you to import your own image

548
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:30,368
to workspaces applications.

549
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:33,250
A lot of our customers have told us that

550
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,689
they uh have their own golden image

551
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:38,809
CICD pipeline or they have

552
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:41,029
their custom tools that helps them

553
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,209
to maintain the freshness of those

554
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,328
image and keeps them updated.

555
00:20:45,848 --> 00:20:47,750
Now you can keep all of

556
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:50,400
uh image pipelines

557
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:52,680
and then export those when you're ready

558
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,269
and import them into workspaces

559
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:57,680
applications. This greatly reduces

560
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,039
the manual operational efforts that

561
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:00,759
admins

562
00:21:01,078 --> 00:21:03,989
had to do previously to use workspaces

563
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:06,269
applications. Lastly,

564
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:08,890
we also introduced 4 new

565
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,640
regions

566
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:12,410
support, which brings the total number

567
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,049
of regions across the globe to 20

568
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,729
for workspaces applications.

569
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,809
And that's not all, right? So global

570
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:22,989
presence and selection is also important

571
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:25,209
for the customers that want to use our

572
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:27,259
partner solutions like Citrix

573
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:30,150
DS with workspace's infrastructure.

574
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:31,809
So this year,

575
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:34,608
we launched a new feature called Workspace's

576
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:36,328
core Managed Instances.

577
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,180
Uh, With this, this

578
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,578
greatly simplified VDI

579
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:44,000
deployment for these kind of customers,

580
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:47,618
allowing them to use highly customizable

581
00:21:47,618 --> 00:21:48,969
instance configurations,

582
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:51,539
including almost all the EC2

583
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,229
instance types that you can think of,

584
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,799
right? And they can do it all

585
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,358
within the security and governance

586
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,799
um boundaries of their uh

587
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:02,539
own AWS account.

588
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:05,598
So this is great news for those

589
00:22:05,598 --> 00:22:06,430
customers as well.

590
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,098
All right.

591
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,108
And lastly,

592
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,759
another area of focus for us this

593
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,160
year is with our secure browser

594
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,759
product. For secure browser,

595
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,088
we first made significant

596
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:23,130
performance improvements in session

597
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,108
start time.

598
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:27,269
Uh, we, uh, up to 50%

599
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:29,368
more, uh, faster, reducing

600
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:31,449
the friction of launching secure browser

601
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:32,868
session, sessions.

602
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:36,180
You know, our new two-bar configurability

603
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,608
also allows organizations to customize

604
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,118
the user experience,

605
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,539
uh, while maintaining security control,

606
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:45,269
right? We also launched CloudWatch

607
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:47,180
metrics for secure browser,

608
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:48,858
allowing the admins,

609
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,509
giving them the visibility they need

610
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:53,949
to, uh, into the

611
00:22:53,949 --> 00:22:55,949
customer um end user usage

612
00:22:55,949 --> 00:22:58,108
patterns and also potentially

613
00:22:58,108 --> 00:22:59,088
security events.

614
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,348
Most importantly,

615
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,559
On the security front,

616
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:05,959
we also introduced three

617
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,299
features this year,

618
00:23:07,838 --> 00:23:10,459
inline reduction for sensitive

619
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:12,939
content, web content filtering,

620
00:23:13,118 --> 00:23:14,618
and session logging.

621
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,469
These, uh, combination of

622
00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:18,279
these

623
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:20,959
three features allowed IT admins

624
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:23,039
to maintain control over the

625
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,078
potential data exfiltration,

626
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:25,818
uh,

627
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,469
uh, risks.

628
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:30,709
All right. With that, I will

629
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,759
hand it over to Corey

630
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,809
from Deloitte to talk about how

631
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:38,068
they leverage these workspaces innovations

632
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:39,949
for different personas in Deloitte.

633
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:43,269
All right, thanks, Ray.

634
00:23:44,348 --> 00:23:46,519
Hello, my name's Corey Weeden. I'm a senior

635
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:48,729
cloud engineer at Deloitte. Oh, there it is.

636
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
Um, I work primarily on our VDI team

637
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,039
supporting our AWS workspaces environment.

638
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,779
Today I wanna talk to you about our journey

639
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:55,838
to workspaces.

640
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,509
So let's start with who are we, right?

641
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:01,449
Some of you guys are probably coming from Fortune 500

642
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:03,608
companies, maybe uh, a US

643
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,729
based company, um, maybe even you're coming

644
00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:06,479
from Deloitte.

645
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:08,930
Um, but there's probably a good chance either

646
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,049
way that you've probably come across the green dot

647
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:11,709
at some point,

648
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:13,789
right? And why is that? It's because

649
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:15,269
nearly 90%

650
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,689
of Fortune 500 companies trust Deloitte, and

651
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:20,088
we are also supporting over 8500

652
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:21,709
US based firms.

653
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,588
Right. So Deloitte employs

654
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:27,209
about 180,000, maybe more

655
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:28,608
US employees all around the world.

656
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,269
So with that, there's a need for virtual desktops.

657
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,858
So what did it look like before we had workspaces?

658
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,858
Well, our team was supporting 7 on-prem

659
00:24:37,858 --> 00:24:39,939
environments, right? And if you have, or if you've

660
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:42,250
had an on-prem VDI environment, you're

661
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,420
probably familiar with some of the challenges, right?

662
00:24:44,729 --> 00:24:46,779
Operational overhead, hardware

663
00:24:46,939 --> 00:24:48,759
that you have to manage yourself, doing your own

664
00:24:49,098 --> 00:24:51,380
OS upgrades, server patching, compliance,

665
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,309
you name it, right?

666
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:54,750
And our personal favorite, the chargeback

667
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,858
model, right? What does that look like? How do we charge

668
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:57,799
our users?

669
00:24:58,338 --> 00:24:59,578
Do we just give them a flat rate?

670
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:01,390
Do we try and estimate,

671
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,750
you know, if you don't know what your environment's gonna look

672
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,049
like in 6 to 12 months, how do you estimate

673
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:07,598
how much each machine costs,

674
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,709
right? So

675
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,368
then

676
00:25:13,118 --> 00:25:15,500
There it is in, uh, 2020, right? COVID

677
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,059
hits.

678
00:25:16,828 --> 00:25:18,049
And everyone gets sent home,

679
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,549
right? But not only are people now working from

680
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:22,719
home, we still have our new hires that are being on boarded.

681
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,068
We also have our intern programs that are still running.

682
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:27,910
We also have just your everyday break fix

683
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,420
situations.

684
00:25:28,949 --> 00:25:30,989
So how do we do that

685
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:33,410
when we have a supply chain bottleneck

686
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,328
when it's hard to get physical assets, right?

687
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,180
So we needed a lot of virtual desktops, and we

688
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,140
needed them quickly,

689
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,539
right? So in comes workspaces, right? A

690
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,858
fully managed service that we could use

691
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:46,000
to scale out seamlessly

692
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,699
and quickly.

693
00:25:47,939 --> 00:25:48,838
With workspaces,

694
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,338
we didn't have to worry about the, the

695
00:25:51,338 --> 00:25:53,588
hardware management, right? We don't have to do our own server

696
00:25:53,588 --> 00:25:55,848
patches or upgrades or anything like that anymore,

697
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:58,108
and we don't have to worry about how much space are we

698
00:25:58,108 --> 00:26:00,180
gonna need in 6 months or how quickly can

699
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,380
we rack and stack more hardware to get that space

700
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:02,959
available.

701
00:26:03,338 --> 00:26:05,299
Amazon handles that for us, right?

702
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:08,380
So Workspaces give us the ability to scale

703
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,910
up, scale out, and we can do it globally

704
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,910
across 8 regions, all from the same pane,

705
00:26:13,068 --> 00:26:14,328
all in the same console,

706
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,209
right? But

707
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,868
who, who uses workspaces,

708
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,750
right? At the way we have a lot of different personas,

709
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:23,608
we have a lot of different types of people using,

710
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:26,309
uh, workspaces, you know, from your daily task

711
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:28,348
worker or maybe it's an executive who just

712
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:30,390
needs to log in to check their email or maybe join a

713
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:30,989
Teams call,

714
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,430
right? Maybe we have project teams that are

715
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,650
using workspaces for their contractors.

716
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,989
Maybe they don't have time to ship a laptop

717
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:40,348
across the globe to get their

718
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,809
contract work and they need to start work today.

719
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:44,939
We also have a lot of developers who are using

720
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:47,219
workspaces as their secure development

721
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:49,459
environment, right? So we give them a full-blown

722
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,739
8 CPU machine and they can have their

723
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:52,959
own development environment.

724
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:56,479
Our, how, how can we deploy

725
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:58,500
all these machines so quickly, right? In the

726
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,338
heart of COVID when everyone needs a virtual machine

727
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,459
right away,

728
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,420
our development teams were able to

729
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:06,078
create a self-service provisioning

730
00:27:06,078 --> 00:27:08,199
process to where no matter where you are in the world

731
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:10,279
or whatever time in the world it is, you

732
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:12,380
didn't have to wait for the US team to

733
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:14,479
wake up or submit a ticket and

734
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:16,539
wait for the ticketing process to get a workspace,

735
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,019
you could deploy your own machine.

736
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:21,259
And at the heart of COVID, I think our team was

737
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:23,539
supporting north of 15,000 workspaces,

738
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,959
but that was just for personal.

739
00:27:25,618 --> 00:27:28,118
Today our team is supporting workspaces personal,

740
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,880
secure browser,

741
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,180
and even pooled, and that just gives us the

742
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,578
ability to fulfill even more use cases

743
00:27:34,578 --> 00:27:35,318
across the

744
00:27:35,858 --> 00:27:36,400
company.

745
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:40,838
And in in partnership with AWS

746
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,189
we've we've come up with a simpler

747
00:27:43,189 --> 00:27:45,420
workflow, a smoother workflow to create

748
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,809
and manage our existing workspace

749
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:48,459
images,

750
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,239
and that's helped us in a couple areas

751
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:53,799
like our Windows 11 migration and

752
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,059
onboarding Ubuntu workspaces for our Linux

753
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:58,289
friends. We've also

754
00:27:58,289 --> 00:27:59,269
started exploring

755
00:27:59,568 --> 00:28:01,809
a simpler authentication flow, a,

756
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,088
a more modern identity alignment with

757
00:28:04,328 --> 00:28:06,150
tra ID workspaces.

758
00:28:06,848 --> 00:28:08,890
We have enhanced observability with Project

759
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,689
Hawkeye,

760
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,289
and of course, if you haven't heard about it

761
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:14,769
already, we're trying, we are exploring

762
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,809
the capabilities of workspaces

763
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:19,348
and how we can develop, enhance and optimize

764
00:28:19,568 --> 00:28:20,189
the next

765
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:22,189
AI capability,

766
00:28:22,608 --> 00:28:24,959
right? And so with that,

767
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:27,259
I will turn it over to Gariner.

768
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:34,809
Thank you, Cody. Thank you.

769
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:43,140
As you can see, this is my favorite slide, right?

770
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:46,479
I'm incorporating it for the 2nd time. Like,

771
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:48,848
I like this so much because this, you know, shows

772
00:28:48,848 --> 00:28:50,269
and presents the work of the team.

773
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,509
It shows the accelerated pace

774
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:55,108
of what we are doing for our customers

775
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,630
and how it enables customers like Deloitte to

776
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,890
leverage our solutions and meet the needs

777
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,130
of demanding needs of different

778
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,848
personas that they take care of, right?

779
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,818
So I talked about how we started early

780
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:09,019
on, kinda, you know, introducing new pricing

781
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:11,318
models, uh, newer selection,

782
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:13,900
and, uh, uh, you know, newer

783
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,680
solutions

784
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,459
for each price to performance point

785
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:19,779
and different personas that you need workspaces, secure

786
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:21,410
browser, application,

787
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:23,500
uh, streaming with uh with AppStream.

788
00:29:23,858 --> 00:29:25,979
And since then, the kind of pace has accelerated,

789
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:28,358
right? Like identity choices, networking,

790
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,979
uh, features, and user features,

791
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:32,559
enabling you to, you know,

792
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,358
uh, use cloud Directory, multi-region resilience,

793
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:36,559
uh, AGA.

794
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,380
There are 4

795
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:41,000
features in here that I like to particularly

796
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,078
call out, right? If you see kind of

797
00:29:43,078 --> 00:29:43,699
the dancing

798
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,219
boxes, right, like, I think those are the

799
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:48,318
4 that I'll call out, which kind of gives

800
00:29:48,318 --> 00:29:49,858
me a good segue into the next section.

801
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:53,118
These four features are Workspace's

802
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:53,779
core,

803
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,318
when we launched it in, uh, like I

804
00:29:56,318 --> 00:29:59,019
think 3 years ago, around kind of 2022,

805
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,598
and enabling you to bring your

806
00:30:01,598 --> 00:30:03,660
M365 applications onto

807
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,719
workspaces, the entire workspace's suite

808
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:06,479
of products.

809
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,890
The third one is the image onboarding

810
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,920
improvements that we've done where

811
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:14,219
we use AI behind the

812
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:16,380
scenes to self-heal

813
00:30:16,699 --> 00:30:18,858
a lot of the issues that might be

814
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,338
there in the image that would have otherwise

815
00:30:21,338 --> 00:30:22,719
required a lot of work

816
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,059
to be done by you.

817
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:27,670
And we launched Workspace's core

818
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,670
managed instances earlier this year to give you the full

819
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,269
selection of, uh, you know,

820
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:33,769
uh, your partner feature set and

821
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:35,059
the best of AWS, right?

822
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:36,259
Together,

823
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,568
these features help you.

824
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:40,130
These features

825
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,868
help us to meet you where you are and

826
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:44,910
accelerate the move from

827
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,729
your on-premise environments

828
00:30:47,189 --> 00:30:49,219
and uh moving on to

829
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:50,689
cloud-enabled fully

830
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,229
managed solutions, you know, on a, on

831
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:54,650
a digital workplace. So,

832
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,489
We have multiple partners who have integrated with

833
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:02,000
Workspace's core, right? Like with Citrix

834
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,009
and Omnisa,

835
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,500
you have, we have coverage and you

836
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,578
have coverage of vast majority of

837
00:31:07,578 --> 00:31:09,000
on-premise workloads,

838
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,400
you know, and uh which you could

839
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,799
migrate to,

840
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,420
uh, you know, the AWSN workspace's

841
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,318
infrastructure.

842
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:17,979
And with WorkSpot,

843
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:19,799
LeoStream, and Vision,

844
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,439
this gives you

845
00:31:21,818 --> 00:31:23,479
a fully managed.

846
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:26,358
Digital workplace solution powered by

847
00:31:26,358 --> 00:31:27,838
workspaces and AWS.

848
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,519
So, the next section

849
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,880
I want to talk to you about is

850
00:31:34,578 --> 00:31:36,618
not only these capabilities, workspace's

851
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:38,779
native capabilities, workspace's partner

852
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:39,618
capabilities,

853
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:42,199
but there's been a lot of innovation

854
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:44,368
that we and the broader AWS

855
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:45,680
have collaborated on,

856
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:48,019
which gives you intelligence capabilities.

857
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:49,180
Like, so, for example,

858
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:51,939
AWS has launched multiple MCPs.

859
00:31:52,098 --> 00:31:54,449
Feature set where workspaces, APIs

860
00:31:54,449 --> 00:31:56,539
are already integrated for you to build

861
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,618
agentic solutions. At the same

862
00:31:58,618 --> 00:31:59,209
time,

863
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,858
newer agentic applications

864
00:32:01,858 --> 00:32:02,900
like uh

865
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,420
uh QuickSuite and Quiro

866
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:08,170
are enabling the customers to build,

867
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,838
uh, you know, and accelerate

868
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,739
uh their own product feature set.

869
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,848
So with that, I will hand it over to Robert

870
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,088
Green, who is the CEO of Vision to talk

871
00:32:17,088 --> 00:32:19,650
about on how they're leveraging these intelligence capabilities

872
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,348
and workspaces broadly

873
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:23,989
to boost their end user and admin productivity.

874
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,509
Alright, good afternoon.

875
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:33,979
I'm Rob Green, CEO of Vision. Uh,

876
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:34,769
today I'm gonna,

877
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,130
uh, show you something with that

878
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,130
will hopefully fundamentally change the way you think

879
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,390
about desktop as a service.

880
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:42,348
So imagine an AI assistant,

881
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:44,559
uh, that lives inside your desktop,

882
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,009
one that actually knows you. It knows

883
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:48,479
your applications,

884
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:50,430
your workflows, your data,

885
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:51,750
uh, your history,

886
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:54,549
not a generic chatbot, a personalized

887
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:57,108
intelligence that understands your context

888
00:32:57,328 --> 00:32:58,568
and anticipates your needs.

889
00:32:59,118 --> 00:32:59,650
What if

890
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,318
your help desk can answer uh

891
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:04,348
an issue before the user puts a ticket

892
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:06,640
in? What if your finance team could

893
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,799
ask a simple question and get detailed cloud

894
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:09,689
cost breakdown

895
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:11,459
directly from their desktop?

896
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,189
This isn't science fiction,

897
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,160
this is what

898
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:16,019
we are working on now.

899
00:33:16,358 --> 00:33:18,559
Oops. Hit

900
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,199
the wrong button.

901
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:21,088
There we go. Alright,

902
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:22,130
sorry about that.

903
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,828
So first, a quick intro in vision. Uh, so

904
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:25,769
we're 14 years old,

905
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:28,299
um, we, we, we're the only vendor managed

906
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,709
desk, uh, that combines the enterprise desktops,

907
00:33:30,949 --> 00:33:33,449
um, with, uh, instant provisioning.

908
00:33:33,949 --> 00:33:34,618
Uh, we, uh,

909
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,229
you know, traditional VDI, uh, deployments

910
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:39,229
take about 4 months. Um, we

911
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:39,848
can deliver,

912
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:42,338
uh, secure, compliant virtual desktops

913
00:33:42,338 --> 00:33:43,410
in about 4 hours.

914
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,979
That's not an incremental improvement,

915
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,229
that's a paradigm shift.

916
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:49,868
Our platform is end to end, zero trust

917
00:33:49,868 --> 00:33:51,969
access, always on compliance,

918
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,348
and everything um in, in

919
00:33:54,348 --> 00:33:56,459
between. Built on AWS

920
00:33:56,459 --> 00:33:57,828
purpose built for the enterprise.

921
00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:00,338
So let me give you a quick tour of our product

922
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,539
suite and dive a little bit um into

923
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:03,920
the AI innovation.

924
00:34:04,219 --> 00:34:06,289
So our philosophy is uh

925
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:08,679
no assembly required, batteries included.

926
00:34:08,978 --> 00:34:10,478
Uh, so we have a DAS platform

927
00:34:10,938 --> 00:34:13,300
that is your complete virtual desktop infrastructure,

928
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,679
industry leading protocol,

929
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,789
automation, unified management.

930
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,958
Our cloud PC is our persistent,

931
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,878
uh, uh, cloud desktop on AWS,

932
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:24,478
uh, again built for enterprise grade performance.

933
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:26,887
Overwatch monitoring, um,

934
00:34:27,378 --> 00:34:29,418
essentially allowing you to be proactive

935
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:31,818
and no problems before your end users do.

936
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:34,717
Um, our Halo, uh, browser isolation,

937
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:37,418
uh, not secure enterprise browser but secure

938
00:34:37,418 --> 00:34:38,358
every browser.

939
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,748
Um, Security Pulse, which is our comp our

940
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:42,858
continuous compliance automation

941
00:34:42,858 --> 00:34:44,898
for HIPPAA, uh, SOC, as

942
00:34:44,898 --> 00:34:45,778
well as PCI,

943
00:34:46,259 --> 00:34:48,697
and our managed instances which gives us full service

944
00:34:48,697 --> 00:34:50,927
or co-managed, um, again, to,

945
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:52,338
to flex to meet what you need.

946
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,239
So our new buy now portal is our self-service

947
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,559
deployment that allows you to get to production

948
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:58,889
uh even faster.

949
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,429
So, um, now here's where it gets

950
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:02,418
really interesting.

951
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,760
Uh, let, let me show you what we are uh

952
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,800
leveraging Workspace's intelligence to bring

953
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,340
Agenic AI to the desktop.

954
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,179
So we've integrated

955
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,619
workspaces intelligence across 5 key areas.

956
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:16,878
Uh, each one represents a real

957
00:35:16,878 --> 00:35:18,898
problem that enterprises struggle with today.

958
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,519
And an AI powered solution that's becoming

959
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,619
more and more a reality.

960
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:25,378
So the first is self-healing image onboarding.

961
00:35:26,228 --> 00:35:28,269
Rapid, reliable, and repeatable process

962
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:30,469
to onboard your OS image, so you can import

963
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:32,590
that image that you've been working on, part

964
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,809
of your, your, your, your CICD pipeline

965
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:37,369
or whatever um you've used in the past.

966
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:40,769
Uh, flexibility at every uh uh

967
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,530
uh flexibility for your journey.

968
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:45,329
So that really means uh we support core bundles

969
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:47,668
and core managed instances, providing flexibility

970
00:35:47,668 --> 00:35:49,208
to use workspaces your way.

971
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:52,719
Vision's AI cloud PC Ask Ray,

972
00:35:52,878 --> 00:35:54,918
which I'll be talking about more um after

973
00:35:54,918 --> 00:35:57,119
this. Our AI system that lives

974
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,128
inside the desktop,

975
00:35:58,438 --> 00:36:00,478
users can ask questions, get

976
00:36:00,478 --> 00:36:02,550
help, and solve problems without data

977
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,110
ever leaving their desktop.

978
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,188
Our AI powered troubleshooting,

979
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:08,000
um,

980
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:10,478
correlating logs, metrics,

981
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:11,398
and sessions

982
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,030
across across systems takes hours

983
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,750
for normal admins. Ray can do it instantly,

984
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:19,269
which I will show, uh, here shortly.

985
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,269
And then AI driven cost management,

986
00:36:21,728 --> 00:36:24,039
finance teams want cost visibility. We

987
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,728
give them democratized access.

988
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:30,590
So here's the secret sauce.

989
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,309
Uh, so we've connected Ray,

990
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,869
uh, to both workspaces and digit MCP

991
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:35,599
servers.

992
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:38,168
We're giving Ray full context across

993
00:36:38,168 --> 00:36:40,349
infrastructure and desktop as a service

994
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:40,898
layers.

995
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,550
Ray isn't a separate tool users

996
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,989
have to, uh, learn. It is embedded

997
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:47,610
in the desktop experience.

998
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,269
Helping users work smarter, not harder.

999
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,530
Each user gets personalized assistance,

1000
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:56,168
but user A's experience does not

1001
00:36:56,168 --> 00:36:58,159
impact user B's experience.

1002
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:00,610
Um, so here's what sets Ray apart

1003
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,250
context from every layer. AWS

1004
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,099
infrastructure,

1005
00:37:04,378 --> 00:37:06,019
workspaces, vision DS,

1006
00:37:06,378 --> 00:37:08,010
and the end user's environment.

1007
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,500
That's not just data, that's intelligence.

1008
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:15,159
So let me show you what this looks like in, in,

1009
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,369
in practice, right?

1010
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,688
We'll start with the real world experience.

1011
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,898
So, um, everyone's gotten

1012
00:37:20,898 --> 00:37:23,000
a support ticket that says, uh,

1013
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,168
my desktop is, is, is, is frozen,

1014
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:27,469
right? That's it, no context,

1015
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:29,809
nothing else, my desktop is frozen, and

1016
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:31,590
I've got a very frustrated user.

1017
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,269
In the old world, here's what happens.

1018
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,760
The tier one asks the user for

1019
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,969
more details. The user takes about an hour

1020
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:41,119
or so to get back, and then tier one

1021
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,219
escalates it up to tier 2. Tier 2

1022
00:37:43,398 --> 00:37:45,639
goes and checks out the logs, um, and

1023
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,570
then, you know,

1024
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:48,958
they may find something and they may not. Days

1025
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:50,840
pass, users are still frustrated.

1026
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:52,789
In the Ray world,

1027
00:37:55,289 --> 00:37:57,829
Using simple natural language interaction,

1028
00:37:58,168 --> 00:38:00,708
Ray goes out, correlates, and, and, and

1029
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:02,898
pulls back from the various

1030
00:38:02,898 --> 00:38:04,989
MCP servers across all the layers

1031
00:38:05,128 --> 00:38:07,289
with context that talk about session

1032
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:09,610
state, performance metrics, recent changes,

1033
00:38:10,128 --> 00:38:12,168
everything, and does that in minutes,

1034
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:13,610
yeah, and not hours.

1035
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:16,780
The user says desktop is freezing. Ray

1036
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,099
translates that into a multi-system

1037
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:20,659
uh diagnostic query

1038
00:38:20,978 --> 00:38:23,019
that correlates the data and delivers

1039
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:25,139
actionable insights in minutes, not

1040
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:28,800
hours. So

1041
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,050
let me double click into it to kind

1042
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,309
of show you behind the scenes.

1043
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:34,639
So this is leveraging Quiro as you

1044
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:35,699
can see on the screen.

1045
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:38,159
Um, so it's Monday

1046
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,349
morning, users are complaining about slow desktops.

1047
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:42,639
Your admin opens up Overwatch, uh, sees

1048
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,639
the graphs, right, opens in, it then

1049
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:46,030
goes to the AWS console,

1050
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,780
opens up cloud watch metrics, cross references

1051
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:50,958
with recent changes, looks at network

1052
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:53,000
telemetry. 40 to 60 minutes

1053
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,539
later they find a root cause.

1054
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,519
Or they can just ask Ray.

1055
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,300
Um, and if we look under the hood using Quiro,

1056
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:01,219
you can see the vision, um,

1057
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,789
Vision Ray actually goes in and and leverages

1058
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:05,869
both Vision MCP servers and

1059
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:08,289
Workspace's MCP servers to investigate

1060
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:10,429
the root cause. Ray sees everything in the

1061
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:11,849
admin would, um,

1062
00:39:12,228 --> 00:39:14,309
would have to correlate manually, but they see it

1063
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:14,909
instantly.

1064
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,789
But Ray doesn't just stop at, at, at

1065
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:19,849
correlating data, it finds a solution,

1066
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:22,269
um and um

1067
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:24,369
it prevents the problem from happening in the future.

1068
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:26,949
This is not about replacing admins though. This

1069
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,110
is about giving admins a

1070
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:29,688
uh

1071
00:39:29,949 --> 00:39:30,869
Iron Man suit,

1072
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:33,949
allowing them to spend more time doing strategic

1073
00:39:33,949 --> 00:39:35,989
work versus correlating and troubleshooting.

1074
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:38,820
So now let me show you something that that will

1075
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,099
make the finance team happy.

1076
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:42,898
So here's a scenario,

1077
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:45,079
um, it plays out in every enterprise.

1078
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,699
Your finance team needs cost breakdown,

1079
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,378
um, for their, their cloud spin.

1080
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,079
They don't have AWS console access and nor

1081
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:52,659
should they.

1082
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:53,699
Um, so

1083
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:56,119
the, that non-technical user from their

1084
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:58,239
desktop in finance asks a

1085
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:00,539
simple question in natural language,

1086
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,958
and Ray connects to the AWS,

1087
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,199
uh, and, and Workspace's MCP

1088
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,699
servers, pulls the data

1089
00:40:07,398 --> 00:40:09,739
and responds with a clear cost breakdown,

1090
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,039
uh, with insights.

1091
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:15,030
But here's where it gets really, really

1092
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,110
interesting, um.

1093
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:18,050
Ray asks,

1094
00:40:18,378 --> 00:40:20,639
do you want me to automate that for you next month?

1095
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,639
User says, sure,

1096
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:25,320
and then Ray will automatically generate

1097
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,659
a script and ensure that that

1098
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,958
report is on his on their desktop

1099
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,438
for the next month.

1100
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:35,898
So, seeing is believing. So

1101
00:40:35,898 --> 00:40:37,938
I put together a very, very quick video. It's

1102
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:40,250
gonna, it's gonna go by very quickly,

1103
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,659
but this is um kind of going over those

1104
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:44,500
three use cases that I just talked about.

1105
00:40:46,228 --> 00:40:48,429
So first we're gonna show how Ray

1106
00:40:48,429 --> 00:40:50,409
is interact allows users to interact

1107
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:53,309
with their desktop. So interact with their files,

1108
00:40:53,429 --> 00:40:54,059
interact

1109
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:56,458
with um asking things about

1110
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:57,769
the files, interacting

1111
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,050
um and allowing that user to

1112
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,300
pull back data very quickly as well

1113
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,360
as open up files.

1114
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,030
So, and this is just one use case, Ray can can

1115
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,030
do a multitude of things on the desktop

1116
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:10,320
and make and again allow that end

1117
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,688
user to have that superpower.

1118
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,679
So at the end here it's gonna uh open up

1119
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:20,550
a file. There

1120
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,628
you go. So in the second use

1121
00:41:22,628 --> 00:41:24,668
case we talked about um you know the finance

1122
00:41:24,668 --> 00:41:25,309
use case,

1123
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,590
where they, they, the finance non-technical

1124
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,329
user in simple language,

1125
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:30,628
ask a question.

1126
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:33,458
And I'm showing you the back end, so obviously this

1127
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,559
is kind of showing the verbose mode,

1128
00:41:35,898 --> 00:41:38,418
but it goes through, pulls out the data, correlates

1129
00:41:38,418 --> 00:41:40,458
the data, creates insights, and

1130
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:41,458
then visualizes it.

1131
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:45,090
And then automatically creates a script to

1132
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,510
automate it going forward.

1133
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:48,628
So the final use case is Ray

1134
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:49,978
can take a trouble ticket again,

1135
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:53,079
going back to that, you know, that my desktop

1136
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:53,628
is frozen.

1137
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,750
Correlate that to the multiple layers,

1138
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,378
so that's the AWS layer, the vision

1139
00:42:00,378 --> 00:42:02,398
layer, the workspaces layer, and

1140
00:42:02,398 --> 00:42:04,679
actually correlate all the components

1141
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:06,878
that that could go into making up that desktop

1142
00:42:06,878 --> 00:42:08,219
for monitoring, Overwatch,

1143
00:42:08,478 --> 00:42:10,840
as well as cloudwatch and then pull back

1144
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,539
a solution

1145
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:13,199
and the problem,

1146
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,599
excuse me, the root cause as well as

1147
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,840
the solution in a matter of minutes. Now

1148
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,269
this is drastically sped up for our demonstration,

1149
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:22,519
but uh it's still a matter of minutes to get

1150
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:23,699
to the root cause,

1151
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,168
and that's my time.

1152
00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:33,989
Thank you so much, Rob.

1153
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:34,969
Um,

1154
00:42:35,409 --> 00:42:37,168
it's so cool to see.

1155
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:38,840
Um,

1156
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,000
It's so cool to see vision using workspaces

1157
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,119
and broader AWS capabilities and

1158
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:46,320
Kiiro and, uh, you know, like Workspaces

1159
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,699
API is integrated into

1160
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,478
um

1161
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:51,090
The

1162
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,030
AWS MCP servers enabling these capabilities,

1163
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:56,208
enabling these kind of gentic features.

1164
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,320
I wanna talk about the future

1165
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,769
of work, right? Like,

1166
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,418
where are things going?

1167
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:06,719
Uh, and what is workspaces

1168
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:08,800
building to define, drive it, and what

1169
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,918
is that you should be thinking about while making

1170
00:43:10,918 --> 00:43:11,938
your choices

1171
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:14,590
in how you design

1172
00:43:14,918 --> 00:43:17,119
your digital workplace strategy and

1173
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,478
shape it, actively shape it.

1174
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:25,369
I want to take you through

1175
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:28,349
how the era of applications has evolved.

1176
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,809
So it's a little bit of a sneak preview

1177
00:43:31,148 --> 00:43:33,389
or kind of a like a walk back on

1178
00:43:33,389 --> 00:43:35,949
how these application frameworks,

1179
00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:38,389
desktops started, right? Like the first era

1180
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:40,329
was native applications.

1181
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:44,139
These applications are built in, um,

1182
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:45,849
ah, you know,

1183
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:48,570
uh, like interacting deeply with the operating

1184
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,570
system in, uh, languages,

1185
00:43:50,688 --> 00:43:53,070
C. You know, or

1186
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,250
uh C++.

1187
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:57,090
And there is a very clear boundary

1188
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,110
on what's remote, what's local,

1189
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:01,610
and the end user uses a desktop that's

1190
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,769
local and connects to either

1191
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:04,708
desktops

1192
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:05,750
or

1193
00:44:06,398 --> 00:44:06,918
applications.

1194
00:44:07,398 --> 00:44:09,449
This is kind of, uh, I think a

1195
00:44:09,449 --> 00:44:11,688
lot of that, you, a lot of it, you will relate

1196
00:44:11,688 --> 00:44:13,958
to it. This is the native era

1197
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:15,050
of applications,

1198
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:16,208
right? Um.

1199
00:44:17,398 --> 00:44:19,719
These applications had

1200
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:21,800
deep performance capabilities because

1201
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,978
you are able to use the operating system,

1202
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:26,639
but you require very

1203
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:29,039
fine-grained management on updating

1204
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:31,059
them, version management of it,

1205
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:33,599
you know, and your end user

1206
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,500
is required to install them,

1207
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:38,039
so it's not controlled, distribution is not controlled

1208
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:40,668
by you. How did this evolve?

1209
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:43,719
This evolved into the set of

1210
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:45,769
applications where distribution is a lot easier, right?

1211
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,840
Like, uh,

1212
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:49,639
applications are well built with web browser

1213
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:51,168
as the, uh, you know,

1214
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:54,139
As the client, and it

1215
00:44:54,139 --> 00:44:56,378
makes your applications accessible to

1216
00:44:56,378 --> 00:44:58,539
everybody. Ah, so it solves

1217
00:44:58,539 --> 00:44:59,878
the distribution problem.

1218
00:45:01,889 --> 00:45:04,039
So SAS transformation has been happening,

1219
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,179
but it is still slow,

1220
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:09,188
uh, to the point where, uh,

1221
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:11,438
I think administrators and

1222
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:12,300
decision makers

1223
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:15,119
think about, have to think about,

1224
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,840
you know, will I, will I get the same performance,

1225
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:20,179
right? Like if I move to a SAS application.

1226
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,599
And there are many deeply entrenched

1227
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:24,699
workflows which kind of slow down this,

1228
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,360
this transformation.

1229
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,829
While the transformation

1230
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:32,099
or kind of the exhalation to SAS

1231
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:34,519
applications is happening, right? Like a new era of

1232
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:35,550
applications is coming in.

1233
00:45:35,918 --> 00:45:36,840
What does it look like?

1234
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,039
In this era,

1235
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,668
End users, customers will continue using

1236
00:45:42,668 --> 00:45:45,090
native applications. They continue using SAS

1237
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,469
applications. You're not going to change them overnight,

1238
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:48,449
you know.

1239
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:49,809
Um,

1240
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,030
but there are 3 new patterns

1241
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,208
that are gonna emerge or

1242
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:56,969
are kind of already emerging.

1243
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:00,110
The first one is in-app agents.

1244
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:03,510
These agents live within the

1245
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,750
applications that are already being used, whether

1246
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,929
they are native applications or the SAS

1247
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:08,878
applications, right? Like,

1248
00:46:09,188 --> 00:46:11,728
this can be an in-app agent on the sidebar,

1249
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:13,989
which has the context of how you're using the

1250
00:46:13,989 --> 00:46:16,050
tool, you know, and helps accelerate

1251
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,168
the usage.

1252
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,128
The second one is

1253
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:22,139
agentic assistant on teammates.

1254
00:46:22,628 --> 00:46:23,329
You heard

1255
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,989
some of the announcements in Matt's keynote about

1256
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:28,110
uh new frontier agents and teammates

1257
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,969
that AAS has launched.

1258
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,139
This is a different pattern of

1259
00:46:33,139 --> 00:46:34,769
how agentic

1260
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:36,519
usage,

1261
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:39,418
you know, works or agents work

1262
00:46:39,418 --> 00:46:41,599
alongside the end user as an assistant,

1263
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:44,369
or they have an independent identity of

1264
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:45,148
their own

1265
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:46,418
as a teammate.

1266
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,128
And the third one is born native

1267
00:46:50,128 --> 00:46:51,719
Agentic applications.

1268
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,349
It's a completely new experience framework,

1269
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,800
you know, and uh together,

1270
00:46:56,969 --> 00:46:59,570
I would say with these 3 new components,

1271
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,309
this is the agentic era of applications,

1272
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:03,889
right? So,

1273
00:47:04,878 --> 00:47:07,019
Starting with native applications, transitioning

1274
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:09,208
to SAS applications, and then accelerating

1275
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:10,969
to agentic applications.

1276
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,659
I want to take a look at this era a little

1277
00:47:14,659 --> 00:47:16,860
bit, or this new paradigm, a little bit in

1278
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:18,610
more detail to talk about, you know,

1279
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:21,179
what is that we should be thinking about, you

1280
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:24,789
know. Let's

1281
00:47:24,789 --> 00:47:26,909
talk about experience frameworks, right? How,

1282
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,458
reflect on your typical workday,

1283
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,869
how do you do work, right? And you

1284
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:34,030
will see that your work is dominated

1285
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:34,610
by

1286
00:47:34,909 --> 00:47:37,168
create, edit, edit, edit, edit

1287
00:47:37,378 --> 00:47:38,128
loops.

1288
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:39,418
You edit a lot,

1289
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:41,829
you know. How is that gonna

1290
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:42,369
change?

1291
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:46,659
I believe these loops get changed

1292
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:48,280
from edit, edit, edit

1293
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,929
to create and review loops

1294
00:47:50,938 --> 00:47:52,938
where the experience has to

1295
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:55,099
be optimized for shortening the

1296
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:57,519
time it takes for you to review

1297
00:47:57,659 --> 00:47:59,739
and hand it back to agentic

1298
00:47:59,739 --> 00:48:01,820
application for further iterating on the

1299
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,978
creation of that content.

1300
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,050
What does it really mean on how you

1301
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,610
shape the digital workplace?

1302
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:14,090
If you look at traditional operating systems, they

1303
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:16,389
were really optimized for the former,

1304
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:18,889
which is edit, edit, edit,

1305
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:21,110
you know, and the entire UI framework

1306
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:23,369
that the operating, the legacy operating systems

1307
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:25,688
built was to give you a familiar

1308
00:48:25,688 --> 00:48:28,228
framework on the edit functionality

1309
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:29,309
across different

1310
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:30,949
UI applications.

1311
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:36,938
The, but the new experience frameworks

1312
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,840
are gonna focus on, if you see

1313
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,099
kind of the animation,

1314
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,840
what is that square box

1315
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,039
which the agents and the humans

1316
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:48,000
use to access these applications?

1317
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,878
Is it a traditional operating system-based

1318
00:48:50,878 --> 00:48:51,559
desktop?

1319
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:54,179
I think newer patterns are going to emerge

1320
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:54,878
where

1321
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:56,398
the experience

1322
00:48:56,659 --> 00:48:59,168
and the collection of those applications is

1323
00:48:59,168 --> 00:49:01,179
influenced by shortening the review

1324
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:02,519
loops, not by the

1325
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,139
legacy UI framework of operating

1326
00:49:05,139 --> 00:49:05,679
systems.

1327
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:16,860
While that transition happens, in-app

1328
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,179
agents are going to continue filling the gap,

1329
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,119
which is

1330
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:21,239
while

1331
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:24,539
you think about the adoption of bonogentic

1332
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:26,800
applications, these in-app agents

1333
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:28,559
continue helping you utilize

1334
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:31,179
the UIs that you're already invested

1335
00:49:31,179 --> 00:49:33,039
in and still accelerate your work.

1336
00:49:34,789 --> 00:49:36,989
So the first thing we talk about here is

1337
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:38,829
about the new experience frameworks.

1338
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,349
What is the future of work

1339
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:43,289
or a future digital workplace,

1340
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:45,869
how you should be thinking about the experience of

1341
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:48,320
that, you can actively shape it. It's

1342
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,429
not where the legacy UI framework

1343
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:52,469
of operating systems, new experience

1344
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:53,969
frameworks are going to emerge.

1345
00:49:56,179 --> 00:49:56,860
And

1346
00:49:57,219 --> 00:49:59,050
the acceleration

1347
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,340
to agentic applications, which I

1348
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,550
call the right shift,

1349
00:50:02,938 --> 00:50:05,030
right, from native applications

1350
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:07,199
to SASS applications to agentic

1351
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:09,679
applications, we see very,

1352
00:50:09,688 --> 00:50:13,280
very fast. Transition,

1353
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:16,199
right? Like you see like in-app agents, agentic

1354
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:18,320
applications, different modes of agentic

1355
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,360
usage, uh, you know, happening,

1356
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:22,800
and many of the organizations are actually

1357
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,280
completely skipping the SAS,

1358
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:26,760
uh, modernizations and skipping

1359
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,878
from native to agentic applications.

1360
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:30,239
I think that there are,

1361
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:32,918
there are two or three key points to make here on

1362
00:50:32,918 --> 00:50:35,320
how this acceleration itself leverages

1363
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,438
agentic AI.

1364
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:39,550
Many of the times, organizations don't

1365
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,668
step into a modernization journey because

1366
00:50:41,668 --> 00:50:43,869
they think that I have 20 million lines of

1367
00:50:43,869 --> 00:50:46,079
code in my native application, right?

1368
00:50:46,188 --> 00:50:48,429
Like, and it's gonna take me a decade to modernize

1369
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:50,530
it. I think a lot

1370
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:52,530
of that fear is fueled

1371
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,429
by lack of precise

1372
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:57,289
understanding of how your end users are using

1373
00:50:57,289 --> 00:50:59,360
that application, right? Like, and we

1374
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,688
are gonna give deep visibility to you

1375
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:04,208
to understand the sweet spot,

1376
00:51:04,289 --> 00:51:06,289
the 80/20, or, you know, what is

1377
00:51:06,289 --> 00:51:08,369
the 20% of the feature set that 80%

1378
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:10,489
of your end users are using, and what are the features and

1379
00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:12,570
capabilities that users don't care about, that you

1380
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,349
don't have to port,

1381
00:51:13,929 --> 00:51:15,329
right? And

1382
00:51:15,769 --> 00:51:17,809
You talked about AWS, uh, Matt

1383
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:19,809
talked about AWS Transform in his

1384
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:22,148
uh keynote that it enables

1385
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,739
5 up to 5X pace

1386
00:51:24,739 --> 00:51:26,148
of uh modernization

1387
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:28,719
of uh typical Windows

1388
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,809
applications, right? So with deep visibility

1389
00:51:30,809 --> 00:51:32,228
into usage patterns

1390
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,849
and agentic applications like AWS

1391
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:37,070
Transform that understand your code base,

1392
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:39,409
you can really, really curate a strategy, and

1393
00:51:39,409 --> 00:51:40,110
then you will see uh

1394
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:42,769
kind of more offerings and products from outside.

1395
00:51:44,918 --> 00:51:45,530
So,

1396
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:48,019
all of this is good, but what does it

1397
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:50,360
what does it mean for boosted productivity

1398
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,659
of your end users?

1399
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:54,648
And that means today, what, what it can

1400
00:51:54,648 --> 00:51:56,978
do for you today, right? Like it's

1401
00:51:56,978 --> 00:51:59,159
like it's not a theoretical concept. You

1402
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:03,090
You heard Matt introduce Frontier

1403
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:03,909
agents,

1404
00:52:04,409 --> 00:52:05,769
Kiiro Autonomous agent,

1405
00:52:06,188 --> 00:52:08,409
AWS security agent, and AWS

1406
00:52:08,409 --> 00:52:09,449
DevOps agents.

1407
00:52:10,438 --> 00:52:12,639
Right? We call them frontier agents because

1408
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:13,219
they are,

1409
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:15,929
they're not typical agents. They have deep

1410
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,719
understanding. They are even beyond the research

1411
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,878
agents to kind of pick up the lexicon of

1412
00:52:20,878 --> 00:52:22,829
uh uh agentic AI,

1413
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,760
you know. But

1414
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,809
what is next? What is the next in

1415
00:52:27,809 --> 00:52:30,208
line of frontier agents that like, you know, AWS

1416
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:32,168
and Workspaces are gonna work, work on?

1417
00:52:32,739 --> 00:52:35,059
An admin-focused agent that

1418
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:37,059
helps you pick the right flavor of the product,

1419
00:52:37,168 --> 00:52:39,489
helps you onboard to the workspace's service,

1420
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:41,369
helps you manage the workload,

1421
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,938
helps you optimize the workload, both

1422
00:52:43,938 --> 00:52:46,070
from a cost and performance perspective,

1423
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,539
and it's able to take actions on your

1424
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:49,159
behalf,

1425
00:52:49,539 --> 00:52:51,619
right? Many of you have actually

1426
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:53,619
seen demos of it. If you had an ABC

1427
00:52:53,619 --> 00:52:55,780
with us earlier this week, we have shown

1428
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,059
you demos of all these three capabilities,

1429
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,378
experience frameworks.

1430
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:02,059
boosted productivity, as well

1431
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:03,969
as kind of transformation journey,

1432
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,679
right. Um,

1433
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:08,579
so, if you haven't seen the demo,

1434
00:53:08,938 --> 00:53:10,978
please ping your point of contact with

1435
00:53:10,978 --> 00:53:12,978
the workspaces or end user computing

1436
00:53:12,978 --> 00:53:14,280
services on AWS

1437
00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:16,780
and we'll like, we'll love to get in touch with you, give

1438
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,579
you a sneak preview and take input from you.

1439
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,260
Continuing on this,

1440
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:23,539
you know, what is next in the line of frontier

1441
00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:25,579
agents, right? Like we talk about computer

1442
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:27,659
use a lot. Computer use

1443
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:30,059
capabilities, they apply to SAS

1444
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:32,219
applications. But how do we really,

1445
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,519
really enable

1446
00:53:33,898 --> 00:53:36,219
the thick applications to move fast

1447
00:53:36,219 --> 00:53:38,610
and act like agentic applications as well,

1448
00:53:38,898 --> 00:53:41,188
right? There's gonna be a

1449
00:53:41,188 --> 00:53:41,728
new.

1450
00:53:42,688 --> 00:53:44,728
There's going to be a new flavor of computer use

1451
00:53:44,728 --> 00:53:46,929
which is built for thick applications, which

1452
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:47,989
enables

1453
00:53:48,289 --> 00:53:49,869
these agents to work

1454
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:52,329
on your behalf as an

1455
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:53,030
assistant

1456
00:53:53,289 --> 00:53:55,250
or as a teammate,

1457
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:57,530
you know, working on these remote

1458
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:59,840
thick applications and completely automating

1459
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,849
your business workflows. This is also one

1460
00:54:01,849 --> 00:54:03,719
of the demos that is available to you, you know,

1461
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,099
so please ping us.

1462
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,159
So,

1463
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,148
new experience frameworks,

1464
00:54:11,438 --> 00:54:13,458
accelerated right shift

1465
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:16,070
towards agentic applications, boosted

1466
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:16,938
productivity,

1467
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:19,398
you know, what does it really

1468
00:54:19,398 --> 00:54:21,519
mean for the choices that you

1469
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:22,360
have to make?

1470
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:25,159
I believe there should at least be one pilot

1471
00:54:25,378 --> 00:54:27,378
that you're running or need

1472
00:54:27,378 --> 00:54:29,659
to run, which is pure, which is

1473
00:54:29,659 --> 00:54:31,659
free from the legacy choices that you

1474
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:32,898
have made or you have

1475
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:34,219
had to make,

1476
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:36,610
you know, and, uh, working

1477
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,840
with your leaders, you should be looking to

1478
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,340
invest in this pure pilot and expanding

1479
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,918
it because

1480
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:46,059
I believe your leadership is also starting

1481
00:54:46,059 --> 00:54:48,329
to believe in the kind of, you know, uh,

1482
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,300
the agentic AI and how it's gonna help,

1483
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:52,760
you know, make your organizations more nimble.

1484
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,000
I will end by saying

1485
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,938
that you can choose to retrofit your legacy
