1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,079
All right. Hi, everyone. I'm Shanta Uwali. I'm

2
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:04,169
a director of product management at Lambda

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:06,250
Test, and I'm really

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,669
excited here to talk about scaling automation

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:10,569
with KNEI and hyper-execute.

6
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:12,679
Now before we begin,

7
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:15,099
what I do want to talk about are the problems with

8
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,449
testing strategies today.

9
00:00:16,818 --> 00:00:18,978
While all of us do understand that there

10
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:21,019
are many problems, but a few of

11
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:23,199
them that I do want to highlight are a

12
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,019
fragmented oversight, there are disconnected

13
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,019
testing processes which do lead to blind

14
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,100
spots, and there's a lack of centralized

15
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,259
governance which causes misalignment.

16
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,978
Second one being there are inconsistent

17
00:00:34,978 --> 00:00:37,829
testing standards. Which brings variability

18
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,810
across teams

19
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:41,709
which actually just goes ahead and weakens quality

20
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,348
causes delays and erodes

21
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:46,590
customer trust if something is shipped out, which is

22
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,750
not exactly how it was supposed to be shipped out.

23
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,109
And finally, a big, big problem that

24
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:53,109
is still out there is brittle

25
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:54,810
unscalable infrastructure.

26
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:57,168
Now legacy systems cannot meet

27
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,389
modern testing needs, and at the

28
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:01,348
end they are slowing down innovation.

29
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,138
Now, if we dig a little deeper into

30
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:06,219
it as to why testing is breaking

31
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:06,879
right now,

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,719
we'll be able to find that

33
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,099
most of the times that we imagine that the

34
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:13,180
quality engineers or any developer team

35
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,260
focusing on testing would be spending on is

36
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,620
not actually being done.

37
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,319
The test planning and authoring, it's just the tip

38
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,319
of the iceberg. What we actually

39
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,540
see is

40
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,418
most of the time is actually spent

41
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,278
in fixing broken and flaky tests.

42
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,599
A lot of the time is actually spent in test optimization,

43
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,500
test execution and monitoring.

44
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,269
And finally, even right now in today's world,

45
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,519
a lot of the time is going into triaging

46
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,859
and debugging the tests.

47
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:41,314
Now we all know that Gen AI

48
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:43,454
is reshaping engineering in today's world, and

49
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:45,454
over the last couple of years what we've

50
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:48,055
seen is there has been a huge

51
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:50,135
code volume surge and what we

52
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:52,775
see here is that those code volume

53
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:54,805
surge will also need to be tested. So

54
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:57,055
the question to ask here is, is

55
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:58,793
testing ready for it or not?

56
00:01:59,174 --> 00:02:00,713
Now that's where

57
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,855
lambda test comes in with modern intent

58
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:05,194
driven testing workflow.

59
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:08,788
Essentially what we're doing with KNAI

60
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:11,008
and hyper execute at the center of it all

61
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,389
is that we can allow you to plan

62
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:15,909
your test, author your tests, leveraging KNAI,

63
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:18,349
and of course go ahead and execute

64
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:19,319
them as well,

65
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:21,618
uh, by leveraging hyper-execute and give you

66
00:02:21,618 --> 00:02:22,969
all the analysis as well

67
00:02:23,308 --> 00:02:25,610
now. The major

68
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,849
question that all of you might be asking as well is

69
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:29,569
that is it only functional testing?

70
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:32,088
The answer to that is no. It can be functional

71
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:34,210
testing, it can be API testing, it will be

72
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,250
accessibility, visual regression,

73
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:37,439
performance testing,

74
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:39,929
because that's how you'll be able to meet your modern testing

75
00:02:39,929 --> 00:02:42,149
needs. Now the way it will work

76
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,449
and the way it works right now is that

77
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,729
you can input any, any

78
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:49,038
requirement that you might have, which could be

79
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:51,050
via media or video and audio

80
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,099
file. It could be a

81
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,479
complete PRE document that you have that you wanna upload

82
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,778
or it could be requirements coming in directly from

83
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,118
Jira stories as well

84
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,860
that goes into KNAI

85
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:03,758
and KNAI gets all the context

86
00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:05,979
and a memory added to it and gives

87
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:08,058
out relevant test cases to you.

88
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:10,580
Now those test cases, while having human

89
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,319
in the loop,

90
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:13,819
then are authored autonomously

91
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,020
by KAI agents and at

92
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,645
the. And all of that can be executed

93
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:20,324
on hyper execute platform.

94
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:21,844
Now the output that I'm talking about,

95
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:24,304
it's actually open source framework and language

96
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,564
leveraging selenium, Playwright, APM,

97
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:28,104
all of that to you and

98
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,463
going ahead and executing and giving you all

99
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:32,463
the analysis and RCAs that might be

100
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,903
helpful for you to figure out what's the best court coverage

101
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:36,963
and for you to be able to finally achieve

102
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:39,304
that in sprint automation that everybody

103
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:40,425
would like to do that.

104
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:42,889
And of course all of that

105
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,389
very seamlessly goes back and plugs

106
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,669
in your Jira workflows by

107
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:50,409
having that connection and more than 100 integrations

108
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:52,250
already being in place.

109
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,770
Now one great part of it is that

110
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,508
all of this works on intent. It's

111
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:59,508
completely natural language based which

112
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:01,588
allows you to move at light scale and

113
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:03,288
much, much faster as well.

114
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:06,008
Now what I would like to do is actually

115
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:07,949
show it all to you in action.

116
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:09,710
And uh

117
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,580
we're just gonna go ahead

118
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,719
and switch to a demo mode.

119
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,920
Now what we have here is a

120
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,088
Jira story, uh, and I've taken an example

121
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:20,600
of Airbnb right here.

122
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:23,170
Uh, this would be something that a lot of us

123
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,040
might get right

124
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,480
as when we're developing any, any feature

125
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,689
or any requirements that might have come from the

126
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:29,250
product team.

127
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:31,488
Once we have those details available,

128
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:32,420
what KAI

129
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,088
can do is that we can just go ahead

130
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:37,410
and add a comment such as lambda

131
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,519
test AI cloud,

132
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,809
let's say generate test scenarios for

133
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:43,528
me. And

134
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:44,959
as soon as I enter that,

135
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,730
Kenny and I will quickly analyze the description,

136
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,970
the summary, and any other custom

137
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,500
field that you might want, and within a few seconds

138
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:54,730
it will come back to us with a

139
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,338
response that,

140
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,730
great, hey, I have gone through the entire

141
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,850
context that you have provided, and I'm

142
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,189
starting to generate the relevant test scenarios

143
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:04,730
that you want. And if you just go ahead and click on that

144
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,865
link. We'll see, uh,

145
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,005
that all the information that was initially provided

146
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:11,125
to us has been figured out by KNAI and it

147
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,954
has started generating test scenarios

148
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:16,295
and multiple test cases within them as well,

149
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:18,725
giving you all the relevant information

150
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:21,036
whether the test case is a must-have,

151
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:23,565
whether the scenarios that have been generated are

152
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:25,696
the positive scenarios, negative scenarios,

153
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:28,100
edge cases, so essentially. Something

154
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:30,761
that you would have spent a couple of days going

155
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:32,761
through figuring out what are the scenarios and

156
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:34,211
test cases you want to automate.

157
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,281
KI helps you do that in seconds with

158
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:39,281
all the relevant context of your

159
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:41,521
application. Now one great thing that I also want to talk

160
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:43,721
about is that if you have existing test

161
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:46,581
cases, it also checks for deduplication

162
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,880
and does not create duplicate tests every

163
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,521
single time.

164
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,350
It saves a lot of your time by ensuring

165
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,660
that it has existing test cases in context

166
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,449
as well.

167
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:57,910
Now, what we can do is we can

168
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,149
actually quickly go ahead and see what details

169
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:02,369
have been created, and these are complete

170
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:04,389
information that would be relevant for you to

171
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:05,670
have your test cases ready.

172
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:08,088
Including test steps, outcomes,

173
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,069
and of course

174
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,548
we have added the flow in a manner

175
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:13,500
that we can have human in the loop.

176
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,000
Anyone can ensure that they are able to review it,

177
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:17,199
make edits to it,

178
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:19,569
uh, make any changes to the test steps as

179
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,730
well, and go ahead and review those

180
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,028
quickly and once all of them do make sense.

181
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,798
The goal is not to just be able to

182
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:28,798
go ahead and create these test cases.

183
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,980
The goal is to be able to automate them

184
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:32,639
in a singular flow itself.

185
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,059
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just select

186
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:36,858
a few of the test cases

187
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,278
and I'm gonna go ahead and create an automate.

188
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,059
Now the beauty of it all is that.

189
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:44,769
You, it's completely platform

190
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:47,009
agnostic whether you have a web

191
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:49,108
application, whether you have a mobile native application

192
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,088
or a hybrid application,

193
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:52,569
or whether it's just a mobile browser app that you wanna

194
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:53,389
go ahead and test.

195
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,459
You can choose any of these,

196
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,959
upload your relevant apps, whether it's

197
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,048
APKs, IPAs, provide us the

198
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:01,829
URL, even if it's a local

199
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,889
application that you wanna go ahead and test out, you can go ahead and

200
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:07,048
do that as well. And finally, just let's

201
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:09,028
say I input the

202
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,470
application under the test, which would be.

203
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,048
Airbnb.com, in my case.

204
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:15,588
And

205
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:18,230
let me just choose a few agents and

206
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,509
go ahead and create an automate.

207
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:21,910
Now as soon as I do that, KEI

208
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,220
will spin up multiple agents in the

209
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,309
background to autonomously author these test cases,

210
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,379
and we can see all of them are coming up right now,

211
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:29,189
right here.

212
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,569
So what we see is that multiple

213
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:33,869
test cases got authored and

214
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:36,165
they. Anonymously ran within the session

215
00:07:36,363 --> 00:07:38,483
and the output that we get at the

216
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:40,744
end is something such as this

217
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,403
that they are providing you the

218
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:45,545
entire context, the entire test cases

219
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:47,824
at every and every, every

220
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:49,363
information which might be relevant to you.

221
00:07:49,684 --> 00:07:51,725
So for example, it actually went ahead

222
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:53,564
and searched for an accommodation,

223
00:07:53,884 --> 00:07:55,963
uh, figured out every step, and all

224
00:07:55,963 --> 00:07:58,125
of this is intent natural language

225
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,439
driven. Now why I'm highlighting

226
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,559
this again and again, why intent driven

227
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,290
is necessary

228
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,319
because the problems that we were talking about initially

229
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,338
when we started out

230
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
being flaky tests, flaky locators,

231
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,000
triaging and debugging, all of that

232
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,199
comes into context when you have

233
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,608
that information available to you, and that

234
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:18,639
information comes as intent to

235
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,199
the system.

236
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,730
Now what you can see here is

237
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,769
complete details along with screenshots which might

238
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:26,769
be relevant to you highlighting what

239
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:27,588
exactly is

240
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,048
KEI doing where it's going ahead and performing

241
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:31,209
the test for you

242
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:33,769
and as an output what you also

243
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:36,149
get uh is the. Complete

244
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,269
code of it as well that you get a complete open

245
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,349
source code whether it's selenium uh

246
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,548
whether it's Playwright, Cyprus

247
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:43,399
WebDriver IO

248
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,529
you can choose

249
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:46,989
any open source framework and language which

250
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:48,168
might be relevant to you

251
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,658
and your team might be more comfortable

252
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:51,288
with that

253
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:52,308
and then.

254
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:55,538
Another thing that I do want to highlight, as I was mentioning

255
00:08:55,538 --> 00:08:57,869
earlier, it's not just about

256
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,099
functional test. You can go ahead and have your

257
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:02,750
API testing, curl commands, assertions

258
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,219
on nest adjacent values, and

259
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:07,509
all the best practices that are already out

260
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:09,710
there from, from decades of experiences

261
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,769
that people have had in testing strategies

262
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,989
can actually be leveraged right

263
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:14,849
here itself.

264
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:18,139
Now, What

265
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:20,479
I also want to show you, which is really, really brilliant,

266
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,808
is that while authoring the test case,

267
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,259
Kenney and I actually figured out that there are

268
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:27,489
a few issues that are already there

269
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:28,210
within the system.

270
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,558
So for example, if I just open one of them.

271
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:34,418
What it was expecting was that

272
00:09:34,418 --> 00:09:35,158
the map

273
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,908
should be present and enabled above the listing.

274
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,269
However, if you just open the screenshot quickly,

275
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:43,129
what we see is the map is actually besides

276
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,279
the listing uh that we see here.

277
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:46,599
So it has gone ahead,

278
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,269
suggested as a bug that the actual

279
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:51,629
outcome was that the map is present but it's

280
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,759
not. above the listings page now

281
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,918
that is something which only an AI will be

282
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:58,019
able to figure out quickly and give you that

283
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,080
result. Now the best part here is

284
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
that you can directly confirm and

285
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,729
raise a bug

286
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,440
on Jira and give it to your

287
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,519
relevant developers and team members to

288
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,658
have an extremely easy smooth flow,

289
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,719
uh, within the same system.

290
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:14,928
And of course you can manage your entire test

291
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:17,178
cases, all the details which might be relevant

292
00:10:17,178 --> 00:10:18,359
to you now

293
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:21,058
what we've done until now is just

294
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,379
seen how multiple test cases are

295
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:25,500
authored and automated, right? We

296
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,399
have automation scripts ready for them,

297
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,798
but that's not all. That's not what we wanna do.

298
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:31,239
We want to go ahead and

299
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,739
bulk them out, maybe create a test suit,

300
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:35,879
maybe create a regression, a sanity suit,

301
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:38,529
and finally integrate them into CI pipelines

302
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:39,678
as well because that's how,

303
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,320
that's how development works for us.

304
00:10:42,798 --> 00:10:44,879
So what you can do is

305
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,700
club all of the test cases together

306
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:49,450
into something called as test runs

307
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,649
and if I just open one of the test runs

308
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,719
that I've already run very recently, just a

309
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:54,649
few hours ago,

310
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:57,369
we'll see that we get complete

311
00:10:57,369 --> 00:10:58,629
results, uh,

312
00:10:59,038 --> 00:10:59,580
and

313
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:02,239
all the analysis that might be required for us

314
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:04,384
so we do see that it has a 70. 3%

315
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:06,634
pass rate, the total duration it took,

316
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:08,913
and finally what we give out to you

317
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:11,033
in case of failures is whether it was a new

318
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:12,724
kind of failure that has come up now,

319
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:15,433
whether it's an anomaly in terms of test execution

320
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,553
time, maybe a network call was taking much

321
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,514
longer than it was expecting to take,

322
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:22,154
or maybe it's a test which is always

323
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:23,215
failing, which might

324
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:24,875
need, need some help.

325
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,428
And if we just click on what the issue was,

326
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,739
we actually see a complete RCA,

327
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,058
a root cause analysis for

328
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,639
how many times the error has been repeated, what

329
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,779
is the overall error trends,

330
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:39,279
what exactly failed right there, and

331
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,460
if needed, any remediation strategies

332
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:42,719
that might be required.

333
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,798
Now all of this comes in from hyper-execute

334
00:11:45,798 --> 00:11:48,119
by analyzing all your historical data

335
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:50,119
as well and any executions that you might

336
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,320
have. Now the great part here is

337
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,519
that you can also schedule your

338
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,558
test runs apart from integrating

339
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,119
these TOCI pipelines as well.

340
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,683
So in case you want to just go ahead and have

341
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:02,904
a sanity run every single day, every morning at

342
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:04,945
9 o'clock, you can go ahead and schedule

343
00:12:04,945 --> 00:12:06,144
that. And

344
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,663
once you come back to any results, what you'll

345
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:11,183
also see, uh, is a complete

346
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:13,423
report if I just switch to this report section

347
00:12:14,075 --> 00:12:16,384
of the historical runs that have happened. So

348
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:18,683
if you see, uh, these are a few runs that are

349
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:21,183
scheduled and are happening recently, we can see.

350
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,609
That what is the overall stability of

351
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,879
my suit, whether it's running consistently

352
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,599
or not, whether there's any decline,

353
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,889
uh, what is the pass fail rate overall

354
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,940
that it has been running over a period of time,

355
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,489
and what are the failure categories, whether it's

356
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,408
failing at a particular step,

357
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,070
uh, whether it's automation, whether it,

358
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,450
it is a product issue or whether it's an environment

359
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,450
issue because that's a huge problem when we're trying

360
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,808
to debug as to what is going on

361
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:47,750
and what might the concerns be.

362
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:51,538
And what I do want to show you is

363
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,658
that if we go ahead into any

364
00:12:53,658 --> 00:12:55,840
of the details, let's say something did

365
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,820
fail, and

366
00:12:57,178 --> 00:12:59,369
this is not enough information for us, we want to dig

367
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:00,639
deep, we want to see more.

368
00:13:01,178 --> 00:13:03,038
We can just click on any of

369
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:05,820
uh the test cases that we see right here and

370
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
be navigated to a complete details for

371
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,320
you along with a video

372
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:12,000
uh along with all the command logs all the

373
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,038
uh relevant information that you might

374
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:15,739
need in order to debug the test

375
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:18,538
including the network calls and

376
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:20,399
an accessibility report as well.

377
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:23,058
Now this is something which is extremely

378
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:25,479
critical as of right now because accessibility.

379
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,649
Is something that everybody is focusing on

380
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:30,719
and needs to focus on right now so

381
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:33,058
you can get your full fledged report using

382
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,149
any specific WCAC version,

383
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:37,678
figure out what if there are any critical issues or

384
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:40,099
serious concerns that you need to get fixed quickly

385
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,058
and see a full fledged report as well.

386
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:44,658
And of course if you're talking

387
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:46,019
about mobile devices,

388
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:48,830
real devices, you get a complete app performance

389
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,408
report as well

390
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,908
for your performance testing whether you want to figure out a

391
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:53,940
cold startup time, hot startup time,

392
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:56,450
check how your application is performing

393
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,668
over a period of test session, whether

394
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:00,779
it's a peak in CPU usage,

395
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:03,029
whether your application is actually degrading

396
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:05,288
the performance of the device, and eventually

397
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:07,729
giving you slow results on a real device

398
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:10,158
because that's something that you cannot find on simulator remotely

399
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:11,168
orders directly.

400
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,558
Memory usage, disk usage, and all of that

401
00:14:14,558 --> 00:14:16,668
information which might be relevant to you.

402
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,250
All right.

403
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,889
So I know that we've gone through a

404
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:23,729
lot of, uh, information,

405
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,269
but. What I do want to highlight

406
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:28,590
and just quickly recap is that

407
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,690
Lambda test is helping us

408
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:33,408
provide modern intent driven testing

409
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:35,668
and the only way we can move forward is

410
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:37,450
by ensuring that we're able to

411
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:38,529
capture

412
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:41,190
issues much, much faster and hence

413
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,288
release faster as well.

414
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:45,019
Now Lambda test has flexible deployment models

415
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,029
on AWS and we're listed

416
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:49,058
on AWS Marketplace as well,

417
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:51,729
and I really wanna thank all of you

418
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,070
for attending this session.

419
00:14:53,408 --> 00:14:54,889
Uh, and, uh,

420
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:57,750
we are available at booth 679,

421
00:14:57,928 --> 00:14:59,969
and if you have any questions, I'd be happy to help

422
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:02,048
out and if you want a customized demo we

423
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:04,048
can try out your applications directly on

424
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:06,168
KNEI as well and see how that works

425
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:06,869
out for you.

426
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:08,408
Thank you so much, everyone.
