1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
- Good morning, all.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,460
Welcome or welcome back if
you've been to re:Invent before.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,240
We are so excited you've
joined us here this morning.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,600
So we've been busy building, innovating,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,810
working backwards from a
lot of the conversations

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,330
and a lot of the challenges
that you've shared with us

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,410
in the last 12 months.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,269
And we're super excited to
share everything that's new

9
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:24,660
in the world of network security

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,210
to help you protect your infrastructure.

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,820
So my name is Sofía Aluma-Santos.

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,010
I lead our go-to-market for our network

13
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,256
and application protection services inside

14
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:36,120
of our security organization.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,030
And I'm joined here by my
colleague, Saleem Muhammad.

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,350
- Yes, hi. Good morning.

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,730
My name is Saleem Muhammad,

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,440
and I lead product management for network

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,900
and application protection at AWS.

20
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,790
Welcome to have you here.

21
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,623
- Awesome.

22
00:00:48,623 --> 00:00:51,360
So Saleem's gonna join us in
a bit to walk through some

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,900
of the new innovations
in network protection.

24
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,880
But for now, I'll go
ahead and get started.

25
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,980
Thank you, Saleem. So...

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,910
We've been working backwards from a lot

27
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,150
of the conversations that we've mentioned.

28
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,750
Part of our role is traveling around

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,640
to different geographies, different geos,

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,560
to where you are all at,
and sharing from you,

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,390
working backwards from your perspective,

32
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,880
your challenges as network
security operators.

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,613
So if you're here,

34
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:28,500
we are assuming that
you are fairly familiar

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,600
with networking, network security,

36
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,070
networking on the cloud,

37
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,310
some of our security services on AWS.

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,800
And you're here to learn
more about what's new

39
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,890
to make your days easier
in network security

40
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,243
and NetSecOps, and how we can
protect your infrastructure

41
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:47,940
in a more streamlined way.

42
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,310
So first, we'll work backwards from some

43
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,070
of the challenges that we use as kind of

44
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,777
the North Star and the guiding
principles that we've used

45
00:01:55,777 --> 00:02:00,270
to really ensure and guide our roadmap

46
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,090
and our security service innovations.

47
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,000
We'll also do a quick primer and overview

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
of the services that are
in scope, in discussion,

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,820
in the network and application
protection portfolio,

50
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,793
and then we'll jump into
everything that's new.

51
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,830
So as we talk through, you know, teams

52
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:26,760
in network security, you all
share different challenges

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,204
and different pain points
that you have to balance

54
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:32,100
when setting out your strategy.

55
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,330
The first of which,

56
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,410
we all know that we are not
on a single architecture type,

57
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,990
a single deployment, a single cloud.

58
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,230
You have to manage a
varying degree of complexity

59
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,971
in your architecture decisions.

60
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:49,530
We understand that folks might
be operating across cloud

61
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,770
or have to support type
of hybrid connectivity,

62
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,770
so you rely on us to ensure
that we match the support,

63
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,666
the functionality to make
sure that you're connected

64
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,240
in the way that you need to.

65
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,240
Second is also making sure
that you're able to scale

66
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,530
and perform and ensure
that you're able to ramp up

67
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,420
and down as you need to,

68
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,240
and you look to us to
ensure that we give you

69
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,153
the visibility and the ability to do so.

70
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,916
A lot of these security
decisions are also driven

71
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:30,690
by compliance and data
sovereignty regulations,

72
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,540
security frameworks
that you must adhere to,

73
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,980
that you must...

74
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,809
That we work backwards from
to ensure that you're given

75
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:41,370
the ability to prove, to do that,

76
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,080
and to meet those standards.

77
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,825
So we take all of that into
mind when we're building

78
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:49,950
a lot of our new functionality
to ensure to give you

79
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,160
the visibility and the
ability to prove and make sure

80
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,720
you're matching those compliance

81
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,433
and those security frameworks.

82
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,250
All of these decisions,
you've told us, takes a toll.

83
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,310
All of this takes a
cognitive load on your teams.

84
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,960
You've told us, Sofía,

85
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,010
every time we see a new
service or a new functionality,

86
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,360
we have to map this back.

87
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,660
We have to understand
how this meets our needs,

88
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,960
how this relates to everything
we've already deployed,

89
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,020
help us ensure that this is intuitive,

90
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,430
that this is easy to spin up.

91
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,490
So this is definitely
something we've kept in mind,

92
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,610
and it's on us to ensure
that things are easier

93
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,453
to start, easier to ramp up to onboard.

94
00:04:32,453 --> 00:04:35,700
We're thinking about things
like interoperability,

95
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,190
integration, native attachments,

96
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,164
so we're abstracting away
things that are manual,

97
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:45,090
and you can spend less
time in that cognitive load

98
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,560
and more time doing things

99
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,193
that are your comparative
advantage and with your business.

100
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,990
Visibility is a key aspect to everything.

101
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,690
You've deployed, you've set your rules,

102
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,940
your policies, your configurations.

103
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,130
How do you know they're working optimally

104
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,840
to meet your use cases?

105
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,960
We're making sure that across the board,

106
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,710
we've made a commitment to
adding visibility all across

107
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,440
our network suite, and we're
super excited to share some

108
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,283
of that today.

109
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,810
And lastly, this is a
fast-paced, high-changing world.

110
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,463
Right?

111
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:23,760
In the era of AI,

112
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,810
how do we know what new
threats are evolving

113
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,160
in this landscape?

114
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,750
We understand that, and
given our unique perspective

115
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,240
with a global infrastructure that we have,

116
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,860
we're able to understand that,

117
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,880
take back the insights that we see across

118
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,335
our traffic patterns, and
make sure we're protecting

119
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:46,380
our local infrastructure,

120
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,460
our AWS underlying
infrastructure, and more and more,

121
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,580
we're giving you a lot of
that threat intelligence

122
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,700
to be able to use that
into your own solutions,

123
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,500
and we'll walk through that as well.

124
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,200
So we know there is no such
thing as a silver bullet

125
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,550
to security, right?

126
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,790
Everything is a layered
defense in depth strategy,

127
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,690
and we understand that
it takes a lot of pieces

128
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,570
that you must tackle to
ensure that you're layering

129
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,220
for defense in depth.

130
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,390
But what we're here to talk
about today is things inside

131
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,330
of the network and
application protection space,

132
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,330
and here, you can see
those here in the middle

133
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,163
of the display.

134
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,130
Now, how do you think
about those services?

135
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,590
We understand that sometimes
it could be challenging

136
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:39,540
to understand how these
things work together,

137
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,273
so let's walk through that real quick.

138
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,690
When you, if you think about

139
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,760
a typical web application architecture,

140
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,114
if you think about how you're organizing

141
00:06:51,114 --> 00:06:53,790
and protecting your traffic as it comes

142
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,288
into your network, you
definitely want to start

143
00:06:56,288 --> 00:07:00,696
with setting up a WAF, a
web application firewall,

144
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:02,580
and a Shield Advanced,

145
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,030
our anti-DDoS solution to
ensure that you're protecting

146
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,603
from threats that are
coming in into your network.

147
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,310
As the traffic is coming in,

148
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,030
you move into the idea of
segmenting, organizing,

149
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,660
and inspecting that
traffic inside of the VPCs.

150
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,320
So then you can leverage a service like

151
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,450
our AWS Network Firewall,

152
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,100
which is our cloud-managed
native next-gen firewall

153
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,700
on AWS, to do things like organizing

154
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,741
for east-west, inspecting
east-west traffic inside

155
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:43,440
of your VPCs, or we
have a lot of customers

156
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,550
that jointly with AWS
WAF use Network Firewall

157
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,120
for ingress inspection
and ingress use cases.

158
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,508
But by and large,

159
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:56,278
the biggest use cases that
we see for Network Firewall

160
00:07:56,278 --> 00:08:00,626
is organizing and setting up robust egress

161
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:03,030
or outbound controls.

162
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:08,030
For egress, it is definitely
a two-part solution.

163
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,430
We want to ensure that folks know

164
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,159
to use Network Firewall along

165
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,544
with Route 53 Resolver DNS firewall

166
00:08:16,544 --> 00:08:19,983
for that DNS path as well.

167
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,750
And then organizing this,
right? Organizing this at scale.

168
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,090
You have WAF policies, security groups,

169
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,270
NACLs to think about, the
DNS firewall policies,

170
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,070
Network Firewall WAFs.

171
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,500
How do you make sure that
you're able to deploy

172
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,150
this from a central location?

173
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:40,290
And that is where services
like Firewall Manager

174
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,830
come into play, where you're
able to organize these,

175
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,870
set these up, and configure these,

176
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,050
and get central visibility from one place.

177
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,767
And Shield Network Security Director,

178
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:53,135
which I'll walk through in a bit,

179
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:57,150
is also meant to give you
extra visibility inside

180
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,043
of your network resources.

181
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:03,030
And if you're more of a visual person,

182
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,120
if you can think about where,

183
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,400
as you're moving your traffic

184
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,160
through your typical web
application architecture,

185
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,950
you'll get that WAF and Shield to protect

186
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,800
on that ingress path,
the Network Firewall,

187
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,985
and the DNS firewall to
protect both paths out

188
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:21,930
on that egress.

189
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,430
And then the Firewall Manager

190
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,213
and Shield Network Security Director

191
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:29,403
for that cross management
and visibility use case.

192
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,770
Now, this is also the team
that ensures and manages

193
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,870
our AWS underlying global backbone.

194
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,870
So we manage and deploy
across our global presence,

195
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,803
and we're making additional
commitment to ensure

196
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:51,390
that you are matching the connectivity,

197
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,640
the performance, and, you know,

198
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,230
the throughput that you need to ensure

199
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,820
that you meet your use cases.

200
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,184
And with that global presence comes

201
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:06,270
an immense scale of protection.

202
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,970
So if you think about
everywhere we are deployed

203
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,863
and the sheer amount
of traffic that we see

204
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:13,955
on a daily basis,

205
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:17,250
think about these are exabytes of data

206
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,493
that we analyze and we see
through our infrastructure

207
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:23,100
on a minute basis,

208
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,866
and thousands of DDoS attacks
that we're able to mitigate

209
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,553
on a daily basis.

210
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,765
All of this comes back
into threat research

211
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:37,500
that we can analyze and learn from.

212
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,110
So if we think about how
we can work backwards

213
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,938
from threats, we know that
there are threat actors

214
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:47,640
who have threat targets and
leave behind threat artifacts

215
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,995
or indicators of compromise,
that we can take, analyze,

216
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:56,010
and build threat intelligence
that we can then use

217
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,710
to mitigate those further attacks.

218
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,560
But here at Amazon and our threat research

219
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,120
and threat intelligence teams,

220
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,240
we like to take a more proactive approach,

221
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,750
and that's the idea of
deceptive technology.

222
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,750
So we disclosed this project
a couple of years ago.

223
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:17,818
If you've heard of MadPot,

224
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:21,420
which is one of our threat
research projects inside

225
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,290
of Amazon, this is
essentially a set of decoys

226
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,560
that we've deployed all
across our infrastructure.

227
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,210
So we have tens of thousands
of decoys deployed across

228
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,290
our global infrastructure.

229
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,110
These are emulating vulnerable services

230
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,800
with different variations
of vulnerabilities,

231
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,920
and we can take that and see the recon,

232
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,970
the type of traffic...

233
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,970
We observe insights that we
see and take and learn from,

234
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,753
and that is integrated
and leveraged across

235
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:58,753
our existing services like
Shield, like GuardDuty.

236
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,308
So now I want to share
everything that's new

237
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:04,290
in network visibility.

238
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,360
As I mentioned, we've made a commitment

239
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,970
and we've understood that folks are asking

240
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,973
for greater visibility
across their network stack.

241
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,900
So, in talking to a lot of customers,

242
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,900
you've told us, Sofía, I
manage a central security team,

243
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,460
but I can only do so much
by setting guardrails,

244
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,920
by setting security baselines.

245
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,750
But I have a complex type of architecture,

246
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,390
a complex type of business organization.

247
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,580
I am inheriting legacy systems,

248
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,420
legacy business units with
different security teams

249
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,940
that are used to doing
things a different way.

250
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,590
So my central guardrails,
unfortunately, only go so far,

251
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,920
and I have to grant
exceptions to these teams.

252
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,150
How do I know what these
teams have actually deployed?

253
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:05,150
I also have to give my
development teams and my app teams

254
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,010
a certain degree of autonomy, right?

255
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,130
I want them to have the
autonomy to work fast

256
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,270
and build fast.

257
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,571
But now how do I know if
they've deployed correctly,

258
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:19,833
if I have things configured,
or what even exists out there?

259
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,300
So this is where the Shield
Network Security Director

260
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,980
service comes into play.

261
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,320
So we announced this a
couple of months ago.

262
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,690
It is currently in preview,

263
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,690
so you can try this out at no cost.

264
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,950
And that is essentially

265
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,410
the use cases that we're trying to solve.

266
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,230
Primary piece is giving
you that visibility

267
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,463
into your network.

268
00:13:41,463 --> 00:13:46,020
It will first scan your
network resources and give you

269
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,960
a topology view of what exists.

270
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,970
It will give you various findings

271
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,030
and give you different severity
levels that you can take

272
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,410
a look at and triage based
upon our AWS best practices.

273
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,180
And we'll set recommendations

274
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,710
based on those best practices.

275
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,360
And if you have any questions,

276
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,911
there's an integration
with Amazon Q Developer

277
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:09,900
where you can ask things of your network

278
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,300
from a natural language basis.

279
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,310
So it's really easy to get started.

280
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,470
Essentially, you start a network analysis

281
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,580
and that will start a scan.

282
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,280
You'll choose the accounts
that you want to scan,

283
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,030
and it will show you
first that topology view.

284
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,860
It will show you what
is connected to what,

285
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,630
what the relationships are,

286
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,970
and you can basically
double click and drill

287
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,339
into each piece and those findings

288
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,940
and those recommendations.

289
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,541
It's important to note here,

290
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:42,853
we may be familiar with
similar type of topology maps.

291
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:44,853
The key thing is here,

292
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,410
you will see everything in
the map no matter if there

293
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,830
is a finding associated
with something or a type

294
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:57,420
of vulnerability or risk,
whether it's there or not.

295
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,070
The key thing is visibility.

296
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,075
So you'll be able to
see everything that is,

297
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:06,903
even if it does not have any
findings associated to it.

298
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,690
You'll be able to also drill
into the type of findings

299
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,430
and different ways.

300
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,170
We have different widgets and dashboards

301
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,450
where you'll be able to
drill into different types

302
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,910
of resource types, filter by those types,

303
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,130
filter by different severity levels.

304
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,792
And then this is that cue piece where,

305
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,702
if you choose to, this
is not a requirement

306
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:31,440
of the service, but if you choose to,

307
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,437
you can ask specific questions
based on your use case

308
00:15:35,437 --> 00:15:37,800
to get drilled into everything

309
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,633
that is in your network posture.

310
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,500
So we've also added additional
visibility across the rest

311
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,790
of our firewalls as well.

312
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,550
The first of which is on AWS WAF.

313
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,640
Now we understood that you
needed additional visibility

314
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,970
into understanding
whether your WAF policies,

315
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,530
your rules were working
as you expected them to.

316
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,080
So this new dashboard experience gives you

317
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,350
that additional visibility
to where, for instance,

318
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,100
if you have teams that have
set all of your WAF policies

319
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,030
to alert mode and you are
expecting, for instance,

320
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,350
for them to be blocking,

321
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,129
you'll be able to easily
see what percentage

322
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:26,670
of your WAF estate is
set on alert or block

323
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,834
for easy triage to understand

324
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:33,030
why it might not be behaving
or why it is behaving,

325
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,160
you know, the way that you expected to.

326
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,540
Additionally, you'll be
able to see things like

327
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,660
where you're seeing
traffic hitting your WAF

328
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,141
and hitting your network.

329
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:48,930
So you might have and
operate in a specific region,

330
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,370
in a specific geo,

331
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,420
so you should not expect to
see traffic in different geos.

332
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,240
Now you'll be able to easily see those

333
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,613
in this dashboard experience as well.

334
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,690
In tandem with that,

335
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,230
we've reduced the price
on the CloudWatch logs

336
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,210
for this new dashboard experience,

337
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,100
so now that gives you essentially

338
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,893
a more predictable cost
structure for that.

339
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,660
Moving on to Network Firewall.

340
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,100
So previously we had an
open-sourced dashboard

341
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,920
that you could spin up
and get traffic insights

342
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,180
for Network Firewall.

343
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,376
We have now announced

344
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:33,180
a new native console
dashboard experience as well

345
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,920
on Network Firewall where you'll be able

346
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,750
to see traffic insights,

347
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,620
things like top talkers and different ways

348
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:45,210
to help you optimize your traffic.

349
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:50,210
For instance, things that
might be good recommendations

350
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,860
for a private link endpoint.

351
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,257
So we have customers that
may not need to, you know,

352
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:59,767
scan all their traffic
through Network Firewall.

353
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:03,510
This new dashboard experience
essentially bubbles up things

354
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,062
that are great private link candidates

355
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:08,010
where you can route your traffic

356
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,630
through that trusted private
link destination and be

357
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,463
on your way.

358
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,100
All right, moving on to
everything that's new

359
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,520
in the world of application
and edge protection.

360
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,030
So we've touched on WAF and
I mentioned we're trying

361
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,230
to essentially make it as
easy as possible for you

362
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:36,230
to get started and spin
up on your WAF web ACLs.

363
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,720
So we have revamped the creation
of the web ACL experience.

364
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,730
Previously it was a very
DIY type of experience.

365
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,760
Now we've radically made it easier

366
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,180
to give you protection
packs and starter packs

367
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,750
where we recommend rule
types for you to get started.

368
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,356
Additionally, just this week we launched

369
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:05,356
a CloudFront Plus Security
bundled flat rate prices.

370
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,977
So this includes CloudFront, WAF,

371
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:12,560
DDoS and Route 53 DNS protections

372
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,210
in a simplified flat rate price.

373
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,190
This is aimed at our founder
persona that where folks

374
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,280
are asking us to give them predictability

375
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,890
in their pricing to make
sure that they're able

376
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,593
to be protected and be on their way.

377
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,025
So new to getting started on WAF,

378
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:38,877
you'll now be able to
essentially tell the experience

379
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:44,910
what type of application
you're trying to build.

380
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,160
And based on that type of application,

381
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,400
be it like an e-commerce
or a banking application,

382
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,120
we'll essentially
recommend different rules

383
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,690
to get you started based on
that type of application.

384
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,540
So as previously you see far at the end,

385
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,570
the only experience that
before this new dash,

386
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,841
this new Starter Pack,

387
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:08,700
protection packs allowed,

388
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,950
it was only a DIY type of experience.

389
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,910
Now you'll be able

390
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,240
to leverage these new
recommended kind of configuration

391
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,373
packs to get you started easier.

392
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,240
Also new to WAF

393
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,240
is a new Layer 7 anti-DDoS
protection managed rule.

394
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,490
Now, I know we mentioned
that Shield Advanced

395
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,290
is our anti-DDoS service.

396
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,290
We have now brought in DDoS protections

397
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,570
as a managed rule onto WAF.

398
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,760
If you're a Shield Advanced customer,

399
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,669
this is included in that subscription.

400
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:44,160
So, you know, these work in tandem.

401
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,650
But this now essentially
gives folks additional

402
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,780
configuration and tunability, visibility,

403
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,470
where we were hearing
from a lot of customers

404
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,570
that they wanted greater visibility

405
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,900
into how these DDoS
protections were working.

406
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,064
Essentially now with this managed rule,

407
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:03,180
we're able to extend
greater configuration,

408
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,117
greater tunability, and greater visibility

409
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:08,013
in that Layer 7 type of protection.

410
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,830
And lastly, new to WAF, we've
added in this age of AI,

411
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,430
it's really important to
ensure that you are able

412
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,280
to authenticate AI agents.

413
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,232
So we are now leveraging
cryptographic signatures

414
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:26,820
on HTTP for verification,

415
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,760
and this will now automatically verify

416
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,613
against in the category AI bots as well.

417
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,693
All right.

418
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:37,080
Now I'll hand it off to Saleem,

419
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,060
who will walk us through
everything that's new

420
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,160
in the world of network protection.

421
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,993
Thanks.

422
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:45,847
- Thank you, Sofía.
(audience applauding)

423
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:47,707
All right.

424
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:50,940
So Sofía just provided
an overview of network

425
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,700
and application protection portfolio.

426
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,550
Then she shared some
enhancements in the space

427
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,910
of threat intelligence and visibility.

428
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,010
And finally, she talked
about some innovations

429
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,080
in application protection space.

430
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,423
Now I'm gonna focus on network protection.

431
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,950
When it comes to network protection,

432
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,203
you generally face
three unique challenges.

433
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,980
First is cyber threats
are constantly changing

434
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,290
and becoming more sophisticated,

435
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,640
which means that staying ahead

436
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,620
of these threats requires
that you continue

437
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,033
to adapt your defenses.

438
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,450
That takes us to challenge number two,

439
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,300
which is your teams are
already spread too thin,

440
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,750
and finding the right skill
set can be challenging.

441
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,840
This actually results in
additional time it may take

442
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,210
for you to detect threats, analyze data,

443
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,220
and take remediation action.

444
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,410
And this challenge is also connected

445
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,400
to challenge number three,
which is you need insights.

446
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,350
You need visibility into
how your applications

447
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,330
are talking to each other and outside

448
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,800
of your environment,

449
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,230
so that you can identify threats quickly

450
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,420
and take remediation actions.

451
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:02,223
All of this makes network
protection critical and complex.

452
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,850
Today I'll talk about a
couple of AWS services

453
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,800
that can help in this space.

454
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,480
First one is Amazon Route
53 Resolver DNS Firewall,

455
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,463
and second is AWS Network Firewall.

456
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:22,470
Amazon Route 53 DNS Resolver
Firewall, DNS Firewall,

457
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,300
is a fully managed service

458
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,700
that helps you block DNS
queries to malicious domains

459
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,823
and allows DNS resolution
to trusted domains.

460
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,490
It is a fully managed service

461
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,688
that you can deploy centrally

462
00:23:36,688 --> 00:23:39,813
to provide coverage across multiple VPCs.

463
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,455
The way you can write policy is either

464
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:47,190
by creating your own custom
domain lists or using one

465
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,413
of the Amazon provided
managed domain lists.

466
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,440
The service provides
full logging capability

467
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,970
so that you can meet compliance

468
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,683
or perform your own auditing.

469
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,838
It also provides advanced
DNS security functionalities,

470
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:03,450
for example, protection
against DGA attacks

471
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,533
or DNS tunneling.

472
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,620
Second service is AWS Network Firewall.

473
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,214
This is our cloud next-gen firewall

474
00:24:13,214 --> 00:24:17,610
which offers stateful inspection.

475
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,620
It provides IDS

476
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,490
and IPS capabilities as
well as TLS decryption

477
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,830
so you can crack open the packet, do

478
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,080
the packet inspection, and
then re-encrypt and send it

479
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,043
to the destination.

480
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,700
This is a fully managed, highly available,

481
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,850
and auto-scaling capability,
which essentially means

482
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,590
that as your traffic increases,

483
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,690
we'll automatically
add additional capacity

484
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,723
to your firewalls all the way
to 100 gigabit per second.

485
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,480
The service also supports
full logging capability.

486
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,560
There are two types of logs

487
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,470
that support flow logs
as well as alert logs.

488
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,640
The way you write the rules,

489
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,320
you can write them in alert mode

490
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,452
so you can get visibility, allow,

491
00:24:57,452 --> 00:25:00,363
or block based on the
action that you take.

492
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:06,870
The way that you deploy
this firewall is one

493
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:10,530
to either provide protection
for ingress traffic,

494
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:15,120
basically any threats that
are coming from the internet

495
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,130
into your VPCs.

496
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,090
You can deploy it

497
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,306
for egress protection
across VPCs, across regions.

498
00:25:22,306 --> 00:25:25,260
Or third, which is the most common one,

499
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,410
is egress protection
to protect any traffic

500
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,860
that is going from your
VPCs out to the internet.

501
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,910
Because this is one

502
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,000
of the most common deployment options

503
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,910
that customers take,
let's take a little bit

504
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,353
of a deeper dive into it.

505
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,193
When looking at egress protection,

506
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,820
there are multiple choices
that are available to you.

507
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,700
Some choices are free
of charge, for example,

508
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,723
stateful security groups
or stateless network ACLs.

509
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,050
We already talked about DNS firewall

510
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,380
to provide you protection at DNS layer.

511
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,660
And then you have some choices

512
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,470
by using middle boxes such
as third party firewalls

513
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,810
or AWS Network Firewall.

514
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,890
In some cases, there are
some customers who require

515
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,510
an explicit proxy.

516
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,000
So far, their choice had been to use one

517
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,580
of the third party explicit proxies

518
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,800
and manage it themselves.

519
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,553
But very recently, we
actually have a new service

520
00:26:25,553 --> 00:26:27,480
that we made available.

521
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,388
It's a fully managed explicit egress proxy

522
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,270
that is offered as a new resource type

523
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,190
under AWS Network Firewall.

524
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,330
So the existing firewall,

525
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,850
it operates as a transparent appliance.

526
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,620
But this new resource type

527
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,433
offers explicit egress function as well.

528
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,630
You can deploy egress
proxy on your NAT gateway,

529
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,700
which makes it very simple
because a lot of traffic

530
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,850
is going to taking the egress path.

531
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,223
And NAT gateway is
generally part of that flow.

532
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,820
The way it works is when the traffic comes

533
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,580
into the proxy, you can
create pre-DNS filtering.

534
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,170
So essentially, it looks at the domains

535
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,510
and filters out any
communications that are going

536
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,880
to malicious or unallowed domains.

537
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,780
After that, the proxy
will do a DNS resolution.

538
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,220
Once the DNS resolution is done,

539
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,270
you can do another

540
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,730
filtering based on post-DNS information.

541
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,930
If the traffic is authorized,
it goes to the destination.

542
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,850
And when the response
comes back from the server,

543
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,794
you can do another analysis based on

544
00:27:28,794 --> 00:27:32,730
the response coming back
from the servers and using

545
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,630
the header attributes in the response.

546
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,730
The service also supports TLS decryption,

547
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,160
so you can definitely use that.

548
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,140
It supports logging capability just like

549
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,820
the existing firewall resource type,

550
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,553
so you can meet compliance
and auditing requirements.

551
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,260
And basically, you can use this to perform

552
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,207
the same functions that
other firewalls provide,

553
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,780
basically to protect
against data exfiltration

554
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,423
or attacks that are based on malwares.

555
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,513
Coming back to the existing
firewall resource type,

556
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,410
there are two ways generally in which you

557
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,610
have been deploying firewalls.

558
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,710
One is distributed firewall deployment,

559
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,030
which is a form where you
deploy a firewall within VPC

560
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,030
and manage it as an individual resource.

561
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,530
Then there is another type,

562
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,790
which is centralized deployment,

563
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,670
typically deployed by a
centralized cloud infrastructure,

564
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:31,080
cloud security team, where they
will have a transit gateway.

565
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,100
And with the transit gateway,

566
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,623
you can create an inspection
VPC where you'll deploy

567
00:28:35,623 --> 00:28:38,760
a firewall and route traffic through it.

568
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,280
It's a very scalable approach
if you have lots and lots

569
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,430
of VPCs and you're centrally
managing your traffic

570
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,043
for either east-west or egress path.

571
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,390
Very recently, actually
around reinforced timeframe,

572
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,060
we simplified the centralized
inspection process.

573
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,030
We actually made available
a native TGW attachment.

574
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,220
So within transit gateway,

575
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,890
you enable native firewall attachment.

576
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,230
We will take the
responsibility of creating

577
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,330
the inspection VPC, creating the firewall,

578
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,360
creating the subnet, and
creating the route table entries

579
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,790
to route traffic through transit gateway

580
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,610
and through this inspection
VPC and the firewall.

581
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,620
All you have to do is point your traffic

582
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,373
to the native attachment and
we'll take care of the rest.

583
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,380
Now, leveraging the same
capability, a couple

584
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,820
of weeks ago, we enhanced

585
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,630
the centralized deployment
model even further.

586
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,420
And this time, we are
taking the simplification

587
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,064
on the cost allocation side.

588
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:38,350
So if you are from a centralized
cloud infrastructure,

589
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,130
cloud security team, what
you have been telling us

590
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,410
is that you are processing traffic

591
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,870
through transit gateway and
Network Firewall centrally

592
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,450
and taking on the cost burden for all

593
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,550
of that data processing yourself.

594
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,020
The more your environments grow,

595
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,060
the more application teams
that you're servicing,

596
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,320
the amount of volume grows,

597
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,955
and then it becomes very difficult for you

598
00:29:56,955 --> 00:29:59,610
to get visibility into which applications

599
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,420
are generating more cost burden for you.

600
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,250
With flexible cost allocation,

601
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,080
we are simplifying that entire process.

602
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,640
So within transit gateway,

603
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,218
you create a cost allocation policy.

604
00:30:11,218 --> 00:30:12,750
Based on that policy,

605
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,347
you can attribute the cost
of data processing in TGW

606
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,710
and Network Firewall to
either the peer account owner

607
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,330
of the source attachment,
destination attachment,

608
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,260
or the centralized cloud
infrastructure team

609
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,557
that owns Network Firewall
and transit gateway.

610
00:30:27,557 --> 00:30:30,425
You can create this
policy at attachment level

611
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:33,273
or more granularly at the flow level.

612
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,070
This native attachment
is our recommended way

613
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,440
of deploying centralized deployment,

614
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,150
because going forward, there will be

615
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,980
a lot more enhancements that will be added

616
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,573
to this kind of functionality.

617
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,469
Now, switching gears
towards threat intelligence,

618
00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:55,440
there are a couple of things
that I'll talk about both

619
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,503
in the space of or in the
area of managed rule groups.

620
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,710
First is active threat defense,

621
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:05,133
which is an Amazon-provided
managed rule group.

622
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,330
Earlier, Sofía was talking about MadPot,

623
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:14,330
which is Amazon's own globally
deployed infrastructure

624
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,830
of honeypots or digital decoys.

625
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:21,180
Our threat researchers actually
exposed these digital decoys

626
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,330
as vulnerable services
to attract interaction

627
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,160
from malicious actors.

628
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,446
Through that interaction,
we learn about their TTPs

629
00:31:29,446 --> 00:31:31,350
and use that threat intelligence

630
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,213
to protect AWS infrastructure.

631
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,540
You have been asking us to provide

632
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,680
the same threat intelligence

633
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,175
that we have to protect AWS infrastructure

634
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:43,114
and make it available for you

635
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:46,080
so that you can protect your
workloads and VPCs as well.

636
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,230
So active threat defense
is our answer to that.

637
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,207
This rule group is generated based on

638
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:52,260
the threat intelligence

639
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,110
that is exactly coming
directly from MadPot.

640
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,240
Once you deploy it on Network Firewall,

641
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,700
we will make sure that we keep it updated.

642
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,000
So as soon as we detect
a threat which is active,

643
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,310
we will add it to the rule group.

644
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,885
And as soon as we realize
that one of the threats

645
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,740
is not active anymore
and it becomes stale,

646
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,470
we'll remove the rule that
is associated with that.

647
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,930
And we do it at a 10-minute interval.

648
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:16,950
So every 10 minutes,

649
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,930
if there is a change
in the threat landscape

650
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,300
that we have visibility
into, we'll make the update.

651
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,940
If there is no change, then
we'll let it go. Right?

652
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,780
So once you deploy it,

653
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,420
there is no need for any manual action.

654
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,760
You can deploy the rule
group either in alert mode

655
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,300
to get visibility or you
can deploy it in block mode

656
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,430
to get visibility as well as take

657
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,983
the simultaneous block action on that.

658
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,290
This is exactly how it works.

659
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,300
In your VPCs, you have firewalls.

660
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,650
This firewall can be deployed

661
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,510
in a distributed deployment model,

662
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,640
basically a firewall in every VPC,

663
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,673
or in a centralized deployment
model with transit gateway.

664
00:32:57,931 --> 00:33:01,800
The middle box is essentially
all of the processing

665
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,360
that we take ownership of.

666
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,720
Our security engineers
are detecting the threats,

667
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,460
they're analyzing it,
they're processing it,

668
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,550
they're making sure that the threats

669
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,620
that they have identified
are actually real.

670
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,060
Once we are sure of that,

671
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,760
at that point we automatically
update the rule groups.

672
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:23,113
Now the second area that
I wanna talk about is you

673
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,510
have been telling us that
when you write firewall rules,

674
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,302
you can of course write custom rules.

675
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:30,780
But in many cases,

676
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,490
you already have existing relationships

677
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,440
with some security vendors.

678
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,790
You're procuring threat intelligence

679
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,580
and using it either
on-prem or in other clouds

680
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,740
or in your firewall as well.

681
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,510
So the current mode of procuring

682
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,670
this third-party threat
intelligence and applying it

683
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,910
on Network Firewall has been
to use the custom rules,

684
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,470
which is a manual process

685
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,430
and adds operational burden on you.

686
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,230
You have been asking us to
simplify that entire process.

687
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,310
Recently, actually a couple of weeks ago,

688
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,010
we announced partner managed rule groups

689
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,660
on Network Firewall.

690
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,500
These rule groups

691
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,666
are based on partner
generated threat intelligence

692
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:10,860
that is available through Marketplace.

693
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,260
The way you deploy this is you go

694
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,390
to AWS Network Firewall console.

695
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:18,150
Within the console, you have
stateful managed rule groups.

696
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,894
That's where you can learn
about all of the partners

697
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:23,520
and their unique managed rule groups

698
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,110
that are available to you.

699
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,479
You can learn more about
what type of rule groups

700
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:30,360
that they provide, what type
of coverage they provide

701
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,130
within the console itself.

702
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,740
Once you have selected the
rule group that you want

703
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,810
to deploy, you hit the subscribe button

704
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,520
and it will automatically take care of all

705
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,830
of the backend functions and make

706
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,510
the rule group available to you.

707
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,270
The step after that is essentially taking

708
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,610
that rule group and
applying it to your firewall

709
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,810
and you're done.

710
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,756
Behind the scene, partners
are taking the responsibility.

711
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,959
As soon as they have a change to make

712
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,940
on the rule group, they will
automatically make the change.

713
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,760
You will not be in the
process, essentially,

714
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,770
you don't have to take
any kind of static action

715
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,975
or manual action to get
the updated rule groups.

716
00:35:04,975 --> 00:35:07,980
You can deploy it either
in alert mode, once again,

717
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,440
just like active threat
defense to get visibility

718
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,870
into the threat activity,

719
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:16,050
or in block mode which will give you both

720
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,239
the visibility as well
as simultaneously block

721
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,213
the communication to the
malicious infrastructure.

722
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,620
There are seven partners

723
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,653
that have launched these
managed rule groups with us.

724
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,430
I will quickly cover their uniqueness,

725
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,500
what type of managed rule
groups that they offer

726
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,693
and how they can benefit
your environments.

727
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,353
First is Check Point.

728
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,600
Check Point is a global
cyber security company

729
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,963
that offers or provides a wide
range of security solutions.

730
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:53,760
They are a pioneer in stateful firewall

731
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,353
and now offer AI-powered
cloud-delivered security solutions.

732
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,830
Their managed rule group
for AWS Network Firewall

733
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,669
is based on their threat cloud AI experts

734
00:36:05,669 --> 00:36:10,020
that automatically create
this rule group and make sure

735
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,758
that it is updated so that
you can get protection

736
00:36:12,758 --> 00:36:17,758
in the areas of CVEs or
OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities.

737
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,990
Second partner is Fortinet,

738
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,723
which is a well-known
cyber security company

739
00:36:27,723 --> 00:36:30,543
and offers next-gen firewalls.

740
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,590
Their managed rule groups are based on

741
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:39,090
the threat research that
their FortiGuard lab provides.

742
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,060
It's the same threat research
that is available to you

743
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,390
as a Fortinet customer across the globe.

744
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,510
So if you are using Fortinet
for example on on-prem

745
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,010
or in other clouds you can bring

746
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,880
the same threat intelligence

747
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,133
and apply it on AWS side as well.

748
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,683
They offer managed IPS rule groups

749
00:36:57,683 --> 00:37:00,420
for AWS Network Firewall
that help you protect

750
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,563
against exploits,
vulnerabilities and C2 attacks.

751
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,780
Infoblox unites networking,
security and cloud

752
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,260
to protect you or basically integrate

753
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,720
with their protective DDI platform

754
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,970
so that enterprise can get
agility and resilience.

755
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,780
Their managed rule groups are based on

756
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,283
their predictive DNS threat intelligence.

757
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,280
At Infoblox's scale

758
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,220
with 70 billion events detected every day

759
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,817
or 4 million indicators every month

760
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:45,817
with 90% pre-query detections,

761
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:51,170
you get faster protection with
low noise and high impact.

762
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,860
Next up is Lumen

763
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,770
which is a global
communication service provider

764
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:02,430
that integrates products
and services in the space

765
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,023
of networking and security.

766
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,610
Their defender managed
rule group is available

767
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,470
on Network Firewall based

768
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,380
on the unique threat
intelligence that they generate

769
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,780
through Black Lotus Labs.

770
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,050
It is their own threat intelligence
team, Black Lotus Labs,

771
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,517
that identifies and neutralizes hundreds

772
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:24,000
of emerging threats leveraging

773
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,953
their backbone level visibility.

774
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,403
Then we have Rapid7 that
offers products and services

775
00:38:33,403 --> 00:38:38,011
in the space of detection and response.

776
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:41,400
Their products include
vulnerability risk management,

777
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,710
attack surface management as well as

778
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,273
managed detection and response.

779
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:50,310
The product that they offer,

780
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,860
basically the managed rule
groups are self-cleaning

781
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,350
and expert-vetted and provide coverage

782
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,730
in two specific areas.

783
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,310
One is advanced persistent threat.

784
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,490
This is where they protect
against state-sponsored

785
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:06,700
or sophisticated attacks, or ransomware,

786
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,180
which is essentially
providing you protection

787
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,163
against financially motivated attacks.

788
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:18,510
ThreatSTOP is a cloud-based
threat intelligence company

789
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,390
that generates their threat
intelligence across thousands

790
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,610
of resources globally.

791
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,520
They convert that into actionable policies

792
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,490
that are made available
to you in your routers,

793
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,413
firewalls or DNS servers.

794
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,940
ThreatSTOP already offers
managed rule groups for AWS WAF.

795
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,550
So now they're extending
their managed rule groups

796
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,810
to Network Firewalls

797
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,420
so you can get network
layer protection as well.

798
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,820
Their rule groups provide
ingress protection

799
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,980
as well as egress protection,

800
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,943
and help you meet compliance
with ITAR and OFAC.

801
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,500
Lastly we have TrendMicro
which is a well-known scene app

802
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,603
or cloud native application protection

803
00:39:59,603 --> 00:40:04,200
platform with expertise in
protecting your environments

804
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,033
in the cloud.

805
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,220
Their manageable groups are based on

806
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,410
their Digital Vaccine program,

807
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,210
which customers are
already using to protect

808
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,968
their cloud environments.

809
00:40:13,968 --> 00:40:16,860
And the specialization that they offer

810
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,510
with their managed groups
on Network Firewall

811
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,430
is to protect you
against zero day attacks.

812
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:23,910
So they have a program called
Trend's Zero Day Initiative

813
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,370
that generates the threat
intelligence and by using

814
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,510
this managed rule group,

815
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:31,140
you are protected faster from the

816
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,140
zero vulnerabilities that are out there.

817
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,290
To summarize, we talked
about some enhancements

818
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:43,113
in the area of threat
intelligence and visibility.

819
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,508
We talked about some
onboarding enhancements

820
00:40:46,508 --> 00:40:50,820
for application protection
and network protection.

821
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,868
We also talked about a new resource type

822
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,303
of explicit proxy within
AWS Network Firewall.

823
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,800
Before we leave, I wanted to share,

824
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,500
there are some additional
sessions that are available

825
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,245
for you to learn more about our firewalls,

826
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:10,290
ingress protection, egress protection,

827
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,650
and overall network and
application protection.

828
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,869
With that said, I hope
you found our session

829
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:20,869
to be informative and the
journey very exciting.

830
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:25,140
Both Sofía and I, we will
stick around here for a while.

831
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,670
If you have any questions and would like

832
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,130
to share your feedback,
we'll really appreciate it.

833
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,623
With that, thank you so much.
