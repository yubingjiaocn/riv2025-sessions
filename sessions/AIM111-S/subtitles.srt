1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,033
- Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,533
Thanks for coming.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,273
All right, through a couple of these.

4
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,850
All right, so I wanna do two things today.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,940
I wanna talk about

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,730
how you can take your
AI-assisted development

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,440
and use Slack to supercharge that,

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,910
to streamline it,

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,740
and I also want to touch upon

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,180
how you can use Slack to
deploy agents and build AI.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,820
So, I'll try to go over some
high-level topics when I can.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,720
I don't know.

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,210
Actually, who in this room uses Slack?

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,480
In the room, in this box
area that uses Slack?

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,630
Okay, has anyone
developed on Slack before?

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,793
Okay, one or two.

17
00:00:46,793 --> 00:00:48,540
Okay, okay, so I'll go over some,

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,090
like I'll try to sneak into
my high-level concepts.

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,820
All right, so Slack,

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,330
the Slack platform came
out maybe 8-10 years ago,

21
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,830
and at its core,

22
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,560
it's basically an
event-driven platform, right?

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,150
Just like Slack, the products.

24
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,490
So back then we called them bots, right?

25
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,610
Bots were just basically non-human actors

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,440
within the Slack workspace.

27
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,520
And now we call them agents,

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,700
which are bots with LLMs attached.

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,080
But technology and the architecture

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,360
is almost exactly the same.

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,410
So the past few years,

32
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,390
we've found a really good match

33
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,430
with the development
that's been happening.

34
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,620
So, it's really kinda a
natural match of Slack

35
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,480
and between a lot of the explosions.

36
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,910
So, I wanna focus on the far right here.

37
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,820
I'm not gonna talk about Slack usage,

38
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,380
I'm gonna really focus
on developer conference,

39
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,170
so we'll focus on AI specifically

40
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,470
and what we're doing within Slack.

41
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,630
You know, so every company is complex.

42
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,000
You know, there's no one silver bullet,

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,437
one solution that works.

44
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:50,250
You know, you acquire
companies, make acquisitions,

45
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,610
they have employees
build things and leave.

46
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,443
You're working.

47
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:56,670
There's always a blend of solutions,

48
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,630
so our approach to AI is
trying to support all of that.

49
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,430
You know, whether it's out of the box,

50
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,320
whether it's something
that you've had running

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,090
on your servers for 10 years,

52
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,970
whether it's a partner that
you chose to work with.

53
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,980
So, we try to build in a way

54
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,330
and give you the tools,

55
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,280
be able to serve all those things

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,080
because really, I'm sure all
the businesses you work for

57
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,863
use all that.

58
00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:22,890
So, I would say our biggest
advantage is the UI.

59
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,360
So, when you're developing AI,

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,250
you should be focused on what?

61
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,540
The new technology, the
business value, the solution.

62
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,770
Slack gives you an out-of-the-box UI

63
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,270
you don't have to worry about.

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,690
We've introduced some
new things this year.

65
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,630
So, if you've seen work objects,

66
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,110
we are having some new multimodal
stuff that's coming out.

67
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,750
And then probably one of
the most popular aspects

68
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,370
of working in Slack and
building AI is context, right?

69
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,290
So to have a good agent,

70
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,020
what you need is who's talking to who?

71
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,550
What are the relationships?

72
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,930
How do people relate to each other?

73
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,640
Channels relate to each other,

74
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,160
objects relate to each other.

75
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,690
What happened last week?

76
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,850
And also what happened
in the last five minutes?

77
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,950
So, oftentimes though,
that's what it takes

78
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,530
to have a good contextual agent

79
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,670
that actually makes sense,

80
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,920
that actually serves a purpose.

81
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,400
So, we give that to you
through a set of APIs

82
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,930
we can call in real time,

83
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,420
you can call on behalf
of the user as well.

84
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,240
So, when you're launching
agents in the Slack,

85
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,970
you can understand what
that user is allowed to see

86
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,700
and only what that user is allowed to see,

87
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,740
and then use that context for the agent.

88
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,690
So, we also launched this
year some automation.

89
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,520
So, like I mentioned,
every company's different.

90
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,350
Sometimes you don't wanna build, right?

91
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,860
So you just wanna be able
to do no code or configure.

92
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,300
So, and that's the case,

93
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,550
you can also automate that in Slack.

94
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,040
And then, lastly what
we've been trying to do

95
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,120
is take all these new UI elements

96
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,180
you see around the internet on
different AI products you use

97
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,250
and blend them into a Slack platform,

98
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,860
but do it in a way that doesn't
increase developer load,

99
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,920
it doesn't take any like
cognitive work to do.

100
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,200
So, we put in streaming,

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,480
Shimmer states, thinking strings,

102
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,540
things like that kind of
naturally into the platform.

103
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,710
But we've done it in ways

104
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,353
that allows you to develop very quickly.

105
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,800
So, I wanna bring over,

106
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,940
I'm gonna run a demo here,

107
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,810
and what I wanna show you

108
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,040
is how you can use some
tools you might use today

109
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,713
when you're developing
with AI within Slack.

110
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,400
All right, so I'm gonna talk through this.

111
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,530
Well, this is Slack if
you haven't seen it.

112
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,020
What we have here is a payments channel.

113
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,790
This is a group of developers

114
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,860
working on a payments app, right?

115
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,453
So, GitHub is in here.

116
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,375
In your Slack, you probably
have many different apps

117
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,010
and bots sending messages,

118
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,660
so this may seem familiar to you.

119
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,060
But in addition to GitHub,

120
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,583
what we also have is a Copilot agent.

121
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,830
So, launching agents in the
Slack is essentially native.

122
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,180
We've had the capability for a while,

123
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,500
we've matured it,

124
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,450
but it just comes
out-of-the-box functionality.

125
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,360
So, in this example,
let's say there's an issue

126
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,150
and I want to invoke an
agent that's in this channel.

127
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,540
So, what I'm gonna do is call
up the GitHub Copilot agent

128
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,880
from this action field,

129
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,460
and just call it like I'm
calling another human, right?

130
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,310
There's actually six different
agents in this channel,

131
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,040
but I'm just gonna call GitHub Copilot.

132
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,690
And what it's gonna do
is it's gonna take off,

133
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,430
it's gonna say, "All
right, I have a job to do,

134
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,050
I'm gonna do it."

135
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,510
You might see some emojis being used.

136
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,830
So I think it'll say, "Yep,"

137
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,900
I have some eyes, I'm looking at this.

138
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,840
So, I know there are eight
people in this channel.

139
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,460
Your channels may have 1,000,

140
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,020
you may have five,

141
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,970
but typically you want
everyone in the channel

142
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,220
to understand that something's happening

143
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,750
and I don't have to do anything,

144
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,510
and then the one person being
able to do that thing, right?

145
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,400
That's probably the most
efficient way to work.

146
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,810
So, what Copilot will do

147
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,157
is automatically let your team know,

148
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:01,440
"Yep, this is being looked at,

149
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,790
being taken care of."

150
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,653
We've went ahead and created a PR,

151
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,500
you can look in the web as well,

152
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,780
and then it'll use some
of our new UI elements

153
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,240
to just update the progress along the way,

154
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,290
which is pretty cool.

155
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,220
So, if you've used Copilot before

156
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,620
or Cursor, Codex,

157
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,540
this will look very familiar to you.

158
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,130
You can see your running agents.

159
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,960
So, we always try to give you the ability

160
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,570
to deep link exactly where you need to go

161
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,400
in case you want to go
do some deep, deep work

162
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,140
outside of Slack, right?

163
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,150
Because sometimes that's
the best place to do it.

164
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,290
So if you really wanna see

165
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,300
if there's different processes running,

166
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,250
you can go ahead and deep link there.

167
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,310
And then this PR essentially
will just be updated over time.

168
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,190
I think overall it's gonna
do maybe three commits

169
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,890
and then Copilot will just do its thing.

170
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,100
Again, we'll deep link for the
people that need to go out.

171
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,410
And the best part of bringing

172
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,180
the AI development into Slack

173
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,330
is it's becoming more and
more asynchronous, right?

174
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,100
No one wants to sit there
and stare at their computer

175
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,690
and watch it work.

176
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,523
So, when you're in Slack,

177
00:07:01,523 --> 00:07:03,480
it'll just give you a notification
when it's done, right?

178
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,313
If you wanna go check,

179
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:05,640
you can see what it's doing, great,

180
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,200
or you can go about your day

181
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,200
and your little activity monitor
will pop up when it's done.

182
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,540
I wanna point out a couple other things.

183
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,400
So, in this one channel,

184
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,680
we also, I think there's six agents total.

185
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,640
We have some other agents here.

186
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,043
We have Claude, Codex, Cursor.

187
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,630
Does anyone use Cursor?

188
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,260
Okay. Anyone?

189
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,550
Oh, that guy does.

190
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,093
Anyone use Codex or Claude?

191
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,400
Okay, okay.

192
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,020
All right, so maybe most are on Claude.

193
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,360
So, all these agents are
in that channel as well,

194
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,550
and you can call them
in the exact same way.

195
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,363
So, that's an interesting
distribution though.

196
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,860
In addition to that, we have
some out-of-the-box agents.

197
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,840
So, oftentimes, if you don't wanna build,

198
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,580
you just want to use Salesforce agents,

199
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,560
we have that, we have those as well,

200
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,690
and those are gonna be
under the Agents tab.

201
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,060
And what those are really useful for

202
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,400
is saving your team time.

203
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,100
So Channel Expert is one
that we came out with

204
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,480
earlier this year.

205
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,580
You know, I'm sure everyone
in this room has had channels

206
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,890
where people drop in and ask questions.

207
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,910
Maybe they're good questions,

208
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,870
maybe they're bad questions,

209
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,000
but they're definitely
distracting questions, right?

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,620
So what the Channel Expert does

211
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,140
is it automatically looks
back to through the channel,

212
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,820
also looks at any resources

213
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,170
that you choose to give it access to,

214
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,760
you can just click and add to it,

215
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,500
and it'll go ahead and try
to answer those questions.

216
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,110
So, it's great for people
that aren't on your team.

217
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,980
Maybe it's great for you

218
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,970
if you came back from vacation,

219
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,110
you're like, "All right, what happened?"

220
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,690
Or maybe there's like, "Oh, has
this issue happened before?"

221
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,790
It's just a little value add.

222
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,290
I use it in all my channels.

223
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,490
It's great.

224
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,450
If someone asks something,

225
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,070
there's a very good chance

226
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,470
that they can get that answer
through those resources

227
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,900
or the past 500, 1,000 messages

228
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,940
or pings that came into that channel,

229
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,020
so that's cool.

230
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,390
And Employee Agent's a fun one too

231
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,150
because this channel's called payment-pr,

232
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,740
every once in a while you
might get someone pop in

233
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,380
and be like, "Oh, my re:Invent
expense was rejected,"

234
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,350
which obviously the development
team would not support that,

235
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,475
so this agent would kick in

236
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:00,390
and be like, "All right, no, no,

237
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,740
here are the company resources,

238
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,707
like you want to go here to
ask accounting about this."

239
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,880
So, yeah, having all those within,

240
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,890
I mean, maybe you wouldn't
have six within one channel,

241
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,390
this is obviously for
demonstration purposes,

242
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,230
but you can,

243
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,980
and they can live there in harmony.

244
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,210
So, looking over here,

245
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,070
we have the plan.

246
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,440
So, the agent is saying,

247
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,400
you know, "This is what I'm gonna do,

248
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,480
this is how I'm doing it,

249
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,520
and it'll update you along the way."

250
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,590
At the end, it'll clean
all this up actually,

251
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,053
so it'll just have a nice message.

252
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,330
This, it says in progress,

253
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,160
I think it's okay, so it's done.

254
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,450
And what you can do,

255
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,460
you can also open up in VS Code.

256
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,560
So really the whole goal
is to let the people

257
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,970
find what they need to find,

258
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,730
let everyone else know
things are happening,

259
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,410
cut down in communication.

260
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,940
Okay, so we're back here.

261
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,880
Obviously, this is a
extremely simple solve.

262
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,880
This isn't a really
complex agentics solution,

263
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,830
but it did solve it.

264
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,660
It created a PR.

265
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,800
I went there.

266
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,390
So, if I close here

267
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,490
and I go over to the actual PR,

268
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,083
the other thing that happens
is I might be over here,

269
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,060
I might be reviewing it,

270
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,110
maybe it takes five minutes,

271
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,553
maybe it takes two weeks.

272
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,570
But because that agent
is over in the channel,

273
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,360
whatever I do in here is
automatically gonna reflect

274
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,160
so my other teammates can see.

275
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,180
What's interesting about that

276
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,370
is it also shows up in Search, right?

277
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,230
So, for incidents that pop up,

278
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,670
when you're using Slack Search,

279
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,260
you're searching in Slackbot,

280
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,240
all of this data will now pop up,

281
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,610
be like, "Oh, that incident
actually resolved."

282
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,400
That just happens automatically
for everyone in the company,

283
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,290
which I think is really interesting.

284
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,690
So, not best practices,

285
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,530
no comment,

286
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,570
merge obviously not the best thing to do,

287
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,700
but you can see it
actually keeps it updated.

288
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,380
You can see the history of the issue

289
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,913
and then actually resolution.

290
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,233
So, pretty interesting.

291
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,630
All right, I think that's done.

292
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,833
Let me pop over here.

293
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,580
All right, so I showed you a couple,

294
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,193
we launched probably hundreds this year.

295
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,030
Slack platform is always free.

296
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,460
There's no, you can just install apps,

297
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,200
you don't have to worry about it.

298
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,580
If you're paying these companies,

299
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,280
we wanna make sure you get
the most value out of that.

300
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,230
So, if you go over the Slack Marketplace,

301
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,470
you can click to install
and add them to Slack,

302
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,873
so I encourage you to
check that out after this.

303
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,190
Okay, so shifting more to, say,
from AI-assisted development

304
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,670
to actually building agents in Slack.

305
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,750
So, this is good

306
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,840
because I think most of you
hadn't built on Slack before.

307
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,730
So, what is the Slack app?

308
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,860
Like I said before, Slack is,

309
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,140
it's an event-based platform, right?

310
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,110
Essentially an app is
something that sits over here,

311
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,450
receives events and sends events back.

312
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,760
I mean, it's not something
you configure on Slack,

313
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,190
so we're language agnostic.

314
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,320
I do wanna call one
really cool thing though,

315
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,910
which helps getting some,

316
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:04,170
takes zero in our world
from like hours to minutes,

317
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,780
and that's the ability to use web sockets.

318
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,080
So, when you launch a local Slack app,

319
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,030
you can use our CLI

320
00:12:12,683 --> 00:12:15,660
many of you probably use vibe
code now or AI assist code,

321
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,833
that works well too.

322
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,680
You can actually run it in Socket Mode,

323
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,690
so you don't have to worry
about setting up an endpoint,

324
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,980
you don't have to worry
about getting approval

325
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,920
to set up this static
endpoint for events to go to.

326
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,440
You can actually run it
right away within seconds

327
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,020
and have that work in Slack.

328
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,000
In that scenario, hopefully
you're starting in a sandbox,

329
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,380
but then when you go to production,

330
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,350
you have the option to
keep it in Socket Mode

331
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,750
or set up a static endpoint.

332
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,130
So you always have that option,

333
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,720
and when you're building for a company,

334
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,130
it's a really nice option to have.

335
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,570
I don't know if anyone's
ever been to those arguments

336
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,830
trying to open up an endpoint before,

337
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,113
but it can kill a project
extremely quickly.

338
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,480
So, there's a couple
concepts in Slack with OAuth,

339
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,680
I guess they're not that unique,

340
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,990
but when you install a Slack app,

341
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,720
we have the bot or the agent,

342
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,720
then we also have the
ability to authenticate

343
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,310
each individual user,

344
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,470
which is more and more popular these days.

345
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,330
So, I mentioned earlier

346
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,550
how you can get the context for that user,

347
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,070
you can take actions
on behalf of that user,

348
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,540
you can search,

349
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,610
you can understand who they talk to,

350
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,050
what they talk about,

351
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,570
how things relate in
their life within Slack.

352
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,300
You can pull all that in through our APIs,

353
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,250
and it's just a simple, simple OAuth,

354
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,480
you can get that through the user,

355
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,630
so that's a really
important topic as well.

356
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,620
All right, let me come back over here.

357
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,530
And I thought about showing you,

358
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,140
I don't know, some complex ways to build

359
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,430
and getting deeper,

360
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,067
but frankly, like if I
was gonna build on Slack

361
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:51,330
and I was gonna launch an agent,

362
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,830
this is what I would probably do,

363
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,103
so I just thought it would
show the simplest possible way.

364
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,040
So, this is Cursor.

365
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,600
If you use Cursor, you recognize it.

366
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,410
But basically, in the past 10 years,

367
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,330
Slack, we've made a lot
of hard choices, right?

368
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,090
It's incredibly simple to
make a complex platform.

369
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,650
You just say yes to everything.

370
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,360
Like, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."

371
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,040
You have this incredibly complex cap form.

372
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,020
It takes you 18 months
to learn to configure.

373
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,810
You need a PhD to even
like enter this space.

374
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,060
We've always taken the opposite approach.

375
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,410
Like, "No, we wanna be simple,

376
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,330
straightforward, easy to use.

377
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,970
We want you to be able to build
an app in less than an hour.

378
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,170
We want it to be quick."

379
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,510
And it's paying dividends now

380
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,300
because it, it lends itself
very, very, very well

381
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,520
to AI assist or vibe coding.

382
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,740
So when you plug your tools against Slack,

383
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,100
I mean, this is using
a simple one-paragraph,

384
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,360
maybe two-sentence prompt

385
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,930
saying, "Build me an assistant-like agent

386
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,400
using public Slack docs and go nuts."

387
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,540
You know, it's searching the web,

388
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,860
there's a couple tools,

389
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,630
but I'm just kind of letting it run,

390
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,360
and it's obviously
running it fast forward,

391
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,790
but I think when I recorded it,

392
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,650
it took six, seven minutes,

393
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,040
and at the end you get a
fully functioning Slack app

394
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,930
with one paragraph.

395
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,600
So, I mean that's probably
the biggest advantage

396
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,440
of our platform

397
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,300
is just that simplicity, right?

398
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,490
The ability to just try it out

399
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,323
because when you're building,

400
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:17,130
I mean, I don't know how
many people in this room

401
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,860
have built something
that's in POC purgatory,

402
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,090
probably everyone.

403
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,370
I have, like most of my
stuff is in POC purgatory,

404
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,390
I would say.

405
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,380
So, I mean, really the
advantage to this quick approach

406
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,940
is you get it in users' hands, right?

407
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,070
Something might seem
incredible in your mind,

408
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,757
and might be like,

409
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:35,910
you think you're like carrying everything,

410
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,750
but as you get user's hands,

411
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,640
like, "Yeah, that's not that sweet."

412
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,080
So being able to actually launch

413
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,513
and test quickly is critical, right?

414
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:45,000
You might fail 99 times out of 100

415
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,520
when we're on like the
frontier of building agents,

416
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,930
trying new solutions.

417
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,960
So being able to actually do
it this quickly and launch,

418
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,060
I think it's critical.

419
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,220
I mean, and one thing I
always caution against

420
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,560
is spending six months with a plan,

421
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,700
building big architecture

422
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,160
because everything
changed since then, right?

423
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,170
Just get it in someone's hands,

424
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,103
start testing.

425
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,100
Yeah, so I just gave it that one prompt

426
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,370
and that is an installable Slack app.

427
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,710
You could run that by run and Socket Mode

428
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,870
and it's in your Slack workspace.

429
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,430
You don't have to do anything else.

430
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,363
So, back over here.

431
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,883
Okay.

432
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,710
All right, so I wanna
open up to some questions.

433
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,810
What do you...

434
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,430
Questions about Slack, about AI,

435
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,060
about agents, about tools you use?

436
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,050
Anything?

437
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,250
Anything I talked about?

438
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,000
What do you? Anyone got anything?

439
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,650
No? All right.

440
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,390
No one? Okay.

441
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,080
Okay, well, check us out over 840.

442
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,980
I don't...

443
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,813
It's that way.

444
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:57,900
It's like if you see actually,

445
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,340
if you see Red Hat, it's past that.

446
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,173
So, if you wanna come by,

447
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:01,680
we can show you how to build,

448
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,030
talk through solutions,

449
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,330
work with you on whatever.

450
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,203
Yeah, thank you.
