  "abstract": "In this session, discover how cloud computing can shorten the development lifecycle for new products. We will demonstrate this by building a product lifecycle digital thread and using real-world connected product data to iterate on design. Through reference architectures and a live demonstration, we will show how to accelerate embedded software development and hardware design using real-world usage data, digital twins, and simulation, leading to reduced time-to-market, improved product quality, and enhanced cross-functional collaboration.",
  "abstract_cn": "在本次会议中，探索云计算如何缩短新产品的开发周期。我们将通过构建产品生命周期数字线程并使用真实世界的联网产品数据来迭代设计，以此进行演示。通过参考架构和现场演示，我们将展示如何使用真实世界的使用数据、数字孪生和仿真来加速嵌入式软件开发和硬件设计，从而缩短上市时间、提高产品质量并增强跨职能协作。",
