1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,620
- Today's session, you're gonna get

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,680
to hear from two large
enterprise customers

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,940
about how they use SAP as
well as AI to transform

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,130
and to innovate for their business.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,900
You're gonna hear from Gustav Hilding,

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,900
who's the Chief Technical
Architect at Axfood.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,270
Axfood is a large grocery retailer

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,310
that's headquartered in Sweden.

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,560
You're gonna hear from Varada Reddy.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,490
Varada is the Director of SAP
Technology and Transformation

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,200
at Harman International.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,010
Harman is a pro and consumer audio company

13
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,890
that owns well-known brands
such as JBL speakers,

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,500
and Marantz stereos, and many more.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,610
My name's Eric Kamman.

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,900
I am a member of our
worldwide SAP on AWS team.

17
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,503
We have more than 7,000 customers
today that run SAP in AWS.

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,380
I lead a team of solution architects

19
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,130
that are focused on building
solutions, and services,

20
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,370
and guidance to support
all of our SAP customers

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,350
on their journey to the cloud.

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,500
So from an agenda today, I'm
gonna give a brief overview

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,900
of some AI services, and solutions,

24
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,000
and use cases for SAP.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,560
Then we're gonna hear from Axfood

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,320
about how they're using
AI machine learning

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,950
to analyze SAP data and
their business processes.

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,450
And then we'll hear from Harman,

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,190
they're gonna talk about
how they're starting

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,510
their S/4 journey,

31
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,390
and how they're using gen
AI services to analyze

32
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,090
and transform with their ABAP code.

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,590
We will have some time for Q&A,

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,600
it's not gonna be live up on stage,

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,760
it'll be kind of behind
the seating area after.

36
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,110
So please stick around, love
to talk after if you have time.

37
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,880
Okay, quick show of hands,

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,160
who's first re:Invent?

39
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,930
First time re:Invent?

40
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,460
Okay, quite a bit.

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,793
What about more than one?

42
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,800
Quite a bit as well.

43
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,880
Good, good, good.

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,810
So for those of you attended
last year, or even in 2023,

45
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,530
if you attended any sessions
about gen AI for SAP,

46
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,880
very different message last year

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,470
than what you're gonna hear this year.

48
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,960
Last year we had a lot of
questions from customers,

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,510
what can I do with gen AI?

50
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,368
What are the possibilities

51
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:07,980
that you could do with gen AI for SAP?

52
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,620
And we showed a lot of demos
in art of the possible.

53
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,500
Fast forward to end of 2025

54
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,000
and we now have real customers,

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,220
like you're gonna hear
with Harman and Axfood,

56
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,330
sharing real stories

57
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,210
about the value that
they are bringing now.

58
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,020
So 2025 is a very pivotal
year where we started the year

59
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,350
with a few customers
that were early adopters.

60
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,680
We had a lot of customers that
were doing proof of concepts

61
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,540
or evaluations.

62
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,210
But you fast forward to the end of 2025,

63
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,880
we're exiting the year
with a lot of customers

64
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,420
that are moving gen AI
solutions into production.

65
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,250
We're starting to see mainstream adoption

66
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,700
of many gen AI services, and a lot of,

67
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,830
you know, other kind of
production ready services

68
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,270
that we have ready to go.

69
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,380
This was made possible

70
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,680
by rapid advancement across a few areas.

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,923
So first is the maturity
of large language models.

72
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:01,590
I'll call out Anthropic.

73
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,020
We use Anthropic Claude,
their Sonnet model,

74
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,840
quite a bit, does a great job of analyzing

75
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,190
and interpreting SAP data
as well as SAP ABAP code.

76
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,410
The beginning of the year,
Anthropic Claude Sonnet

77
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,990
was on version 3.5, then it went to 3.7,

78
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,120
to 4,0, to 4.5.

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,630
Each of those releases
was a major step change

80
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,787
in the maturity and the
capability to analyze

81
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,540
and interpret SAP business context.

82
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,640
We also saw industry adoption

83
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,210
for some kind of open standards

84
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,310
and some protocols across the industry,

85
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,950
and adoption within AWS services.

86
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,820
So, for example,

87
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,590
you see MCP up there,

88
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,880
MCP, if you're not familiar,

89
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,950
that's Model Context Protocol.

90
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,430
This is an open standard that
when you build AI agents,

91
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,620
it shows you how you can communicate

92
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,240
with backend data sources.

93
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,530
We're starting to build solutions,

94
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,530
we have some available,
that use MCP to communicate

95
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,800
with SAP using the OData interfaces

96
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,230
or the ABAP Test Cockpit.

97
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,700
So, you know,

98
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,340
overall, very pivotal year 2025.

99
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,990
I'm really excited where we're exiting

100
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,080
and seeing a lot of customers
adopting gen AI for SAP.

101
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,353
And this will accelerate
further as we go into next year.

102
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,400
Okay, we have more than 200 services,

103
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,050
you've probably heard that before.

104
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,437
When you start to narrow it down to say,

105
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:21,810
"What are the main services

106
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,840
I should be looking at
for gen AI, for SAP?

107
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,770
Here's the short list.

108
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,480
There's more services
than just these four,

109
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,280
but these are the four core ones.

110
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,160
Starting on the upper left
is Amazon Q Developer.

111
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,440
This is an AI coding assistant.

112
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,310
It works across almost
all programming languages.

113
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,510
Does a very good job with all
of SAP's programming languages

114
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,383
and frameworks,

115
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:47,160
including their cloud application
framework CAP and WRAP.

116
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,800
Also works really well with ABAP.

117
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,310
We released an MCP server
called the ABAP Accelerator

118
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,050
just recently.

119
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,520
The ABAP Accelerator allows you

120
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,360
to do some really interesting
use cases with Q Developer.

121
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,970
For example, it will
automatically generate

122
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,250
unit test cases for your ABAP code.

123
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,130
It will also take legacy ECC code,

124
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,130
automatically convert it to
be S/4 compliant code, right?

125
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,600
So Q Developer overall can really help you

126
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,430
on your S/4 journey.

127
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,990
If you're moving to CleanCore,

128
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,030
there's a lot of interesting
use cases that can help,

129
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,520
and then a lot more beyond that.

130
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,470
Upper right is Amazon Quick Suite,

131
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,990
in that family of services
also is Q Automate

132
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,863
and QuickSight.

133
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,750
Quick Suite, this is an AI
business intelligence platform.

134
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,630
It allows you to aggregate
data from multiple sources,

135
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,290
such as your own emails, your own files,

136
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,610
as well as interface with
enterprise data like SAP,

137
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,220
Salesforce, ServiceNow, and a lot more.

138
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,390
Once you gather the data, you
can chat with it agentically.

139
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,410
You can drill down, you can
build your own dashboards.

140
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,920
You can even build your own
agents with Quick Suite.

141
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,080
And we're seeing some
really interesting use cases

142
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,730
customers are starting to build

143
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,490
to automate accounts
payable, accounts receivable,

144
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,640
month end close processes
using Quick Suite.

145
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,470
The bottom two, Amazon Kiro,

146
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,360
you'll probably hear a lot about Kiro

147
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,760
this week at re:Invent.

148
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,680
This is our new agentic IDE

149
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,260
or integrated developer environment.

150
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,110
We're seeing some really
interesting SAP use cases

151
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,870
with Kiro, such as
building BTP applications,

152
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,960
or Fiori, or UI5 front end.

153
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,770
And then Bedrock and Bedrock
AgentCore on the bottom right,

154
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,890
Bedrock is our main AWS service

155
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,610
for integrating with large
language models like Anthropic,

156
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,630
or Amazon's Nova models,
or even OpenAI now.

157
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,070
And then Bedrock AgentCore,

158
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,530
this is a runtime
environment for AI agents.

159
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,130
So you could build AI
agents, run 'em in AgentCore,

160
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,220
and allows you to deploy
them into a highly scalable,

161
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,390
highly secure, highly
performance runtime environment.

162
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,920
We have sessions

163
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,160
and workshops this week
on all of these services.

164
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,620
We have sessions that are
SAP specific, and of course,

165
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,900
we have some that are
not SAP specific as well.

166
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,600
So if anyone has any
questions about any of these,

167
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,130
come find me after the session

168
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,830
and I'll point you in the right direction.

169
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,080
Okay, so without further ado,

170
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,960
I want to get into our
customer success stories.

171
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,510
So Gustav, I would like to
bring you up to the stage

172
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,193
and hand it over to you.

173
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,963
- So Eric, thank you for the introduction.

174
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:33,330
Axford is a leading food retailer
located in Sweden, Europe.

175
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,610
We are on the other side of the ocean,

176
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,590
where the time difference is nine hours.

177
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,023
So I'm here at midnight right now.

178
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,650
We have around 800 stores

179
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,860
and meet millions of customers every week.

180
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,230
Axford is one of the top 60 companies

181
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,093
on the Swedish stock exchange.

182
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,860
Our company consists of different brands,

183
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,220
and our customers, they
recognize us as supermarkets,

184
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,480
grocery stores, convenience
stores with different logos,

185
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,480
different prices, different concepts.

186
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,933
We operate both within
B2B and in B2C businesses.

187
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,840
We are a family of brands,

188
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,820
but we share common
operations when it comes

189
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,660
to purchasing,

190
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,820
logistics, business development,

191
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,403
IT, and other supporting functions.

192
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,960
Our market share is continuously growing.

193
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,690
We currently sell about 25% of the food

194
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,433
that is being sold in our country.

195
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,420
This means that both growing volumes

196
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,340
and keeping a tight focus on our costs

197
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,080
is key for our success.

198
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,500
Since retail, especially food retail,

199
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,413
is a business with high
volumes and low margins.

200
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,043
So we try to standardize
whenever possible.

201
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,700
Our SAP landscape consists
of a vast amount of systems.

202
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,610
Mainly we're running SAPS S/4

203
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,500
and SAP CAR.

204
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,380
And SAP S/4 we're running
the industry solution retail

205
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,213
as an add-on.

206
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,370
This means that we can keep

207
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,250
much of our master data in S/4.

208
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,580
So we keep our articles, our assortment,

209
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,130
our prices, our promotions,

210
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,650
our sales orders, purchase orders,

211
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,250
inventory, and point of sales data in SAP,

212
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,773
besides the traditional
ERP data, of course.

213
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,160
For maintaining our forecast,

214
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,583
we're running SAP EWM and SAP FnR.

215
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,570
Besides traditional ERP systems,

216
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,660
we're also running sub commerce cloud

217
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,850
and sub success factors.

218
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,240
Here we keep our eCommerce
orders, our employee data,

219
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,803
and our content services.

220
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,010
Looking at a process view,

221
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,750
we can categorize our systems

222
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,973
into different application layers.

223
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,490
S/4 is the basis of many
well-established flows.

224
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,403
We do a lot of custom development
in S/4 as well, though.

225
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,410
SAP CAR has got more unique capabilities

226
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,930
and it's used for retail
specific processes,

227
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,180
such as merchandising,
and assortment planning,

228
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,190
and promotion planning.

229
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,450
CAR is the abbreviation

230
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,913
for customer activity
repository, by the way.

231
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,490
So it's got most data objects
besides customer data.

232
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,230
It doesn't have customer data.

233
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,633
We keep our customer data outside of SAP.

234
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:31,077
AWS is used to enhance our
systems with analytical AI,

235
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,733
AI machine learning, and
composite applications.

236
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,393
We also keep our data stack on AWS.

237
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,840
The systems on AWS typically have

238
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,703
a shorter application life cycle.

239
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,960
I've also depicted some other
SAP systems to the left,

240
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,243
depending on their uniqueness level.

241
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,090
So we manage our SAP suite ourselves.

242
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,550
We're currently running
the the SAP S/4HANA

243
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,813
on premise edition.

244
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,980
Without the involvement
of any third parties,

245
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,740
we've got own staff, own employees,

246
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,243
and do everything ourselves.

247
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,670
Our business processes

248
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,030
that need differentiation
are custom developed in ABAP,

249
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,143
and have been so for quite
some time, over 15 years.

250
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,250
We've got full control
over the code, logic,

251
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,053
and the development.

252
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,490
We're building integrations on SAP BTP

253
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,860
with integration suites.

254
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,750
To give you some numbers,

255
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,530
our HANA database is over
six terabytes in size.

256
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,530
We are running over 4,000
CPUs and 140 virtual machines.

257
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,510
So going into our use cases, well,

258
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,390
in retail, many flows
are about moving goods

259
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,103
from point A to point B.

260
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,010
We also handle fresh items.

261
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,300
So we really need to have the stuff

262
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,460
at the right place at the right time.

263
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,320
Therefore, a lot of our focus

264
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,663
is on optimizing forecast and volumes.

265
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,590
We currently have more than
100 machine learning models

266
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,463
in production.

267
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:16,080
We anticipate that we can get
around 30% better accuracy

268
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,700
in our custom built models

269
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,400
than we get in our standard systems,

270
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,620
especially when it comes to irregularities

271
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,690
or deviations in our flows.

272
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,670
This is because we can build them up

273
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,473
with more history and more data.

274
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,080
We are currently running
around 20 different use cases

275
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,293
in forecasting for both
stores and our warehouses.

276
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,860
Furthermore, we use simulations
for our assortment planning

277
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,260
and use forecasted volumes in combinations

278
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,860
with customer data to
get the desired outcomes

279
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,770
for both us and our suppliers.

280
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,100
In e-comm, AI helps us to
deliver the relevant products

281
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,333
for our customers.

282
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,953
By using AI, we get better stability,

283
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,970
better sustainability, less food waste,

284
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,073
and a positive impact on the environment.

285
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,480
A few examples of our optimized flows

286
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,030
are being realized by
traditional machine learning.

287
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,100
We use ML for campaign
forecasts, seasonal forecasts,

288
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,953
sales forecasts, and e-commerce forecasts.

289
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,700
A simplification is that all forecasts

290
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,520
that require more data
than we keep in SAP,

291
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,783
they're custom built.

292
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,680
In our warehouses,

293
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,830
we optimize where to place items

294
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,600
depending on how much they're sold.

295
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,790
In that way, we can get
the shortest picking routes

296
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,263
for our manual pickers.

297
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,530
Regarding e-commerce,

298
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,830
we personalize the user experience online

299
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,770
and in our customer journeys.

300
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,370
This is done by building
models with article relations,

301
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,100
for instance, related items,

302
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,233
and predicting the next best action.

303
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,550
This can be used to
drive cross sell, upsell,

304
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,593
and other forms of recommendations.

305
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,600
Our shopping baskets are
normally around 50 items.

306
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,880
So clicking add to basket 50 times

307
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,860
is quite a hassle for our users.

308
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,030
So everything we can do

309
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,853
to simplify the user experience
is of big value here.

310
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,880
We also present users

311
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,730
with their most commonly purchased items

312
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,080
and inspiration on what
their peers are buying.

313
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,350
In our assortment planning,
there is a constant tug of war

314
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,063
between different parameters.

315
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,900
We use simulations a lot here.

316
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,120
For instance, we simulate what happens

317
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,040
if you change the price,

318
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,170
your volumes are probably
gonna go up somewhere,

319
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,870
but then again, another
item will sell less.

320
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,240
So we try to optimize
for the optimal outcomes

321
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,040
with machine learning models
in our assortment planning.

322
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,190
We improve our customer
offers by creating clusters

323
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,690
of customer groups,

324
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,880
and we also allocate personalized offers

325
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,613
for our customers to
bring them to our stores.

326
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,910
In our support functions, we
make data-driven decisions

327
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,480
and we share aggregated sales
data with our suppliers.

328
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,160
We never share customer data,

329
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,260
but we share it on an aggregated level.

330
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,590
This helps our suppliers
plan their flows better

331
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,593
and it also helps us get
our flows better in turn.

332
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,130
We also use a couple of AI models

333
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,203
for our internal decision making here.

334
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,620
Of course, we're also using gen AI

335
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,180
for employee productivity tools,

336
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,173
such as chatbots and similar applications.

337
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,510
Another example of gen
AI usage that we built

338
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,890
is a design tool for creating images.

339
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,043
It's a fine tuned stable
diffusion model on Bedrock,

340
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,780
trained on our design
language of our own brands.

341
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,750
We gave this to our business
and they played around with it

342
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,500
and actually created package
designs for milk cartoons.

343
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,533
These are actual items that
were sold in our stores.

344
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,120
Well, this was all
about bringing attention

345
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,160
to what can be done with AI

346
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,110
and also got our leadership on
board with what can be done.

347
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,630
So awareness in departments outside of IT

348
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,953
was a key benefit here.

349
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,980
So how did we get here?

350
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,363
Well, our SAP history
started way before 2010.

351
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,640
We started building our
current data layers in 2012

352
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,430
when we introduced a loyalty program

353
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,413
and an enterprise data warehouse.

354
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,450
A few years later, Axfood
decided to go into e-commerce.

355
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,280
We needed a solution that could scale up

356
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,493
and scale down according
to our purchase patterns.

357
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,423
So this was when we
introduced AWS back in 2014.

358
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,690
Being on AWS made us see
amazing launches like SageMaker,

359
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:05,100
Lambda, Fargate, and other
cool technology within AI.

360
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,620
So we decided to place
our entire AI platform

361
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,543
on AWS a few years later.

362
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,550
However, running AI in the cloud

363
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,680
and having a warehouse on prem

364
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,840
wasn't really a perfect solution.

365
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,310
We got into scaling issues

366
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,440
and decided to move our
entire data platform

367
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,940
to AWS back in 2022.

368
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,860
Since then, we've been building
lots of innovative solutions

369
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,780
and composite applications
on top of both SAP and AWS.

370
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,510
As you can see, our cloud
journey started in a small corner

371
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,610
of our company with e-commerce

372
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,373
and currently covers most major processes.

373
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,540
So, since we introduced our
loyalty program back in 2010,

374
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,510
we had needs for creating
traditional reports.

375
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,670
Well, we introduced the principle

376
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,510
to export all data, SAP
data and non-SAP data,

377
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,863
into our data stack.

378
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,790
On top of our data stack, we run AI models

379
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,900
and return the results,

380
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,920
either as machine learning
models through APIs

381
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,193
or as result sets back into
our enterprise systems.

382
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,770
It's a simple picture, but I'm
gonna go into more details.

383
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:21,090
So one key part of our AWS AI stack

384
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,870
is a self-service platform
that we call Mimer.

385
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,070
Mimer is a suite of AWS
tools, mainly SageMaker

386
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,513
and Airflow.

387
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,813
We both create and run ML models in Mimer.

388
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,620
We also use auto ML

389
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,290
to choose the optimal
machine learning models

390
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,143
and produce optimal
results for each use case.

391
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,590
With Mimer, we can build data pipelines,

392
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,480
either from manual files,

393
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,390
through third party
data from our warehouse,

394
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,640
or even through web scraping.

395
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,580
All data is imported into S/3

396
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,073
where it can be used for
further AI development.

397
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,740
Our data scientists
work in SageMaker Studio

398
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,083
and can explore large amounts of data.

399
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,700
We prepare inputs in SageMaker,

400
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,703
we train models, evaluate results,

401
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,330
and deploy artifacts.

402
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,400
When results have been calculated,

403
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,800
we return them either as
machine learning models

404
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,030
through APIs or as result
sets into our source

405
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,773
or into our target systems.

406
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,930
Currently our data stack has grown

407
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,000
from being just a data warehouse

408
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,103
into an entire data ecosystem.

409
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,480
Data is generated in
our application layer,

410
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,060
mainly in our SAP systems.

411
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,090
After that, it's integrated
through the integration layer,

412
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,760
either through EventBridge, EventMesh,

413
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,213
or integration services
from CPI as messages.

414
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,140
When data lands in our BI stack,

415
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,340
we use DBT and Glue amongst others

416
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,773
to calculate our ETL and data layers.

417
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,860
On top of the BI layer, we
place our machine learning layer

418
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,080
where we can do traditional ML with Mimer

419
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,803
or generative AI applications
with our AI gateway.

420
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,900
On the bottom of the picture,

421
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,120
I've depicted our analytics layer

422
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,350
where we use MicroStrategy

423
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,840
to analyze data from our warehouse

424
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,293
and sub analytics cloud to go
directly to our SAP systems.

425
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,353
So our data stack is
continuously evolving.

426
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,270
Some of the key points
for future extensions are,

427
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,730
better focus on data integration with SAP.

428
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,650
We always want to have more data

429
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,783
in our data warehouse layers.

430
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,450
We also need to improve our
business with more AI models,

431
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,273
more real time and new use cases.

432
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,790
A lot of our focus right now
is on building data products.

433
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,580
Building data products also
requires data governance

434
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,100
and has an impact on our semantic layers,

435
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,700
which are continuously evolving.

436
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,040
Furthermore, we need to support the world

437
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,590
of agentic AI better than we do today.

438
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,670
So we have an initiative
to look at MCP servers

439
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,583
and other technology to
have our data AI ready.

440
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,330
Finally, we need to do
some re-architecture

441
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,663
of legacy systems, for instance, SAP BW.

442
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,760
Finally, I would like to introduce

443
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,920
some of our lessons learned.

444
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,690
We've treated data as a foundation

445
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,003
for improving our business since 2012.

446
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,760
This has led to a long-term focus

447
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,623
of building multiple layers of data.

448
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,360
Data needs to have a single
source of truth, be clean,

449
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,683
and ready for AI.

450
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,960
We also introduced some high
value use cases early on.

451
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,570
This made our leadership introduced

452
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,463
into what can be done with AI.

453
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,670
When our leadership was on board,

454
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,670
we got a lot easier to get funds released

455
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,170
and to create the teams

456
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,570
for the necessary machine
learning developments.

457
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,940
Last of all, I would like to thank AWS

458
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,607
for the amazing AI
technology that we're using

459
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:24,450
and for the enablement services
and good collaboration.

460
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,310
I would also like to
reach out to my colleagues

461
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,663
and say a big thank you.

462
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,603
Thank you.

463
00:22:30,943 --> 00:22:33,900
(audience applauding)

464
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,280
- Okay, thank you, Gustav.

465
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,113
Stay up here, though,

466
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:37,746
I have one question for you.
- Sure.

467
00:22:37,746 --> 00:22:39,780
- I love your story, thank you.

468
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,780
You were early adopters in
gen AI for SAP or AI for SAP.

469
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,200
A lot of the work you did

470
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,230
started before mainstream
adoption of large language models.

471
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,940
Could you just share a little
bit about your thoughts

472
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,770
about transitioning from, I'd say,

473
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,710
some of your homegrown
machine learning models

474
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,660
and what you're thinking
about with adopting

475
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,940
some of the large language
models in the future?

476
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,790
- Yeah, so we are already looking into Q.

477
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,220
We're using that for
development in all our teams,

478
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,533
be it SAP or non-SAP right now.

479
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,480
We are also looking at the world
of agentic AI, like I said.

480
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,680
We really need to get more
generative AI use cases

481
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,850
on board with agents.

482
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,280
So that's really an area for exploration

483
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,660
for the future for us.

484
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,770
- Awesome, awesome.

485
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,441
Well, thank you again for coming here

486
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:25,274
- Thank you.
- and sharing

487
00:23:25,274 --> 00:23:27,120
your story with everybody.
- Thank you.

488
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,930
- Okay, so next here we
have Harman International,

489
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,663
so I'd like to bring
Varada up to the stage.

490
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,930
- Good afternoon, everyone.

491
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,747
My name is Varada Reddy,

492
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:40,890
I work as Director of SAP Technology

493
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,540
at Harmon International.

494
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,373
So thank you, Eric,

495
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:46,890
for the introduction and Gustav
for the nice presentation.

496
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,530
So first I'll start with a quick summary

497
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,280
of what my company does
and then I will explain

498
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,780
what are the SAP products

499
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,910
we are using at Harman International,

500
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:01,140
followed by our S/4HANA
implementation approach.

501
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,080
And then I will highlight
one of the key challenges

502
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,930
we faced during our S/4 implementation,

503
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:11,163
and how we solved it with AWS capability.

504
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,030
So a brief introduction about my company.

505
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,690
So Harman International
is a global company,

506
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,090
specializes in connected
audio technologies

507
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,103
providing audio systems in automotive

508
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,580
and consumer divisions.

509
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,990
So it is headquartered
in Stanford, Connecticut.

510
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,383
And the company was
founded about 75 years ago,

511
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,680
and the parent company
is Samsung Electronics.

512
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,790
The company was acquired by
Samsung Electronics in 2017

513
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,840
and since then it has been
part of Samsung Electronics.

514
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,870
So some of the well-known
brands of Harman International

515
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,633
or JBL, Harman Kardon, AKG,

516
00:25:01,674 --> 00:25:04,890
and also there is a recent
addition, Bowers & Wilkins.

517
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,643
You might have been familiar
with some of these products.

518
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,480
And the company has two
major business segments.

519
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,310
In automotive solutions,

520
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,960
the company provides infotainment
systems, ADAS systems,

521
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,780
and connected car platforms.

522
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,420
And in consumer audio it
has headphones, speakers,

523
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,150
soundbars, and multi-room audio systems.

524
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,220
And also, professional solutions

525
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,860
is a subdivision of lifestyle division.

526
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,230
So which provides audio
equipment for studios,

527
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,723
and live events, and
enterprise environments.

528
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,610
So let me give a quick overview

529
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,280
of Harman's SAP applications.

530
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,863
So we have two SAP ECC landscapes,

531
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:53,160
both are running on ECC 6.0 and EHP 7.

532
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,550
And we have SAP BW for data warehousing.

533
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,350
And we have IBP for SIOP,

534
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,260
supply chain planning and optimization.

535
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,070
And we have SAP Ariba
for indirect procurement.

536
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,920
And we have BPC and BW 4/HANNA

537
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,140
for planning and consolidation.

538
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,200
And then we have several
manufacturing, integration,

539
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,290
intelligence and manufacturing
execution systems

540
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:21,290
for managing the operations
at global plants we have,

541
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,920
manufacturing plants.

542
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,080
And then we have BTP,

543
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,350
a business technology
platform on business.

544
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,840
BTP, we have integration suite enabled

545
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,130
and also we are using
some of the other modules

546
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,550
for build process
automation, build work zone,

547
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,080
etcetera.

548
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,510
And we have above the data services

549
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,720
and information for data
profiling and cleansing.

550
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,650
And we have SAP GRC for user provisioning

551
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,560
and governance and risk compliance.

552
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,200
And we have supplier business network

553
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,990
and some of the SAP technical solutions,

554
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,210
like solution manager
for change management,

555
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,190
custom code lifecycle management.

556
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,363
And NWDI for Java development
and portal systems.

557
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,080
And let me zoom a little
bit on our ECC landscape.

558
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,273
So we have two ECC
landscapes, as I mentioned,

559
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:19,170
both of them are running on ECC 6.0/EHP 7.

560
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,440
And as I'm going to highlight
a problem very specific

561
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,910
to custom code,

562
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,364
so I'm only covering the data

563
00:27:26,364 --> 00:27:28,290
that is related to customizations we have.

564
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,090
So we have 30,000 custom objects

565
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,620
in one of the ECC landscapes

566
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,540
and on second landscape we
have nearly 20,000 CBOs.

567
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,990
And as part of S/4 migration,

568
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,810
these are the key considerations we have.

569
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,920
So we wanted to improve

570
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,180
some of the business process

571
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,180
running on SAP ECC environment

572
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,850
as part of S/4 migration
to improve the efficiency

573
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,680
of those business process.

574
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,400
And also, we have a finance
transformation plan.

575
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,440
So as part of this finance transformation,

576
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,220
the goal is to improve the
enterprise architectures.

577
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,520
And as part of that we are planning

578
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,430
to consolidate some of the company codes

579
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,430
and harmonize some of
the chart of accounts.

580
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,500
And also reduce the technology debt

581
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,990
by getting rid of some of unused

582
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,090
or low used third party solutions

583
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:21,300
or replace it with standard
S/4 functionalities.

584
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,220
And also get rid of some of the unused

585
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,140
or less efficient interfaces

586
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,303
and improve the code and configurations.

587
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,210
And also another goal

588
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,290
is to reduce the database
footprint significantly.

589
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,650
So even with regular archiving

590
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,300
on the current ECC environment,

591
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,660
we are unable to reduce
the footprint significantly

592
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,890
beyond certain extent.

593
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,610
That's mainly due to a lot
of third party related tables

594
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,220
have grown rapidly over
the period of time.

595
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,170
And also, several custom tables,

596
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,840
which are not part of the archiving scope,

597
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,840
contributed significantly
to the size of database.

598
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,170
So reducing the database
footprint is another objective.

599
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:06,170
And then another objective
is reducing or streamlining

600
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,070
the custom code we have

601
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:12,090
by eliminating unused customizations

602
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,730
or replacing with standard functionalities

603
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,663
wherever possible.

604
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,160
And one of the drivers to
reduce the database footprint

605
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,010
is downtime minimization
during the go live.

606
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:28,010
So as our manufacturing
plants are operating 24 by 7,

607
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,460
downtime causes business impact.

608
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,173
So reducing the downtime
to a weekend is necessary.

609
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,900
So coming to Harman's S/4
implementation journey

610
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,770
in specific.

611
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,010
So as I mentioned, as
one of the key objectives

612
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,810
is to reduce the data footprint

613
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,850
and also do the finance transformation,

614
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,410
improve the business process,

615
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,800
we select two data transition approach,

616
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,650
so as part of this we are migrating

617
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,290
only the open transactions along

618
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:04,500
with master data and customizing data.

619
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,300
And as part of the finance transformation,

620
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,400
like I said earlier, we are planning

621
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,280
to consolidate the company codes,

622
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,350
harmonize the chart of accounts,

623
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,473
and adopt SAP best
practices wherever possible.

624
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,550
And then coming to the customer
object rationalization,

625
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:23,700
the objective is to
streamline the customizations

626
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,470
by eliminating the unused code

627
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,040
and replace less efficient custom code

628
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,170
with S/4 standard functionalities

629
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:36,170
or improve the efficiency
of the code, etcetera.

630
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,110
And the landscape build is being done

631
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,180
with Shell approach.

632
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,020
So we are using SAP DMLT
services to migrate,

633
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,013
to select two data from ECC
source to S/4 environment.

634
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,250
So as I just mentioned,
one of the key challenges

635
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,850
we have is as our ECC systems

636
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,060
were implemented more than 25 years ago,

637
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,340
and over the period of 25 years

638
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,330
we have added a lot of
customizations in the system,

639
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,610
and majority of those customizations

640
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,500
have very poor documentation,

641
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,310
and in some cases very
minimal documentation.

642
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,430
So it is extremely important
to clearly understand

643
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,370
what are the customizations
we have today in the system

644
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:26,724
so we can efficiently
migrate it to S/4HANA.

645
00:31:26,724 --> 00:31:29,460
And also we can understand what to test

646
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,790
and where there is a
possibility to replace

647
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,140
some of those customizations

648
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,840
with S/4 standard functionalities,

649
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,020
and also where we can adopt

650
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,080
some of the innovations
available from S/4.

651
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,970
So this determines the need to document

652
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,673
all those customizations
which are in place today.

653
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,090
So some of the key
objectives, like I said,

654
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,130
eliminate unused custom code.

655
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,870
So after doing the initial analysis,

656
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,620
we determined that nearly
40% of today's code

657
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,210
is not even in use.

658
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,590
So that requires a thorough cleanup.

659
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:12,270
And then we have a requirement
to analyze the interfaces

660
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,420
and dependencies as a lot of programs,

661
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,970
which were developed as part
of building the interfaces

662
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:23,010
for the systems connected
with ECC environment,

663
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,140
we need to clearly
understand the dependencies

664
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,954
so we can take care of
all the interface mapping

665
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:31,020
and dependencies, etcetera,

666
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,813
when we migrate the code from ECC to S/4.

667
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,940
And also another objective is to identify

668
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,850
what are all the
simplifications happening in S/4

669
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,800
and where we can eliminate

670
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,290
some of the customizations we have.

671
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,360
So as we built these customizations

672
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,020
over the period of 25 years,

673
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,970
so meanwhile SAP might have released

674
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,850
a lot of those functionalities
as standard functionalities

675
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,250
with subsequent ECC releases itself,

676
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,790
and some of them may be
released as part of S/4HANA.

677
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,550
So having good understanding

678
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,300
of what we have today
will help us to understand

679
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,980
what are the standard functionalities

680
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,233
which can replace some
of the customizations.

681
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,890
And another advantage of documenting

682
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,190
these customizations is we can limit

683
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,130
the testing effort by clearly knowing

684
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,410
what is really important for business

685
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,710
and what is being used, so
we can focus on the testing.

686
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,670
And also, when we are
troubleshooting some issues

687
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,440
as part of SIT and UIT,

688
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,480
we clearly understand the dependencies

689
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,620
and the purpose of the code,

690
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,573
so we can troubleshoot it quickly.

691
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,970
So not doing this documentation
will have a business impact,

692
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,700
because it can bring in
operational inefficiencies

693
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,930
and escalating costs as we
have to focus on more number

694
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,140
of objects without clearly
understanding the purpose

695
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,490
of the current code,

696
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,160
and also missed
opportunities for innovation,

697
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,780
without knowing what we have today,

698
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,560
we cannot adapt what is
available in the future release.

699
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,300
And there are also integration risks,

700
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,890
like I mentioned earlier,

701
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,540
if we don't understand the dependencies

702
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,460
and mappings in place, so we
cannot take care of those.

703
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,290
Also, it has a strategic importance.

704
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,810
So with fully documenting

705
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,870
and eliminating unused code or replacing

706
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,450
with standard S/4 functionalities
wherever possible,

707
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,820
we can optimize the system performance

708
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,250
and reduce the cost of ownership

709
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,350
even with the future upgrades

710
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,640
because we have less custom
code footprint to deal with.

711
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,330
And we clearly understand
where there are risks

712
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:43,710
and what are all the key areas to focus.

713
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:47,070
And then, even with future releases,

714
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,390
with clear documentation
we can quickly adopt

715
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,760
whenever there are new standard
functionalities available

716
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,823
and replace the existing customizations.

717
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,860
So with all this clear understanding,

718
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,170
we know that now we have to document

719
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,390
all 30,000 customer objects,

720
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,313
so there is no alternative for it.

721
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,100
So initially we started documenting

722
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,050
the custom code manually.

723
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,300
So there are some key
challenges with that.

724
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,680
So we started with six consultants
and started documenting.

725
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,680
So the performance was very poor

726
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,900
and it was very, very time consuming.

727
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,720
So in order to meet the project timelines,

728
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,920
so we initially planned

729
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,110
to achieve this in less than six months,

730
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,950
and as we were not meeting the goal

731
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,790
with the rate of speed
with six consultants

732
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,080
working on the documentation,

733
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,030
we ramped up the size of
people working on the task.

734
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,920
So we ramped up to 12 consultants.

735
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,810
Even with that there is minor
improvement in the speed,

736
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,893
still the estimation to
achieve the goal was 15 months.

737
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,377
And the cost of paying 12 consultants

738
00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:05,463
for the period of 15 months
is expensive, as you know.

739
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,900
And also, the consultants
were collaborating

740
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,320
with several functional
teams to understand

741
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,510
the purpose of the code developed

742
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,870
over the period of 25 years,
and trying to document,

743
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:22,620
and it was very inconsistent
and missing the uniformity

744
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,430
because each person was
documenting in different format,

745
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,300
and it's not providing the
value we were looking for.

746
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,770
So these were the practical challenges.

747
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,257
And then we thought, this
is not working at all.

748
00:36:34,257 --> 00:36:39,257
And also, we were unable
to meet the timelines

749
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,900
for the subsequent tasks planned

750
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,280
based on this documentation,

751
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,850
like mapping this custom documentation

752
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:51,000
with business process,
documenting or linking it

753
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,540
with the L1 to L4 process,
like order to cash,

754
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,460
regard to report, etcetera.

755
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,460
So the plan was to use this documentation

756
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,140
and association with
different business processes

757
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,070
during the unit testing, also
during SIT, UIT, etcetera.

758
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,720
But this was not working.

759
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,870
So then we looked at
alternative opportunities,

760
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:16,080
how we can solve it
with less manual effort

761
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:21,080
and how to bring in high consistency.

762
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,740
So then we started exploring
the AWS capability,

763
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:30,390
mainly we started with AWS Bedrock tool.

764
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:33,630
So the initial output from the tool

765
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,850
was not up to the expectation,

766
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,740
even though it was doing automatically

767
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,103
and it was only producing
the technical details,

768
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:43,688
like it scans the program

769
00:37:43,688 --> 00:37:46,230
and provided only that tables

770
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:51,230
that program was utilizing
and few technical details.

771
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,750
Then we collaborated with AWS team

772
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,730
and significantly improved

773
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:00,840
by improving the prompt
and outputs, etcetera,

774
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,260
and then we were able to
achieve what we wanted.

775
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,260
So by utilizing AWS
Bedrock to quickly scan

776
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,360
all 30,000 objects at a rapid
speed significantly helped us

777
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,240
to achieve the goal within a short period.

778
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,480
So the speed compared
to the manual processing

779
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,550
was much, much higher.

780
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,280
So the speed has improved
by six to seven times

781
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,150
and reduce the total timeline
from 15 months to 2 months.

782
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:34,770
And the total cost
reduction was more than 70%.

783
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,520
And the outputs are very
structured, easy to interpret,

784
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,380
and very consistent.

785
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,680
So this is all achieved with AWS Bedrock.

786
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,510
And later we tried Amazon Q Developer

787
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:52,980
with a latest version of Claude Sonnet

788
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,980
and it was even providing better output.

789
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,650
So let me show you a quick sample.

790
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,550
So on the left side,

791
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,790
what you see is the
manually generated output

792
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,870
by the 12 consultants.

793
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,270
So this is one of the
sample program output.

794
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,970
As you see, it is very
difficult to understand

795
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:13,440
unless a technical person looks at it

796
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,890
and completely puts effort to understand.

797
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,660
It is very difficult for a business person

798
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,130
or a functional person to understand

799
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,720
what is the purpose of the code.

800
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,250
And what you see on the right side

801
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,640
is the AI generated output,
it is very structured.

802
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,610
So the top four or five
lines, if you look at,

803
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,290
it provides a key summary,

804
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:34,320
and then in the bottom it provides

805
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,810
business scenario
description of the program.

806
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,290
So when a business person takes a look at,

807
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,560
he can quickly understand

808
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,980
what is the purpose of this
program and understand,

809
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,230
as it is written in business language.

810
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,870
And then what are the key functionalities?

811
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:52,950
So if one of the SAP functional
team member looks at it,

812
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,500
he or she can quickly understand

813
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,410
what are the key
functionalities of this program.

814
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,080
And then in the bottom, as you see,

815
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,440
so this is a detailed
step by step documentation

816
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,820
in technical perspective.

817
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,020
So if an above developer

818
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,320
wants to understand each
snippet of the code,

819
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,710
he or she can take a look at this

820
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,410
and understand the complete functionality

821
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,270
of the code in technical terms.

822
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,100
So you see the difference.

823
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,040
So the right side, AI generated output

824
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,040
is very easy to consume and
also is very consistent across,

825
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,990
because same prompt was used across

826
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,540
all 30,000 customer objects.

827
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,933
So the output was very
structured and very consistent.

828
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,400
So one of the key lessons
learned based on this is,

829
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,490
so whenever you are dealing with some task

830
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,940
which is highly manual,
and highly repetitive,

831
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,360
and consuming a lot of your resources,

832
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,970
think AI as the first option

833
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:00,900
and see what are the
possibilities available from AWS,

834
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:05,700
and evaluate thoroughly if
you can automate it completely

835
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,820
or at least reduce the
manual effort to some extent.

836
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,880
And then think about manual effort.

837
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,650
So in our case, as it took
some time for us to explore,

838
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,776
I want to share this
lesson learned with you,

839
00:41:19,776 --> 00:41:23,070
so if you're going through S/4 journey,

840
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,440
whatever may be the task
you're dealing with,

841
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,890
if it has high manual effort
and repetitive in nature,

842
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,873
think of AI as an option.

843
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,710
That's all from my myself, thank you.

844
00:41:36,593 --> 00:41:39,869
(audience applauding)

845
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:42,495
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

846
00:41:42,495 --> 00:41:43,328
- Okay, thank you, Varada,

847
00:41:43,328 --> 00:41:45,210
I have a question for you as well.

848
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,710
I know you're on a multi-year journey

849
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,060
for your S/4 journey,

850
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,970
and what you're doing with
gen AI, analyzing ABAP code

851
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,830
is part of your kind of assessment,

852
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,870
your early phases of the project.

853
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,540
How are you thinking
about use cases for gen AI

854
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,330
for the next phases of your S/4 journey?

855
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,200
- Sure.

856
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,320
Some of the use cases we
already started evaluating

857
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,110
is unit testing in
development environment.

858
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,723
So after we do the code remediation,

859
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,830
we are using a tool called SmartShip

860
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,950
to automatically remediate the custom code

861
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,123
in S/4 environment.

862
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,140
And also, as part of our
finance transformation,

863
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,829
we need to do some
functional code remediations

864
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:26,910
as we are con consolidating
the company codes

865
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:29,730
and harmonizing the chart
of accounts, etcetera.

866
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,420
So we need to do some functional
code remediations as well.

867
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,540
So post that, we need
to perform certain level

868
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,000
of unit testing in
development environment,

869
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,430
which is highly manual.

870
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:45,510
So to reduce the effort in unit testing,

871
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:49,380
we would like to use
MCP capability of Amazon

872
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,910
to automate some of that,

873
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:54,600
so to quickly scan the remediated code

874
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,180
and see it is consistent, and efficient,

875
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,680
and compatible with S/4HANA.

876
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,940
That's one of the use cases.

877
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,910
And also another use case
is whatever the new code

878
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:06,390
we develop as part of S/4 implementation,

879
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:10,830
we'd like to use Bedrock or
Q Developer to document it.

880
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,990
So manually documenting
the new custom code

881
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,570
can lead to inconsistencies,
and the developers sometimes,

882
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,910
if they're lazy, they don't fully document

883
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:22,350
all the data that's required,

884
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,650
and later it becomes very
challenging to troubleshoot.

885
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,360
So to maintain that consistency,

886
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,370
we would like to introduce those tools

887
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:32,160
and make it as a mandatory
step for all the developers

888
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,360
to use those tools with a
specific, predefined prompt.

889
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,650
So that way all the programs

890
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,350
will have mandatory details in place,

891
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,060
which can be easily referred later

892
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,760
for troubleshooting or
making further enhancements

893
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,660
in that code.

894
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,070
That's another use case.

895
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:49,780
And third one we are thinking of

896
00:43:51,076 --> 00:43:54,210
is using agentic capability of AWS

897
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:57,870
to scan historical
transactions in ECC environment

898
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:02,670
and capture the data used
in different transactions

899
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,770
and use the same data in automating

900
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,710
the testing in S/4 environment.

901
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,020
So manually generating those test data

902
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,170
is a big task and difficult.

903
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:16,080
So if we are successful in doing that,

904
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,240
it'll significantly help
in automated testing.

905
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,590
- Yeah, got it.

906
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,060
Cool, well, hey, thanks for the answer,

907
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,830
thanks for presenting here today,

908
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,410
and I look forward to hearing
how the next couple years

909
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,760
of your S/4 journey go.

910
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,660
- Thank you.
- So, thank you.

911
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,510
- I would like to take this
opportunity to thank AWS team

912
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,510
for their significant help on utilizing

913
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,420
some of these AI capabilities, thank you.

914
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,420
- Thank you, Varada.

915
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,370
Please do go into the app
and complete the survey

916
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,100
and hope you enjoy the
rest of your re:Invent.

917
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,500
Thank you for joining today.

918
00:44:46,647 --> 00:44:48,388
