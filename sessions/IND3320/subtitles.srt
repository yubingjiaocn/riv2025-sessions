1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,869
Well, welcome to IND 3320

2
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:03,608
Accelerating AI,

3
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:07,019
How Sun Life reduces latency and enhances

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:07,658
engagement.

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,500
My name is Salman Moghul. I'm a principal

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,720
consultant with, uh, AWS Professional

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,429
Services.

8
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:15,250
I'm joined here today

9
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:16,329
with three

10
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:17,859
wonderful leaders,

11
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,269
great colleagues from Sun Life who will share

12
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:22,429
their real world journey building

13
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,219
Gen AI applications,

14
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,129
solutions, architectures.

15
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:28,839
That keep users engaged while,

16
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:31,899
you know, during the complex workflows.

17
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:34,908
Quick introductions

18
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,209
from SunLife. We have Robert Chen. He's a

19
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,250
product owner for Gen AI Patterns.

20
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:41,950
To me, he's the OG who actually started the whole

21
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,069
thing and, uh, democratized Gen AI

22
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:45,069
at, uh, SunLife,

23
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,228
has built, uh, numerous Gen AI

24
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,829
technology patterns, uh, since early 2023.

25
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,469
Dennis, uh, Wolowic, he's the

26
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,228
director and domain enterprise architect for Contact

27
00:00:56,228 --> 00:00:58,649
Center. He's building very innovative

28
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,090
multi-agent collaborative workflows within Amazon

29
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,168
Contact Center, which he'll go over today.

30
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:05,599
And then we have Walter Kurzat.

31
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,668
He's a senior principal engineer

32
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,528
and he's the brain.

33
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,469
Behind basically the

34
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:14,528
uh designing and operationalizing GEI

35
00:01:14,528 --> 00:01:16,109
patterns at Sun Life

36
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:18,709
in a in a very tightly regulated

37
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:20,209
and secure environment

38
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:22,790
and interestingly enough uh this is the

39
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,028
same team who built a very uh recently

40
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:27,230
built an omni-channel Gen AI

41
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,769
solution called Code name Iris using um.

42
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:32,028
Amazon Connect and Bedrock,

43
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,510
uh, so the solution recently won some

44
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,500
CIO awards.

45
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,069
So the point is that if you wanted to come and

46
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,760
talk to,

47
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:41,069
uh, this team afterwards and how they

48
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,430
actually took this, uh, solution to production.

49
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:46,299
Please do so. We have a lot of contents. I know this

50
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:47,198
is the last

51
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,180
sort of last uh presentation before you can

52
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,989
leave, so

53
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:52,480
please stick around

54
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:54,480
and uh we have a lot of contents to cover.

55
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:58,150
All right, our agenda for today, I, I

56
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,269
will quickly explain the evolution of

57
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:01,150
Enterprise AI

58
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,629
and how this evolution has

59
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:05,528
caused some interesting and unique challenges.

60
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:06,930
Dennis will

61
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:08,169
walk us through,

62
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,788
uh, how him, uh, him, uh, Dennis

63
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:12,008
and his team are building

64
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:15,229
very innovative agentic concierge-like

65
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:16,889
system within Amazon Connect.

66
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:20,429
Uh, they are accelerating AI adoption within

67
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:21,588
Amazon Contact Center.

68
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,629
Rob will then show us, uh, their

69
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:25,969
contents assist, which is the

70
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:29,189
content generation and scoring platform within

71
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:29,770
Sun Life.

72
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:32,508
And finally, Walter will deep dive into

73
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:34,129
architectures and demos.

74
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,788
So let's talk about Enterprise AI and

75
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:40,189
how this evolution has caused some

76
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:41,169
interesting new challenges.

77
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,528
Uh, we have seen the event

78
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:46,649
of, or, or dawn of, uh, rack

79
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:47,919
systems, rack workflows.

80
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:50,800
They have been around. These are retrieval augment

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,610
generation systems.

82
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,538
Uh, these are single step,

83
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:56,028
uh, solutions that, uh,

84
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,449
you know, that what, what the reason why I say

85
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:00,449
single step because there's 11 round

86
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:02,679
trip to, uh, to your, uh, bedrock

87
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:04,649
or large language model to generate contents.

88
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,979
And there's a lot of human oversight involved.

89
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,399
We're now seeing, uh, deterministic agents

90
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,520
that are automating multiple steps

91
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,199
or multitask workflows,

92
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,639
and they're still very heavily being developed and

93
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,159
used in, um, SMBs and enterprises.

94
00:03:18,558 --> 00:03:20,669
We're also seeing autonomous agent. These

95
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,338
are, uh, multi,

96
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,080
uh, multi-step agentic workflows with a large

97
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,159
va variety of tool sets. They

98
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,278
can truly mimic human reasoning

99
00:03:29,278 --> 00:03:31,469
and capabilities, and, and, and now we're

100
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:32,300
starting to see.

101
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:35,288
Virtual worker agentic virtual workers

102
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,389
that can truly collaborate between uh

103
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,360
teams across your organization.

104
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,550
So while this,

105
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,288
you know, evolution has, has brought incredible,

106
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,909
incredible business values and, and it

107
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:49,990
has unlocked a lot of potential, this has also

108
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,288
caused a lot of interesting, you, uh,

109
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:54,429
interesting challenges that we'll talk about to deal

110
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:56,729
with. So

111
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,838
here's one like on the right hand side,

112
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:01,050
uh, on the left hand side you see a simple

113
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,319
Q&A, uh, chatbot. It

114
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,550
works perfectly well.

115
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:07,669
Your, uh, you get instant answers,

116
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,129
you know, users are typically very happy with these

117
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:11,868
instant responses, but on the,

118
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:13,669
on the right hand side you see

119
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,508
a more complex workflow.

120
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:18,269
This is the continences that Rob will go over.

121
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,059
And it's it's toward the right

122
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,139
hand side of the spectrum that we just saw in

123
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,220
the previous slide.

124
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:26,699
These are deterministic workflows moving toward

125
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,298
autonomy.

126
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:30,298
So analyzing, analyzing guidelines,

127
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:31,778
generating drafts,

128
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:32,730
and then

129
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,509
refining the output, these, these intelligent

130
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,309
steps take time,

131
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,899
sometimes 30, 60, longer.

132
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:41,608
So what is the problem here? It's, it's,

133
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:43,970
it's the response, right? So user

134
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,809
expects immediate response when they see

135
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:49,309
these spinners or 3 dot animation. They

136
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:51,389
think the system is not working, whereas

137
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,509
behind the scenes AI is working perfectly well, but

138
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:54,428
it just takes time.

139
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:57,028
Uh, to, to respond, so it's, it's

140
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:59,149
not a technical problem, it's more of a user, user

141
00:04:59,149 --> 00:04:59,869
experience problem.

142
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,009
And undoubtedly in 2025

143
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:06,119
it has been the year for model context

144
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,869
protocol uh that

145
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,290
act as a catalyst or acted as a

146
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,329
catalyst that has sped up

147
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:14,528
the creation of these agentic systems.

148
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:17,129
It's often compared the USB-C port

149
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:19,689
for uh agentic AI systems

150
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,809
provides standardized way to connect to your tools

151
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,470
and data sources behind the scene,

152
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:24,629
um,

153
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:27,199
and. Suddenly

154
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,319
with the with the help of MCP building

155
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,480
these autonomous agents become very easy

156
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,439
for enterprises,

157
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,660
but there's always like a

158
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,980
catch, right? So the catch is that while

159
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,399
um you are able to build these things

160
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,660
very rapidly,

161
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:41,858
uh, you,

162
00:05:42,238 --> 00:05:44,720
it takes time to execute uh energetic

163
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,238
workflow.

164
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,350
Uh, so

165
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,869
this really amplified that that

166
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:50,170
challenge that we just saw,

167
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:52,750
and as more and more enterprise adopt intelligent

168
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,569
agents through MCP, keeping

169
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,949
users engaged in your system

170
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:58,449
is, is extremely critical.

171
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,439
So how do we solve this challenge?

172
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,939
How do we keep users engaged during,

173
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,319
during these long running AI workflows?

174
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:09,730
Well, you probably have guessed and you have dealt with

175
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,329
it, uh, at some point, streaming

176
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,709
or, uh, real-time updates is the way to go.

177
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,329
And if you've been keeping up with these plethora

178
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:19,689
of, uh, reinvent announcement,

179
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:21,809
there was one just recently made around Amazon

180
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:24,040
API gateway now supporting streaming

181
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,569
natively.

182
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,139
Um, and you can also build

183
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,439
your webSocket servers

184
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:30,899
if you wanna go down that daring path, but

185
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,100
scaling those servers is challenging.

186
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,970
So for enterprises,

187
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,699
managed services that are secure and provide

188
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,980
necessary capabilities out of the box are super

189
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,160
critical, and that's why AppSync is

190
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,379
a better option.

191
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:46,410
And it offers three key capabilities

192
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,459
like flexible security through private

193
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:49,230
APIs,

194
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,759
uh, so your, your traffic never leaves your

195
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,129
VPC, it's always secure internal.

196
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,809
Uh, number 2 is the, uh,

197
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,129
request handling.

198
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,629
So it, it provides you with flexible

199
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,869
request handling so you could,

200
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:04,269
uh, you could stream these real-time updates to the front

201
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:06,540
end. You can also use resolvers,

202
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:08,619
um, for those who don't know what

203
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,250
AppSync is. We can talk later.

204
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:12,660
Uh, you can, you can change your request

205
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,480
and response resolvers using,

206
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,119
uh, uh, using, using these capabilities.

207
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:18,519
And then

208
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,869
third being the flexible evolution of

209
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:21,798
your API model.

210
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,379
So as you can imagine, as you're adding more

211
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,439
and more data points, uh, connections to your

212
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,480
back end, uh, your, you and

213
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,670
your consumer are consuming your APIs.

214
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,189
GraphQL has some capabilities built

215
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,738
in where,

216
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:36,600
uh, the changes in the back end doesn't really

217
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,670
impact your, your, your consumer.

218
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,238
So another key capability that enables

219
00:07:41,238 --> 00:07:43,189
streaming is GraphQL subscription.

220
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:44,238
Uh, so

221
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:46,920
it, it happens over a managed web socket, so.

222
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,759
Uh, it provides, so AppSync

223
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,790
provides all these capabilities in a managed

224
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,079
way, in a more secure way.

225
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,858
Uh, talking a little bit more about security

226
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,500
for highly regulated customers like SunLife

227
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:01,079
Security, uh, is, is critical.

228
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,238
AppSync provides this API,

229
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:05,338
private API accessibility only from

230
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:06,559
your VPC

231
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:07,959
through private link.

232
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,449
So with controls at every level

233
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:13,119
you can, uh, use IM policies.

234
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,738
You can use endpoint policies

235
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,910
and, you know, security groups and whatnot,

236
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:18,009
so. Uh,

237
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,519
that, that's what SunLife uses behind the

238
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,519
scene. Another key capability

239
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,759
of AppSync is resource access

240
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,420
management sharing or RAM.

241
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,119
So you can share APIs across multiple

242
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:31,358
accounts in a highly regulated environment

243
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:33,500
where you have multiple accounts to deal with.

244
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,808
Typically you are only allowed. To get into a cloud

245
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:38,129
through a foundational or a network account

246
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,469
so you can share your workload APIs

247
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,649
into this foundational account and then

248
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:43,269
access it through

249
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,840
um through through that through that VPC

250
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,928
endpoint and Walter will dive

251
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,928
deeper into this way

252
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:51,879
deep uh in in in his section.

253
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,928
All right, so

254
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,759
Couple of patterns,

255
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,460
uh, so for simple Q&A bot, AppSync, uh,

256
00:08:58,469 --> 00:08:59,090
calls

257
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:00,308
Bedrock,

258
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,109
uh, using its built-in capability

259
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,629
like these are data sources.

260
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:07,250
So there's a Bedrock data source you could bring your

261
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,119
context, your prompt,

262
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,590
called AppSync, and it will work, right? So

263
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,149
this, this is for simplistic workflows, works

264
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:13,668
quite well,

265
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:14,808
but for more

266
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:17,408
complex workflows that require

267
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:19,950
a longer time to execute, you need a different pattern, and

268
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,190
this is the async pattern for AppSync

269
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:24,538
where. Uh, which we talked about, this is

270
00:09:24,538 --> 00:09:26,739
applicable to the right hand side of the spectrum

271
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:27,399
for the AI,

272
00:09:27,678 --> 00:09:29,808
uh, longer running workflows, so user

273
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:30,798
makes a request,

274
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:33,349
absence mutation or query

275
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,960
to, you know, uh, start the

276
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:37,119
back end workflow

277
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,340
at the same time application subscribe.

278
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:41,928
So ASync invokes the lambda function which

279
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:43,889
orchestrates between your MCP server,

280
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,029
between Bedrock,

281
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:47,408
and you know, MCP server provides your

282
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:49,639
standard set of guides, uh, tools,

283
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,048
APIs, and databases to your, to your, to your MCP

284
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:53,469
and to your orchestrator

285
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:54,668
and, and then.

286
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,830
It starts streaming like as you're

287
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,109
going through as your AI orchestrator is going

288
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:02,259
through those multi-step process you can now

289
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:04,369
start streaming that data back to your

290
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,619
to your front end or to your consumer of the

291
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:07,489
API so

292
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,529
that

293
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,129
32nd

294
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,229
turns into a more engaging,

295
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,960
transparent, and explainable experience.

296
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,129
Uh, so this is

297
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:19,070
this pattern is applicable to any long running workflows

298
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,918
and, um,

299
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,308
and, and this is AI orchestration through

300
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,460
UX. Sunlife

301
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,080
also

302
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:29,320
leveraged multi-agent orchestration in their contact center

303
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,239
so that they remove dial tones

304
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:33,700
like press 1 for this, press 2 for this with

305
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,840
a very smart concierge system

306
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:38,058
that understands user utterances better than

307
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:39,239
your traditional built-in

308
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:40,658
uh NLP intent.

309
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:43,000
Uh, well, uh, Dennis will talk about this in

310
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,139
a second, and the concierge routes these

311
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:46,580
requests to a specialized subagent.

312
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:49,210
Uh, it can be an authentication agent to verify

313
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,609
your, or to, to authenticate your users.

314
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,889
It can be an IT support, uh, agent

315
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,928
that can handle your password resets

316
00:10:55,928 --> 00:10:58,119
requests, and it can be any specialized subs,

317
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:00,609
uh, sets of sub agents that can handle

318
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:03,330
claims, you know, your, your benefits

319
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,769
type of, uh, requests.

320
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,210
So the key is to keeping this response time in.

321
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:09,210
Check when building these multiple agents

322
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:11,788
and uh what you're seeing here is

323
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:13,788
the example of agentic virtual

324
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:16,548
worker. These are multi-agent coord uh

325
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:18,750
this is multi-agent coordination delivering

326
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,210
complete self-service.

327
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:21,889
um, so to, to recap,

328
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,139
MCP enable agentic workflows.

329
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:26,548
AppSync accelerated AI through

330
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:27,808
real-time streaming,

331
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,190
uh, contact Center or

332
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,308
Amazon Connect accelerated through voice

333
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,149
and conversational concierge system.

334
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,369
Sun Life uses both,

335
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:36,950
so better UX.

336
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,849
Uh, faster, uh, you know, faster

337
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:41,960
AI engaged user and to dive

338
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,830
deeper into

339
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:45,210
the self-service contact use case, I'm

340
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,989
gonna invite Dennis Wolovi to the stage.

341
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:52,178
Uh Hit

342
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,259
the hit the green button.

343
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,788
All right, good afternoon. My name is Dennis Volovic,

344
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:02,109
and I'm a domain enterprise architect for

345
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:03,690
contact centers at Sun Life.

346
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:06,269
It's been a good reinvent so far. I'm

347
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,349
trying to catch up on all the announcements. I'm,

348
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:10,830
I'm looking forward to getting back and experimenting

349
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,830
with the 29 new features

350
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,308
announced for Amazon Connect.

351
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:15,899
Before I get started,

352
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:18,500
for those that may not be familiar with Sun Life,

353
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,489
we're an international financial services

354
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:24,099
organization, and our purpose is to help clients

355
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:26,519
achieve lifetime financial security

356
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:28,019
and live healthier lives.

357
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,359
Picture this.

358
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,779
You call customer service and within

359
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,918
seconds you're having a real conversation.

360
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:38,548
No menus, no press 1 for this, press

361
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:39,450
2 for that,

362
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,779
no repeating your account number 3 times,

363
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,639
just natural dialogue

364
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,940
that actually solves your problems.

365
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,500
It sounds too good to be true.

366
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:50,590
I'll show you how you can transform from menus

367
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,750
to a conversational IVR and

368
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,830
create concierge-like experiences

369
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,989
that move beyond keywords

370
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:59,229
to natural dialogue that understands

371
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:01,418
context, intent, and nuance.

372
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:02,509
From there

373
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:04,950
we'll get to digital assistance that will empower

374
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,190
your customers to resolve issues

375
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,678
independently through AI guided interactions.

376
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,548
And with conversational digital assistants

377
00:13:12,788 --> 00:13:14,830
you can start to balance the friction typically

378
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,109
faced with tasks like authentication.

379
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,460
Contact centers are where AI can really

380
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,090
shine and transform IVR experiences.

381
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:24,288
The question is,

382
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,330
where do you start?

383
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,879
We've been, we've been working with Amazon

384
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,849
Connect now for several years,

385
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:34,440
and as we're moving through the journey

386
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,908
from touch tone to deterministic agents,

387
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:39,798
we're testing and learning thoughtfully

388
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:40,979
and responsibly

389
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,279
to ensure we focus on the right outcomes

390
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,538
and experiences for our customers.

391
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:48,399
The solution options I'll share helped us

392
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,979
improve service quality

393
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:52,399
while progressively enhancing the customer

394
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,519
experience on the IVR.

395
00:13:55,678 --> 00:13:57,859
We'll start by talking about Amazon Connect

396
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,080
and Amazon Lex.

397
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,178
This is how you enable your IVR

398
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,279
for speech recognition and natural language

399
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,469
understanding. Then I'll introduce

400
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:09,200
services like Bedrock and EKS

401
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,979
that will augment the Connect experience

402
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:13,739
with larger language models

403
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:15,719
and model context protocol.

404
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,700
Which will give us more contextual

405
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,298
awareness,

406
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,298
multi-turn memory, and dynamic dialogues.

407
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:25,349
You'll come to see that there is a path

408
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:27,529
to deterministic agents, and along

409
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:29,349
the way there's value

410
00:14:29,609 --> 00:14:31,759
that can be delivered for your customers.

411
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,769
All right, we'll start by covering a voice

412
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:36,369
powered

413
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:39,529
experience. Now this is a very nice alternative.

414
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:41,928
Your customers will be able to appreciate

415
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:43,928
expressing themselves verbally.

416
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:47,000
The solution uses Amazon Lex.

417
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:49,739
Uh, I know there were a lot of announcements

418
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,879
around Connect AI agents,

419
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:53,678
uh, but Lex

420
00:14:53,979 --> 00:14:56,058
does remain the scaffolding that sits

421
00:14:56,058 --> 00:14:58,168
between Connect and those AI

422
00:14:58,168 --> 00:15:00,460
agents, so it's still an important concept to

423
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,479
try and understand,

424
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:04,259
and it's also a key enabler for Nova

425
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:06,719
Sonic. For

426
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,759
those of you that are unfamiliar with Amazon Connect,

427
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,000
that's AWS's customer service

428
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,099
platform, and Amazon Lex

429
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:15,840
is a builder for conversational interfaces.

430
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:19,288
Now what is a a Lex bot?

431
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:21,649
A bot is made up of intent. So these

432
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:23,889
are the actions that your customer wants

433
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,288
to take, uh, for example, uh,

434
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,649
asking about their claim status or what

435
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,288
their coverage amount is,

436
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:33,168
and utterances are the way that

437
00:15:33,168 --> 00:15:35,269
your customers will express that question,

438
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,750
uh, what am I covered for?

439
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,558
So then how does Lex respond?

440
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,099
Um, Lex could respond

441
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:44,139
directly from the intent. So for answers that

442
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:46,219
never change, you can put those

443
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:48,308
right in your intent and Lex will respond.

444
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,979
It can also respond with a slot. So a slot

445
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:51,940
is Lex's way,

446
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,658
Lex's way of collecting more

447
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:56,859
information. So in that coverage example I

448
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:58,580
shared, uh, Lex might

449
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:01,029
present a slot and say, did you mean

450
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:03,019
medical coverage or dental coverage?

451
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,489
And finally, if you wanted to do some customization,

452
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:08,389
you can introduce a lambda.

453
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,048
And the lambda will let you do things

454
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:14,129
like attach to APIs, so this

455
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:16,250
will give you an opportunity to create

456
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,859
more personalized responses.

457
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:20,609
So again, going back to that dental coverage

458
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:21,190
example,

459
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,840
you'll want to personalize that response so that your

460
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,509
customer

461
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:27,210
knows exactly how much coverage they have

462
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,950
before they go and visit the dentist.

463
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,330
And one last point about the lambda is you can only

464
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,509
have one per elect spot.

465
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:36,190
Now let's turn our attention to Amazon Connect.

466
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:39,000
Um, Amazon Connect is where you

467
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,320
build the IVR experience and you can

468
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:44,000
kind of for those that haven't seen it, there's a

469
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,158
contact flow designer,

470
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,479
it's like a canvas you drop blocks on

471
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:49,479
there, you connect arrows, and that essentially

472
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,019
becomes

473
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
the journey that your customers have on

474
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,219
the IVR

475
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:55,918
and if we walk through the flow here that

476
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:56,558
you're seeing.

477
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:59,308
The way we manage the journey in

478
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:01,450
this architecture is through

479
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,019
Connect session attributes,

480
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:06,500
contact attributes, and, and when Lex

481
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,630
returns something, we use those session attributes

482
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:10,900
and together we use the

483
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,279
results of that to navigate the user

484
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:14,920
across the IVR

485
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:17,618
and you can see what's happening here. I've got 3

486
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:19,858
Lex bots so when a customer calls

487
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:22,088
in, you may want to present the menu

488
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:24,318
bot so that your customer can express

489
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,680
their reason for calling

490
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,880
and then as a result of that,

491
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:30,489
um, as a result of calling the menu

492
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:32,549
bot. It may be that your

493
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:34,578
customer wants to know what their coverage amount is,

494
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,368
so that could then

495
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:36,650
lead us to

496
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:39,269
showing the self-service bot and resolving

497
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:40,269
that inquiry.

498
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:42,828
Another valid outcome from a menu bot could

499
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,380
be that,

500
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,828
you know what, we're gonna have to put them into a queue so

501
00:17:45,828 --> 00:17:47,068
that they can talk to an agent.

502
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:50,118
And then once they're in the queue waiting, we

503
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:52,420
may want to surface the authentication bot

504
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:54,618
and try to collect some more information from them

505
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,959
while they're sitting in the queue.

506
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:58,910
Now, You've got

507
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,098
lots of options here. You could collapse

508
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:02,949
all the Lexbots into one.

509
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:04,289
These really do become

510
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,088
architecture decisions

511
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,489
for you on how you want to develop that

512
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,009
customer experience.

513
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,469
Again, this solution has nice benefits.

514
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,868
It does eliminate the menu frustration.

515
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:17,769
It introduces natural language understanding,

516
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:19,729
and there is a structured

517
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,328
nature to Lex, so

518
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,989
you have very clear outcomes that that

519
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:24,989
your customers will get.

520
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,239
And with that solution it does deliver

521
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,279
value, but it does leave some challenges when you

522
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,759
wanna get to a more conversational

523
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
experience. There's been recent advances

524
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,719
in Gen AI that come with some compelling

525
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,420
solution options, and we'll get into those.

526
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,039
One of the things is as you scale those

527
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,160
highly configured experiences that you've built in

528
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,759
Lex, it's really nice to be able to augment

529
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,979
Lex with some large language models

530
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,019
and prompts.

531
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,539
Uh, in the previous diagram you saw

532
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:55,578
the integration, how there was a Lex, the lambda, and

533
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:57,160
then all your API calls

534
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,578
that feels very tied to

535
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:01,068
your Lex implementation

536
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:03,380
and very use case specific.

537
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,858
Salman spoke earlier about what's changed, and

538
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:08,180
he mentioned model context protocol. So

539
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,779
now those large language models that we've augmented

540
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:12,880
Lex with, suddenly we can use that

541
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:15,039
to discover tools on an MCP server.

542
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:18,400
And then the last challenge is more around user

543
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,618
experience and how do you manage the state

544
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,078
that's a lot easier to solve with larger

545
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,118
language models. The orchestration

546
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:27,670
frameworks like Lang chain and strands,

547
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,199
they've got hooks to be able to implement session

548
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:32,318
management and conversation

549
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:33,598
history a lot easier.

550
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:36,410
So I'll walk you through the solution architecture

551
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:39,029
and I'll share how we can level up the previous

552
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:41,189
design and get it to be more conversational.

553
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,949
So in this architecture,

554
00:19:44,568 --> 00:19:45,789
Lex is still the gateway.

555
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:49,809
That when we when we spoke about

556
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:51,969
Lex in the previous architecture I talked

557
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:54,009
about how it's designed and how there's intense

558
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,828
and how there's utterances

559
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,368
and the idea is that when the customer

560
00:19:58,368 --> 00:19:59,130
says something

561
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:01,769
Lex tries to match it to an intent and then

562
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:02,348
respond.

563
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:04,549
What I didn't talk about is

564
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:06,130
what happens if Lex

565
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,328
doesn't understand.

566
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,858
So there's another intent there called a

567
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:11,910
fallback intent, and that's essentially

568
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,209
Lex's catch-all

569
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,630
and allows you to create

570
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,828
responses such as I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.

571
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:19,828
Could you please rephrase your question?

572
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,900
Now why do I mention that?

573
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:24,328
The reason is is that the Lexbot

574
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,670
in this architecture has no intents.

575
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,509
All we have is the fallback intent.

576
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,868
So what's happening is that when the customer is

577
00:20:30,868 --> 00:20:32,868
talking, it's going through Lex,

578
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,009
it's falling back, and it's going right

579
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:37,430
to the lambda, and that's where the next big

580
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,430
change comes in this, uh, in, in this,

581
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,170
uh, approach.

582
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,430
We use the

583
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,469
Standard MCP client SDK

584
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,199
and effectively we turn our lambda

585
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,680
into an MCP client that is

586
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,719
capable of calling an MCP

587
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,680
server hosted in EKS.

588
00:20:55,598 --> 00:20:57,709
So when the process starts, the lambda will

589
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,838
do a fetch. It'll do a resources call on

590
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:01,098
the MCP server,

591
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:03,400
and it will pull back the configuration elements

592
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,439
it needs. It'll pull back the prompt

593
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:07,098
that it needs to drive the orchestration.

594
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:10,750
You'll also see in the diagram that I have bedrock

595
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,930
that's where we get our large language models

596
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:14,250
and when.

597
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,189
With the prompt that we just pulled,

598
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,549
we can suddenly

599
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,949
pass that over to the large language model

600
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,289
and the larger language model can then discover the

601
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:25,568
tools that it needs and then start orchestrating

602
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:26,969
the authentication flow.

603
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:30,390
Another thing on this that's new is there's a

604
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,588
Dynamo DB and we use that

605
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:35,088
for managing the session

606
00:21:35,088 --> 00:21:37,390
and conversation history. We

607
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,229
could have just as easily used S3.

608
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:40,739
And

609
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:42,209
something that's not

610
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:44,789
reflected in here is that uh laying chain and

611
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:47,449
land graft, that's our orchestration framework,

612
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:49,250
and as a result, uh,

613
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,368
the persistence layer is implemented using

614
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:54,549
uh checkpointers that are provided with that.

615
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,130
Now let's look at the MCP server.

616
00:21:58,328 --> 00:21:59,390
When we first started

617
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:01,769
doing this, the agent core wasn't

618
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:02,390
available

619
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:04,559
for us to use at the time,

620
00:22:04,848 --> 00:22:05,380
and

621
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:07,809
one of the things we were thinking for expediency

622
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:10,009
was let's try to convert a lambda into

623
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:11,170
an MCP server.

624
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:12,750
But due to the stateless nature

625
00:22:13,118 --> 00:22:15,130
of lambdas and the fact that they die off

626
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:15,750
quickly,

627
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:18,568
um, we thought not because MCP

628
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:19,430
protocols

629
00:22:19,949 --> 00:22:22,420
operate asynchronously and

630
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:23,660
they are stateful.

631
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:26,229
And if we were to go to use a lambda, we

632
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:28,608
would have to build our own persistence layer

633
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:31,368
again in Dynamo DB or S3

634
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:33,640
so that we could rewrite those session IDs.

635
00:22:33,828 --> 00:22:36,650
So our choice was to containerize

636
00:22:36,868 --> 00:22:38,598
because that gives us that permanent

637
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:39,809
long running

638
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,670
mechanism. And

639
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:44,269
the other thing is, is that with the MCP

640
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:45,009
protocol

641
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,709
using session stickiness, it all kind of works

642
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:48,809
better that way for us.

643
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:52,000
Another thing about the MCP server, we

644
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,459
use fast MCP and multi-threading

645
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,108
to scale the MCP server container,

646
00:22:57,358 --> 00:22:59,400
and then EKS takes care of horizontal

647
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,509
scaling when our workloads

648
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:03,469
increase. So

649
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:06,019
another. Either

650
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:08,180
in the MCP server you'll see that

651
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,380
we've got a couple of servers. We've got one

652
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,500
for authentication, so that's

653
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,618
we keep our prompts up there and then we

654
00:23:14,618 --> 00:23:16,779
have several tools like a user ID tool

655
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:18,979
so that we can do a validation of the user

656
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:21,019
ID and an OTP tool so that

657
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:23,259
we can send a one-time passcode to somebody's

658
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:23,979
phone and then

659
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,368
uh validate that.

660
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,779
We also have a knowledge base uh

661
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:29,559
MCP server as well.

662
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:32,380
So let's talk about how this flow

663
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,750
is being orchestrated.

664
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:37,489
Before diving into the prompt engineering,

665
00:23:37,989 --> 00:23:40,469
let's talk about what makes a deterministic

666
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:41,160
agent

667
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:43,818
with our authentication scenario, we

668
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:44,529
need the same

669
00:23:45,108 --> 00:23:46,449
predictable output.

670
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,709
For given input

671
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:51,949
every single time, we can't have the LLM

672
00:23:51,949 --> 00:23:54,269
decide a user ID is

673
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:56,348
good one day and then not

674
00:23:56,348 --> 00:23:56,880
another,

675
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,608
or worse, let someone bypass it altogether.

676
00:24:00,068 --> 00:24:02,068
So the agent must operate on a set of

677
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:04,150
predefined rules and make large

678
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,828
language model outputs more deterministic

679
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:08,809
by lowering the temperature.

680
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:12,660
Structured JSON outputs and leveraging

681
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,029
MCP tools for standard responses.

682
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:18,420
I mentioned earlier about creating a

683
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,880
concierge experience

684
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,618
and to do this we make use of prompts to

685
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:25,098
deliver a multi-agent orchestration.

686
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,789
The concierge is also deterministic.

687
00:24:28,848 --> 00:24:30,750
It needs to properly

688
00:24:31,608 --> 00:24:33,650
understand customer intent and know when to

689
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,189
route to a human

690
00:24:35,449 --> 00:24:37,489
or hand off to another agent,

691
00:24:37,848 --> 00:24:40,410
and the concierge prompt has its own persona

692
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,449
definition. It's got its own instructions

693
00:24:42,449 --> 00:24:44,348
and confidence logic. It needs to know

694
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,209
when to route or ask clarifying

695
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:49,289
questions. So there's also retry logic.

696
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,630
Once the concierge has done the job of understanding

697
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,789
the intent, it may determine that

698
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:56,828
to fulfill it, it needs to call

699
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:58,489
an authentication service,

700
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,209
and here we do the multi-agent orchestration

701
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:01,729
and

702
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,799
introduce the authentication agent,

703
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:06,828
and this too has its own persona definition.

704
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:09,309
It has its own step by step deterministic

705
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:10,098
workflows.

706
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,500
We've all been through authentication. There's

707
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,630
a there's a clear sequence of steps. You've got

708
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,509
to resolve an IED and then.

709
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,170
Get on to the next factor like OTP

710
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,939
so we have to make sure that

711
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,670
the flow we create with the prompt is very

712
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,170
um step by step and deterministic

713
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,239
and of course there's the tool discovery.

714
00:25:29,858 --> 00:25:31,900
Another neat thing about the authentication

715
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
agent, it doesn't operate in a dual

716
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,939
mode, and the first mode is the

717
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:37,838
agent decides the next step.

718
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,358
And then in the other mode, it's when Lex

719
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:41,519
collects input

720
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:43,838
via the slots that I mentioned in the

721
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:44,939
in the previous slide.

722
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:46,289
And

723
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:48,250
because we have a structured

724
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:49,828
JSON output,

725
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,199
that's what enables the seamless switching

726
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:53,150
between the two modes.

727
00:25:54,689 --> 00:25:56,769
So when you augment the Kinect experience with

728
00:25:56,769 --> 00:25:59,209
large language models and MCP servers, the

729
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:01,209
options with prompt engineering open many

730
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:02,088
possibilities.

731
00:26:02,838 --> 00:26:05,098
And you can take this in endless directions.

732
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:07,479
I hope that you saw that there is

733
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:09,559
a path from touch tone to

734
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:11,219
deterministic agents, and

735
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,799
along the way there's a lot of value to be had.

736
00:26:14,598 --> 00:26:16,598
Uh, before I transition to the

737
00:26:16,598 --> 00:26:18,598
next speaker, I just wanna thank you

738
00:26:18,598 --> 00:26:20,598
for joining, and I hope I've

739
00:26:20,598 --> 00:26:23,279
given you some ideas on how you can accelerate,

740
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:25,118
accelerate AI

741
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:27,578
and transform your own, uh, IVR

742
00:26:27,578 --> 00:26:29,660
experiences in your contact centers.

743
00:26:30,078 --> 00:26:32,670
Um, I'll transition now to Rob

744
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,368
and he'll talk about content assist

745
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,019
and

746
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,150
sorry I.

747
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:41,709
He'll talk about content assist and

748
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:44,229
another creative use case for MCP.

749
00:26:44,588 --> 00:26:46,848
Thank you. All

750
00:26:46,848 --> 00:26:49,348
right. All

751
00:26:49,348 --> 00:26:50,608
right, thanks, Dennis.

752
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,189
Never would have thought I'd be up on stage talking

753
00:26:53,189 --> 00:26:55,078
about content at reinvent, but

754
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:56,729
content seems to be everywhere.

755
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:59,140
Um, social media,

756
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,640
email blasts, you know, everybody has their Instagram,

757
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:02,459
their TikTok,

758
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,439
their Facebook content coming in.

759
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,078
Problem with content is it's difficult to

760
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:09,199
create. Everybody hates doing documentation

761
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:11,279
even, but creating content is really tough,

762
00:27:11,318 --> 00:27:13,338
and that's where the whole concept of

763
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,279
could we make it easier with Gen AI.

764
00:27:16,098 --> 00:27:18,519
And that's exactly where we're going in terms of

765
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,979
how can we make things easier for

766
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:23,160
different use cases for content

767
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,989
as we start moving forward,

768
00:27:25,338 --> 00:27:27,459
um, as Salmon mentioned, I'm Rob

769
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:29,318
Chin, product owner of GEI

770
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:30,858
Patterns,

771
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,680
and

772
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:34,140
started a journey with Salmon and Jenny I probably

773
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,759
around

774
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:36,029
2023,

775
00:27:36,578 --> 00:27:38,618
and back then that's when there was

776
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:40,779
no AWS GEI blogs to learn

777
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:43,170
from. There wasn't any GEI services

778
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:45,650
and now it's probably pretty hard to find a session

779
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,229
that doesn't have any GEI in there

780
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:48,568
or Bedrock.

781
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,949
I remember in 2023 when Bedrock

782
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:52,049
started getting released,

783
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,529
a Google search just said that Bedrock was

784
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:56,650
where the Flintstones, the Flintstones were from,

785
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,239
but now we have Cloud, so you can ask Claude if you don't

786
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,189
know the Flintstones

787
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,170
who lives in the town of Bedrock, you'll get some interesting answers.

788
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:06,019
But um so let's jump into content

789
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,259
assist. So Continent

790
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:10,380
just started because GEI is great

791
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,759
at generating content.

792
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:14,299
So could we design a solution

793
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:16,400
that could leverage large language models

794
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:17,519
to help us

795
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:19,689
create, score,

796
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:21,118
and even rewrite

797
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,858
content as we move forward? And do

798
00:28:23,858 --> 00:28:25,858
we have to limit ourselves? Large language models

799
00:28:25,858 --> 00:28:27,939
really don't know what kind of content they're creating,

800
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:30,390
so we could do it for marketing, custom

801
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,130
summaries,

802
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,500
documentation,

803
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,209
even res you know, responses to RFPs.

804
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:37,338
You could definitely do if you just kind of guide it.

805
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:39,868
And that was where consciousness went.

806
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,489
Our solutions powered by Amazon Bedrock,

807
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:46,108
one of our preferred models and probably a lot of folks

808
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:48,769
in this room, um, cloud Anthropic

809
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:51,328
is one of the big models for creating content.

810
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:54,318
And the intent of the solution is really to

811
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:56,019
generate high quality content through

812
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,459
precise prompting,

813
00:28:57,838 --> 00:28:59,000
and precise prompting.

814
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:00,920
The power of the prompt,

815
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,250
everything comes around the quality of the prompt

816
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:03,789
to generate,

817
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,328
quality output, and we'll be talking about that

818
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,170
a little bit later on.

819
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,439
And

820
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,789
Prompting in terms of content

821
00:29:11,088 --> 00:29:13,250
who knows content the most than the subject

822
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,250
matter experts. So as we go through

823
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,588
here you'll start seeing that

824
00:29:17,108 --> 00:29:19,529
creating content is really a partnership between the

825
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:20,140
technology team

826
00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:22,489
and the business teams because I

827
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:24,608
know very little about content, but if we can provide

828
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,439
the foundation like content assist

829
00:29:26,729 --> 00:29:28,430
to, you know, move this, um,

830
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:31,009
content creation forward, that's where we wanna

831
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:33,269
go. For today's demo,

832
00:29:33,368 --> 00:29:34,588
I always wanted my own mock

833
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,380
company, so I created Perfect Frame Studios.

834
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,068
It's a company that specialize in creating

835
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:42,078
premium cat videos which everybody loves,

836
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:42,989
so we'll be using

837
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:45,469
Perfect Frame Studios as we move forward.

838
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:48,759
What you're seeing here is a preview we'll do the demo

839
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,799
later. It's a preview of

840
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,959
content that was created for Instagram for

841
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,140
Perfect Frame Videos and we'll start going

842
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,539
through. So

843
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:59,578
Consciousness is definitely wasn't developed overnight.

844
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,239
It was a very iterative process.

845
00:30:01,838 --> 00:30:04,160
Started back in 2024 with

846
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,539
a few curious users, and the thing I found

847
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,539
about Gen AI curiosity is really what

848
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:09,160
drives,

849
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:12,219
um, moving forward with ideas.

850
00:30:12,618 --> 00:30:13,920
So we had folks that were using

851
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,759
one line prompts, create an Instagram post for

852
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:19,140
XYZ Perfect Frame Studios,

853
00:30:19,699 --> 00:30:20,420
did really good.

854
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,939
They're happy with the results, but over time,

855
00:30:23,608 --> 00:30:25,699
The content looked very generic. It didn't have that

856
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,818
brand tone, that brand voice that everybody was

857
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:29,410
used to in creating content,

858
00:30:29,818 --> 00:30:31,818
and then they, we started working together, the IT

859
00:30:31,818 --> 00:30:34,118
team, professional services from Amazon,

860
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:36,779
we started creating prompt templates that we could hand

861
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:38,818
to the business so they could start pulling

862
00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:41,199
in those brand guidelines and brand voice

863
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,189
that they knew

864
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,699
they were experts in, and we started creating

865
00:30:44,699 --> 00:30:46,719
these complex, more precise prompts

866
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:48,358
that was really generating amazing

867
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:51,338
content, so amazing that we started

868
00:30:51,338 --> 00:30:53,239
getting a lot of use cases coming in.

869
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,449
Business groups were filling in these templates, creating

870
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:58,729
these amazing prompts, so we started amassing

871
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:00,469
a lot of prompts that were being shared

872
00:31:00,969 --> 00:31:02,969
that people were using and putting into an internal

873
00:31:02,969 --> 00:31:05,088
tool that we had similar to a chat

874
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:05,750
GPT

875
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:08,049
where you would put the prompt in, put your content, and

876
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:10,269
it would generate it connected to Bedrock.

877
00:31:11,699 --> 00:31:13,739
The key to getting good quality

878
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:14,598
content is

879
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,439
be very clear and descriptive

880
00:31:16,699 --> 00:31:19,000
in your prompts, and we'll cover some of this

881
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,108
uh prompting styles as we move forward.

882
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:23,358
But as we started getting more and more of these prompts,

883
00:31:23,578 --> 00:31:25,618
we created a UX wrapper around it so

884
00:31:25,618 --> 00:31:27,699
that if you're a marketing person wanting

885
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:29,390
to create an Instagram post,

886
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,160
you would go in, select the

887
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,880
categories that you're wanting to.

888
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,239
It would pull the predefined prompt from the back

889
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,799
end and create the content.

890
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:38,410
Later on,

891
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,358
We thought about where else could we.

892
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:44,039
Introducing from a front end perspective, we

893
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,689
chose a web UI to start with,

894
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:48,180
but you could easily extend this out into

895
00:31:48,318 --> 00:31:50,479
other channels whether it's Slack, Microsoft

896
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:52,838
Teams, or even a Microsoft, um, add-in.

897
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,279
The key, I think with any of these G AI solutions

898
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,358
is build your solution as modular

899
00:31:57,358 --> 00:31:58,160
as possible

900
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:00,449
because you don't know where the next, uh,

901
00:32:00,739 --> 00:32:01,858
technology platform is gonna be.

902
00:32:02,318 --> 00:32:04,420
You know, we started small doing things

903
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,680
in our, our tool sunlight fast, but

904
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,759
then we took the prompt,

905
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,439
dropped it into a lambda,

906
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,660
dropped it into

907
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:13,199
a UX, so everything was very modular,

908
00:32:13,318 --> 00:32:14,299
nothing was lost.

909
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:16,699
So I talked about

910
00:32:17,318 --> 00:32:19,338
precise prompting and you're probably wondering what is this

911
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:21,660
magical prompt that we use to get this quality

912
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:23,959
output so I'm just gonna walk you through a little bit in

913
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:24,640
terms of.

914
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,759
Things that we um considered

915
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:29,799
so you'll see the brand guidelines we have it

916
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:32,118
captured within an XML structure.

917
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:36,000
Using cloud, um, the model,

918
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:38,068
the XML structure really keeps things

919
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,769
organized so that when you start referring to these

920
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:41,848
areas in your prompt,

921
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,910
it keeps cloud very focused.

922
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:46,608
So if you can get things structured

923
00:32:46,608 --> 00:32:48,809
in the XML format in this particular

924
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:49,969
case, brand guidelines,

925
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,449
we want our marketing post to be professional and

926
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:53,910
caring, plain language.

927
00:32:54,969 --> 00:32:56,680
We can talk about the brand examples,

928
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,250
good examples, bad examples, very

929
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,368
key bad example if

930
00:33:01,368 --> 00:33:03,489
you have a cat with an attitude problem, no worries,

931
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:05,059
we can handle difficult talent,

932
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:07,189
not exactly the best example, but

933
00:33:07,608 --> 00:33:09,608
maybe your cats need some extra time to warm up

934
00:33:09,608 --> 00:33:11,219
and that's perfectly normal.

935
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:13,750
So these examples really help guide

936
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:15,269
the models in creating your

937
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:17,848
content. Other guidelines you

938
00:33:17,848 --> 00:33:20,049
can bring in and as you can see as you start looking

939
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:21,989
through this content we talked about prompting

940
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,568
being the new development language you'll notice

941
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:26,568
that everything in here is really business

942
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:28,348
driven from the content experts so

943
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:30,469
you're starting to see a shift from

944
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,969
technical development more into the business side

945
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,009
of things so the business is driving a

946
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:37,150
lot of the content generation logic now

947
00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:39,868
and we provide the foundation and content assist

948
00:33:39,868 --> 00:33:40,568
to enable them.

949
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:43,449
In this case you can include call to actions,

950
00:33:43,469 --> 00:33:45,750
anything that in this case a marketing team would want

951
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,368
to drive through very iterative

952
00:33:48,699 --> 00:33:50,709
if you're not getting the right output, look back at

953
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:52,289
your prompt, add more details.

954
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,358
In terms of, you know, the output format

955
00:33:56,729 --> 00:33:59,160
for this particular one, you'll see I ask it for

956
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,410
the actual post,

957
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,939
but the other one that I ask for is a reasoning, and the reasoning

958
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:04,279
is very key because

959
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:06,578
as these models generate your content

960
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:07,900
they're using your guidelines.

961
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:10,699
But when you're doing the human in the loop review to

962
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,760
understand why did it write a

963
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,820
marketing post in a particular way,

964
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,340
the LLM will actually go through and say I

965
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,590
wrote it because you told me,

966
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,059
and a lot of the times it'll actually be spot

967
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,079
on. Because your guidelines weren't

968
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:25,197
specific enough and then you can go back

969
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:26,367
in and start tuning it

970
00:34:26,637 --> 00:34:27,697
so be specific

971
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:29,259
and then lastly

972
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:32,079
telling it step by step exactly what you want.

973
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:35,099
The LLM to do as you go through and

974
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,217
if it's starting to, you know, drift and not

975
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:39,407
follow exactly what you um are

976
00:34:39,407 --> 00:34:39,978
expecting

977
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:42,197
just start adding on to your instructions

978
00:34:42,778 --> 00:34:44,898
so you start pulling all of these sections into

979
00:34:44,898 --> 00:34:46,137
your overall prompt

980
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:48,657
and we're having complex prompts now that are like

981
00:34:48,657 --> 00:34:50,398
5 to 10 pages in length.

982
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,637
Which is giving really good

983
00:34:53,637 --> 00:34:56,018
results, but it does create challenges.

984
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,708
Complex prompts take longer to run, which

985
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:01,829
is expected to get quality. It

986
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:02,570
takes time.

987
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,349
So when we had these complex prompts

988
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:07,349
being run, they could take up to a minute in time.

989
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,909
Users are impatient. Nobody likes to wait. They

990
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:12,110
start flipping away, reading their emails, going to different

991
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,148
chats, and then sometimes they don't come back.

992
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:16,349
So to improve that, we

993
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:18,429
looked at a streaming solution so that we

994
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:20,590
could keep the client engaged, and

995
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,628
that's when we introduced, um, App sync,

996
00:35:22,978 --> 00:35:25,340
which Salmon touched on and Walter will be, um,

997
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:27,349
explaining. Getting that streaming going

998
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:29,360
as soon as Bedrock starts creating the

999
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,708
content, you get that scrolling effect,

1000
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,769
almost near immediate response.

1001
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,148
The second challenge we talked about was

1002
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:38,409
this huge library of complex prompts. What are we

1003
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:39,449
gonna do with them now?

1004
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:41,329
We had a UI in front of it.

1005
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,139
The model was, you know,

1006
00:35:43,418 --> 00:35:45,579
if this then that if you're doing this

1007
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:46,909
post, choose this prompt,

1008
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,119
and then thank goodness MCP came around

1009
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,840
and that really opened up an opportunity to start

1010
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,599
having a dynamic library of prompts

1011
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:56,438
so the concept that we're looking at is

1012
00:35:56,898 --> 00:35:59,320
putting all your prompts into the MCP catalog.

1013
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,228
Being able to

1014
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:03,929
tell the server what you're wanting to do

1015
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,909
and it'll choose the prompts on the back end

1016
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,610
and you'll get a pretty deterministic

1017
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,668
output in terms of if you put in

1018
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,898
enough detail as to what each prompt does

1019
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,110
it'll go through and start choosing the right

1020
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:15,668
tools.

1021
00:36:17,148 --> 00:36:19,269
Salman did touch on, you know, MCP being

1022
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:21,599
the enabler for building these deterministic agents,

1023
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:23,829
and I think this, you know, this

1024
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:26,119
phased approach that we've taken with content assist

1025
00:36:26,469 --> 00:36:28,539
is taking us further down the road to full

1026
00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:30,699
autonomy. We're not there yet, but it's

1027
00:36:30,699 --> 00:36:31,989
getting you further down the road.

1028
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:35,329
When you first talking about started talking about LLMs

1029
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:35,989
and

1030
00:36:36,409 --> 00:36:38,510
MCP it was a little bit, it was hard for me

1031
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,530
to. Understand at

1032
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,639
first because the whole concept of an LLM being able to think

1033
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,219
like a human.

1034
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:46,039
So I'm gonna share a simple analogy that I

1035
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,969
um started through and

1036
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,449
it's a little experiment like you can do in cloud.

1037
00:36:50,648 --> 00:36:52,728
AI if you want to to kind of understand

1038
00:36:52,728 --> 00:36:54,809
the connection between LLM's

1039
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:56,309
tools and MCP.

1040
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:00,418
Everybody knows as you start moving to agentic

1041
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,668
is very goal oriented. You just wanna

1042
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:05,510
explain what your problem is and you want the LLM

1043
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,610
to solve it. So in this particular example

1044
00:37:08,148 --> 00:37:10,360
we wanna build an engaging social media marketing

1045
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,409
post for

1046
00:37:11,668 --> 00:37:12,878
a particular topic.

1047
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:14,628
So we start with giving it

1048
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:16,989
a list of tools and Salman and

1049
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:18,110
Dennis had talked about that.

1050
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:19,989
So in this case we have brand guidelines,

1051
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:21,369
content examples,

1052
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,309
social media post trends,

1053
00:37:23,668 --> 00:37:25,909
and also some random tools a hammer, a lawn mower,

1054
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:27,628
and of course an instant pot.

1055
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:30,809
So we provided this list of tools to the LLM.

1056
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:33,148
It knows what it wants to do, and we asked it which

1057
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:34,168
tools would you choose.

1058
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,059
So it actually goes through and tells me it's gonna take the guidelines,

1059
00:37:37,228 --> 00:37:38,898
examples, and the social media trends,

1060
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:40,250
and it'll actually tell me

1061
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,909
it threw out the hammer, lawn mower, and the instant pot.

1062
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,550
So now we know which tools it's selected.

1063
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:48,789
And then I'll ask it how are you gonna use these tools

1064
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:51,530
without any instructions, and it'll actually

1065
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,679
build me a step by step guide as to what it's

1066
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:56,099
gonna be doing. I didn't have to instruct it at all

1067
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:58,269
just based on its knowledge

1068
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,728
and its thinking capability, it

1069
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:02,958
told me step by step. I'm gonna start with the guidelines,

1070
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,090
look at the examples,

1071
00:38:04,688 --> 00:38:06,769
understand the trends, draft the post. It gave

1072
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:07,949
me a lot more details

1073
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:11,050
and review, rewrite, and presented

1074
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,070
back with reasoning.

1075
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,539
So with that said.

1076
00:38:14,938 --> 00:38:16,938
You can see how this starts forming your

1077
00:38:16,938 --> 00:38:18,938
next generation agentic workflow if

1078
00:38:18,938 --> 00:38:20,639
you can start kicking off more.

1079
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:23,489
Activities in the back end maybe you wanna

1080
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:25,610
create it maybe you wanna start emailing it to

1081
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:27,809
a distribution list maybe you wanna put it onto

1082
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:28,398
SharePoint,

1083
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:30,929
put it into a workflow you can start

1084
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:32,050
creating these um

1085
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:33,260
different steps

1086
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,648
and the beauty of using MCP is as

1087
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,219
you start adding more tools,

1088
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,648
let's say I start building a library of

1089
00:38:39,648 --> 00:38:41,840
um. How our social media posts

1090
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,958
have been performing and let's say I threw that into

1091
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:46,119
a simple SharePoint with descriptions on each

1092
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:46,648
post.

1093
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,079
I could actually have a tool does a

1094
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,269
standard rag approach,

1095
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,139
pull the latest details, what's been performing well,

1096
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,260
cats in the snow videos if that's trending well.

1097
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,639
I wanna pull that in as my good

1098
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,519
examples and I can start creating dynamic

1099
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,599
examples in my content creation

1100
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,760
process. So huge opportunities with MCP

1101
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,378
and like I said.

1102
00:39:07,128 --> 00:39:09,250
Building it modularly allows you to drop it

1103
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:09,789
in and

1104
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:12,139
maybe some other groups will be using

1105
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:14,579
those tools. LLM will decide and start exposing

1106
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,619
them similar to the concierge approach

1107
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:18,800
that Dennis said we're gonna have a lot of tools in there

1108
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:21,500
and we really want the concierge to help us

1109
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,619
understand which ones to use.

1110
00:39:22,938 --> 00:39:25,099
If you take the hotel example, if a new

1111
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:25,938
restaurant pops up,

1112
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,280
they sell pizza,

1113
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,978
they're gonna offer, hey, you know, Rob, there's a pizza shop

1114
00:39:29,978 --> 00:39:31,059
there you wanna go there.

1115
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:33,648
So we can just dynamically expose that

1116
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:35,929
and the LLM like a concierge will

1117
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:37,969
be able to um help help through

1118
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:40,000
things. Problem

1119
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,898
with coming on, um, a Thursday

1120
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,438
session is there's so much new releases

1121
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:45,789
on, um, at reinvent,

1122
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:48,219
so we kinda updated some of our slides

1123
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,219
for those that attended the, um,

1124
00:39:50,728 --> 00:39:52,800
uh, Swami session we talked about Agent Corp.

1125
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:55,199
You probably think there's a lot of opportunities

1126
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:57,309
in there in there for content assist,

1127
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,340
and definitely there is.

1128
00:39:58,668 --> 00:40:00,780
There's semantic search to help find the right

1129
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,458
tools,

1130
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,878
um, policy and evaluations to make

1131
00:40:03,878 --> 00:40:05,958
sure that you're choosing these agents that

1132
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:07,559
are working or doing a good job.

1133
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:10,039
And episodic memories was the one that's

1134
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,550
interesting. If something went,

1135
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:14,168
you know, off the rails in one quarter, let's

1136
00:40:14,168 --> 00:40:16,389
say you created these cat videos that really flopped.

1137
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,239
The episodic memories will allow us to when we

1138
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:21,280
start creating things it'll remind us that hey you know

1139
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,139
what, last year

1140
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,800
you had a good idea it failed, don't go

1141
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,918
there. So all those things that are coming

1142
00:40:26,918 --> 00:40:29,079
to Asian core is gonna be a huge I think as

1143
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:30,800
we move forward with uh content assist.

1144
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:33,829
So I talked about how all these things come together,

1145
00:40:34,168 --> 00:40:36,289
but there's a lot that happens in the back

1146
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:38,489
end and Walter's gonna talk about the

1147
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:40,610
technology and the architecture behind that.

1148
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,719
And there's a lot of steps, but

1149
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:44,219
I'll pass it off to Walter.

1150
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,090
Thanks.

1151
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,409
Thanks Dennis and Robert. That was, uh, for

1152
00:40:57,409 --> 00:40:59,119
that context. That was, that was great.

1153
00:40:59,378 --> 00:41:01,579
Um, so in this section, I'll, we'll do a deep dive

1154
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:04,139
into how we use AWS App Sync to accelerate

1155
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:04,918
our solution

1156
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,519
and reduce latency.

1157
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:10,269
We'll explore how real-time streaming transformed

1158
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:12,389
our user experience, turning long

1159
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:14,628
waits into interactive, transparent

1160
00:41:14,628 --> 00:41:15,389
progress updates.

1161
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,559
And then we'll walk through the architecture and key

1162
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,340
design decisions.

1163
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:22,369
My name is Walter Kurzatz. I'm a senior

1164
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:24,449
principal software engineer at SunLife.

1165
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,849
I led the engineering efforts behind our

1166
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:28,280
AppSync implementation,

1167
00:41:28,648 --> 00:41:30,780
working closely with our engineering teams to

1168
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,148
design and deliver a solution

1169
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:34,530
that met our robust enterprise

1170
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,090
requirements.

1171
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,699
Today, I'll show you how our architecture.

1172
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:42,219
Leverages ASync's managed graphQL service,

1173
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:44,949
private APIs, and real-time streaming

1174
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:46,128
to support complex,

1175
00:41:46,429 --> 00:41:47,809
long-running workflows.

1176
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:50,668
You'll see how we integrated AppSync with Amazon

1177
00:41:50,668 --> 00:41:52,708
Bedrock, Lambda, and our

1178
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,780
model context protocol server to

1179
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,809
orchestrate multi-step processes.

1180
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,929
So yeah, later on, Rob will walk you through the demo

1181
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:02,070
and we'll show you in our how our solution

1182
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,449
streams streams the progress updates

1183
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,590
in real time and instead of loading a

1184
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,659
spinner and uncertainty, you'll

1185
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,590
see updates as they actually occur.

1186
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,168
The complexity of Gen AI workflows

1187
00:42:15,168 --> 00:42:17,550
and lack of scalable streaming infrastructure

1188
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,668
were some of the hurdles that we had to overcome.

1189
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,639
As we advanced our Gen AI initiatives,

1190
00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:25,269
we encountered several significant challenges

1191
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:26,909
that shaped our approach,

1192
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:29,840
and as our use cases became more complex,

1193
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,128
the complexity of context increased

1194
00:42:32,128 --> 00:42:32,929
dramatically,

1195
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:35,489
requiring substantially more time to

1196
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:37,719
complete. As Rob

1197
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:39,918
mentioned, our second challenge was user

1198
00:42:39,918 --> 00:42:42,030
experience. Our users are accustomed to

1199
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,119
instant responses, and with

1200
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:46,429
complex reasoning and longer wait times,

1201
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:48,800
there was a real risk of users abandoning

1202
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,579
their sessions.

1203
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:53,429
So let's get started with the architecture overview,

1204
00:42:53,628 --> 00:42:55,708
and then I'll move into a demonstration so

1205
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:57,628
you can see AppSync streaming in action.

1206
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,070
So in this slide,

1207
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,769
I'll walk you through the key components and technologies

1208
00:43:03,769 --> 00:43:04,909
of our AppSync solution.

1209
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,148
Our UI was written in React

1210
00:43:09,148 --> 00:43:11,228
JS and we are leveraging the

1211
00:43:11,228 --> 00:43:12,070
Apollo,

1212
00:43:12,628 --> 00:43:15,030
uh, TypeScript client libraries

1213
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,539
to manage our graphQL subscriptions,

1214
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:19,449
queries, and mutations.

1215
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:26,228
Our net our networking and and hosting,

1216
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:28,878
we're we're leveraging OpenShift and

1217
00:43:28,878 --> 00:43:31,208
Kubernetes for container and orchestration

1218
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,239
management. In there we've

1219
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:35,250
implemented a secure gateway to access our

1220
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,369
lambda functions.

1221
00:43:36,728 --> 00:43:38,969
We've implemented Engine X to

1222
00:43:38,969 --> 00:43:40,969
act as our reverse proxy to manage

1223
00:43:40,969 --> 00:43:42,570
our web socket connections.

1224
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,969
And then finally we have our MCP server

1225
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:46,550
implemented as a container as well.

1226
00:43:48,938 --> 00:43:51,019
We also are leveraging AWS

1227
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:52,889
identity and access management.

1228
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:56,219
We have implemented a, uh, invoke

1229
00:43:56,219 --> 00:43:58,289
role to allow us to access App

1230
00:43:58,289 --> 00:43:58,949
syncs

1231
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:00,719
within our network account.

1232
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:03,628
And we are using STS to

1233
00:44:03,628 --> 00:44:05,708
actually do an assumed role in that network

1234
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:07,750
account which allows us to get temporary

1235
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,958
credentials to access the app sync

1236
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:13,110
itself. AWS

1237
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,679
Resource access manager,

1238
00:44:15,148 --> 00:44:17,269
as Solomon alluded to, we,

1239
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:18,849
we implemented that to enable

1240
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:21,409
cross-account resource sharing

1241
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:24,030
for ASync. Our A sync is implemented in

1242
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:26,309
two places our network or foundation

1243
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:28,458
account, also in our private, uh,

1244
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:29,269
workload account.

1245
00:44:31,489 --> 00:44:33,510
And of course AWS OPSync itself,

1246
00:44:33,728 --> 00:44:36,228
it's a fully managed graphQL service

1247
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,688
and for our solution we're leveraging it

1248
00:44:38,688 --> 00:44:40,030
for the real-time streaming.

1249
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:43,829
AWS lambda,

1250
00:44:44,188 --> 00:44:46,309
our serverless compute, we're leveraging

1251
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:47,148
it, um.

1252
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:49,978
To, to implement our, our, our backend

1253
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,179
approach, our backend strategy, so we have

1254
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:54,228
3 lambda functions. We have our API

1255
00:44:54,228 --> 00:44:54,918
lambda,

1256
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,760
which is we're using to do our assume role

1257
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,280
in our network account.

1258
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,719
Uh, we're using

1259
00:45:00,978 --> 00:45:03,099
a data source lambda, which acts

1260
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:05,519
as an intermediary processing our

1261
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:07,219
graphQL requests.

1262
00:45:07,769 --> 00:45:09,969
And then finally we have our lambda

1263
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:12,188
orchestrator, which is really putting it all together,

1264
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,349
connecting to

1265
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,889
SNS connecting to Bedrock, connecting

1266
00:45:15,889 --> 00:45:18,010
to AppSync, and of course it is also our

1267
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,708
MCP host and client.

1268
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:24,619
We have that we're using SNS for secured

1269
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:26,909
pub and sub notification. So in this case,

1270
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,320
our data source lambda is

1271
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,360
publishing to SNS and our

1272
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,760
lambda orchestrator

1273
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:34,539
is subscribing to that.

1274
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,309
We're leveraging AWS Bedrock

1275
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:41,329
for the LLM integration as well as the

1276
00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:43,110
streaming API which we're using

1277
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:45,409
to actually write back to sync our

1278
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,269
mutations.

1279
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,000
And then finally our model context protocol,

1280
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,579
which provide, which we're using to host

1281
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:55,139
our uh system prompts

1282
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:57,438
as well as our content scoring tools.

1283
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,478
So let's walk through step one.

1284
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,489
So in step one, the user, the UI

1285
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:11,389
sends a request through our secured gateway

1286
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:13,929
to the back end lambda to obtain temporary

1287
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:14,639
credentials.

1288
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:17,168
These credentials allow our UI to send

1289
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:19,668
requests to the shared app sync endpoint

1290
00:46:19,668 --> 00:46:20,688
in our network account.

1291
00:46:26,438 --> 00:46:28,969
The lambda function uses the AWSSTS

1292
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:31,128
to assume an IAM role

1293
00:46:31,269 --> 00:46:33,469
in the network account. The network account's

1294
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:35,110
IAM role then trusts this,

1295
00:46:35,628 --> 00:46:37,250
the lambda's execution role,

1296
00:46:37,668 --> 00:46:40,148
and grants the permissions to invoke sync.

1297
00:46:45,628 --> 00:46:46,889
Just as a note here,

1298
00:46:47,228 --> 00:46:49,369
um, we are using SIGV4

1299
00:46:49,469 --> 00:46:51,949
in the headers. This is required for APSync.

1300
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,648
AppSync uses this to authorize

1301
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,728
and authenticate.

1302
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:58,429
Um, at the time that we created this

1303
00:46:58,429 --> 00:46:58,978
solution,

1304
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:02,389
there was no other mechanism for authentication

1305
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:04,458
authorization, so we were left with

1306
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,168
using the SIGV4 headers.

1307
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,889
So when RUI connects to the sync,

1308
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:13,530
especially for real-time subscriptions via WebSocket,

1309
00:47:13,648 --> 00:47:15,918
it must sign the initial handshake shake

1310
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:18,168
using SIGV 4 headers, and this signature

1311
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,030
proves the request is authorized

1312
00:47:20,329 --> 00:47:22,489
using the temporary credentials obtained via

1313
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:23,228
the lambda

1314
00:47:23,489 --> 00:47:25,128
and cross-count role assumption.

1315
00:47:27,938 --> 00:47:30,079
The UI uses the Apollo library

1316
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,159
and step 2 uses the Apollo library to connect

1317
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:34,590
to AppSync and subscribe to events.

1318
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:37,219
It prepares the web socket connection signed

1319
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:38,639
with the SIGV4 headers,

1320
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:41,219
and that is passed as a query parameter

1321
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:42,619
in the webSocket URL.

1322
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:48,829
The web socket connection is established through

1323
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:50,389
our Engine X reverse proxy.

1324
00:47:50,929 --> 00:47:52,570
The reverse the reverse proxy

1325
00:47:53,059 --> 00:47:55,139
accepts our web socket upgrade request and

1326
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:57,349
then forwards the web socket connection to

1327
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:59,510
the app sync endpoint in our network account.

1328
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:04,110
The app sync network

1329
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:06,800
app sync in a network account then validates

1330
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,099
the SIGV4 signature,

1331
00:48:08,478 --> 00:48:10,559
the temporary credentials, and forwards the request

1332
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,519
to our private app sync instance.

1333
00:48:15,168 --> 00:48:17,648
AppSync establishes the the subscription

1334
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:19,929
and enables the streaming of the real-time

1335
00:48:19,929 --> 00:48:22,148
data to the client via the web socket

1336
00:48:22,148 --> 00:48:22,728
connection.

1337
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:25,570
And then finally,

1338
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:28,349
just a little note here, subscription and graphQL

1339
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:30,898
is a way for the client to receive real-time

1340
00:48:30,898 --> 00:48:33,329
updates from the server whenever certain events

1341
00:48:33,469 --> 00:48:34,849
or data changes occur.

1342
00:48:35,128 --> 00:48:37,349
So instead of repeatedly polling for a specific

1343
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:39,128
event or a data stream

1344
00:48:40,228 --> 00:48:42,309
and gets notified instantly when

1345
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:43,208
something happens.

1346
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,300
So in AWS

1347
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:50,079
apps in AWS app sync graphQL subscriptions

1348
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,280
are defined in your schema and

1349
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,099
typically use

1350
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:55,958
defined in your schema typically use a non-data source

1351
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,878
which allows you to execute custom logic

1352
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,398
or transformations without connecting to a

1353
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:01,918
back end.

1354
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:04,050
In a multi-account

1355
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:05,728
in a multi-account setup.

1356
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:09,228
The subscription requests are securely

1357
00:49:09,228 --> 00:49:11,269
forwarded to a private app sync

1358
00:49:11,269 --> 00:49:13,469
instance which processes events

1359
00:49:13,469 --> 00:49:15,590
and streams real-time updates back to the

1360
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,989
client over web sockets.

1361
00:49:17,918 --> 00:49:20,519
This approach enables instant event-driven

1362
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:22,668
feedback while keeping the backend

1363
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:23,719
resources protected.

1364
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,079
And step

1365
00:49:29,398 --> 00:49:31,679
step 2, do you oops, sorry.

1366
00:49:34,628 --> 00:49:35,199
OK.

1367
00:49:39,219 --> 00:49:40,320
And step 2,

1368
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,909
The UI uses the Apollo library

1369
00:49:44,409 --> 00:49:46,449
to connect to AppSync and subscribe

1370
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:48,849
to the events. It prepares the web socket connection.

1371
00:49:49,688 --> 00:49:50,918
Uh, sorry.

1372
00:49:56,478 --> 00:49:58,539
I think it was one of my slides got messed up here.

1373
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:03,128
I'll just skip to this next section here, so the user

1374
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:05,329
submits the graphQL query through

1375
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:07,010
the established web socket connection.

1376
00:50:09,869 --> 00:50:11,909
The request is routed through Engine X

1377
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,909
reverse proxy, and then forwards the

1378
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:14,969
request to the web socket.

1379
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:16,668
Topsync

1380
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:19,510
sync in the network account receives

1381
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:20,250
oh man.

1382
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:25,139
Oh yeah, OK.

1383
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:28,449
The app sync of the network account then receives the

1384
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:30,708
query, validates the SIGV4 signature

1385
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:32,809
and temporary credentials, and routes the

1386
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:35,510
request to the appropriate API and resolver.

1387
00:50:35,929 --> 00:50:38,090
In this case, the resolver is get

1388
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:38,929
content response.

1389
00:50:39,628 --> 00:50:40,659
The resolver

1390
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,280
transforms the graphQL query into

1391
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,539
a payload for the data source

1392
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:47,898
lambda, and then invokes the lambda

1393
00:50:47,898 --> 00:50:48,500
itself.

1394
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,199
The DS lambda, the data source lambda.

1395
00:50:51,989 --> 00:50:53,389
Receives the payload,

1396
00:50:53,909 --> 00:50:56,219
processes it, and publishes it to the SNS

1397
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,860
topic fire and forget.

1398
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:04,099
And finally, the LLM orchestrator

1399
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,958
lambda is is is is subscribed

1400
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:09,369
to that topic, and when triggered,

1401
00:51:09,478 --> 00:51:11,559
it receives the payload and invokes the

1402
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:13,478
bedrock LLM streaming API.

1403
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,800
And when triggered,

1404
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:20,760
And and the orchestrator lander then streams the

1405
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,039
tokens from the bedrock,

1406
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:24,438
from bedrock, buffering them and sending the

1407
00:51:24,438 --> 00:51:26,478
updates back to AppSync as they are

1408
00:51:26,478 --> 00:51:27,188
generated.

1409
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:28,760
So how does this happen?

1410
00:51:30,668 --> 00:51:32,969
The mutation send message is defined

1411
00:51:32,969 --> 00:51:34,199
in the A sync schema

1412
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:36,550
and is mapped to to use

1413
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:37,438
a resolver,

1414
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,030
which is again configured as a non-data

1415
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,148
source. The resolver acts

1416
00:51:42,148 --> 00:51:44,349
as a correlation ID mechanism to

1417
00:51:44,349 --> 00:51:47,010
ensure that the right client receives the mutation

1418
00:51:47,389 --> 00:51:49,469
before posting the response back to the

1419
00:51:49,469 --> 00:51:50,550
web socket connection.

1420
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,360
And finally, how does MCP fit into

1421
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,159
our solution?

1422
00:52:00,228 --> 00:52:02,269
The user requests the social media

1423
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:04,128
content providing basic context.

1424
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:09,030
LLM then the LLM connects

1425
00:52:09,139 --> 00:52:11,208
to the MCP server via server

1426
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:12,550
sent event transport.

1427
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,688
The server announces what's available,

1428
00:52:15,898 --> 00:52:18,500
what prompts are available, what tools are available.

1429
00:52:18,898 --> 00:52:20,898
The lambda orchestrator then requests

1430
00:52:20,898 --> 00:52:23,300
a system prompt which instructs the LLM

1431
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,340
to execute the scoring tool from a

1432
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,500
list of available tools after

1433
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,239
the content has actually been generated.

1434
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,019
The LLM, the LLM then generates

1435
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:34,378
the social media content based on the system

1436
00:52:34,378 --> 00:52:34,909
prompt,

1437
00:52:35,378 --> 00:52:37,539
and finally the LLM invokes the MCP

1438
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:39,539
scoring tool as instructed by the

1439
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:40,539
system prompt.

1440
00:52:40,978 --> 00:52:43,260
The lambda orchestrator streams the scoring

1441
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,550
results back to the UI.

1442
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,938
OK, so I think this next step we'll just

1443
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:52,148
walk through a bit of a demo,

1444
00:52:52,668 --> 00:52:53,708
seeing all this in action.

1445
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:57,648
All right, thanks Walter. So

1446
00:52:57,949 --> 00:52:58,929
now you've seen the

1447
00:52:59,668 --> 00:53:01,949
crazy technical portion in the back and I'm gonna show you the,

1448
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:04,269
the easy stuff that I look at the front end.

1449
00:53:04,739 --> 00:53:05,809
So for this demo

1450
00:53:06,188 --> 00:53:07,599
we talked about our fictional,

1451
00:53:07,909 --> 00:53:10,070
uh, cat videography company that offers premium

1452
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:11,728
cat photo and video creation service.

1453
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,840
We come to your cat. You don't have to bring the cat to us.

1454
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,389
So in this particular promotion we're launching

1455
00:53:17,389 --> 00:53:19,438
a new winter holiday photo pack for clients

1456
00:53:19,438 --> 00:53:21,679
with multiple cats, 15%

1457
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:23,030
off for each additional cat.

1458
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,228
It's a great gift idea for a cat loving,

1459
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:27,719
for that cat loving friend that's so hard to buy for.

1460
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:31,059
So this is content assist

1461
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:32,989
and I'm gonna try this thing.

1462
00:53:33,489 --> 00:53:35,489
The right hand screen is actually the one

1463
00:53:35,489 --> 00:53:37,728
that's gonna be showing the app sync streaming and

1464
00:53:37,728 --> 00:53:39,789
the left hand side is the uh

1465
00:53:39,789 --> 00:53:41,668
the legacy version that we had working.

1466
00:53:42,128 --> 00:53:43,349
So as you can see we've chosen

1467
00:53:43,728 --> 00:53:46,168
the menus, social media, generate

1468
00:53:46,168 --> 00:53:48,739
content we're targeting the US customers

1469
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:51,050
as well as we wanna do let's

1470
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:52,010
say Instagram,

1471
00:53:52,489 --> 00:53:53,300
kick it off,

1472
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,719
see the dancing dots and you'll see the app sync

1473
00:53:55,719 --> 00:53:58,269
version it starts streaming as soon as.

1474
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:01,148
You send it and then Bedrock starts creating

1475
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:03,489
the content and it starts generating

1476
00:54:03,489 --> 00:54:05,648
it. You'll see the other side start catching up

1477
00:54:05,648 --> 00:54:07,708
soon. And you'll see it

1478
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:09,579
does a post, it does the reasoning,

1479
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:12,409
and it's gonna keep going because in the

1480
00:54:12,989 --> 00:54:14,769
uh the new version we've actually

1481
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:17,050
have the scoring engine

1482
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:19,728
inside the MCP so it's actually decided to

1483
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:21,610
score the content at the end

1484
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:23,750
so you'll see it gives a whole category score,

1485
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:26,228
brand alignment, grammar, and these are all

1486
00:54:26,228 --> 00:54:28,389
different scoring mechanisms

1487
00:54:28,389 --> 00:54:30,429
that you can put in place depending on what kind

1488
00:54:30,429 --> 00:54:31,800
of content you're looking for.

1489
00:54:32,389 --> 00:54:33,168
So that's really.

1490
00:54:33,978 --> 00:54:36,019
Totally customizable depending on the content. If

1491
00:54:36,019 --> 00:54:37,829
you're writing, let's say technical content,

1492
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:40,409
you may wanna score differently in terms of, you know,

1493
00:54:40,699 --> 00:54:42,599
technical terms complexity

1494
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,978
so it's totally customizable like I

1495
00:54:44,978 --> 00:54:47,059
said before it all comes down to

1496
00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:49,360
the prompts and how you design them for your

1497
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,659
specific business units.

1498
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,699
Uh, some of these, you know, some of these lessons learned

1499
00:54:55,699 --> 00:54:56,260
from, you know,

1500
00:54:56,659 --> 00:54:58,659
going through consciousness. I know Walter.

1501
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,599
I come to you with a lot of

1502
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,059
crazy ideas and you seem to

1503
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,139
kind of bring the team together to actually solution

1504
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:06,878
them. Like if you were to look at

1505
00:55:07,219 --> 00:55:08,918
the lessons learned, what would you say was the

1506
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:10,119
biggest challenge

1507
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,559
that you had to deal with?

1508
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,659
So, well, I've, I've put a few bullet points in here,

1509
00:55:14,739 --> 00:55:16,840
but I would say leveraging ASync,

1510
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,369
uh, sort of connection pooling was a

1511
00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:21,378
was a big deal for us uh initially

1512
00:55:21,378 --> 00:55:22,619
we started using AppSync.

1513
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:25,239
It didn't really perform the way we thought it should,

1514
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,659
but then we realized it was really our implementation

1515
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:29,800
of it and how we were using it, so

1516
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,869
making those connections every single time, doing the

1517
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:32,739
handshakes

1518
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,510
where, you know, something that you had to leverage

1519
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:37,519
just a a pool for connection pools

1520
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:39,599
for that. So without doing that, doing all of that

1521
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,679
work up each and every time, that can

1522
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:42,619
be time consuming

1523
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,079
and always be open to new technologies like I

1524
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:47,010
talked about before, you know, we started,

1525
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,079
you know, deploying on.

1526
00:55:48,474 --> 00:55:50,554
Just doing our content creation within

1527
00:55:50,554 --> 00:55:52,635
our sunlight Fast tool then we

1528
00:55:52,635 --> 00:55:53,333
built a solution

1529
00:55:53,635 --> 00:55:55,864
deployed in a container. Now we're looking at gent

1530
00:55:55,864 --> 00:55:56,735
core and

1531
00:55:56,994 --> 00:55:59,063
who knows what's going to release next week. It seems to be

1532
00:55:59,063 --> 00:56:01,333
a new release from AWS every, every

1533
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:03,215
week, so build it modularly

1534
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:05,833
so you can move it around wherever you want. I think

1535
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:07,833
that's kind of one of the biggest lessons learned build something

1536
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:10,094
that's cohesive, solid that you can

1537
00:56:10,094 --> 00:56:11,543
deploy right?

1538
00:56:11,954 --> 00:56:13,853
But as you can see it was a huge.

1539
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,329
You know, architecture diagram, a lot of folks

1540
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:18,519
have to work on it we kind of pushed the limits on a lot of these

1541
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:20,789
different services and scenarios,

1542
00:56:21,289 --> 00:56:22,168
so as you can see.

1543
00:56:23,489 --> 00:56:25,329
These are a few folks that uh

1544
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:28,208
were key contributors in terms of designing

1545
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:28,860
the solution.

1546
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:31,688
Every part of those boxes, and when you show me that architecture

1547
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:32,869
box actually, Walter,

1548
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,469
as we went through the project meetings, I can kind of look at

1549
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:38,010
associating the names to each of these boxes, but

1550
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,869
when it all came together and actually

1551
00:56:40,449 --> 00:56:42,478
gave that streaming demo, that was, um, that was

1552
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:43,090
pretty amazing.

1553
00:56:44,728 --> 00:56:47,219
It's free. So

1554
00:56:47,219 --> 00:56:49,300
thank you everybody. I know thank you for staying for

1555
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,599
the the last session. We're standing between you

1556
00:56:51,898 --> 00:56:52,659
and um

1557
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:55,179
and the party, but we're gonna be around.

1558
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:56,699
I know we had a lot of content to cover.

1559
00:56:57,059 --> 00:56:59,300
We'll be around if you have any questions on, you know,

1560
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:01,619
whether it's MCP, A sync, content

1561
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:02,128
creation,

1562
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:03,260
uh, we'll be here.

1563
00:57:03,969 --> 00:57:06,159
Uh, please complete the survey in the mobile app.

1564
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:08,579
Don't leave any stars on the table. It's your last session. You

1565
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:09,378
can give us 5,

1566
00:57:10,418 --> 00:57:12,659
but, um, and enjoy, enjoy the party

1567
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:14,159
tonight. Hope you enjoyed it.

1568
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:15,059
Thank you.
