1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,950
- All right, thank you so much.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,110
I'm gonna begin with a statement.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,423
Agents are the new storefront,

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,510
so discovery is shifting.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,210
Thanks. Hold your applause please.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,250
Discovery is shifting to
GenAI-assisted agents.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,250
So in 20 minutes I'll show you
two modes of agentic commerce

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,500
and how AWS plus Stripe are
helping to make payments

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,340
instant and secure and trusted
in both of those modes.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,210
So really quick, let's jump
right in into a lightning talk,

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,860
and there we go.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,460
All right, so 30 seconds on Stripe.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,850
Stripe is a financial platform.

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,240
Think of us as the financial
infrastructure of the internet.

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,260
So basically we do a lot
more than just payments.

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,340
Consider us to be
programmatic money movement.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,790
So we like to think of ourselves
as the AWS of payments,

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,290
but we do a lot more than just payments.

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,730
So as you can see here,

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,770
we obviously accept money globally

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,360
in many different countries.

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,080
We can automate revenue with,
you know, recurring payments

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,160
with our billing product.

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,580
We can automate tax calculations,
reporting, and data.

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,490
We power lots of
marketplaces in the world,

26
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,870
from DoorDash, to Instacart,
to Lyft, many, many others.

27
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,080
And we actually have a lot
of banking as a service,

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,310
money management offerings such
as Stripe issuing, capital.

29
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,520
We're also very market
leading in stablecoins.

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,820
So think of us again as
programmatic money movement,

31
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,320
financial infrastructure

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,780
to solve use cases across the board.

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,140
We're very horizontal in
how we approach things.

34
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,520
And we're very proud of
our partnership with AWS.

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,520
So we have competencies in
everything you see here,

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,000
retail, media and entertainment,

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,950
travel and hospitality, insurance,

38
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,270
as well as focused on ISVs as a vertical.

39
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,850
And this partnership basically

40
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,590
really comes to fruition in life,

41
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,960
when you think about the amount of uptime

42
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,300
and availability that we drive

43
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,300
through both AWS' really
fantastic cloud infrastructure

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,730
and our very talented
engineering team at Stripe.

45
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,080
We drive five nines of
availability consistently.

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,600
We just completed Black
Friday, Cyber Monday,

47
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,560
moved I think close to $40 billion

48
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,300
and had six to seven
nines of availability.

49
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,660
So we're very proud of the
fact that the combination

50
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,950
of AWS plus stripe serves
4 million plus customers

51
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,833
in a very scalable, reliable way.

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,730
And these types of solutions

53
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,880
drive real revenue for customers.

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,780
So in adding Stripe's
optimized checkout suite,

55
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,650
we can generate on average close to 12%

56
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,680
of top-line revenue uplift.

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,350
That's a huge number when
you really think about it.

58
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,870
And we can modernize and optimize

59
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,710
and drive efficiency
through 30% faster launches

60
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,740
through Stripe's innovation in API layers,

61
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,900
in developer SDKs, toolkits,

62
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,690
we have some of the best
documentation in the industry,

63
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,100
and we have a unified API.

64
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,410
So we're very friendly to drive efficiency

65
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,410
through innovation through
our developer community.

66
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,600
And finally, reducing risk.

67
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,880
So we have many, many fraud data models

68
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,020
that I'll talk about,

69
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,730
that are powered by again, the combination

70
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,523
of Stripe engineering
and AWS infrastructure.

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,570
So earlier this year we launched

72
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,380
the world's first
payments foundation model.

73
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,180
It's trained on literally tens
of billions of key signals.

74
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,260
Think of it as using the
breadth of the global economy

75
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,540
to train an AI model.

76
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,700
So if you know anything about

77
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,770
vector databases or vector spacing,

78
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,340
it uses high-dimensional vector space

79
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,990
to quantify things like different clusters

80
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,330
and what these clusters
mean to each other.

81
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,090
So payments that share
similarities, for example,

82
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,180
that come from the same
country, or from the same card,

83
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,330
or that are positioned
closer geographically,

84
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,440
from the same bank,

85
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,510
we can cluster this information

86
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,860
and use it to be very predictive
in how we prevent fraud

87
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,050
and bring other solutions to market.

88
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,360
Payments from the same
email address, for example.

89
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,640
These are very important data points

90
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,550
to build into vector
spaces and to cluster.

91
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,760
So in using these solutions,

92
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,060
we've driven $1.4 trillion
of annual payment volume

93
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,833
last year in 2024.

94
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,700
92% of cards using this
payment foundation model

95
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,420
have been seen before.

96
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,490
So again, think of it as an AI model

97
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,520
that's just trained on
billions of data points.

98
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,920
So we can become very predictive

99
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,450
and actually look at a
transaction start to finish,

100
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,550
and instead of being reactive to it,

101
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,510
actually be proactive
in eliminating fraud.

102
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,430
So we've had millions of companies

103
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,253
that have leveraged these
products and solutions.

104
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,470
Now, this payments foundation
model drives the entire

105
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,880
end-to-end experience,

106
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,400
from the checkout, to authentication,

107
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,150
to fraud prevention with
radar, card testing,

108
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,800
all the way across the board,

109
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,510
refunds and disputes,

110
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,340
the payments foundation model is key

111
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,860
to delivering value end to end

112
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,080
in the entire payments lifecycle.

113
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,240
So some real-world statistics,

114
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,240
95% of card testing attacks
have been detected in real-time

115
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,310
using this payments foundation model.

116
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,970
21% improvement over prior methods.

117
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,540
Though again, very key that
we're instead of reacting,

118
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,360
we're being very proactive
using this foundations model

119
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,593
to prevent fraud.

120
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,140
Things like smart disputes.

121
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,570
So if you're ever gonna dispute a charge,

122
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,390
it could be 10 to 15, 20
pages of documentation

123
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,280
that you have to submit.

124
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,070
Smart disputes is a way
that we're using GenAI

125
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:08,610
to generate this paperwork,
generate everything,

126
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,300
submit it automatically,
automated end to end.

127
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,980
And so DoorDash implemented it

128
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,580
and had a 10% reduction
in chargeback costs,

129
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,590
which you can imagine for a
company the size of DoorDash,

130
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,680
this was a very significant
amount of revenue.

131
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,240
Vimeo and Squarespace,

132
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,020
13% increase in chargebacks recovered.

133
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,020
So again, automation and AI
can be used in every aspect

134
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,862
of end-to-end payments lifecycle,

135
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,012
including including
even fighting disputes.

136
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,230
So really quick to wrap up,
optimized checkout suite,

137
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,510
it boosts revenue by creating frictionless

138
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,790
checkout experiences for your customers.

139
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,170
We also have a one-click digital
wallet called Stripe Link.

140
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,650
You can go to link.com,
sign up for an account.

141
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,650
Basically think of this as a
phone-agnostic digital wallet.

142
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,690
It's not Apple Pay, it's Google Pay,

143
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,180
it competes with those from the standpoint

144
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,800
of what it delivers,

145
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,380
but it's available to you no
matter what device you use,

146
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,760
no matter what browser you use.

147
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,720
So Stripe Link is definitely
a one-click wallet

148
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,300
that powers a lot of
frictionless checkout experiences

149
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,133
for us.

150
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,040
So let's jump into the topic
at hand, agentic commerce.

151
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,240
So I promised you we'd talk about

152
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,530
two modes of agentic commerce.

153
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,920
There's actually three
models that exist today.

154
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,160
Business to agent, otherwise known as B2A,

155
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,700
agent to consumer, A2C, and then A to A.

156
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,040
I'll briefly touch on A to A,

157
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,260
because it is more of a future model.

158
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,140
Think of it as a world where
you've got an autonomous agent

159
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,550
from the buyer's perspective,

160
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,130
negotiating with an autonomous agent

161
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,720
on the seller's perspective.

162
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,660
And there's no human involved
at all in the checkout.

163
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,420
So you're basically having
an agent shop on your behalf.

164
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,060
The seller has an agent
representing them on behalf.

165
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,280
You're using policy engines and logic

166
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,200
to come to a conclusion.

167
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,200
That's a future use case
that we're working on.

168
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,820
But we have already launched
real live solutions today

169
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,770
in the first two use cases.

170
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,080
I'll start with business to agent,

171
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,230
and this is participating
in agentic channels.

172
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,930
So quick show of hands,

173
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,680
who here has used any AI
surface to try and buy something

174
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,430
or at least get a recommendation
to shop for something?

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,170
Wow! Okay.

176
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,440
So our stats show one out of four,

177
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,090
and that was more than half,

178
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,550
just roughly scanning the audience.

179
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,010
So very sophisticated audience here

180
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,140
that's used AI for shopping.

181
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,110
So the key thing that
we wanted to talk about

182
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,160
is that's one channel,
AI being the new search,

183
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,610
as I mentioned earlier, AI
being the new storefront.

184
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,560
And then we have AI-powered advisors,

185
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,510
which is agent to consumer.

186
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,710
We'll also talk about
that use case as well.

187
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,900
So business to agent,

188
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,610
what we're seeing is an emerging
ecosystem between buyers,

189
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,660
AI agents or orchestrators,
and merchants and businesses.

190
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,340
So businesses want their products

191
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,360
to be discoverable in
these AI chat surfaces.

192
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,270
And buyers want a frictionless, very safe,

193
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,740
secure checkout experience.

194
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,490
Basically payments is
the one layer of trust

195
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,850
that cannot be compromised
in agentic commerce.

196
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,400
Think about giving an agent
your bank account information

197
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,367
or your credit card and saying

198
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,790
"Go out and shop for something,"

199
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,350
that may not be the best idea, right?

200
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,150
So we wanna basically build something

201
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,050
that's fast, secure,
reliable, fraud-proof.

202
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,960
And so this is the ecosystem
that we're working with.

203
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,330
So we've partnered with
all the AI companies

204
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,760
that you see there in
the center of the screen.

205
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,700
And again, we're
laser-focused on making sure

206
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,350
that this new ecosystem,
this new way of purchasing

207
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,123
is safe, reliable, and secure.

208
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,440
So what have we launched?

209
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,440
We launched this in late
September at our US New York tour

210
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,930
it's called Agentic Commerce
Protocol, ACP for short.

211
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,500
And it's an open-standard

212
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,390
Apache-2 licensed community-driven,

213
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,900
can be used by any AI surface.

214
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,140
So we launched, we
co-authored it with OpenAI,

215
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,500
but it is available to be
used on Perplexity, Gemini,

216
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,810
Microsoft Copilot, X, Meta,

217
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,390
all the ones that you saw
on the previous slide.

218
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,110
And the way to think of it is,

219
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,670
the problem that we were trying
to solve by giving an agent

220
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,450
a virtualized debit card and
go out and complete a purchase,

221
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,730
is a very difficult problem.

222
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,050
So in the past we tried

223
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,540
using things like browser automation,

224
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,020
and what we realized is that
agents are not really very good

225
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,980
at trying to figure out a
human-readable checkout.

226
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,683
So agents are very probabilistic,

227
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,280
and you get different outcomes every time.

228
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,590
So it could go to the same human checkout

229
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,570
and figure it out in five seconds,

230
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,830
or go to that same human checkout

231
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,080
and take 10 minutes to figure it out.

232
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,650
So we launched an experience
similar to that with Perplexity

233
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,540
and we learned a lot and evolved,

234
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,190
and basically came back
to the drawing board

235
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,520
and said, "Okay, what we
need to do is make a way

236
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,390
of making these human-readable
checkouts machine-readable.

237
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,420
So we need to create an abstraction layer

238
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,420
and bring that human checkout to the agent

239
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,820
in a way that the agent
can be successful."

240
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,040
And what agents are really good at

241
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,830
are deterministic outcomes.

242
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,360
Agents can hit an API

243
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,510
and make a consistent API call every time.

244
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,840
So that's basically the thought model

245
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,880
around what we were trying to solve.

246
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,280
And so what we brought
to market is a protocol

247
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,510
that again makes a human-readable
checkout machine-readable.

248
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,990
And then if you wanna be
discoverable as a business

249
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,030
in these new machine-readable checkouts,

250
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,630
you have to make your product
catalog machine-readable,

251
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,480
and you have to feed your product catalog

252
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,500
straight to the agents.

253
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,980
So we have to publish
protocols, product feed specs,

254
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,570
delegated payment specs.

255
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,850
There's a lot of documentation
that I'll share with you

256
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,620
at the end of the presentation.

257
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,190
But that was basically what
we were trying to solve.

258
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,100
And I get a lot of questions about

259
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,280
what's the difference between AP2,

260
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,880
which Google launched
two weeks prior to ACP,

261
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,350
what are the differences?

262
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,770
And so basically AP2 is
a principles framework.

263
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,050
There's a lot of really good
thought leadership from Google

264
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,620
and a lot of partners that
went into developing AP2.

265
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,090
Stripe participated somewhat

266
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,400
at the beginning of those conversations.

267
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,100
But Stripe takes a little
bit of a different approach

268
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,770
in that we like to build things,

269
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,440
and we like to basically get
it launched out in the market.

270
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,230
We like to innovate with design partners

271
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,260
and launch something live, learn, iterate,

272
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,670
and evolve from that,

273
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,800
and then let the protocol mature

274
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,290
as it's being delivered out in the wild.

275
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:12,290
So we basically two weeks
after AP2, launched ACP

276
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,160
in co-authorship with OpenAI.

277
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,870
And part of the technology
that we had to solve for

278
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,180
was shared payment tokens.

279
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,290
And I'll talk a little bit about

280
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,210
shared payment tokens coming up.

281
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,260
But we are live today on Etsy,
and I'll show you an example.

282
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,600
And we're implementing
with Walmart and Shopify,

283
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,820
many other large big box retailers.

284
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,100
So this is a live solution
that we're talking about,

285
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,190
it's not a principles
framework, it is basically live,

286
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,200
and something that we launched.

287
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,443
So what is a shared payment token?

288
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,900
Think of an example of giving
an AI agent your credit card

289
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,810
and you say you wanna
buy a model airplane,

290
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,900
and it hallucinates and
tries to buy a real airplane

291
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,610
and drains your bank account.

292
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,890
So this is a scenario,
a nightmare scenario

293
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,250
that we do not wanna
embrace in agentic commerce.

294
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,430
So you have to have
something called guardrails,

295
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,770
which is basically a budgeted amount

296
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,530
that the agent cannot exceed.

297
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,700
So think of a shared payment
token as like a Russian doll

298
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,410
of layers of logic around a payment method

299
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,790
that's been tokenized.

300
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,550
So you've got your payment
method on file, Stripe Link

301
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,320
or like your Visa card.

302
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,537
And then you've clicked
on OpenAI ChatGPT saying,

303
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,867
"I wanna buy this model
airplane, it's $5."

304
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,660
And the shared payment token

305
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,850
is instantly minted at that point

306
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,610
and gives you a $5 budgeted amount,

307
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,470
and it cannot exceed that amount.

308
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,790
And also inside this logic
layer is fraud signal.

309
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,710
So if this card has been used previously

310
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,750
in card testing attacks,

311
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,060
we'll pass that signal to the merchant.

312
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,920
This is a very important
part of the protocol

313
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,640
is we have to make sure that
these extra layers of logic

314
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,733
are included as part of
the shared payment token.

315
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,280
So this is live today.

316
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,070
You can take out your phones
right now if you want to.

317
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,903
You can make history

318
00:15:08,903 --> 00:15:11,580
and be one of the world's
first agentic shoppers.

319
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,310
I've bought many things for my dog

320
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,960
as I do these demos on stage.

321
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,810
But it's very, like I
said, you can make history.

322
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,130
This is something you can basically

323
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,207
go into ChatGPT right now and say,

324
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:24,660
"Buy me some dog treats on Etsy."

325
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,850
You'll find some that say visit,

326
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,190
which means they have not adopted ACP,

327
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,670
but interestingly, you'll
find some that say buy.

328
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,110
So you can click on buy

329
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,920
and actually complete that
purchase inside the chat session

330
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,830
while never leaving that chat experience.

331
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,030
So the goal is OpenAI wants
you to stay in OpenAI,

332
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,760
get these hyper-personalized
recommendations.

333
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,890
It's gonna really get to
know your dog over time,

334
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,240
like what treats it likes,

335
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,180
what size, you know, costumes
it likes for Halloween.

336
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,830
All of the above.

337
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,750
Getting those hyper-personalized
recommendations

338
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,330
are what the GenAI agents are all about.

339
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,610
But we also wanna make this a safe, fast,

340
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,590
secure payment experience

341
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,780
that meets you at the
point of inspiration.

342
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,460
OpenAI was very clear with us

343
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,790
where they said we do not
want the user leaving the site

344
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,173
to complete the purchase.

345
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,690
So four minutes left, we're
gonna talk about mode two.

346
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,690
Mode two is AI stylists or what
we call agent two consumer.

347
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,360
So some retail brands
do not want to give up

348
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,360
all modes of discovery to
these external AI agents.

349
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,370
Not everybody wants to sell
things in ChatGPT, right?

350
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,700
Luxury brands, you know, hotels,

351
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,960
there's lots of use cases
for agent to consumer.

352
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,330
Some of these have already been launched

353
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,460
and are available out in the wild today,

354
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,490
you may have seen Amazon Rufus,

355
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,670
which is an onsite AI-powered assistant.

356
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,850
So again, you're using GenAI
to optimize the experience.

357
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,780
You're still getting

358
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,420
these hyper-personalized recommendations,

359
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,000
but you're just not using ChatGPT

360
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,220
or Perplexity as your front end portal.

361
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,823
You're actually going to an
onsite branded experience.

362
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,500
Walmart has Sparky, Ralph
Lauren just launched Ask Ralph.

363
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,440
You see I've got some nice
quotes there as far as like

364
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,260
where the industry is heading
for agent to consumer.

365
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,050
And the really important thing is Stripe,

366
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,300
we launched this at Stripe Sessions

367
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,040
earlier this year in May,

368
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,410
we have an onsite shopping advisor.

369
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,860
we have a reference architecture
that we've built with AWS

370
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,560
that allows any business to implement

371
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,580
their own Ask Ralph, or Sparky, or Rufus.

372
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,460
So we've worked with some major brands

373
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,610
in using AWS GenAI frontend.

374
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,850
Bedrock, trained very
well on knowledge bases,

375
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,970
product catalogs, guardrails.

376
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,260
So a lot of these AI agents

377
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,230
that have been released out in
the wild are not really good.

378
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,180
Rufus is really good, Sparky is good.

379
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,620
There's a few good ones.

380
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,140
We've got since we've built with Bedrock,

381
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,340
built in guardrails.

382
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,730
So you cannot make these
agents go off the rails

383
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,503
and do something unpredictable.

384
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,860
For the architects and
developers in the crowd,

385
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,140
this was my reference architecture

386
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,220
that I built for the AI stylist,

387
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,660
and you can see the Stripe
interaction is a clear API call.

388
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,860
So you don't have to use
shared payment tokens

389
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,870
if you're making a direct API call

390
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,060
from an onsite shopping assistant.

391
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,820
Stripe also has an MCP server.

392
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,730
So you can actually call
our MCP server directly,

393
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,590
generate what we call a payment link

394
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,840
to complete the transaction.

395
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,530
I've got Lambda functions that
we can talk about offline.

396
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,780
Meet me in the corner after the session

397
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,400
if you wanna talk about any of this.

398
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,170
But basically you can interact
directly with Stripe's API,

399
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,340
or our MCP server, or
our agentic commerce SDK,

400
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,760
to build out onsite payment experiences

401
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,030
that are powered directly at that level.

402
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:10,710
So with the last minute, I'll
open it up for any questions.

403
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,710
You can also scan the Q and A,
I'm sorry, the QR code here.

404
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,960
Main thing is you can go
directly to agenticcommerce.dev

405
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,797
and see the protocol that
we published with OpenAI.

406
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:27,810
We have a GitHub repo.

407
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,370
We're very encouraged

408
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,940
to make this an open community
developer-led experience.

409
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,473
We've realized that at Stripe,

410
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,740
we use this talking point a lot.

411
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,960
We haven't won yet. Okay?

412
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,310
We released thus protocol,

413
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,470
it's been very effective so far.

414
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,200
But there are so many more
use cases that we wanna talk

415
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,640
to our merchants about,

416
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,620
that we wanna work with
our developer community

417
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,460
to build this out

418
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,430
and make it more mature
and evolve over time.

419
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,900
So with that, I am 20
seconds away from being done.

420
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,763
Any five second questions?

421
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,090
All right, well, thank you so much.

422
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,740
I'll be hanging out after the show

423
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,040
if you have any questions.
