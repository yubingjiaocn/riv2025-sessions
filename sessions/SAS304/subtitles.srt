1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
- Alright. Hey, welcome to re:Invent.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,140
This is our first talk for re:Invent.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,570
Probably for a lot of you
is your first talk as well.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,530
Thank you for coming.

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,380
We really appreciate you
guys coming and your support.

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,187
Today's topic is gonna
be really interesting

7
00:00:12,187 --> 00:00:13,680
for many of you.

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,940
If you haven't been under a rock

9
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,310
for the last year, you've
heard something about GenAI,

10
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,230
you've heard something
about the agentic experience

11
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,540
that's creeping into
all of our landscapes.

12
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,170
For many of us, this means
taking the existing applications

13
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,780
we have and transforming them to be part

14
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,520
of the agentic revolution, right?

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,950
It's not enough to simply say, Hey,

16
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,330
we've got this existing application.

17
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,530
We're gonna just rewrite everything.

18
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,360
Most of us who live in the real world,

19
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,615
know we have to deal with all

20
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:39,960
of our applications and
everything that we we've built.

21
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,290
So today's topic, transforming from SaaS

22
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,680
to multi-tenant agentic
SaaS is really topical

23
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,240
for a lot of the people that I talk to.

24
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,670
The customers who talk
to me aren't interested

25
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,890
in just creating new things and toys.

26
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,840
They have applications,
they have customers,

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,010
and they wanna make these things

28
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,410
that they have work for their customers.

29
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,240
This is a 300 level talk.

30
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,280
So we are gonna set the
baseline a little bit

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,630
in terms of some of the basics.

32
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,910
We're gonna talk about the
SaaS fundamentals a little.

33
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,010
We're gonna talk about
some agentic fundamentals.

34
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,768
We're mostly gonna focus on
the transformation aspect

35
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:12,645
of how you take existing applications

36
00:01:12,645 --> 00:01:16,290
and build them into an
agentic SaaS application.

37
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,250
My name is Bill Tarr.

38
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,200
I'm a principal partner
solutions architect,

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,090
and I'm lucky enough to be
joined by Ranjith Raman,

40
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,403
also a principal partner
solutions architect.

41
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,270
Before I dive into this,
I wanna spend a tiny bit

42
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,940
of time telling you about
something else that's going on.

43
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,250
This year a couple of our
breakout talks are lucky enough

44
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,440
to be accompanied by a workshop.

45
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,780
So if you're someone who
likes to get hands on,

46
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,730
if you wanna get your
hands dirty, you like going

47
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,860
through a workshop
flow, feel free to come.

48
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,560
We actually have two sessions
Monday and Wednesday.

49
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,590
Now, they're both listed as
full on the catalog already,

50
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,690
but as you can see, not everybody shows

51
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,980
up for every session.

52
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,690
These workshops that we have

53
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,760
for SaaS are definitely
worth waiting in line for.

54
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,410
If you have the opportunity to go

55
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,300
and check them out, please do.

56
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,850
If you don't, don't stress.

57
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,500
One of the things I regret most

58
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,030
after every re:Invent is a lot

59
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,660
of people don't realize all
of our workshops are public.

60
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,000
If you see them here, you can go find them

61
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,230
in our workshop catalog.

62
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,240
If you don't reach out
to your account essay,

63
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,950
and they will help you walk
through these workshops

64
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,783
and find them.

65
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:16,320
They're great resources.

66
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,770
They're also generally
backed by GitHub repos.

67
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,240
You can usually find the code

68
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,790
that lives behind the
workshop as well, publicly.

69
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,880
So with that, let's move into
the content a little bit.

70
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,260
The SaaS value proposition.

71
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,570
I said I'd set the
table just a little bit.

72
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,790
If you've ever heard us
talk over the last six years

73
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,280
about SaaS, you've heard
a lot of these topics.

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,960
How do you scale an application?

75
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,210
What does it mean to be
efficient in building

76
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,800
and operating your solution?

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,000
How do you achieve the agility

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,970
to rapidly add innovation
for your customers?

79
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,310
And how do you let your
customers gain value out

80
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,050
of your software as quickly as possible

81
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,580
with frictionless onboarding?

82
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,500
And then getting into
the more technical side,

83
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,570
how do we deploy our SaaS applications?

84
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,210
What does it mean to have
isolation between our topics?

85
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,950
How do we do different price tiering

86
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,450
and then data partitioning even?

87
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,150
How do we take our data, our tenant data,

88
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,250
and separate it out from other tenant data

89
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,620
for cost and operational efficiency?

90
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,290
All of these are just the
general SaaS value propositions,

91
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,710
and most of, you're probably
familiar with them already.

92
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,770
Now, in this new world of agentic SaaS,

93
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,230
what we're seeing, and what
I think is gonna remain true,

94
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,140
and you'll see throughout
this talk, is all

95
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,320
of those SaaS value
propositions are inherited

96
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,000
by an agentic SaaS solution.

97
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,970
We don't absolve ourselves
from the responsibility

98
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,670
to do any of these other
things in agentic solution.

99
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,170
Yes, they're fast to build.

100
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,350
You can crank out an
agentic application quickly,

101
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,910
but it doesn't absolve us from having

102
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,920
to think about what it
means to deliver that,

103
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,017
that agent at scale
about how to operate it.

104
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:45,240
And so people aren't
constantly crunching buttons

105
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,770
and redoing the same tasks.

106
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,680
How do you create agility? How
do you do tenant isolation?

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,080
All of these topics are the foundation

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,280
of what we're gonna be talking about

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,660
in terms of agentic SaaS.

110
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,790
Now and into the near future as we start

111
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,190
to see more of these
agentic applications start

112
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,713
to reach production and actual customers.

113
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,980
What do we mean by Agentic AI?

114
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,370
Well, just in general, when
we're talking about agentic AI,

115
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,340
what we mean is a system that
has a high degree of autonomy

116
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,170
and the ability to make decisions.

117
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,497
But maybe the last part of
this, where we're actually

118
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:16,330
(chuckles)

119
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,310
saying what it's not highlighted
with minimal human insight

120
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,830
is what I'd like to highlight
and emphasize for you.

121
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,520
Because agentic solutions
have a lot of capabilities,

122
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,930
but they don't have the capability

123
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,680
to continually make decisions
on independently, especially

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,160
in highly valuable or
highly regulated industries.

125
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,587
Being able to make it easier
for humans to do a lot

126
00:04:37,587 --> 00:04:41,910
of the existing tasks is
really the cornerstone

127
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,260
of what I'd say is important

128
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,200
for a SaaS transformation
into agentic SaaS.

129
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,700
Taking off some of that heavy lifting

130
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,580
from your individual
operators and putting that

131
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,040
into agentic solution to
help make them more optimal.

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,160
That's when we're starting
to talk about agentic SaaS,

133
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,720
because we're talking about
injecting SaaS app agents

134
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,950
that do planning, building,

135
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,260
and operating, which are the same tasks

136
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,527
that humans do today in
operating a SaaS solution.

137
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:11,430
And agents behave
similarly, but not the same.

138
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,920
They have different usage patterns,

139
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,690
which unlocks new capabilities.

140
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,490
There are things that agents can do

141
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,010
that humans simply couldn't
have done operating a SaaS.

142
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,372
They can't sit there 24
hours monitoring the state

143
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,020
of your customer's application.

144
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,100
Agents can't. They can
replace outdated processes.

145
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,540
Oftentimes, we have lots

146
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,006
of humans mashing buttons
running reports over

147
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:36,270
and over again, or monitoring operations.

148
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,260
Those can be replaced or
enhanced by SaaS, SaaS agents.

149
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,450
And of course, just removing
the undifferentiated heavy

150
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,850
lifting of things that we
have to do repetitively,

151
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,413
like onboarding processes.

152
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,780
Now, when we talk about SaaS,
you've probably heard us say

153
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,990
before, SaaS is a business solution

154
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,910
that has technical implementations.

155
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,340
We always wanna start
from a business use case

156
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,980
and work backwards from
that into the tech.

157
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,160
So when we're thinking about SaaS agents,

158
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,710
or agentic SaaS, we wanna
start thinking about

159
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,180
that technical implementation

160
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,300
and what that means from
an agentic perspective.

161
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,660
For example, attracting new
customers is pretty much key

162
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,860
to any SaaS application.

163
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,390
If you're not attracting new customers,

164
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,180
you're probably not gonna
be particularly successful.

165
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,480
Maybe some of the ways we can
do agentic implementations

166
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,313
that might enhance

167
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:27,780
that business strategy,
it's model selection.

168
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,340
Could having different level of models

169
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,130
and different price points allow
us to differentiate product

170
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,540
for different types of customers.

171
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,125
So we can go up or down market in terms

172
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,020
of the offerings we're making.

173
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,730
Could we do different integrations?

174
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,730
So A2A agent, technology,
MCP model, context, protocol.

175
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,870
Both of these might be
familiar to already.

176
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,750
They're simply how we talk
to systems either remotely

177
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,830
or locally that allow us to
unlock additional capabilities.

178
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,000
Again, in SaaS, very few
SaaS applications are simply

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,080
a bunch of code.

180
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,640
They're a bunch of code that integrates

181
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,050
with third party providers.

182
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,850
Are you using Stripe as
your billing provider?

183
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,640
Are you using Datadog
for your observability?

184
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,530
All these different platforms are evolving

185
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,540
to have their own A2A and MCP stories.

186
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,820
Now, what does this mean
for attracting customers?

187
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,860
Again, it can give you some flexibility.

188
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,690
Can you integrate with different products

189
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,070
that you couldn't before?

190
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,750
Can that unlock different capabilities

191
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,210
for your customers,
perhaps in new industries,

192
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,260
which weren't inaccessible to you before?

193
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,340
And how do you retain customers?

194
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,760
Well, if you operated a SaaS, reliability

195
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,200
is the cornerstone of this.

196
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,460
If your system isn't reliable,

197
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,380
if they're having irregular experiences,

198
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,990
of course they're not gonna
be happy with your platform.

199
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,420
Can you actually do agent evaluation?

200
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,550
Can you do additional
testing to your platform

201
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,670
that you couldn't before
because of how AgentCore

202
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,460
and the different operations
it unlocks can do?

203
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,400
Could you actually enhance
your customer success story?

204
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,750
And this is one of the real stories

205
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,730
that we're hearing more
and more from customers, is

206
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,880
that the customer success teams
are increasingly using some

207
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,880
of these tools like
automation and user flows.

208
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,590
Not to eliminate the humans who know

209
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,330
what they're operating on,

210
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,310
but simply focusing them, bringing them

211
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,520
to the right tasks at the
right time to help customers

212
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,083
who have specific needs.

213
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,630
And easy discovery and onboarding.

214
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,160
This could mean all sorts of things,

215
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,550
but how you select frameworks
in terms of your agentic story

216
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,520
that make it easier for you
to rapidly onboard customers.

217
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,510
And of course, identity

218
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,390
and authorization has
always been a little bit

219
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,390
of a sticky widget in terms
of onboarding customers.

220
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,280
Can the agentic story reach out

221
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,980
and figure out how, what
those identity stories are

222
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,680
and help customers set them
up without human interaction?

223
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,120
All of these can be ways

224
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,830
that you can improve your SaaS business

225
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,813
by using agentic implementations.

226
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,250
Now, agentic SaaS comes in
a few different flavors.

227
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,440
And we are talking about
transformations today, right?

228
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,210
So sort of keep in the back of your mind.

229
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,460
There's gonna be lots of
talks about how you just write

230
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,920
a new SaaS, new application
in terms of an agent.

231
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,800
We are talking about
applications that exist today

232
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,420
and what it means to build them out.

233
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,833
So think about agent ready SaaS, right?

234
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,770
This would simply be, you know,

235
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,230
we can take a existing application,

236
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,270
we can wrap it in say MCP or A2A

237
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,700
and make this available
through new channels

238
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,100
for either existing or new customers.

239
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,510
And again, like we were talking about

240
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,177
with our own capabilities of
using third party software,

241
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:17,370
and third parties can
also use our software.

242
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,530
And this may unlock
different patterns for them

243
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,793
to consume our software.

244
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,760
Embedded agent SaaS, right?

245
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,010
And this is actually
having automated workflows

246
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,660
that come into our system.

247
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,360
So this is probably kind of
closest to what we think about

248
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,530
from most SaaS applications.

249
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,170
Can I just take agents, stick
'em somewhere in the workflows

250
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,880
that I have today.

251
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,890
Human facing agents, we're all kind

252
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,540
of familiar with this modality, right?

253
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,880
A chat bot or something that
actually lets you interface

254
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,400
with an application that before
you would've been clicking

255
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,410
through a bunch of buttons.

256
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,880
And agents facing agents.

257
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,230
This is sort of the new frontier

258
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,940
that we're all thinking
about and talking about.

259
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,460
Will there come a point where
an agent will simply talk

260
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,560
to an agent without any human in between?

261
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,540
Can two different third party software

262
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,610
that you're using can
Stripe talk to Datadog

263
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,443
and figure out, well,

264
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:02,550
like a particular
integration that you have

265
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,900
without you even needing
to tell it what to do?

266
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,560
This is kind of an interesting
one from a sort of a mindset

267
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,750
of what we're gonna be talking about next.

268
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,712
When we think about
existing transformations,

269
00:10:15,712 --> 00:10:18,990
transformations for existing
SaaS applications, I want you

270
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,140
to think in terms of layers
work your way downwards.

271
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,230
Most human interactions
and workflows happen

272
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,510
at the solutions API layer, right?

273
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,130
API UI layer.

274
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,720
Humans are interacting with these,

275
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,120
systems are being designed
to interact with these.

276
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,250
There's business logic and
there's data underneath.

277
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,600
But the easiest place to
inject agentic experiences

278
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,580
into existing applications is usually

279
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,783
at that front edge.

280
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,840
Model your human interactions.

281
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,760
Think about what those workflows are

282
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,790
and figure out how agents can
enhance those experiences,

283
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,670
either for your customers
or for your own operators.

284
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,380
And you're probably gonna be pretty happy

285
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,990
with the experience overall
because it's gonna enable you

286
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,410
to inject agentic
experiences non-invasively,

287
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,750
but still visibly to your
customers and operators,

288
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,880
and remove some of the
undifferentiated heavy lifting

289
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,920
that they're probably
already experiencing.

290
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,020
Don't ignore the data in
the business logic layer.

291
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,420
If you have opportunities
to inject the data agents

292
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,370
into there, yeah, please do.

293
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,320
But maybe focus on that front edge first

294
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,270
as you're thinking about
transforming your applications.

295
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,010
And I think you'll probably find a lot

296
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,043
of opportunities to inject
agents into that experience.

297
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,090
So which flavor of
agentic SaaS really fits

298
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,800
for my domain and customers?

299
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,960
Let's get a just a tad more technical.

300
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,700
Yes, I've been sort of
skimming along the top of this.

301
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,556
We haven't really even seen
a technical architecture.

302
00:11:34,556 --> 00:11:36,780
Let's start thinking about what it means

303
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,250
for agents in these.

304
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,890
Well, you can have an
agent as a product, right?

305
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,723
We already sort of said,

306
00:11:41,723 --> 00:11:43,590
Hey, you could simply have
an agentic experience.

307
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,323
We've already seen this.
ROS is a perfect example.

308
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:48,780
ROS, like Revenue Operating Systems,

309
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,980
agents, all the way down.

310
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,600
They built on agents, they run agents,

311
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,143
everything they do is agents.

312
00:11:53,143 --> 00:11:56,460
A really interesting
solution, very innovative,

313
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,200
but that's a brand new solution, right?

314
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,640
And we're thinking about transformation.

315
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,840
This may or may not be a fit

316
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,010
for how we're thinking about things

317
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,280
unless we have entirely new
work streams we want to develop.

318
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,830
On the other hand, this probably
resembles your architecture

319
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,850
a little bit more today.

320
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,840
You probably have a front end,

321
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,030
you've got an API, you
got some microservices,

322
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,160
some databases behind there, perhaps.

323
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,210
Maybe we can inject agents
into some existing workflows.

324
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,310
Maybe we can replace some microservices.

325
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,800
Maybe we can think about how
we can add new functionality,

326
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,590
which is really the easier
path to agentic solutions.

327
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,630
Can we take the existing
functionality we have

328
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,760
and enhance it with additional workflows

329
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,110
that involve agents?

330
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,110
Or can we simply, again, that,
you know, chat bot modality,

331
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,640
can't we stick agents in the front of this

332
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,920
and simply let them talk to the customer

333
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,010
and have our application
move behind a step

334
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,482
and have an API, MCP layer that talks

335
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:45,600
to that new modality.

336
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,780
But for today, we're gonna be
focusing on this middle one,

337
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,250
as I said, probably resembles your

338
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,110
architecture a little bit more, right?

339
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,300
This is closer to an
existing SaaS application

340
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,290
that we might recognize.

341
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,200
So that'll be the focus of
today's talk a little bit,

342
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,910
even though you'll see, I think some clues

343
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,520
that will help you in the
other directions as well.

344
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,720
Agent deployment models.

345
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,880
So just getting a little bit more specific

346
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,170
about what we mean here.

347
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,240
When we talk about agents

348
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,560
and we talk about SaaS,

349
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,790
you've probably heard us use the word

350
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,710
dedicated or siloed before.

351
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,690
This simply means in a SaaS term,

352
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,150
everybody gets their
own stack of software.

353
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,450
In a dig agentic term, guess
what? It means the same thing.

354
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,710
Everyone gets their own agent.

355
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,030
Everyone gets their own knowledge bases.

356
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,920
Everyone gets their
own tenant data stores.

357
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,060
All of the agentic parts

358
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,850
that make up the complete
architecture of an agent.

359
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,800
Everybody gets their own stack.

360
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,350
And compare this to shared
or pooled architectures

361
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,640
where in fact one agent is
operating from multiple tenants.

362
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,070
In this world, we have to
make different decisions

363
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,500
and they have to think
about who's operating on

364
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,760
that agent at any given time.

365
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,250
And again, our knowledge
bases, our data stores,

366
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,140
everything else could
be shared in this model.

367
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,840
But with that comes a little
bit of responsibility.

368
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,820
'Cause when agents meet multi-tenancy

369
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,680
and agentic SaaS, we now have

370
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,780
to think about how we're deploying them.

371
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,970
There are interesting aspects of agents

372
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,070
that are gonna push us a
little bit toward the limit

373
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,170
compared to where we were before.

374
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,420
There were already SaaS solutions.

375
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,323
You know, think about like Dremio

376
00:14:08,323 --> 00:14:10,530
or Datadog where a lot of the system ran

377
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,000
in the customer's account.

378
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,060
In agentic solutions, you'll
be challenged even more

379
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,240
to bring your agents closer
to your customer's data.

380
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,790
So those remote deployments
will be on the table

381
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,900
for a lot of solutions.

382
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,430
We have to sort of open
up our mind and think

383
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,130
about how we would operate
those types of solutions.

384
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,450
Those are still dedicated though, right?

385
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,760
If we're thinking about
those in terms of isolation,

386
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,140
if you deploy at your customer's account,

387
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,670
they're the only one who can access it.

388
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,830
Still a dedicated solution.

389
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,210
We'll spend a lot of time thinking

390
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,070
and talking about shared as always though.

391
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,170
What does it mean to
have a shared solution?

392
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,760
The biggest thing we're
adding to the slide

393
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,620
over the last one is tenant context.

394
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,390
And you are gonna hear us
dive into what it means

395
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,480
to do identity and tenant
context in AgentCore

396
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,340
and in agents in general.

397
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,310
Injecting that tenant context,
making sure it proliferates

398
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,620
through the whole agentic
system that we've created.

399
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,720
All the way from the front
end back to the data sources.

400
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,490
And back to the observability story

401
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,673
is really how you make
agentic stories multi-tenant.

402
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,750
So with that, yeah, with that,

403
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,700
we wanna think a little bit
about what the agent story is.

404
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,620
What is an agent even, right?

405
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,383
So if we think about agents holistically,

406
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,070
we wanna break it down into parts.

407
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,050
These are traditional parts.
None of this is new to us.

408
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,180
We have an agent that's your compute.

409
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,257
If you've ever written any
application, there was compute,

410
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:31,632
there's a compute behind
that is a prompt, right?

411
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:34,500
For a model, that's what makes it an agent

412
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,450
in a sort of pedantic model, right?

413
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,880
Okay, now it's an agent, it's got a model.

414
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,190
But really we have to think
about all these other parts.

415
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,023
What are the goals

416
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,680
or instructions that
we're passing into it?

417
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,240
What are the tools that has capabilities

418
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,890
for capabilities to do?

419
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,090
What is the context?

420
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,010
If you've worked with
any agentic solutions,

421
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,140
you realize there's a context
that's going conversation

422
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,670
to conversation that's going with it.

423
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,540
How do we store those?

424
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,940
How do we think about those
in terms of isolation?

425
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,260
That'll be what we're talking about.

426
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,170
And then the downstream thoughts.
What about observability?

427
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,430
What about the actions we can take

428
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,013
in the environments
that they take part on?

429
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,370
And with that, we're gonna start to get

430
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,830
into the agentic
transformation strategy, right?

431
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,260
And with that, we're gonna
hand it off to Ranjith

432
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,210
and he is gonna take you
through the next parts.

433
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,043
- Thanks Bill.

434
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,620
Alright, so Bill, set it up really nicely

435
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,180
by introducing why companies

436
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,860
and especially SaaS companies may have

437
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,650
to undergo an agent transformation, right?

438
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,680
So now what I will be doing
in this section is take you

439
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,070
through some practical
approaches in terms of

440
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,560
how do you navigate that
transformation, right?

441
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,570
And I'll also show you some examples

442
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,847
on how to build and
implement AI agents as part

443
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:43,953
of your SaaS application, right?

444
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,930
So what you're looking
at is a pretty simple

445
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,570
and a straightforward representation

446
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,210
of a CRM SaaS application, right?

447
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,760
So CRM stands for customer
relationship management, right?

448
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,683
And I assume this is a sales
management function within

449
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,050
a CRM app, right?

450
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,420
So there is lead management,
there is a creation

451
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,730
of opportunity or a task, right?

452
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,190
And what you see on the
top is a control plane,

453
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,250
which is very standard,
typical for any SaaS, right?

454
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,320
So you have services
like onboarding services

455
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,260
that sets up identity
billing metering, right?

456
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,420
So basically services that has sort

457
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,020
of this crosscutting concern
across the entire app, right?

458
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,472
And below that is the application plane,

459
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,110
which is where your tenant workloads

460
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,000
are actually running, right?

461
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,880
Now in terms of the request flow, right?

462
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,630
So you have a user coming in

463
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:31,560
through your front-end application, right?

464
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,420
CloudFront static assets are

465
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,720
from an Amazon S3 bucket, right?

466
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,170
The user gets authenticated

467
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,560
and the authenticated request flows

468
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,940
through API Gateway, right?

469
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,397
So pretty standard and
something that you would've done

470
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,040
or you would've seen, right?

471
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,250
And then there's JWT or a JSON web token

472
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,530
that's flowing around
the request chain, right?

473
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,340
And that jot tokens reaches
application plane services,

474
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,173
right?

475
00:17:57,173 --> 00:18:00,450
So pretty standard. Pretty
standard for a SaaS application.

476
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,670
You know, we are using Lambda,
you could use containers

477
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,350
for your application plane services,

478
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,060
that's totally fine, right?

479
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,163
But if you think about this,

480
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,670
there's typically some
kind of a user experience

481
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,060
or UI on top of this, you
know, experience, right?

482
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,650
So there is some kind of a form

483
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,230
where somebody's entering
the contact details

484
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,230
or somebody's entering the
opportunity or task details.

485
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,230
Right? Now, if I'm a SaaS
provider, I'm thinking, well,

486
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,080
that's a user workflow that
is ripe for disruption, right?

487
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,882
So that is something that
I could potentially move it

488
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:36,942
over to an AI agent and
have an AI agent handle

489
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:40,170
that manual sort of, you know, user entry

490
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,150
and that pull workflow, right?

491
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,010
So how do you go about doing

492
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,020
that is exactly what we
are gonna talk about,

493
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,621
or I'm gonna cover as part of, you know,

494
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:50,253
during the rest of the session.

495
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,800
So what we recommend is taking
a phased approach, right?

496
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,510
So when I say a phased approach, right?

497
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,610
So there are four phases here.

498
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,760
The first phase would be
your domain analysis, right?

499
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,220
So this is your domain
analysis and modeling,

500
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,580
and you know, this is where
you identify your domain,

501
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,581
your sub-domains, your bounded context,

502
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:14,433
and folks that have already
done domain driven design,

503
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:16,650
you'll be already familiar with this.

504
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,840
So it's about identifying
what your domains are,

505
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,700
what the objects within your domains are,

506
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,760
what are the boundaries,
you know, for those objects.

507
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,620
And then you orchestrate the flow

508
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,450
between those bounded contexts, right?

509
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,730
So that's essentially phase one.

510
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,192
And if you already have an
application, this is an exercise

511
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:33,396
that you've already done, right?

512
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:36,060
So this is something that
would've already done

513
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,700
and have, but if you have not done it,

514
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,550
we highly recommend doing that right?

515
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,450
Now, phase two is the agent
capability development.

516
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,570
So once you have done the
whole process of identifying

517
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,190
a domain, sub-domains,
bounded context, right?

518
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,390
So you would take those learnings

519
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,853
and start creating your
initial agent, right?

520
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,024
And you start mapping the
agent responsibilities

521
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:59,460
to those bounded context
that you have determined

522
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,963
or yeah, that you figured out

523
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:04,653
in the phase one of this process, right?

524
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,293
Phase three is the infrastructure,
which is super important.

525
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,610
And this is probably
where I'm gonna spend most

526
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,220
of my time on, is, you know,
you need the right kind

527
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,185
of infrastructure to, you
know, run your agents, right?

528
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:19,710
Something that's managed,
something that provides you

529
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,975
with the runtime identity

530
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:23,970
and access control,
memory management, right?

531
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,230
So all that is super important.

532
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,313
So that's picking the right
infrastructure is definitely

533
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:30,180
an important part of this process.

534
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,400
And finally, you know, phase
four is scaling and monitoring.

535
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,720
This is where you are monitoring
the agent performance,

536
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,969
coming up with scaling strategies, right?

537
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:41,311
And just like any application, right?

538
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:45,480
So this is critical as well
when you're going through

539
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,060
or undergoing an agentic
transformation, right?

540
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,360
So these are the four phases
and the phases is evolving,

541
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,500
like there could be other phases

542
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,990
or more phases that might come up, right?

543
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,666
But from what we observe,
from what we see, so this is

544
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,547
how we would recommend
approaching your transformation

545
00:21:01,547 --> 00:21:02,913
to agentic.

546
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,540
I'll quickly go through this again,

547
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,370
like I said, phase one is domain analysis.

548
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,800
So this is where you're
identifying the different domains

549
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,300
within your application, right?

550
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,170
So because our example
is a CRM SaaS app, right?

551
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,300
So there's a sales management domain than

552
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,530
objects within that domain, right?

553
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,100
There's customer support,
there's marketing automations,

554
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,170
and there could be more domains, right?

555
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,220
So there could be a payment domain

556
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,350
or account management, right?

557
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,183
So the first step

558
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:32,100
is really identifying
the different domains

559
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,720
and then you would orchestrate the flow

560
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,620
between those domains.

561
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,336
Like how are those
domains connected, right?

562
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,120
So this is classic, you
know, domain driven design

563
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,080
if you have done it
right, if you have gone

564
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,406
from a monolithic architecture
to a microservices

565
00:21:45,406 --> 00:21:47,430
or you know, sort of architecture, right?

566
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,920
So this is something that
you've already done, right?

567
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,340
So, and that's where we would
recommend to start the process

568
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,700
and then start with a
single domain, right?

569
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,440
So pick a domain, let's say you pick

570
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,420
the sales management domain, right?

571
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,006
And you start mapping the capabilities

572
00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:03,750
into the agent, right?

573
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,720
So you would add the customer
capability or the lead,

574
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,820
or the opportunity or the task.

575
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,880
And what you would see is
we have something called

576
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,360
the tools, I mean, which
are basically, APA calls

577
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,500
or your business logic.

578
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,790
So tools are a way, you know,
where your agent gets access

579
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,560
to external data or gets access

580
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,510
to certain capabilities, right?

581
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,949
So this is perhaps, you
know, some, you know,

582
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:29,340
a way you could start
the whole process, right?

583
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,515
So you'll start with a single agent

584
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,750
and start adding
capabilities into that agent.

585
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,903
But at some point you'll see that,

586
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:38,400
or notice that, you know, as you add, keep

587
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,400
on adding tools, it can
potentially overwhelm the LLM

588
00:22:43,557 --> 00:22:45,720
and the context of the LLM, right?

589
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,290
So when you send a prompt into
the LLM, it may not be able

590
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:53,010
to figure out which tool
to invoke or call, right?

591
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:58,010
So at some point you
may want to break it up

592
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,460
into multiple agents, right?

593
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,300
This again, goes back

594
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,279
to the whole domain driven concept, right?

595
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,510
Where you have separation
of concerns, right?

596
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,050
So you may not want one
agent to expose, you know,

597
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,720
whatever they're doing to
a different agent, right?

598
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,710
Or a different tool, right?

599
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,259
So you come up with, you
know, some kind of a boundary

600
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:19,413
and create separate agents, right?

601
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,250
Now, when you have separate
agents, you need some kind

602
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,320
of an orchestrator or a supervisor agent

603
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,870
that knows which agent
to call or which agent

604
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,600
to invoke when there is a
request coming in, right?

605
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,090
And the supervisor agent
is the one that would look

606
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,687
at the incoming prompt and
it knows which agent to call.

607
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:36,520
Right?

608
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,562
Now this process can get a
little bit complex, right?

609
00:23:44,562 --> 00:23:48,300
So you have the user request
coming in, you have it goes

610
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,070
to the supervisor agent, and then

611
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,980
the supervisor agent
determines which agent to call.

612
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,730
And if you look at the customer
agent, it has a local tool.

613
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,460
If you look at the lead agent,
it's calling an MCP server,

614
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,320
which has, you know, more tools, right?

615
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,730
And then there are some common tools

616
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,770
that the agent has to invoke.

617
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,961
Now add in an external tool call, right?

618
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:11,640
And also identity, this whole
process can get really heavy

619
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,320
and really complex, right?

620
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,285
And yeah, I mean, it gets complex

621
00:24:17,285 --> 00:24:21,360
because there is obviously
multi-agent collaboration,

622
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,550
you have to orchestrate
between those agents.

623
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,260
Like I said, you know, tools

624
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,180
and tool execution becomes
a challenge, right?

625
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,538
As your number of tools increases

626
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:31,290
and the context increases as well, right?

627
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,963
Now, there are some frameworks out there,

628
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:35,880
which I'm sure a lot of
you would've heard of

629
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,880
or even use like LangGraph,
LangChain, crewAI, strands

630
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,520
agents from Amazon that we
built and we open source, right?

631
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,900
So these are, you know,
perfect, you know, choices

632
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,540
because they give, you know,
these frameworks, they give you

633
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,720
that sort of prebuilt abstractions,
but you as a developer

634
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,700
or architect or engineer, you don't have

635
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,080
to do a lot of the heavy lifting.

636
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,760
The frameworks handle that for you, right?

637
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,370
It does that multi-age and
collaboration, it knows how

638
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,500
to orchestrate and all that, right?

639
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,000
But you know, oftentimes,

640
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,020
like we have seen developers,
they still face challenges.

641
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,450
They hit the sort of brick
wall when they're trying

642
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,300
to move their proof of
concept to production, right?

643
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,440
So they still find it challenging,

644
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,990
they still find it hard, right?

645
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,840
And now you add tenancy
into the mix, right?

646
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,890
So you have your agent,

647
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,950
you have multiple tenants
accessing the same agent, right?

648
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,490
Some tenants might be okay to
share a particular construct

649
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,680
like memory while others may not, right?

650
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,030
Because they're in an enterprise tier

651
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,600
or premium tier, you know,
customers or tenants, right?

652
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,190
And then the same goes with knowledge base

653
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,440
and tools like some might be okay to share

654
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,330
and they say, okay, like
it depends on the plan

655
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,580
or the tier that the
tenant is signing, right?

656
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,189
If they're in the basic tier,
it's going probably going

657
00:25:47,189 --> 00:25:50,370
to be share things are gonna
be shared or pooled, right?

658
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,230
But if you're a enterprise tier tenant,

659
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,370
you know, you may wanna
provide them better isolation,

660
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,440
better quality of service.

661
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,690
So things are going to
be more dedicated, right?

662
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,550
So when you add multi-tenancy or tenancy

663
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,853
into the mix, things get
even more complex right?

664
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,230
Now, throw in identity, right?

665
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,530
So you, you have your enterprise,
you have your employees,

666
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,110
you have, you know, batch
processes or some kind of

667
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,680
a process talking to the
agent, how does the agent know?

668
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,090
Is this the right source?

669
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:24,570
Like, can they allow that
request to come through, right?

670
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,618
Then you having your tenant users going

671
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,590
to the agents, right?

672
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,940
Agent calling other agents,

673
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,700
which calls external services.

674
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,580
Agent could call other
external agents, right?

675
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,150
So there are a lot of
considerations when it comes

676
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,240
to a security and identity
perspective, right?

677
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,820
Things like access control, authorization,

678
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,810
managing the lifecycle,
identity lifecycle, integrating

679
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,340
with third party applications, right?

680
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,710
And the whole governance
and compliance aspect

681
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,593
can get really complex
and challenging, right?

682
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,430
And that gets us into a phase three,

683
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,230
which is picking the right infrastructure

684
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,070
and picking the right place
to deploy your agents, right?

685
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,380
You need something that does
all the undifferentiated heavy

686
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,931
lifting of, you know, securely
running your AgentCore

687
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:12,420
and remembering past interactions, right?

688
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,820
The whole memory aspect of it, right?

689
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,100
Identity and access control agent tool use

690
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,572
where you execute complex
workflows, be able

691
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:22,371
to discover other agents
that are out there, right?

692
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:26,086
And also finally auditing
every single interactions

693
00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:29,073
that happening within that
whole sort of ecosystem, right?

694
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,410
And this is where AgentCore,

695
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,930
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore comes in.

696
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,760
So, which is a managed service

697
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,437
from AWS, which lets you
deploy and operate agents

698
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:43,710
in production, you know,
in a highly secure, safe

699
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,027
and a reliable manner.

700
00:27:45,027 --> 00:27:48,210
And as you see here, AgentCore has a lot

701
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,430
of services and components, right?

702
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,340
And I'm not going to go deep
into every single one of those,

703
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,004
but we are gonna focus on a few of them.

704
00:27:56,004 --> 00:27:58,250
And the first one is going
to be the runtime, right?

705
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,872
So AgentCore Runtime, think of it.

706
00:28:00,872 --> 00:28:02,960
So this is a compute, right?

707
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,000
So this is where your
agents are actually deployed

708
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,610
and this is where it's running, right?

709
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,443
And you can,

710
00:28:09,443 --> 00:28:12,542
like I said, you can build
your agent using any framework,

711
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:15,870
LangChain, graphs,
Strands, doesn't matter.

712
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,540
You can use any model
that's available right?

713
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,740
Through Bedrock.

714
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,100
You can develop that and
bring that and deploy that

715
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,610
into AgentCore Runtime and
it's just gonna work, right?

716
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,870
And then, you know, towards
the top, right? Yep.

717
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,690
Top right, you have the
AgentCore Gateway, right?

718
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,760
So this is where you want your agents

719
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,290
to discover other agents

720
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,260
or other tools, external, internal, right?

721
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,321
Perhaps you, there is a
business unit that have,

722
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,480
that has exposed their own agents, right?

723
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,610
Or tools, right? And you want your agent

724
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,380
that's running within
the runtime to access

725
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,970
that over MCP, right?

726
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,780
Which is, I'm sure a lot of
is a model context protocol.

727
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,540
AgentCore provides a really
nice abstraction, really nice

728
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,530
way to invoke or access
those external tools

729
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,970
or targets, right?

730
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,388
And we'll get into, you know,
how that whole thing works

731
00:29:05,388 --> 00:29:08,040
in a little bit here.

732
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,420
Then there is browser, which is

733
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,469
for browser, AgentCore Interpreter,

734
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:13,983
it gives you a sandbox for executing code.

735
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,109
Not gonna go super deep into those,

736
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:20,850
but AgentCore Identity is
central to this whole sort

737
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,250
of authentication and security experience.

738
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,561
So I'll definitely be covering that.

739
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:27,686
Then you have observability
and AgentCore memory, right?

740
00:29:27,686 --> 00:29:31,290
So like I said, AgentCore
provides a really nice way

741
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:35,610
to deploy and operate your
agents in a safe, secure,

742
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,383
and relatable manner, right?

743
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,180
Alright, so you're ready
to deploy your first agent

744
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,074
into AgentCore Runtime.

745
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:47,160
So what you're looking at
is, again, a really simple,

746
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,140
straightforward implementation
of an agent, right?

747
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,797
It's using the Strands SDK
and something to notice

748
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:58,200
is the decorator called
app entry point, right?

749
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,399
So app entry point is where

750
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,580
like when you invoke an agent,

751
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,070
that's where it's going to enter, right?

752
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,300
So that's the function

753
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,580
that'll get called the My Agent function.

754
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,444
Again, this is a Python representation.

755
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:13,492
You know, you could do the
same thing in other languages

756
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:16,507
as well, but Abdo entry point

757
00:30:16,507 --> 00:30:19,260
is where the request would enter.

758
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,210
And then if you want to take this agent,

759
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,670
so you have this running locally, you want

760
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,360
to take this and deploy
that into AgentCore.

761
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,950
All you need to do is, you know, come up

762
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,800
with a Docker file, package
up your dependencies.

763
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,740
And when you say Launch AgentCore launch,

764
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,480
it's going create an image and push that

765
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,790
to an ECR Elastic Container
Registry repository,

766
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,940
and then it'll pull down
into AgentCore Runtime

767
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,070
and it'll deploy that AgentCore, agent

768
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,840
into the AgentCore Runtime, right?

769
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,420
So you have your first CRM agent, right?

770
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,700
I mean, sort of the monolithic agent

771
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,378
that we saw a few slides ago deployed

772
00:30:52,378 --> 00:30:55,323
into AgentCore Runtime.

773
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,690
So now you may ask like, how
do I access this agent, right?

774
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,523
It's pretty straightforward, right?

775
00:31:01,523 --> 00:31:04,680
So all you have to do is
AgentCore Runtime exposes

776
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,170
an endpoint and you just do AHJDP request

777
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,429
and you're able to access

778
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:12,153
or invoke the agent using that endpoint.

779
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,550
Now, let's go back to the request flow

780
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,550
that we, you know, that
I started with, right?

781
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,798
So a tenant comes in, right?

782
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,930
The authenticated request flows in, right?

783
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,460
There's some kind of a JSON web token

784
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,940
or a jot that the IDP,
you know, provided, right?

785
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,890
So that flowing through the proxy,

786
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,696
and then from the proxy to the runtime,

787
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:38,670
you pass in the Jot
token or the JWT token,

788
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,710
and it should be the access token, right?

789
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,080
So when you call agent deployed

790
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,545
with an AgentCore Runtime,
you would use the access token

791
00:31:47,545 --> 00:31:50,520
from the proxy when you're
making that call, right?

792
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,338
And what AgentCore Runtime does is

793
00:31:52,338 --> 00:31:56,100
before it forwards the
request to an agent deployed,

794
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,310
it sends it to AgentCore
Identity, the other service

795
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,810
and AgentCore Identity would go back

796
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:04,962
and validate that request
with the Identity provider.

797
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:09,330
In this case it's Cognito
and it ensures it's a valid,

798
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,640
it's coming from a valid
source, it's a valid user,

799
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,294
valid identity before it sends a request

800
00:32:13,294 --> 00:32:16,710
to the agent that's deployed, right?

801
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,710
And I'll get into, you know, somewhat,

802
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,045
I'll go into the weeds
(chuckles) on this flow

803
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:25,893
in a little bit, or I
think it's right here.

804
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,783
So this is basically a refresher on OAuth,

805
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,843
which even today,

806
00:32:32,843 --> 00:32:34,770
I mean, I find it somewhat
difficult to understand.

807
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,450
So it's a quick sort of refresher.

808
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,360
So let's say you have a tenant user,

809
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,780
the user's browser connects
to the front end, right?

810
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,460
And the front end, right?

811
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,660
So you have the user sign in

812
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,270
and they make an authorization
request to an IDP, right?

813
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,019
In this case Cognito, then Cognito returns

814
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:55,410
an authorization grant code
back to the front end, right?

815
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,230
The front end comes back
with an authorization code,

816
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,690
comes back with the
Client_id client secret.

817
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,065
And then Cognito is like,
okay, I recognize this user,

818
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:06,188
I authenticate, so here are
the ID tokens, access tokens,

819
00:33:06,188 --> 00:33:08,640
and the refresh tokens, right?

820
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,790
And those tokens, it flows
around through the request chain

821
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,530
and it reaches the proxy lambda.

822
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,310
And the proxy Lambda uses one
of those tokens, which is,

823
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,290
like I said, the access token

824
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,162
to access the AgentCore Runtime.

825
00:33:22,162 --> 00:33:25,443
Okay? So now AgentCore Runtime,

826
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,190
before it sends the request
to the agent, it sends it

827
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,580
to AgentCore Identity,
validates the agent,

828
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,947
and then it returns what's called

829
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:36,780
a workload access token, right?

830
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,947
So this is a new
construct within AgentCore

831
00:33:38,947 --> 00:33:40,767
that we have introduced.

832
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:43,068
And this is opaque to you,

833
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:45,060
like you don't have to
do anything here, right?

834
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,830
So this is an additional layer of security

835
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,460
that AgentCore has introduced
with workload access token.

836
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,673
Right? Now, what is a
workload access token?

837
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,750
So when you deploy an agent
with an AgentCore Runtime,

838
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,820
every agent gets its own identity.

839
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,037
So we call it the agent identity or the,

840
00:34:01,037 --> 00:34:04,290
or an agent workload identity, right?

841
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,360
Then you have the incoming access token.

842
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,030
So a combination of the
incoming access token

843
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,180
and the agent identity is
a workload access token.

844
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,081
And this is not something you are doing

845
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:16,770
the service does it automatically, right?

846
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,900
So you don't have to worry
about, you know, creating

847
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,500
an workload access token, right?

848
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,290
Sort of a slightly
different representation

849
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,160
of the same thing, right?

850
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,870
So you have the agent
identity, incoming access token

851
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,680
request goes to AgentCore Identity, right?

852
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,160
It gets validated and then
AgentCore Identity creates

853
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,690
this workload access token.

854
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,210
And what happens with this token is

855
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,590
that any outbound communication
or you know, request

856
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,050
that the agent, the CRM agent makes,

857
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,220
it uses a workload access token
from this point on, right?

858
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,340
So if it's calling an MCP server,
if it's calling a gateway,

859
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,610
or if it's calling a tool, it
uses a workload access token

860
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,953
to, you know, as part
of that request chain.

861
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,030
Now, what happens when there
are multiple users, right?

862
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,190
Because we are talking
about a multi-tenant,

863
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,650
multi-user system, right?

864
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,020
If it can quickly go
through the flow, right?

865
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,670
So you have a tenant,
one user, they come in

866
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,840
with their access token,

867
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,970
they get their own workload
access token, right?

868
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,010
The same thing for tenant two user.

869
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,070
They come in with their
own access token, again,

870
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,260
they get their own workload
access token, right?

871
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,050
So, you know, security is sort of inbuilt,

872
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:28,914
the isolation is sort of inbuilt
as part of the AgentCore.

873
00:35:28,914 --> 00:35:32,823
And AgentCore Runtime provides
that by default, right?

874
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,400
And once you have the
access token, obviously

875
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,280
like I said, you can, the
agent is able to make any kind

876
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,463
of outbound authentication
calls that it has to make.

877
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,153
Let's look at some code hope that's okay.

878
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,503
Well, there's no going back
(chuckles) now, right? Right.

879
00:35:53,493 --> 00:35:54,326
So what you're looking

880
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:59,280
at is the proxy calling the
AgentCore Runtime, right?

881
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,740
So you have the access token, right?

882
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,320
Like I said a few times, right?

883
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,340
Step one is the URL to call
AgentCore Runtime, right?

884
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,190
So if you notice there's
an ARN or an escaped ARN.

885
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,300
So we have to escape RNA, the
RNA is the AWS resource name,

886
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,030
it has all the slashes and
all that right of the colons.

887
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,520
So you're escaping that,
and you would add that

888
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,325
as part of the URL in your calling.

889
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:24,150
So this represents basically

890
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,940
which agent you're calling
within the runtime, right?

891
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,820
If you have a supervisor
agent, the ARN is probably

892
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,920
for the most likely for
the supervisor agent

893
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,920
that's deployed, right, so that's a URL.

894
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,390
Then you would create the payload,

895
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,060
which has a prompt, right?

896
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,530
And then you add the payload

897
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,090
as part of AHJDP request, right?

898
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,610
So there's a history P
call that you're making

899
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,890
to the AgentCore Runtime.

900
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,140
You're passing the token, like
I've said a few times, right?

901
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,040
So it's passed as part of
the authorization header,

902
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,630
and finally they're adding the tenant ID

903
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,470
as part of the header.

904
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:59,190
So this would make sure that
Tenant_id flows through,

905
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,290
you know, across to the agent running

906
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:04,440
within the AgentCore Runtime
so that the agent is able

907
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,190
to take actions on the tenant, you know,

908
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,410
set up isolation policies and
all that good stuff, right?

909
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,780
So it's important to make
sure, you know, some kind

910
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,285
of a tenant identifier
is passed from the proxy

911
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:18,420
into the AgentCore or the agent running

912
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,190
within AgentCore, right?

913
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,110
So this is a calling side.

914
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,420
Now this is the agent
implementation, right?

915
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,560
So the receiving side, right?

916
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,320
So like I said, Abdo entry point by now,

917
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,430
it should be familiar to you, right?

918
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,500
So that's the entry point
into the agent when the

919
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,733
call comes in, right?

920
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:36,810
We are retrieving the tenant ID

921
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:39,063
that was passed in the
previous step, right?

922
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,980
Now, convert lead, convert lead is,

923
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,200
and I'll get into what
this particular tool is.

924
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,260
So it's a tool, it has business logic.

925
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,450
And if you remember where I
started off the presentation,

926
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,270
I said, you know, there are user workflows

927
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,770
that you want to automate, right?

928
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,140
So there are people entering
opportunities manually,

929
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,750
there are people filling up forms, right?

930
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,180
The goal or the idea here is

931
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,210
to have an AI agent automate
that for you, right?

932
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,770
You wanna have that business logic

933
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,720
because it's a, it's a, you know,

934
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,630
create read credit operation,
right, update lead operation.

935
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,640
You want that as part of an agent, right?

936
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,080
So that's what Convert Lead does.

937
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,430
And I'll show you, show you the code

938
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,200
for the Convert lead in my next slide.

939
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,440
But the idea is you have a
tool called Convert Lead,

940
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,080
you're providing that
tool to the agent, right?

941
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,270
So it has, so now this agent has access to

942
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,710
that particular tool, right?

943
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,970
And you can add more tools, right?

944
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,420
I mean, I mean obviously you
can see that it's an RNA.

945
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,440
If you have multiple tools,

946
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,450
you can just do a comma separated list

947
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,073
and provide that, right?

948
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:42,600
Bedrock model. It's a class
within the Strands SDK, right?

949
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,151
Which you provide the Model_id

950
00:38:45,151 --> 00:38:47,790
and some of the other parameters, right?

951
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,920
Agent comes from the Strands SDK.

952
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,740
Again, you provided the model
and also the system prompt.

953
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:56,247
And then finally, you know,
so that's a prompt, right?

954
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:59,070
And as part of the prompt, you
have to specify the tenant ID

955
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,300
to make sure it goes

956
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,340
to the right tenant and all that, right?

957
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,390
It operates on the right tenant.

958
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:07,350
So this is a snippet of
the agent implementation

959
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,613
or AgentCore, right?

960
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,350
Now the tool code, right?

961
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,910
So I talked about the convert lead, right?

962
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,660
So you start with the actor
tool decorator, again,

963
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,090
it comes from the Strands SDK, right?

964
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,740
And you make sure there's
a tenant ID, right?

965
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,420
If you don't have, have a tenant ID

966
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,532
or see a tenant ID, you, you know,

967
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:29,010
you kick back the request, right?

968
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,720
But if you do have a tenant id,

969
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,020
then you do the credit
operations for step three

970
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,390
is basically where you're
getting the opportunities stable

971
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,220
or the task stable, right?

972
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,460
And step four is where
you're, you know, updating,

973
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,400
or in this case it's creating
a new upgrade, right?

974
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,510
So, you know, you can
see that we have sort

975
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,738
of taken the user workflows, right?

976
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:52,650
Where someone was entering the form

977
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,930
and we have moved that
into an agent, right?

978
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,440
To a tool and we have provided this tool

979
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,760
to the agent, right?

980
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,710
So we have transformed
that experience, right?

981
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,110
Again, sort of a simplistic
or a simple example,

982
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,510
but you get the idea, right?

983
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,820
Okay, so up until now we have been focused

984
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,000
on the agent deployed within
the AgentCore Runtime.

985
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,710
It had access to some tools, right?

986
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,750
So we talked about the convert lead tool,

987
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,460
it could have access
to other tools, right?

988
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,590
Like you see here, that's totally fine,

989
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,170
but there are cases where, you know,

990
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,630
when you want your agent
to access other tools

991
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,570
or other targets that ex
it could be external that,

992
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,860
you know, third parties have exposed

993
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,020
or perhaps a different
business unit within your

994
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,190
company as exposed, right?

995
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,740
So you want your agent
to have access to that

996
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,970
and that is enabled

997
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,450
or achieved using the
AgentCore Gateway, right?

998
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:45,015
If I mean, like I said,
AgentCore Gateway provides a way

999
00:40:45,015 --> 00:40:50,015
to discover new tools and
integrate with new targets.

1000
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,060
Now, what are some of the targets

1001
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,510
that AgentCore Gateway supports, right?

1002
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,520
You can have an API Gateway Target, right?

1003
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,880
So any APIs that you
expose, you know, as part

1004
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,750
of a API Gateway, the agent
now has access to that.

1005
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,697
OpenAPI Target, right?

1006
00:41:04,697 --> 00:41:06,840
So you can have a Lambda Target, right?

1007
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,900
So if you have a Lambda
function, you know,

1008
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,530
AgentCore Gateway, can
MCPFI that Lambda function

1009
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,360
and provide that to the agent, right?

1010
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,649
So the idea is your CRM agent
deployed within runtime has

1011
00:41:18,649 --> 00:41:21,090
more intelligence, right?

1012
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,730
By having access to these
additional tools, right?

1013
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,310
So you can have an MCP
server Target as well, right?

1014
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,580
So the gateway provides a
really nice way, you know,

1015
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,130
it provides an abstraction where
it's able to provide access

1016
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,810
to multiple tools and provide that

1017
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,860
to the agent running within the run time.

1018
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,020
Now there's an arrow
coming from, you know,

1019
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,450
or going from AgentCore
Gateway to identity, right?

1020
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,250
So again, security

1021
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,320
and identity is sort
of first class citizen

1022
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,090
or construct in this whole experience.

1023
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,200
So any request coming
into AgentCore Gateway has

1024
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,620
to be authenticated, you
know, so the agent has

1025
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,140
to send an access token
into the gateway, right?

1026
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,090
And that token gets authenticated

1027
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,730
or validated using Cognito.

1028
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:06,720
And then that's how Gateway
would process that request.

1029
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,950
If it doesn't find an access token,

1030
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,900
it wouldn't process the request, right?

1031
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,550
So this is the gateway
implementation, right?

1032
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,280
So the code, now you have the CRM agent

1033
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,500
with running within your runtime, right?

1034
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,650
It is trying to access the gateway, right?

1035
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,930
The first thing that it needs
is the Gateway_id, right?

1036
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,670
So you would have the gateway deployed,

1037
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,200
you get the Gateway_id, right?

1038
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,900
In this case it's stored in a SSM

1039
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,070
in a parameter store, right?

1040
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,819
Systems manager parameter
store, you get the Gateway_id,

1041
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:37,200
add that as part of the URL.

1042
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,700
Like I said, you need the access token

1043
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,650
to access the gateway as well.

1044
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,410
Like, just like you need an
access token to access runtime,

1045
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,870
you need an access token
to access gateway as well.

1046
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:49,212
So you get the access
token, you can see that

1047
00:42:49,212 --> 00:42:51,390
there is an a requires_access_token.

1048
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,940
So that comes from the Strands SDK.

1049
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,360
So you don't have to do a lot
of wiring or heavy lifting.

1050
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,926
You get the access token
using that decorator.

1051
00:42:59,926 --> 00:43:03,480
If you just add that as part
of your Python implementation.

1052
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,840
And something to take a
note is the auth flow,

1053
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,920
it's M2M, right?

1054
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,500
So M2M stands for machine to machine

1055
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,140
because you have an agent
calling another agent, right?

1056
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,680
So it's different from
the earlier auth flow

1057
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,170
because that, that was from
web to an agent, right?

1058
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,980
So this is that is an
authorization code grand flow.

1059
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,180
So this is a machine
to machine flow, right?

1060
00:43:26,377 --> 00:43:29,040
And then once we have that, see

1061
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,830
that we are using MCPClient,
MCPClient, it's part

1062
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,600
of the Strands SDK, right?

1063
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,360
And then you use streamable HCDP client

1064
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,860
and passing the token.

1065
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,960
And then number seven is important, right?

1066
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,396
Because this is slightly different

1067
00:43:41,396 --> 00:43:43,770
from the earlier implementation, right?

1068
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,840
You still have the convert lead tool,

1069
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,660
but you're giving your agent
access to other tools, right?

1070
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,540
That's coming from the gateway now, right?

1071
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:55,765
So you're listing the tools,
there is also a semantic search

1072
00:43:55,765 --> 00:43:58,407
or a semantic, you know, so
you could use that as well,

1073
00:43:58,407 --> 00:44:01,140
but you're listing the tools
that sitting behind the gateway

1074
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,200
and you're providing that to
the agent in this case, right?

1075
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,265
So the agent has more intelligence,
has access to more tools

1076
00:44:07,265 --> 00:44:09,063
to take a decision, right?

1077
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:14,880
Alright, alright, so this
is a really nice feature

1078
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,873
that this literally came, or
I wanna say last week, right?

1079
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:23,460
So the request coming into
the gateway, you're now able

1080
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,150
to examine it, inspect it,
or intercept it, right?

1081
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:30,000
And you're able to add
things to the header, right?

1082
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,187
So this is, especially
if you wanna, you know,

1083
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:34,890
and you can attach a
Lambda function to it.

1084
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,930
If you worked with API
Gateway, this is very similar

1085
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:39,360
to the Lambda authorizer that
you attach to an API Gateway.

1086
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,130
So same concept, right?

1087
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,210
And so, you know, this will
be helpful if you wanna

1088
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,600
inject some tenant specific
values or variables

1089
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,810
before the request goes
to the downstream targets

1090
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:52,917
or downstream systems, right?

1091
00:44:52,917 --> 00:44:56,202
And the same thing, when
the response comes back from

1092
00:44:56,202 --> 00:45:00,480
the downstream systems, you
can have a lambda interceptor

1093
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,170
process the response and
send it back, you know,

1094
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,003
process the response
before it gets sent back

1095
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,560
to the caller, right?

1096
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,400
You can inject more, you
know, values, tenant specific

1097
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,950
and whatnot as part of the
response as well, right?

1098
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:19,173
Oh, I'm sorry, I can go back.

1099
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,420
Okay, so this is basically a summary

1100
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,190
of the end-to-end
authentication flow, right?

1101
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,590
So you have the user, you have users

1102
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,930
that wants to access agent, right?

1103
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,190
So we talked about this at length, right?

1104
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:39,030
They get authenticated, AgentCore Runtime,

1105
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,070
there's an inbound auth right?

1106
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,740
Now, AgentCore Runtime Gateway, right?

1107
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,780
There is an outbound
auth which uses OAuth,

1108
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,080
but you can also use IAM
outbound authentication

1109
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,670
if your agent wants to
access AWS resources, right?

1110
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,970
Like a, you know, your agent
wants to access DynamoDB

1111
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,223
or any AWS resource it,

1112
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:03,570
you can use IAM outbound auth as well.

1113
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,940
And the call to the gateway,
you know, like I said

1114
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,680
before, you can use OAuth

1115
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,470
and then even Gateway, if you
see there is an inbound auth,

1116
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,850
there is also an outbound auth going

1117
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,090
for the calls, going from
the gateway to other external

1118
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:19,650
or third party services, right?

1119
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,270
So Gateway has both inbound

1120
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,093
and as well as outbound oath as well.

1121
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,373
Okay? So up until now we have
looked at, you know, something

1122
00:46:30,373 --> 00:46:35,103
where you had a single
runtime, single gateway, right?

1123
00:46:36,328 --> 00:46:37,587
And a few tools,

1124
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:40,020
but there could be
situations where you have,

1125
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,480
because typically in SaaS
you have customers that are

1126
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,280
of different shapes

1127
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,410
and sizes, like they
have requirements, right?

1128
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:47,880
So you could have someone
in the basic tier,

1129
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,070
you could have someone in
the premium tier, right?

1130
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:54,870
So you could absolutely create
a dedicated runtime gateway

1131
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,040
for your premium tier customers.

1132
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,227
It would look something like this, right?

1133
00:46:58,227 --> 00:47:00,932
But it's still important
to maintain, you know,

1134
00:47:00,932 --> 00:47:02,760
have some kind of an identity, right?

1135
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,590
So you would have AgentCore Identity

1136
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,140
and what you can do as part
of your identity provider

1137
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:12,000
is create separate application IDs, right?

1138
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,140
So client applications, right?

1139
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,560
So for example, you could create
a basic client application

1140
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,600
for your basic tier customers

1141
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,827
and for a premium tier customers,

1142
00:47:19,827 --> 00:47:23,340
you can create their own
application IDs, right?

1143
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,800
And that's how AgentCore Identity would

1144
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,300
recognize the request coming in.

1145
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,930
If it's coming from a premium,
you know, to your customer,

1146
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,259
it would go authenticated
against a premium

1147
00:47:33,259 --> 00:47:34,770
application id, right?

1148
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,103
You get the idea, right? So if,
if there are more enterprise

1149
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:40,919
to your customers, you can,
you know, achieve isolation

1150
00:47:40,919 --> 00:47:43,743
by creating their own
application IDs, right?

1151
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,170
Finally, there is a
session isolation built in

1152
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:52,545
because every agent session
that gets created, it,

1153
00:47:52,545 --> 00:47:55,650
it gets created in its own MicroVM.

1154
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:58,561
And we use the firecracker technology

1155
00:47:58,561 --> 00:48:00,930
that AWS invented, right?

1156
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:04,710
So every session runs in a
completely isolated MicroVM.

1157
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,050
It has its own memory,
it has its own compute,

1158
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,540
it has its own file system, right?

1159
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,810
Because if without that session isolation,

1160
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,970
there is a possibility that local files

1161
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:18,090
and state could be accessed can bleed over

1162
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,560
and potentially be exposed.

1163
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:24,560
So every agent session, it's
created within its own MicroVM.

1164
00:48:27,265 --> 00:48:28,950
And this is the final
thing before I hand it over

1165
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,170
to Bill, AgentCore memory, right?

1166
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:33,840
So super important
within an agentic system,

1167
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,550
because you want the agent

1168
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:39,240
to retrieve past interactions
that you had with it, right?

1169
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,123
So an AgentCore memory, it's a service

1170
00:48:41,123 --> 00:48:44,940
within agent Bedrock AgentCore,
it has a short term memory

1171
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:45,830
and a long-term memory, right?

1172
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:49,590
So short term memory is where
the interactions are stored

1173
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,993
within a single session, right?

1174
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:55,290
Yeah. So that's what
short term memory is like.

1175
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:58,140
It stores all the past interactions
within a single session.

1176
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,940
And the long-term memory is,

1177
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,710
it spans across sessions, right?

1178
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:04,983
So it stores interactions
across multiple sessions.

1179
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:11,600
Now, in terms of isolation
with AgentCore memory,

1180
00:49:12,056 --> 00:49:14,760
AgentCore memory provides
some really nice features.

1181
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,980
So you can have like session tags.

1182
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,180
So there is something called

1183
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,190
for short term memory, there's
something called actorid.

1184
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,110
So you can dedicate certain tenant

1185
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:24,120
and users their own actorids, right?

1186
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,710
And long term memory,

1187
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,510
you can create their own namespace, right?

1188
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,420
And the way you would access
that from your front end

1189
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,800
or from your agent is you
extract the tenant_id, you know,

1190
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,660
like we saw from the incoming,
token, you would map that

1191
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:40,980
to an IAM session tag, right?

1192
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,690
So this is something, you know,

1193
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:44,040
you may have already done, right?

1194
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,500
So you, you create an IAM policy for

1195
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,820
with placeholders, right?

1196
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,805
And then you use the tenant
IDs, update that, right?

1197
00:49:50,805 --> 00:49:52,690
And then you assume that role

1198
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:57,784
and then you can use the
STS the token service

1199
00:49:57,784 --> 00:50:00,750
to get temporary credentials
that's specific for

1200
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:04,200
that tenant, right, that
made the request, right?

1201
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,440
So now, now you have tenant
scoped credentials using which

1202
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,536
you can access the
specific, you know, part

1203
00:50:10,536 --> 00:50:13,320
of region within the
memory, short-term memory

1204
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,330
or the long-term memory, right?

1205
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:18,834
So really nice way to
achieve, you know, isolation

1206
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:21,303
when you're using AgentCore memory, right?

1207
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,386
Alright, so I think I've covered a lot

1208
00:50:26,386 --> 00:50:28,920
of things here to talk about phase four,

1209
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,790
which is the final phase.

1210
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:32,880
I'll hand it over to Bill. Yep.

1211
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,030
- Thank you Ranjith. So we've
covered a lot of ground.

1212
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,470
We've covered three phases already.

1213
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,930
The last one, and hopefully
the one you didn't

1214
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,400
forget is observability.

1215
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,710
'Cause when we talk to SaaS
customers, when we're talking

1216
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,750
to customers with the
existing SaaS products,

1217
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,537
often people don't spend quite
enough time thinking about

1218
00:50:48,537 --> 00:50:50,970
the observability story
and how to build that in.

1219
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:53,310
If you're building agentic
solutions, I want you

1220
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:54,750
to be thinking about this right

1221
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,310
at the front edge of your application.

1222
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,330
I want this to be a part

1223
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,730
of your original planning phases in part

1224
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,740
because it's fairly complex.

1225
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,190
Now this part of the story
hasn't changed all that much.

1226
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,530
And when we've talked about
SaaS solutions in the past.

1227
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:08,363
We've always said,

1228
00:51:08,363 --> 00:51:09,690
Hey, you're gonna have
different tiers of customers.

1229
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,430
There's gonna be some complexity.

1230
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,080
Out of everything that they call,

1231
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:17,310
we wanna be emitting some
specific SaaS context, right?

1232
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,800
So it has always kind of looked like this.

1233
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,110
We've simply added agents into this story.

1234
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:23,640
Instead of saying, Hey,
you're calling a function,

1235
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,680
you're calling a microservice,
whatever you're calling,

1236
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,260
we wanna omit very specific metrics

1237
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,140
that talk about what
the consumer is doing.

1238
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,540
Are they using a specific
agent? Where are they using it?

1239
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,390
What feature are they
using? What's the tenant id?

1240
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:38,070
What's the tier that they belong to?

1241
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:40,380
Any of those that could
be relevant downstream

1242
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:44,100
to your business users to help
them to break down this usage

1243
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,400
by, you know, different pricing
tiers, different regions.

1244
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,410
However they need to think about how

1245
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,720
to successfully operate
their SaaS business.

1246
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,940
Those are the metrics
that we need to omit.

1247
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,190
'Cause downstream there's
gonna be a whole nother story

1248
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:57,690
for how they visualize these things.

1249
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,880
If we don't provide them the
data, they're not gonna be able

1250
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,140
to dig into that data and get

1251
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,243
to the observability story they need.

1252
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:06,960
We've talked about all
sorts of different parts

1253
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,930
of AgentCore and of course
observability has its own

1254
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,030
functionality within AgentCore.

1255
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:14,490
It provides a lot of things out the box.

1256
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,940
It has really nice agentic
dashboards that come out

1257
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,800
of the box in CloudWatch.

1258
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,660
Those are worth looking into right away.

1259
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,720
Now the caveat I'll give you to both that

1260
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,120
and the third party dashboards
that we'll be taking a look

1261
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,630
at are very few observability platforms.

1262
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:33,960
Consider Tenant_id to be
a first class concept.

1263
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,400
What do I mean by that?

1264
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,620
When you look into of your
observability dashboards,

1265
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,827
it will talk about what
agent are you using?

1266
00:52:38,827 --> 00:52:40,953
You know, what platform are you using?

1267
00:52:41,923 --> 00:52:43,980
What region did you deploy in?

1268
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,710
It will not talk about
your tenant identifier.

1269
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,780
This is a business concept
that's specific to you.

1270
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,190
'Cause you're a SaaS provider.

1271
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:53,400
To them it's just another
piece of metadata.

1272
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,488
Now that's problematic because
downstream we want tenant ID

1273
00:52:57,488 --> 00:52:59,280
to be a first class concept.

1274
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,640
We want our dashboards to
drive off of tenant id.

1275
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,310
So regardless, take a look
at the agent dashboards.

1276
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:08,147
They're great, really nice
functionality outta the box.

1277
00:53:08,147 --> 00:53:10,500
You're not gonna find an
easy way to simply say,

1278
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,230
Hey look, I can see tenant id.
You'll see it in your logs.

1279
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,210
They'll be there if you admit it,

1280
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:17,400
but it's not gonna occur to be automatic

1281
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,420
into those dashboards.

1282
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,620
Just keep that in mind, especially

1283
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,780
as we're going through this next example.

1284
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,210
So I took a look at some of the examples

1285
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,230
that come out of the box.

1286
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:26,100
If you haven't looked,

1287
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,182
there's a GitHub out there
called AgentCore Samples.

1288
00:53:29,182 --> 00:53:30,120
It's great.

1289
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,350
It gives you examples of all

1290
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,970
of the stuff we've been
talking about today,

1291
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:34,271
including third party observability.

1292
00:53:34,271 --> 00:53:36,720
And they actually built
out a nice little example

1293
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,880
with the Jupyter Notebook for Langfuse,

1294
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,742
which is an AWS partner that
has a completed agent platform

1295
00:53:41,742 --> 00:53:44,880
including observability for agents.

1296
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,170
I dug into that a little
bit, sorry for the wall

1297
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:49,470
of text of code, but
there really isn't much

1298
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:51,000
to show here except for code.

1299
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,890
Honestly, if you're doing observability,

1300
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,600
you're sending data from your agent off

1301
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,070
to their third party solution.

1302
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,930
It's really just how you configure it.

1303
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:00,540
So I wanted to call it a
couple specific things on here.

1304
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,810
We're disabling the built-in
open telemetry solution

1305
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:04,890
for AgentCore.

1306
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:06,406
This is because we're gonna directly send

1307
00:54:06,406 --> 00:54:09,300
these metrics off to Langfuse.

1308
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,380
You can see just setting up

1309
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,090
a private key and some endpoints.

1310
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,560
This is all pretty basic stuff

1311
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,556
in terms of setup, it
looks a little complex

1312
00:54:15,556 --> 00:54:16,830
'cause there's a few lines.

1313
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,170
If you think about it,
there's a URL, there's a key

1314
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:20,490
and we're sending data to it.

1315
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,010
That's really all there is to this setup.

1316
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:26,580
When we get onto this, the
example uses Strands telemetry,

1317
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,810
which has built a built-in
OTLP exporter that you can use

1318
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,370
and you simply have to make sure that

1319
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,170
however, we're sending that data off

1320
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,570
to our third party, Langfuse in this case,

1321
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:38,250
you're emitting tenant metrics.

1322
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,430
I did it in two different ways
here and I'll tell you why.

1323
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:44,400
I admitted Tenant_id as a trace attribute,

1324
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,770
which turns into metadata
on Langfuse's side.

1325
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,465
And I also did it as a tag.

1326
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:50,157
Now this was important

1327
00:54:50,157 --> 00:54:53,580
because when I first set this
up, I created my metadata

1328
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,257
as Tenant_id and I sent it off to Langfuse

1329
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:56,880
and I started looking at the dashboards

1330
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,650
and I couldn't find it.

1331
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,271
And this again is the problem

1332
00:55:00,271 --> 00:55:02,760
where Tenant_id is not
a first class concept

1333
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,740
for almost any third party solution.

1334
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,110
You have to figure out where
that Tenant_id is gonna surface

1335
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:08,400
in the dashboards.

1336
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,160
When I put the Tenant_id
into the tags for Langfuse,

1337
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,440
it immediately surfaced
up into the dashboards

1338
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,595
and as able to create interesting.

1339
00:55:15,595 --> 00:55:17,755
So there's my tenant id, I was able

1340
00:55:17,755 --> 00:55:21,450
to create interesting
models, you know, just again,

1341
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:23,370
this is just a query, logging it.

1342
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,860
Here's the metadata as
it shows up in Langfuse.

1343
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,080
So because now I have Langfuse here,

1344
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,000
umbrella-corp-004, which you could see

1345
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,833
down there in the bottom.

1346
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:31,890
That's my tenant.

1347
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:35,200
It's metadata and it's also a
tag which allowed me to create

1348
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,840
some interesting dashboards like this one.

1349
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,221
All I'm really doing here
is I'm sorting the count

1350
00:55:42,221 --> 00:55:45,270
of Tenant_id calls for
this specific agent.

1351
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:47,718
I can create much more
sophisticated models based on the

1352
00:55:47,718 --> 00:55:49,980
Agent_id based on region
and everything else.

1353
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,070
But that Tenant_id has to be
a first class concept in here

1354
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,630
for the dashboarding to properly work.

1355
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,820
Now Agent Fuse is, is aware of this.

1356
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,920
There's actually even
a ticket out there open

1357
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,670
on GitHub to make the tenant ID

1358
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:05,700
and the metadata available
to the dashboards.

1359
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,070
But what you'll find consistently
across all observably

1360
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:12,060
platforms is you have to be the
one thinking about tenant ID

1361
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,640
and how that surfaces
through your BI tools.

1362
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,610
Whether your customers are
are using third party tools,

1363
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,746
whether they're using AWS tools, you

1364
00:56:19,746 --> 00:56:21,930
or as you're developing
your application, have

1365
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:25,170
to think about how that's
gonna out to the end users.

1366
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:27,300
There's also an interesting case for this.

1367
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,310
Our example here is a CRM.

1368
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,020
So this year I was lucky enough to work

1369
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,320
with Salesforce working on
their agent force platform

1370
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,520
alongside our AgentCore

1371
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,220
and talking about the
interoperability between the two.

1372
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:41,340
With Agentic platforms, we're
increasingly gonna be pushed

1373
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,170
to talk about the interoperability

1374
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:45,120
of multiple agentic platforms.

1375
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,800
We'd love for you to build
everything on AgentCore.

1376
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,620
That's awesome. Chances
are you have other products

1377
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,510
that also have agentic stories.

1378
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:54,360
How are you going to
reconcile this as a developer?

1379
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,800
As an operator?

1380
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,170
Well, using third party
solutions like Langfuse

1381
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:00,300
and having all of your
different agentic systems,

1382
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,000
sending your telemetry off
to a single source is one

1383
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,950
of the ways as a SaaS
provider you can sort

1384
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:06,930
of streamline this operation.

1385
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,280
And really when we was working

1386
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,360
with Salesforce, it was great.

1387
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,260
It was easy 'cause there was two

1388
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,280
of us talking to each other.

1389
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,050
It was, Hey, what do you see in your logs?

1390
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,490
Oh okay, what do I see in my logs? Right?

1391
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:15,780
Let's just compare.

1392
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,670
In a real world operating solution,

1393
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:19,440
that's not how things work.

1394
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,080
Being having a single point
for you to create dashboards

1395
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,250
for you to visualize all of

1396
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,960
that data is actually pretty helpful.

1397
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,210
So going back to our original
use case we're talking about

1398
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,660
here, for a CRM solution or
anything else you're building

1399
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,770
where there's multiple parts

1400
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,200
and multiple tools, it'd be
awesome if you could figure out

1401
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,680
a way to use a single tool
like an operate like Langfuse

1402
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,380
and send all your data over there.

1403
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:41,610
I'm gonna hint, (laughs)

1404
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:43,680
and that's actually a fifth phase of this.

1405
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,720
You just quickly talk about what it means

1406
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,160
to do pricing in SaaS.

1407
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,510
We're almost at time,

1408
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,100
I'm gonna shortchange
this just a little bit.

1409
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,300
This could be an hour
talk in and of itself.

1410
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,530
Growth unhinged, which
is a website I really

1411
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:56,580
like has been spending a little bit

1412
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,580
of time thinking about how
to price agentic features.

1413
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,780
And they've sort of broken it down

1414
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,260
by this metrics activity-based model

1415
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,540
versus outcome-based model.

1416
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,400
Outcome-based model is starting to evolve

1417
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,980
in the agentic world
when we price not just

1418
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,840
on how many widgets did you consume

1419
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,730
but how many widgets successfully did

1420
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,290
something you wanted them to do.

1421
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:18,120
And it's an interesting mental model.

1422
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,015
And then there's sort of this
fixed versus variable model

1423
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:22,860
that we always think about in SaaS.

1424
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,570
Do people want to have a fixed price?

1425
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,193
They want have a variable price?

1426
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,740
And when they broke this down, you started

1427
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,150
to see pattern emerge.

1428
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:31,740
When you wanted do outcome-based

1429
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,870
and you wanted to be fixed,
you can do per workflow.

1430
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:37,230
So when a workflow completes,
we're gonna charge on that.

1431
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:39,540
If you wanna have a variable
outcome based process,

1432
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,340
you could do a per agent outcome, right?

1433
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,140
So you can actually
measure more granularly

1434
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,550
and this gets a little bit more

1435
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,620
like consumption based pricing.

1436
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,390
Activity based, you can do fixed

1437
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:50,070
per agent like a monthly fee.

1438
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:52,774
Hey, you get an entitlement
to this many agent executions

1439
00:58:52,774 --> 00:58:55,290
versus variable for activity based,

1440
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:56,670
which it very much starts

1441
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,230
to resemble consumption based pricing

1442
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,340
as we're familiar with it.

1443
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,200
So this is actually a great
website growth unhinged.

1444
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,790
If you haven't looked into it before,

1445
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,590
I think it's worth taking a look at.

1446
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,350
Now where do we start in terms of this?

1447
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:11,130
You wanna focus on that
agentic business strategy.

1448
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,050
We haven't spent too
much time talking about

1449
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,580
the overarching strategy,

1450
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,320
but think about this transformation.

1451
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,900
How did you get here
and where are you going?

1452
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,550
Identify how and where your agents

1453
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,320
are gonna enrich your offering.

1454
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,070
Be strategic. Think of that
top down model we talked about.

1455
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:28,110
Develop new agentic pricing strategies.

1456
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:30,660
Again, have you considered
whether your customers

1457
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,010
are willing to do outcome based pricing

1458
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:33,510
or consumption based pricing?

1459
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:35,970
These are important
questions to ask upfront.

1460
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:39,273
How do we scale? How do we
remain agile and efficient?

1461
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,527
How do we model our agents
for tenant onboarding?

1462
00:59:42,527 --> 00:59:44,910
'Cause this is probably one
of the key areas that we see

1463
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:46,560
that's gonna evolve very quickly.

1464
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,340
And how do we introduce
new metrics, evaluations,

1465
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:53,059
operating models that are gonna
make our existing operations

1466
00:59:53,059 --> 00:59:56,420
the things that humans are
beating their heads into today,

1467
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,413
more efficient and work better.

1468
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,830
So I'll quickly throw
this, the takeaways up here

1469
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:04,043
so I'm not running into
anyone else's time.

1470
01:00:04,043 --> 01:00:07,230
SaaS is a business. It's one
size, not one size fits all.

1471
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:09,120
Be diligent about who planned this.

1472
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,500
You can take a picture and
you could read the rest

1473
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,290
of this on your own time
'cause we are out of time.

1474
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:14,700
Thank you all very much for coming.

1475
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,170
I hope you enjoyed the talk.

1476
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:18,180
I will once again make a reminder.

1477
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,090
Ranjith has a workshop that
covers a lot of this topic.

1478
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,890
If you didn't take a picture
before, come up and bug him

1479
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,120
and ask when it's gonna be.

1480
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:24,953
Thank you all.

1481
01:00:24,953 --> 01:00:26,884
(audience clapping)
