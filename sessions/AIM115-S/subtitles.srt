1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,250
- Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,490
Thank you for joining us
this morning. I'm Catherine,

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,180
I'm a director in the UK PWC firm

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,590
working in the health team.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,960
I'm joined today with my colleague Andy,

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,280
who works in our local public
sector team in the UK firm

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,990
and Nicola, our client who works

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,990
for the National Health
Service in the UK at a hospital

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,373
just outside of London.

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,060
We want to come and talk
to you today about how

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,990
amazing AWS products have
been transforming the public

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,840
sector and the work that
we are doing in the UK.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,990
I think for those of you who
don't really know much about

14
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,750
the UK, the National Health Service

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,780
is actually the biggest
employer in Europe.

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,820
And despite the fact
that you've got millions

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,960
of people working for the
NHS, the waiting list for

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,720
kind of access to the healthcare is

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,200
10% of the population on a waiting list.

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,330
They just don't have
enough capacity to see all

21
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,970
of the people, all of the
customers who want to,

22
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,430
to get access to health.

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,250
And the fact that it's the
most trusted institution in the

24
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,300
UK, even the the kind of
waiting times are basically

25
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,450
what dominate the sort
of citizen perception,

26
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,210
giving it a really bad reputation.

27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,880
And even though the NHS
app is actually one of

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,820
the most used healthcare
apps in the world,

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,080
the technology landscape in
the NHS in the UK is pretty

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,300
complex, really outdated,

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,760
and you know, very limited use

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,240
of digital AI and Cloud.

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,730
This actually gives us a
huge opportunity though

34
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,860
to do some really, really exciting stuff

35
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,590
to improve that citizen experience.

36
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,230
So Andy, we obviously learned
a huge amount from the work

37
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,510
that you were doing in local councils.

38
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,270
Do you want to kind of reflect
on the sort of learnings

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,800
that you've got from that work?

40
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,260
- Yeah, sure. So I think as
you've just seen from the video,

41
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,500
we started off working with
Amazon Connect in local council,

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,787
so local government in the UK,

43
00:01:56,787 --> 00:01:58,890
and I think we found three
things that we can do

44
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,723
really quickly.

45
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:00,556
- I don't think your mic is working

46
00:02:00,556 --> 00:02:02,100
- Hopefully you can hear me?

47
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,240
Otherwise I'm gonna
have to talk like this,

48
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,913
which would be a little bit difficult.

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,650
Hopefully someone can turn
me up. Lemme just pull that.

50
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,660
So the first thing was is that

51
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,220
you can do things really fast.

52
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,850
So we can deploy Amazon
Connect in 10 to 15 days

53
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,380
for a full contact center migration.

54
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,710
We can release 30% of a
typical contact center's

55
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,990
capacity in a matter of 10 weeks.

56
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,670
And with the right governance
and decision making,

57
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,130
that means you can achieve
results really fast.

58
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,840
One of the things we wanted
to do is take that learning

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,300
and transfer it into the health service.

60
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,920
Second thing is there's
a lot of components.

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,740
So once you create it once
you've got a reusable asset

62
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,900
that builds in quality,
that builds in pace,

63
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,240
that builds in a lot of things
that mean that we don't have

64
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,340
to worry so much about
the specific requirements

65
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,450
of a given industry.

66
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,570
We can move from one to
the next very, very fast.

67
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,330
And last thing is, councils really do need

68
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,830
to modernize fast.

69
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,510
They have, they're running out money,

70
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,020
they have increasing citizen expectations.

71
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,820
The two components to
be put together meant

72
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,207
that people were willing to say,

73
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:00,210
"Alright, I'm gonna go and try that."

74
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,280
I know I can fail fast,
I know I'm not committed.

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,480
If it doesn't work, let's get

76
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,670
involved and let's get it done quickly.

77
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,550
- Amazing. And so I think
having heard that story

78
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,850
and the success that we had
in local government, Nicola,

79
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,160
what was it that really interested you

80
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,100
and how we could apply it into the NHS?

81
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,840
- Yeah, so I think as you said,

82
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,640
patients are waiting easily a year

83
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,410
for a routine appointment.

84
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,990
So when I say we have a long
wait, we have a long wait.

85
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,180
On top of that, Medway, where I work,

86
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,610
is an incredibly deprived area.

87
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,000
We have really poor engagement
with healthcare, huge numbers

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,630
of drug abuse, alcohol
abuse, social deprivation.

89
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,450
And it makes it harder for
our patients to be able

90
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,220
to access our healthcare.

91
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,200
If I tell you that our average reading age

92
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,640
of our demographic is six,
so incredibly challenged,

93
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,400
Um, one of the things that we
really wanted to understand is

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,180
how we can improve how we
communicate with our patients

95
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,180
and how our patients are
able to communicate with us.

96
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,000
Not only that, we, by starting work

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,210
with PWC at the very
beginning, we average at

98
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:08,160
around 120,000 calls into
our contact center a year.

99
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,200
50% of those were going unanswered.

100
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,520
And that's not because our staff was

101
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,800
sat there doing nothing.

102
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,270
It was the sheer volume of numbers.

103
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,330
That converts there into
patients that either want

104
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,420
to change their appointment,
can't attend their appointment,

105
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,010
and therefore we don't know about that,

106
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,660
we have wasted appointments,

107
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,310
therefore you're waiting
even longer than a year

108
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,280
because we are not utilizing
our opportunity within our

109
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,470
clinic templates.

110
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,550
So we really wanted to
understand how we could work

111
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,410
with a company like AWS to try

112
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,590
and put something in that
really supported our patients.

113
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,320
But not only that, it supported our staff.

114
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,270
Because we weren't answering the calls,

115
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,820
we were getting a lot
of very angry patients,

116
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,970
um, and that was coming down
onto our staff that are some

117
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,130
of our lower paid staff,

118
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,020
and we're coming in every day to a barrage

119
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,130
of abuse from patients

120
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,260
A, because they've waited for
a year for their appointment

121
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,360
and B, they've tried to call 12 times

122
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,220
and no one's answering the call.

123
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,410
So I think we were looking at, it wasn't

124
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,250
around could we have, let's
get AI and what can it fix?

125
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,650
It was around where are our problems

126
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,950
and how can AI potentially
support some of the issues

127
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,870
that we've got as an organization?

128
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,430
- Yeah, amazing. And you know, it's,

129
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,010
it's fairly easy if you
look across, you know,

130
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,430
what do citizens want, what
are they calling up for?

131
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,150
Majority of that, 80% of
that is like really easily,

132
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,210
you know, self-served,
you know, stuff like,

133
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,297
I think majority of them was

134
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:35,130
"Where do I park my car?"
as a kind of really low bar

135
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,270
for citizen experience.

136
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,200
So Andy, I think you mentioned
earlier about the fact

137
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,540
that you know, it's quite
financially challenged

138
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,340
and I think everything is around outcomes

139
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,870
and how you improve that.

140
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,720
What was it you in particular
found around kind of,

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,680
improving customer experience
whilst also reducing cost?

142
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,900
- Yeah, so I think there's
probably four things to call out.

143
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,390
So the first is that using Lex and Lambda

144
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,460
we're able to automate
a large volume of that

145
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,560
simple transactional contact.

146
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,480
That means that calls never go unanswered.

147
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,080
It means that there's an
effective answer each time

148
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,580
and it means that that's capacity

149
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,530
that's not spent on
the phone when it could

150
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,300
be doing something more valuable.

151
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,890
And certainly what we saw in Birmingham,

152
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,930
the example you probably
saw on the video there was

153
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,095
that 55% of inbound
calls could be automated

154
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:20,700
and have been automated.

155
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,790
So that's 55% of total
volumes of calls attempted,

156
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,370
not just those that an agent could get to.

157
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,200
The second is that we can drive really

158
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,580
high level of quality.

159
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,540
So 80% of all calls in
Birmingham, again were

160
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,970
answered effectively to
the customer satisfaction,

161
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,430
and with that journey being fulfilled.

162
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,770
So we've now got high level
of automation delivered

163
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,020
at high level of quality.

164
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,237
The other is it's available 24/7

165
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,290
'cause the robot doesn't sleep.

166
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,210
And that gives us a
huge advantage for some

167
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,890
of those marginalized communities

168
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,160
who perhaps can't contact in
the hours that traditionally

169
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,620
public sector organizations would offer.

170
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,820
But the third thing, and I think the thing

171
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,840
that makes it really powerful
is that by connecting again

172
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,510
with Lambda into back office systems,

173
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,300
we could actually fulfill
the end-to-end journey.

174
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,280
So you wanna raise the
case? Yeah, we can do that.

175
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,190
You want to start in process
and eligibility assessment?

176
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,890
Yeah, we can do that. And
it means that it wasn't

177
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,990
as if we were providing an automation

178
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,610
to just hold someone in stasis.

179
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,930
We were actually delivering
what they needed,

180
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,880
when they needed it, accurately,

181
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,770
first time, right every time.

182
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,810
- Yeah. Fantastic. And I think Nicola,

183
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,750
it really resonates when you
say this isn't just about

184
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,570
AI as a buzzword, where
can we throw it at?

185
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,060
It's actually really
understanding what problems

186
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,628
that you're trying to solve.

187
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:38,760
So obviously we implemented
Connect, Bedrock,

188
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,501
Lex, Lambda.

189
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,350
What in particular was it
that you were trying to solve

190
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,500
and what was the impact
that this technology had?

191
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,560
- I think Andy's referenced
it beautifully with

192
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,100
how transferable this
kind of automation is.

193
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,360
So as I said, we wanted
to start it with a basic

194
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,300
kind of rollout within the organization.

195
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,150
I'll apologize now if any of
you are clinicians in the room.

196
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,340
They are the hardest group
of people to work with

197
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,743
in trying to put any kind of change in.

198
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,400
So we didn't want to
come full bang with it,

199
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,130
let's automate radiology
reporting, let's do,

200
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,360
let's take it away from that

201
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,480
and actually understand what
we can do so it is scalable

202
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,000
and we can then build up
to doing those things.

203
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,260
So I think for us with the,
with our contact center,

204
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,320
we wanted to understand
the number of patients

205
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,180
that were now able to get through.

206
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,890
So we have something called A DNA,

207
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,750
so it's a "did not attend".

208
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,870
We monitor that on a
percentage on a weekly basis.

209
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,090
We can understand how many of our patients

210
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,440
didn't come for their appointment,

211
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,880
why did they not come?

212
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,000
That has dropped by 4%
since we started this,

213
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,190
which doesn't sound huge,
but it's a massive amount

214
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,800
of patients for us within six weeks.

215
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,140
It took six weeks to deploy
this within our area,

216
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,030
once we kind of had the go ahead

217
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,280
and got through all the
information governance element

218
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,670
of all of it, 80% of our
calls are now automated,

219
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,640
which means, that's, you
know, out of 110,000,

220
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,940
that's 80, 90,000 a year that are not

221
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,920
having to have a person answer that.

222
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,750
We've always given the
patients the ability

223
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,490
to have a human being there.

224
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,802
We have a lot of elderly patients,

225
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:15,780
a lot of patients that
have neurodiversity,

226
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,160
have learning difficulties.

227
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,750
There's still that human person

228
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,200
if they want to talk to them.

229
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,390
But we've saved I think patient minutes.

230
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,330
We are saving tens of thousands a month

231
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,163
in the fact that

232
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:30,180
those calls are answered
straight away now.

233
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,330
As you referenced with the
council, it's open 24/7,

234
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,740
it's not just open nine to five

235
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,690
while people are working normally,

236
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,340
it does it in multiple languages.

237
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,680
We have a huge immigrant population

238
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,500
that are non-English speaking
as their first language.

239
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,760
So again, the accessibility
that it's given our patients

240
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,440
has gone through the roof.

241
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,650
The patient feedback we are receiving now,

242
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,320
it's gone from that
cohort of patients that,

243
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,050
like I said, were giving our staff abuse.

244
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,770
It's flipped completely to
now an incredibly happy group

245
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,617
of patients that are like,

246
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:05,610
"Why did we not do this
years and years ago?"

247
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,490
So I think the impact is
massively tangible for us.

248
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,810
- Yeah, no, it's really exciting

249
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,240
and it's such a compelling
story really for something

250
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,680
that's pretty simple.

251
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,790
- It is, yeah.

252
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,350
- So I mean obviously not everything is

253
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,910
a really easy ride.

254
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,070
Andy, what were the kind of challenges

255
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,660
that you in particular faced

256
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,616
and I guess more importantly,
what are the specifics

257
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:26,910
that are really important
to get right when you

258
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,830
are deploying this?

259
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,933
- So I think one of the
things we take for granted is

260
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:34,230
that the labels we give
to things mean anything

261
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,720
to our customers and our citizens.

262
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,150
Actually the title of something
that's used internally

263
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,950
may have no meaning whatsoever to

264
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,710
your average person on the
street who just wants a thing.

265
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,750
So the first thing you got
get your head around is

266
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,410
how do we accurately
understand their intent?

267
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,910
So it's not about what are
the words they're using,

268
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,740
it's what is the thing
they're trying to do

269
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,200
and how are we using the
technology to help us understand

270
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,710
that and resolve it down to
a thing we can then act on?

271
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,990
And there was an interesting
example in Medway

272
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,750
where there's obviously some
clinical language that's used,

273
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,390
which is beyond the sort
of, the normal parameters

274
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,520
that something like Lex
would be able to accommodate.

275
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,500
So then there's a Bedrock
lookup that can go

276
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,870
and find the really
complex medical language,

277
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,310
resolve that down so it's accurate,

278
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,140
'cause that's one thing
you don't wanna get wrong.

279
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,020
I think the second thing is,
is that you've probably heard

280
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,200
that phrase about "Don't let
perfect be the enemy of good."

281
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,863
And coming back to clinicians
being harsh judges,

282
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,920
you'll never get something that's perfect

283
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,080
and you'll never get
something that's 100% right.

284
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,470
But the half of the job here
is to get your MVP at 80%,

285
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,850
put that into production

286
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,860
and use the feedback
that you get to make it

287
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,780
as close to perfect as you can.

288
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,060
But of course what that relies on is that

289
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,190
you've got the ability
to change things quickly.

290
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,930
So again, this is where
the tool set really

291
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,510
comes into its own 'cause
you can make those changes

292
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,420
as you go, as part of the
continuous improvement method

293
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,820
of the actual service
that you're engaging with.

294
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,700
And it's that fusion of, if
you like, the business process

295
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,140
and the technology configuration,

296
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,420
that means you can make
progress very, very quickly.

297
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,340
- Yeah, great. And I think the work

298
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,800
that was done at Medway is so replicable

299
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,470
that we're now putting
it into multiple other

300
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,940
NHS organizations.

301
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,590
So I think the learnings for that of like,

302
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,390
what you can get done in six weeks,

303
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:16,140
and now Nicola, as a
phenomenally rapid period of time

304
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,940
to, to get this up and running,

305
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,490
where did you kind of take it next and

306
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,100
what's the kind of future for you?

307
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,750
- So I'm gonna start by saying the fact

308
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,870
that I am stood at this
conference talking to you guys,

309
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,900
I am the least "techie" person
you are ever going to meet.

310
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,080
The fact I know what Agentic AI now is,

311
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,350
I have sat there listening to
the geniuses at AWS talking,

312
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,330
Googling stuff as they're talking to me.

313
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,530
So, this is so exciting
for me and for my trust,

314
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,210
We are not reputationally known

315
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,730
as being a transformational organization.

316
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,340
The fact that we have big
London teaching hospitals

317
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,520
coming to us and asking
us how we've done this,

318
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,620
how we've done this so quickly,

319
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,800
and I think a lot of that has
been around the engagement,

320
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,507
how we've engaged with our staff.

321
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:03,930
So if you look at our contact
center, we didn't go in

322
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,767
because the minute you talk
about AI, people think,

323
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:08,160
"Well that's it, my job's
gone, I'm losing my job,

324
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,200
they're replacing me with a computer."

325
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,660
So we've been really
careful about how we've gone

326
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,810
to those teams and involved
them right from the beginning.

327
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,610
They've been part of the design.

328
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,830
And I think the reason that we did that,

329
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,800
because we wanted them to
support what we are doing.

330
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,300
Because if they weren't gonna do that,

331
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,330
this was never gonna work.
And I think that's huge.

332
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,150
I think next for us,
oh God, where do we go?

333
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,400
It's the sky's the limit,

334
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,250
the scalability of this now
for us as an organization,

335
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,500
we've done a number, whilst
we've been deploying,

336
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,330
we've been doing scoping work

337
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,005
to understand, what can we do?

338
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:42,780
So if I give you an example,

339
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,390
within Medway we have five prisons.

340
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,700
So just for us, our prison organi,

341
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,160
our prison population is huge.

342
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,160
They're again, a massively
challenged demographic

343
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,999
of patients to reach out to
and get that engagement with.

344
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:59,160
So we are now looking at
how we get a regional hub

345
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,030
within Kent and Medway to
support with all of that for

346
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:06,570
other hospital trusts
within our own localities.

347
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,220
We're rolling out the
work we've already done

348
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,053
to other areas.

349
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:12,180
So we have, Canter is in
the next one we're going to,

350
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,003
that's built and ready to
be deployed as we speak.

351
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,290
But we're also looking, the
NHS is under a massive amount

352
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,630
of financial pressure, huge amount.

353
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,860
We have huge efficiencies.

354
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,740
My organization has a 50
million pound saving target

355
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,010
this year, which I know in AWS
terms that's pocket change,

356
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,510
but for an NHS hospital trust,
it's a huge amount of money.

357
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,330
And we have to hold, you
know, look at that awful,

358
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,730
how do we, how do we take people out?

359
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,010
Which is not a nice thing to do,

360
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,590
but we are now looking at
what we can roll out in some

361
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,910
of our back office functions.

362
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,090
So looking at HR, finance, again, those,

363
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,040
it's the same methodology,

364
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,630
but do you need someone to tell you

365
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,310
how much annual leave you've got left

366
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,860
or when your payslip should be coming out?

367
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,850
So again, it's looking at
where we can scale this to.

368
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,200
And then I think the next move,

369
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,900
which is gonna be incredibly
exciting, is how we start

370
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,660
to bring in more clinical services.

371
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,420
So preoperative
questionnaires for example.

372
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,253
- Yeah

373
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:11,250
- We don't need someone to be doing that.

374
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,243
We don't need someone
to be reviewing that.

375
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:15,960
You've got your set scripts,
depending on the answers,

376
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,857
you'll go into a green box of

377
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:19,770
"Happy day, you're good
to go for your surgery."

378
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,960
or "Okay, you need a review."

379
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,300
But again, it's taking the
pressure away from our clinical

380
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,360
staff, but also from our
administrative staff.

381
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,120
And I think every time we start to scope,

382
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,050
we see more opportunity
and it's, it's so exciting.

383
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,183
I don't think I ever thought
working in an organization

384
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:39,780
like the NHS, you'd, I mean
get the opportunity to do this.

385
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,730
I flew over from London
yesterday to do this.

386
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,650
This is, you know, amazing.

387
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,350
So yeah, I think the sky
really is the limit for us.

388
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,000
- Yeah, and I think that's so exciting.

389
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,130
Especially, it's the mindset,

390
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,650
I think in this particular
instance that made it

391
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,600
so successful, of just really willing

392
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,680
to give something a go.

393
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,513
- Yeah

394
00:15:56,513 --> 00:15:58,380
- Leverage what had been
built successfully in other

395
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,070
places and kind of keep
scaling it and rolling it out.

396
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,770
I mean, it sounds a really
ambitious kind of vision for

397
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,410
what you wanna create across
your geographical area.

398
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,900
But I guess Andy, just
closing off with you,

399
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,870
like what's in your sort
of ambitious future?

400
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,890
- Yeah so one of the things
that using Lex to do this

401
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,140
encourages or invites
your customer to do is

402
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,600
perhaps sacrifice a little
bit of the customer experience

403
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,463
for a lot of the capacity release.

404
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,230
But with Nova Sonic arriving
and a range of models

405
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,820
that are gonna do voice to voice,

406
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,200
we can actually redress that balance.

407
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,097
So we make it a big investment
right now about saying

408
00:16:33,097 --> 00:16:34,770
"How do we take everything we've learned

409
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,930
and put it in that purely
generative environment?"

410
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,630
So we've got rich conversations,
high customer experience,

411
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,810
empathy, intimacy perhaps
where it's appropriate,

412
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,560
to drive... greater
demand, if you like, for,

413
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,800
for the voice channel at
very, very little cost.

414
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,020
The second thing is, and picking
up a point Nicola made is

415
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,820
everything that your
customer wants from you

416
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,020
as an organization,

417
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,450
your staff will want from
you in some other way,

418
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,610
some transactional need or requirement.

419
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,990
And there's no reason
why you can't automate

420
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,700
business support using the same tools

421
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,200
that you use for customer support.

422
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,000
And I think that becomes
quite an interesting

423
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,330
two-dimensional approach
to using Amazon Connect.

424
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,010
Then the third one, I
think this is where it gets

425
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,390
really exciting is,

426
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,400
and you've heard lots of
announcements already about sort

427
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,040
of Agentic development is,

428
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,410
why do I need my citizen

429
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,690
or customer to phone me up?

430
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,957
Why can't I just get them to say,

431
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:24,690
"My agent's gonna deal with that."

432
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,100
And we'll create an interface that allows

433
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,650
their personal agent to
achieve all the things

434
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,410
with us as the council or
the hospital that we need

435
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,440
without [microphone muffles]

436
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,200
having to lift a finger or a microphone!

437
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,180
And I think that, you know
what, what becomes quite

438
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,310
exciting about that is we
can really empower people

439
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,950
on their behalf to get the
best things proactively

440
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,690
rather than waiting
for them to contact us.

441
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,480
So I think watch this space,
there's a lot coming there.

442
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,745
- Fantastic. Great. Thank you very much.

443
00:17:50,745 --> 00:17:51,578
- Thank you.

444
00:17:51,578 --> 00:17:52,477
- Thank you all.
