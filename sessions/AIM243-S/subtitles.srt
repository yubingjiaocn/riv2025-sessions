1
00:00:00,108 --> 00:00:02,180
This is the uh the session from Hashi Corp

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,570
where we're gonna talk about running and scaling agentic

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,488
AI applications in production.

4
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:07,988
And with that,

5
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:10,919
my name's Cole Morrison. I head up our brand story

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,089
function and am our principal evangelist at

7
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:14,368
Hashi Corp, and,

8
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:17,089
and my name is Kyle Ruddy. I lead up product marketing

9
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:18,388
for, for Hashi Corp.

10
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,228
So we've been doing this for quite a bit,

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,309
Kyle. I think I came up mainly through

12
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:24,609
the software side and then kind of got

13
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:25,629
tired of dealing with

14
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,329
your type and was like, I'm gonna learn the offside.

15
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,408
Wow, harsh

16
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,750
shots fired already, yeah, yeah,

17
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,668
but you came out mainly through the op side,

18
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,990
correct? Yes, yeah, I was, I was big

19
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,069
on the system engineering side starting from

20
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,889
help desks,

21
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:43,168
kind of pretty much migrating my way all the way up

22
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:45,618
through systems engineering and getting into, to

23
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:47,668
kind of like this whole like DevOps concepts,

24
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:50,505
so much. Stronger on the on the

25
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:52,575
operations side when it comes down to to the dev

26
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:54,804
and the ops, which is kind of funny because

27
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:57,064
like that's that's that whole bridge

28
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:59,094
between things is, well it's it's a story

29
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:01,145
and something that we're gonna have to deal with again with of

30
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:03,505
course don't worry, we'll say like 50

31
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:05,534
million times in this talk, but speaking

32
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:07,484
of which, that whole thing, you know.

33
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,278
There, I feel like there's a number of groups, Kyle, in

34
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,519
terms of when it comes to AI. There's the folks

35
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,799
that are like this is the answer,

36
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,359
like this is gonna solve everything, and then there's

37
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,480
the rest that usually are like what

38
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,778
engineers, like senior engineers,

39
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,079
your parents,

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,558
and like doomsdayers that are like, let's stay

41
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:27,668
away from AI. It's got all sorts of problems,

42
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,900
right? Which group do you fall into?

43
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,028
I don't know. I'm, I, I used to be

44
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:36,028
on the, the latter side, but I,

45
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:38,069
I think it's starting to, to slowly

46
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:40,430
sell me on, on certain types of workflows

47
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,549
and certain types of, of, uh, you

48
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:44,549
know, support for various languages and what they

49
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,829
can kind of do and, and add to existing

50
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,469
workflows. So yeah,

51
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,829
that's, that's how it goes eventually you gotta adopt. But

52
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:53,168
then there's a third group, and that third group of people

53
00:01:53,308 --> 00:01:55,388
that have just been doing this. They've been doing it for

54
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:57,469
a long time and some

55
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:59,629
of them didn't necessarily even get to see

56
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:01,739
what. Came of their work. So, we've had this black and

57
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:03,319
white picture up here for longer than

58
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:06,019
we intended, but it's OK. We're gonna talk

59
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:08,050
about a little bit about, I don't know if any of y'all know who

60
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,088
Frank Rosenblatt is. OK, this guy

61
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,199
was born in the 20s,

62
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:13,740
and somewhere in his 30s, like

63
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,000
most of us, he actually came into his thing,

64
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:18,139
you know, he was in neuroscience and psychology,

65
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,838
and he had this really

66
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,449
cool idea, which was,

67
00:02:21,778 --> 00:02:23,819
you know, technically the human body is just

68
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:24,750
like hardware,

69
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:26,000
so is the brain.

70
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,679
And if that's the case,

71
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:29,849
Maybe we can make a machine learn.

72
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:32,490
So he got the US Navy

73
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,770
involved and they funded the very

74
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,469
first

75
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,250
machine learning

76
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:40,330
idea here, and they put it on an IBM 704

77
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,330
mainframe which, having spoken to some of you,

78
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:44,469
I know you've got some of you for some reason have those

79
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,649
in your on-prem basements still, which

80
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:47,349
is fine,

81
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,699
and he started doing something that

82
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:51,508
we now do today. He got that machine

83
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:54,050
with 400 little

84
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,276
photo sensors to look at. Thing

85
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:58,586
and decide a simple yes or

86
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:00,597
no. This was really big

87
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,376
for Frank. OK. He called it his perceptron,

88
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:05,515
and he was so into it and it was like

89
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:08,456
60s, he called it the Mark 1 perceptron.

90
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:10,656
And this was the first case of a machine

91
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:12,836
doing this. Now, if you know, if you've done any of

92
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:14,996
this stuff in machine learning, you know that

93
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:17,317
this is the first kind of neuron,

94
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:18,616
right? Now

95
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,116
this took off, right?

96
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:23,235
He wrote a book about it, Principles of neurodynamics.

97
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:25,544
He started getting a lot of attention. He built

98
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:27,812
bigger and bigger perceptrons.

99
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:29,862
And, and, and real quick, Kyle, like, have you

100
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:31,342
seen a mainframe before, right?

101
00:03:31,663 --> 00:03:33,804
I, I have, yeah, you have seen a mainframe before.

102
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:36,104
It's kind of funny like for the size that

103
00:03:36,104 --> 00:03:38,203
they were at the time, the amount of computing power

104
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:40,463
wasn't necessarily there, right? And

105
00:03:40,463 --> 00:03:42,153
it's taken us so many years to get there.

106
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,582
And he kept going and going and going until

107
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:46,854
eventually people started putting out papers

108
00:03:46,854 --> 00:03:49,324
and what and they're like, well, this is nice,

109
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:52,050
but what can we practically do? With it right now.

110
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:54,409
And we hit sort of this AI winter

111
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:55,730
towards the 60s

112
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,050
and Frank, like most tech

113
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,490
people do when we're caught in a loop,

114
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,790
went deeper. He's like, you know what?

115
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,290
I'm gonna prove you all wrong. I'm gonna take rats

116
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,230
that I've trained

117
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:07,651
and I'm gonna take untrained rats, and I'm gonna

118
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:09,800
try to transfer the training over to the rat by like

119
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,469
poking them

120
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:13,050
in the brain. Yeah, it didn't

121
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,210
work. It was very controversial, probably even more now

122
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,610
than it was. And he went off in the 70s

123
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,190
and.

124
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,278
Died a pretty early death and never actually

125
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:23,358
saw his work come into play because what

126
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:25,480
he discovered was actually the whole idea of a

127
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,670
machine, yes or no, but not just that,

128
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,699
what's called

129
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,088
back propagation,

130
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,959
uh, back propagation error in the sense that after

131
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,750
a machine is said a yes or no,

132
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,230
it goes back and weights all the yes or no. So

133
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,579
if we look at something like Kyle and like Kyle,

134
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,165
like. Has a beard, right? He's,

135
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:45,535
does he have a beard? Yes or no? Yes or no. Does he have glasses?

136
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:47,613
Yes or no. You do that enough times, good. If

137
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:49,613
the result's wrong, then we need to go back and

138
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:51,233
change the weights of those. That was him,

139
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,764
right? So if you think about what we're doing in the,

140
00:04:53,774 --> 00:04:55,673
in the entire space today,

141
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:58,444
that's just millions of perceptrons,

142
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:00,504
and unfortunately, Frank never got to

143
00:05:00,504 --> 00:05:01,014
see that.

144
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:03,295
But thankfully to the height

145
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:03,915
machine,

146
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:06,855
well, now we've got a lot of people here because we put AI

147
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:08,634
in our title, right, Kyle? That's right.

148
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,608
All right, so with that, let's dive into

149
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:14,769
two truths. Normally this is 2 truths and a lie,

150
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:17,100
but we don't have that much time to get into the lie.

151
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,850
So, uh, and really like the

152
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,970
AI hype is, is loud. Like that

153
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,250
was kind of one of the things that I was talking about there earlier

154
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,369
where I, I was, I was kind of a denier at

155
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,389
first. Like you, you have all of these promises,

156
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:29,358
you have all of this,

157
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:31,855
this, you know. Capabilities of what could

158
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:33,935
be and it was loud we

159
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,975
heard it everywhere like we made various

160
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:38,454
comments at even our own events and conferences

161
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:40,536
where we're like, you know, it's, it's not a keynote if you

162
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:41,475
don't say AI

163
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,855
that was hilarious for a long time

164
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:45,855
until like we actually started doing stuff with

165
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,894
AI and then it turned into not really so

166
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:48,894
funny but

167
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:51,380
the technology is also. So real when it comes

168
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,011
down to it

169
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:54,571
because that's just kind of where the the curve of

170
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:56,802
adoption really is trending towards that,

171
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:59,372
you know, we've kind of moved on from the hype

172
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:01,540
scale of things and I mean

173
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,682
it's kind of sort of still there but

174
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:05,781
we're also now starting to get to the point where we

175
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:06,521
can realize

176
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,122
some of that value from the the

177
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:10,341
AI hype cycle.

178
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:13,569
I have no comment on that one,

179
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,459
yeah, so the question is where does it fit? So,

180
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:19,290
um, we had a very fun

181
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,519
conversation with our, our co-founder Hashkurb

182
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,720
Arman, and he had a neat idea, right? It's

183
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,449
like, well, when it comes to Gen AI,

184
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,238
it's obviously not.

185
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:29,850
A general intelligence. So if y'all don't know that

186
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,009
it being a general intelligence is more like

187
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:34,048
saying, well, what if we build a bigger skyscraper to get

188
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:34,608
to the moon? Like,

189
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:37,290
eventually we're gonna run out of oxygen and die, right?

190
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:39,730
But it's not quite the loom, right? The Luddites

191
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,889
are like, we don't like the loom, it's taking our jobs to get rid

192
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:44,119
of it. So where is it? Where does it sit,

193
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,428
Kyle? Because it disrupts a lot

194
00:06:46,428 --> 00:06:48,480
of different industries, right? It's

195
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,730
much bigger than just some narrow disruptor.

196
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,869
How do you see it in context of stuff?

197
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,730
I mean it, it could be applied into to

198
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,879
many different facets and I, I think that's kind of

199
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,220
one of the, the, the areas of the hype cycle

200
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,420
is, is really like where can you, you

201
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,619
know, apply this and it gets into such a

202
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:06,040
broad kind of capability

203
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:08,459
that you know it's kind of permeating into every

204
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:10,535
single industry, you know. For a long time

205
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:12,535
it was kind of funny to talk about, you know, how

206
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:14,535
like various industries are changing and

207
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,915
everybody's turning into a software company and

208
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:19,233
now it's kind of the same thing on the AI side where,

209
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:21,285
you know, kind of everybody can now start using

210
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:23,434
AI in various ways, shapes and forms

211
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:24,233
and therefore

212
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:26,295
how do you then kind of control it.

213
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,939
But the question is, what does this mean for

214
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:31,019
the ops folks y'all here at Reinvent

215
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:31,798
because,

216
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,100
hey, we're working in the cloud, and

217
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,220
when we've had some folks come up into the booth

218
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:36,798
like, OK,

219
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,369
we got agents, we got code being generated,

220
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,959
it's coming at us faster than ever.

221
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:44,259
The AI is like there's so, it's

222
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:46,579
in every single thing. What does this mean for me

223
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,579
as the SRE? And the biggest thing we

224
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:50,798
want you to walk away from today with is

225
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:51,439
this.

226
00:07:54,428 --> 00:07:56,548
It's just another workload like that's

227
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:57,889
really what it comes down to

228
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,189
and and that's really what the session is going to be

229
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,189
about is, you know, trying to apply a lot

230
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,470
of those same things that you apply

231
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,358
within your infrastructure today

232
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,670
is going to be just the same way

233
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,290
that you apply that to AI

234
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:12,750
because again it's just another

235
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,588
workload.

236
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:15,709
But what is different?

237
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,000
Well, the blast radius is different.

238
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,470
Blast radius is quite different. We're gonna go a little bit, we're

239
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,670
gonna go pretty deep, sorry, on the technical

240
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,709
side, because we think if we, if you

241
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,209
understand the first principles

242
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:28,949
around what's happening in the software

243
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:31,488
itself, then you as the infrastructure folks

244
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:33,950
are gonna be able to better deal with it, right,

245
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:35,989
and tell people no or tell people yes when

246
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:36,668
you'd like to.

247
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:40,219
So in terms of how we're gonna get into

248
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,269
this today, Kyle,

249
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:43,889
yes, we're gonna go over the, the two planes,

250
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:46,178
the model and the ops plane. We're gonna go into

251
00:08:46,178 --> 00:08:48,259
and talk a little bit about the blast radius

252
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,750
that Cole was just referring to,

253
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:52,058
and then how do we get to an actual known good

254
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:54,298
steady state where we feel comfortable

255
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:56,460
now, you know, kind of harnessing and using

256
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,899
and consuming these newfound AI-based

257
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:01,298
workloads and apply that to our existing

258
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:04,109
environment. All

259
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:06,168
right, the model plane,

260
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:08,668
you know what? I think we should have probably put this slide

261
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:09,308
before it,

262
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:10,158
um.

263
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:12,830
So when it comes to

264
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,629
thinking about this new world of AI

265
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,690
for the infrastructure and the software folks,

266
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,849
because there's actually been a number of software folks that have come up

267
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:20,849
and have been like, oh,

268
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:23,250
we gotta deploy this stuff now. I'm like, how

269
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,250
are you deploying it? It's like from my laptop. It's like

270
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:27,450
that's, that's not good. Much like

271
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,609
the perceptron, we're gonna try to draw

272
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:31,729
a line between one thing or the other, and

273
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:33,769
this one thing or the other is, well, what's

274
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:36,158
actually thinking. OK, the

275
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,279
brain, not to say the op side doesn't have

276
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,428
brain, and then of course what

277
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,158
actually runs. And in fact,

278
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:43,960
throughout this whole talk, we're gonna always try to differentiate

279
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,239
where those things are, because until you understand that

280
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,859
line, it's very easy,

281
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,340
right, to overoptimize on certain

282
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,428
things, get the wrong ideas, or at

283
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,798
the very worst, get up and say the wrong thing

284
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:56,580
because you're not really sure where it's coming from.

285
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,168
What are your thoughts on that, Kyle?

286
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,580
No, I totally agree.

287
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:01,139
All right,

288
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,149
so when it comes to the model

289
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:06,269
plane, when for for the ops people,

290
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,379
I kinda wanted to go over some of the

291
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,479
higher level components, and I keep forgetting

292
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,479
that this is right here, so I keep looking over here and

293
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,139
pointing at it.

294
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,918
But let's start with the most basic thing. If you're using

295
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:17,940
some sort of model, you've got the prompt. That's

296
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,139
what you're typing in. So you've got the prompt,

297
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:22,538
and then of course you have the model itself that's actually

298
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,080
taking the thing. The model itself,

299
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:26,379
for those of you who have done no research to

300
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:28,580
it, is not actually a brain, despite that looking

301
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,178
like a brain. It's the most glorified autocomplete

302
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:31,798
you've ever

303
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:34,379
seen. It's one of my favorite things, like, as

304
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,599
it goes through, it's just a standard deviation. So

305
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:38,639
when you ask it what's 1 + 1 and

306
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,639
it says 2, it just generally

307
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,719
knows that it's, it's just a standard deviation of

308
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:44,158
it, right? So

309
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:46,558
after that there is the entire

310
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,678
reasoning side of it. Now this reasoning and

311
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:50,798
tools kind of come into when you hear what an

312
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:52,879
agent's doing, OK? So that's

313
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,960
the heuristic that we'll get into a little bit when it's

314
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,349
deciding like, OK, well, generally

315
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,178
if someone says I have access to HTTP

316
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:02,580
tool or to like this documentation

317
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,879
and they give me this goal.

318
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:06,298
What, how should I reason about using those?

319
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,619
You have memory. It's gotta keep context in terms

320
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:10,690
of like what's going on now for the

321
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,830
memory side of it there's that there's not

322
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,019
just the actual tokens that you're passing up which

323
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:17,840
for all intents and purposes are just numerical representations

324
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,940
of the text that you've got, right? There's

325
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,979
also the evaluators as it starts

326
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,450
moving. Towards its goal,

327
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,960
you gotta actually check and see, are you there? These

328
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,000
become even more important because in the

329
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,139
world where programmers are hard coding control

330
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:31,678
flow, that's a little bit more predictable.

331
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,239
There's the supervisor pattern,

332
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,479
right? So this is where you've got one

333
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,798
top level agent or

334
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,960
program or whatever that fans out to other

335
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,279
supporting specialists.

336
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:45,000
There's MCP. I gotta put that on there.

337
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:47,668
I mean y'all have seen the MCP servers,

338
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:50,038
half of them are just a glorified wrapper for an API,

339
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,619
but in general they just make it easier to discover tools.

340
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:55,279
You've got Rag, which is more or less

341
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,519
before any prompt you do, going and

342
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,629
preceding that prompt with other things. So

343
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,960
for example, if you really want to get the most, the

344
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,029
most detailed answer on what. To have that

345
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:04,729
for dinner tonight,

346
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,229
just load up all of Wikipedia beforehand

347
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:09,000
and you'll probably get something interesting.

348
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:11,379
And then of course there's retries because

349
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:13,548
this is an agent, because it's not a human, it

350
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:15,548
might retry quite a bit, but everything

351
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:16,500
I just said there,

352
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,960
it doesn't matter to y'all if you are

353
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:20,109
in the upside,

354
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:21,109
because

355
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,918
It's just another workload, OK? That, that's

356
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:26,259
all it is. You're gonna contain all of the chaos

357
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:28,428
that is that programmer into

358
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:30,469
a container, and he's much easier to

359
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:30,979
deal with.

360
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,548
I'm talking about myself in third person, Kyle. Yes,

361
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,200
indeed, yeah,

362
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,558
but in the end those are just services at that point,

363
00:12:36,678 --> 00:12:39,000
you know, those are things that are running that's out there, things

364
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,279
that, uh, that you need to know what they are,

365
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,359
but not necessarily like you don't need to know

366
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:45,460
the intricate details of all of those things

367
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,908
or even, you know, to the depth that Cole was

368
00:12:47,908 --> 00:12:49,219
going into right there.

369
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:52,058
On the operation side it comes down to what's

370
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:54,219
in the uh what's running those

371
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:55,279
actual things

372
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,639
and that's when we get into the ops plane

373
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,320
and that's.

374
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:00,259
I'll go one more there

375
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,149
because that's the things that we know.

376
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:04,769
Those are the things that we know, love, they've

377
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,269
existed for a very long time.

378
00:13:06,558 --> 00:13:08,678
None of those things have changed, even,

379
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:11,369
you know, we still need networking, we still need connectivity,

380
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:13,570
we still need compute resources, we still need

381
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,690
somewhere to run these various things. We

382
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,918
still need memory, we still need databases, all

383
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:19,928
of those things that we know and love and

384
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:22,099
have been using for probably more than a decade,

385
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:23,590
depending on your age.

386
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:26,239
They're still there. They're still there. They're still

387
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,460
required. They're still needed.

388
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:30,119
I have a quick question for the audience, like, who here

389
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:32,320
is actually in the data science, the

390
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,158
software side?

391
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:35,428
You, are you, who's, who's actually the ones like coding

392
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:36,119
this stuff,

393
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,599
right? Don't be shy. We're not gonna call you out,

394
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:40,820
or we will, OK. So there's enough here

395
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,779
where like

396
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:44,219
these are now for some of y'all this is

397
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:46,298
this is actually new stuff you've been trying to avoid it

398
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:48,298
but you do need to actually like dive in

399
00:13:48,298 --> 00:13:50,340
and learn it, but it is if it

400
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,379
this makes you feel better, much like the

401
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:54,418
perceptron has been around for a long time, so the

402
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:55,320
patterns are the same.

403
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:59,158
So then building on that, what happens with

404
00:13:59,158 --> 00:14:01,178
our our newfound AI powers here,

405
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:03,250
we have slight changes in the way that

406
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,389
some of these things are required to operate,

407
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,918
you know, when we think about compute now, it's not just

408
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:09,989
CPUs, it's also GPUs.

409
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,389
When we think about various identities, it's going

410
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,418
from like me as a person as a human. And

411
00:14:14,908 --> 00:14:17,168
logging into something we now have these agent

412
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:19,548
things that actually are nonhumans

413
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:22,009
that they need their own levels of permissions

414
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:24,279
and access and those types of things.

415
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:26,489
We're dealing with different types of databases,

416
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:28,609
you know, instead of you know maybe post grads we're

417
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:30,288
now working with vector databases,

418
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,788
but in the end.

419
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:34,580
End of the day it's all the same type of,

420
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,038
you know, high level compute and

421
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:39,200
offer operating offers.

422
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:42,058
So it's kind of just like a different flavor of

423
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,158
the same thing. Obviously the way you think about

424
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:46,279
them and some of the stuff that you're gonna have to change, there are gonna

425
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,558
be a few things there, but like Kyle

426
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:50,719
said, it's pretty much just more of the same.

427
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,038
All right, so here is one thing you will

428
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:57,298
have to deal with as the ops

429
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:59,519
folks when it comes to the if you are

430
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,960
just using an API, right, if you're just

431
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,038
using like OpenAI's hosted

432
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:06,058
model or if you're using Bedrock or something like

433
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:08,340
that, this all becomes even simpler

434
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,399
because then in whatever application that

435
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,678
your software developers are building when they're using

436
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,700
these, it's just another API call

437
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,989
probably. Either hitting just the post requests

438
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:19,168
or using like streaming capabilities which

439
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:21,389
is now in HTTP, right? So

440
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:22,989
that's, that's, that's even easier.

441
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:23,908
You have,

442
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:26,369
I have, well, we put cluster on here.

443
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,070
I don't remember why. I think it was because

444
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,070
we've been so Kubernetesified that I don't

445
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,048
even know what life is without a cluster

446
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:35,469
file. Yeah, I don't, but we really mean

447
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:36,690
run time like whatever

448
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,219
you've got your. CPU and memory on all those

449
00:15:39,219 --> 00:15:41,259
different things when you have a cluster of

450
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:43,298
that runtime, you can choose to put the

451
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:45,580
model and hosted somewhere in that, right?

452
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,700
Now obviously you're gonna need to put those in a different

453
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,500
type of runtime,

454
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,359
a GPU based runtime,

455
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,940
um, but if you're doing something like Kubernete's, you can

456
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,009
keep them right there in the cluster, and the benefits are,

457
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,058
of course, that it's close, right? It's gonna be a

458
00:15:57,058 --> 00:15:59,178
lot faster. Access can be a lot easier to manage

459
00:15:59,178 --> 00:15:59,879
and the like.

460
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,639
You can of course put in an entirely separate

461
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,879
runtime, OK, host it on its own

462
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,960
EKS cluster or its own EC2

463
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,080
instance or however it is you want to go about that. That of course

464
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,859
is going to

465
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:12,710
create separation of concerns. It's gonna be a little bit

466
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,719
easier to reason about it, but of course there's

467
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:17,158
gonna be the fact that it's separate. And then there's

468
00:16:17,158 --> 00:16:19,320
edge devices. Now this is actually really

469
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,158
cool to an extent,

470
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,139
which is let's just talk like

471
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:25,469
kinda like hosting an enterprise grade

472
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:27,080
LLM, pretty, pretty.

473
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,428
Pretty expensive, right? Absolutely, it, it

474
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:30,080
can be, yeah,

475
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,788
I mean there's, there's LLMs, large language

476
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:35,219
models, and there's SLMs or small language models,

477
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,450
and so that is one of those things that comes down

478
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,690
to, you know, how are you managing the resources

479
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,859
and where do they need to live so that you can

480
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:43,349
either access them easier,

481
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,989
access them cheaper, or do it in a more

482
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:48,149
secure fashion. And the secure

483
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:50,229
side is where that really comes down to if you've

484
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:52,308
got a manufacturing factory

485
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:53,710
that manufactures.

486
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,690
Shaving kits, I don't know, it's your beard that's doing this for me, OK?

487
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,359
And they're coming down

488
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,538
a whole line here and you've got a camera that needs to evaluate

489
00:17:00,538 --> 00:17:02,580
them and is trying to use a

490
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,699
stochastic heuristic of something like a model.

491
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,939
You can't just shove all of GPT on that.

492
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,219
So maybe you want to pick something like Granite, right?

493
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,500
So IBM's got their small language model that's a whole

494
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,618
whopping like 3 gigs, and it can stay

495
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:15,699
right there. It can process a lot faster, but

496
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:17,739
of course call back up to cloud. So these are kind of

497
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:20,390
the 4 ways. Do you have any other thoughts on the model

498
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,019
serving options? Nope.

499
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:23,660
All right.

500
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,559
So I and I kind of already touched on, on kind

501
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,699
of the, the three main problems there when it comes

502
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:29,269
down to,

503
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,598
you know, at the end of the day regardless of what type

504
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:33,680
of workload you're dealing with AI

505
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,750
or not, it's really all about speed, cost,

506
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,160
and risk, you know, how fast can you access

507
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,358
resources or really how, how fast

508
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:42,539
can your end users, your customers,

509
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:43,779
uh, if you will.

510
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,338
You know, access those resources, how

511
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:47,598
much does it cost

512
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,049
to maintain those levels of resources because that's

513
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:52,160
definitely something that's, that's more and more

514
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,838
prevalent as, as AI

515
00:17:54,838 --> 00:17:56,959
resources and AI workloads kind of evolve

516
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,219
and work through those processes. And then

517
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:01,328
last but not least, of course it comes down to

518
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:03,459
security and making sure that you know agents

519
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,459
aren't running amok and having access to

520
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,598
all kinds of insane things

521
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:09,410
driving those cloud costs up,

522
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:12,088
yeah. Speed,

523
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,848
cost and risk. OK,

524
00:18:14,368 --> 00:18:16,559
all right, and that's kind of where we come into, to play

525
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,209
with the Hashiorp cloud platform.

526
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,660
This is one of those areas where we really like

527
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,318
to apply a, a general, you know, managed

528
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:25,469
control plane where you can provide,

529
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:27,910
you know, a consistent operating model

530
00:18:28,088 --> 00:18:30,250
when it comes to how various teams need to,

531
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:32,529
to generate those workloads, how they maintain

532
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,358
those workloads,

533
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:35,805
uh, and how they, you know. Continue that throughout

534
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:37,963
the entire life cycle of their uh

535
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:39,453
their existence and usage

536
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:42,144
and you know I know we're at the the AWS

537
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:44,324
uh event but however this is something

538
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,525
that applies to to all sorts of things as well.

539
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:48,844
This isn't just AWS but you can do Kubernete's

540
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:50,864
clusters you can do all sorts of things,

541
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:53,414
uh, well beyond just that,

542
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:54,295
uh, so

543
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:55,785
throwing that out there.

544
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,529
And then when it comes down to it, you know, we've

545
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:00,769
kind of touched on this a little bit already, but

546
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:03,118
you know, really what it comes down to is, you know,

547
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:05,549
this is something that we've already been through,

548
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,900
if you will, like as people, you

549
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,209
know, everybody is in here at a cloud conference,

550
00:19:10,368 --> 00:19:12,630
so we've all had cloud programs at some

551
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,799
point in time of our career,

552
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,088
you know, we've had to go through the process of adopting.

553
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:19,394
Certain cloud services we've had to go through

554
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:21,424
and standardize what that looks like to

555
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,993
to then build on those services

556
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:26,154
and then scaling those up and that's something

557
00:19:26,154 --> 00:19:28,233
that Hasha Corp has been there along the

558
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,394
entire journey. We've been around for more than a decade,

559
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:32,963
you know, releasing various products all the way back

560
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,035
to vagrant and all the way up to what we

561
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:37,184
have today with the Hasha Corp cloud

562
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:39,309
platform. And it's really

563
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:41,559
interesting that even our, our, our co-founder

564
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,630
Arman, he, he kind of likens the

565
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,838
this whole like AI adoption

566
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:48,358
and AI program very similarly

567
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:49,750
to cloud programs.

568
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,239
However, the one big thing that's kind of changed

569
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:54,509
in, in that type of aspect here is, is

570
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:55,809
the, the timing.

571
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:58,618
Like it's greatly consolidated like folks

572
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,880
and organizations really need to go from, you

573
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,000
know, we, we have a little while to, you

574
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,479
know, kind of implement things on our own pace

575
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:07,019
and, and now it's like no.

576
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:09,660
We need this stuff up. We need it up this fiscal

577
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,640
year or this calendar year.

578
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,338
So how do we get to that point? And so that's where we

579
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,479
see a lot of this rapid adoption when it comes

580
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,618
to the AI program side of things,

581
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,059
which is, it's kind of comes back to what we said

582
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,098
again. It's just another workload and that

583
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:25,259
and Armand's idea and what Kyle just talked about,

584
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:27,670
if you abstract the idea of an agent program

585
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:29,939
into just it's a workload, well, it's

586
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:32,019
a lot easier to reason about the entire thing and

587
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:34,180
so the journey is kind of complete in

588
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,759
terms of how you're gonna go about managing it.

589
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:40,250
All right. So, let's, I'm gonna hop

590
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,309
over to a, uh,

591
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,880
our, our demo here,

592
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,420
and we're gonna walk through, if I can, if

593
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,959
this will recognize my finger.

594
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,890
And I click over to the thing.

595
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:53,779
We're gonna walk through some, some of the, the,

596
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:55,979
what we're gonna be looking about as, as we talk

597
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:58,140
about that. And so, um, as demos

598
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,259
go and as demos go with myself and Kyle,

599
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:02,618
this meant that we dug a hole

600
00:21:02,618 --> 00:21:04,660
and got so deep that we're like, let's just

601
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,500
keep digging

602
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,219
instead of making it simpler.

603
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:09,539
So we did to make

604
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,618
sure that y'all had something and we could talk very

605
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,809
deeply about it, we have an

606
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:16,019
application here that is doing a couple of

607
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:18,019
things. It is, so say

608
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:19,078
hi to everyone.

609
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:22,259
At the reinvent talk.

610
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:25,529
OK, so what we have here is

611
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:27,549
we have an application that's reaching up

612
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:29,689
to a supervisor agent. Now

613
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:32,529
this supervisor agent, his whole

614
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:34,650
entire, right, so here he's he's talking

615
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,229
to everyone there,

616
00:21:35,568 --> 00:21:36,250
there, there he is.

617
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:38,469
I don't know why he's a he. I decided to use a he.

618
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:40,789
This supervisor's entire

619
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:43,529
point is to speak to humans, to

620
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:45,571
interpret human language, but in the Background

621
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:48,291
it's got connection to a specialized

622
00:21:48,511 --> 00:21:50,672
infrastructure agent, and that infrastructure

623
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:52,752
agent, while the supervisor's using a

624
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:54,752
large language model, so bedrock to

625
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:56,821
interpret all of this in the background, it's

626
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:58,952
reaching out to a small language model

627
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:01,002
that we're hosting just directly on

628
00:22:01,002 --> 00:22:03,252
EKS y'all. It's just in

629
00:22:03,252 --> 00:22:05,271
a Docker image. I just deployed it into

630
00:22:05,271 --> 00:22:07,655
an EKS cluster just like a Other workload,

631
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:09,935
it's talking to this, this small, this

632
00:22:09,935 --> 00:22:12,134
agent that's speaking to this small language

633
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:14,494
model, and it's generating and it's entire

634
00:22:14,494 --> 00:22:16,576
ideas. I need to interpret this. I'm gonna be

635
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,935
pass something from the LLM. I need to

636
00:22:18,935 --> 00:22:21,336
understand and think about the infrastructure

637
00:22:21,336 --> 00:22:23,336
side of it. And also I've got access

638
00:22:23,336 --> 00:22:25,855
to what's going on in context of

639
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:28,244
of of our terraform deployment in our

640
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:30,130
organization. Now speaking of which,

641
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:32,608
this is where we're going to use that platform

642
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:34,709
that Kyle showed that incredibly beautiful

643
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:37,189
slide on, which is HCP Terraform.

644
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:39,828
So Kyle, just give, give folks a little idea

645
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:42,068
of, of this product, how it works

646
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:42,910
with Terraform.

647
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,239
Yeah, so HCP Terraform is,

648
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,838
is essentially a hosted service that allows you to

649
00:22:47,838 --> 00:22:50,489
plan and apply all of your terraform

650
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:52,858
operations in a, you know, a centralized

651
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:53,430
service,

652
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:55,880
and what we'll walk through is, is kind of how

653
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,880
some of those features and capabilities are kind

654
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,229
of brought to life as we're managing these

655
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:02,279
various workloads as we go through

656
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:04,469
our demos. Yeah, and so real quick, how many of y'all

657
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:05,640
here use Terraform?

658
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,358
That's what I'm talking about. All right, so you

659
00:23:09,358 --> 00:23:11,358
know that the beauty of terraform is

660
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:13,400
that it is code, and as a result,

661
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:16,078
when you're talking to your, to your

662
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:18,078
co-pilot or GPT or whatever thing and

663
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:20,559
you're using it to help generate the code, it helps

664
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,598
represent the actual state of the infrastructure

665
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:24,640
itself. It gives you a way to persist, whatever it is that it

666
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,229
did generate, whether it's good or not.

667
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:29,489
Now if you just let that go rogue here, if I Over

668
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:31,489
to to this to

669
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,630
to my little AI infrastructure agent here

670
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:36,009
and I say, hey, do stuff it's gonna do it

671
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,088
now whether or not it's gonna be good or not,

672
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:39,868
that's kind of the question. Well,

673
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:42,209
the platform here HTP Terraform is going to

674
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:44,250
serve as our human in the loop. It's going to be

675
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,608
able to make it so that when we go into our actual

676
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:48,969
like, you know, orchestrated workloads

677
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:49,509
here

678
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:51,529
if I can find the one where I deployed.

679
00:23:51,818 --> 00:23:53,858
The uh the actual spaces. Oh, that's

680
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:56,059
right, I deleted the application, you did, yeah,

681
00:23:56,098 --> 00:23:58,029
I deleted it. We'll, we'll deploy it later,

682
00:23:58,338 --> 00:24:00,539
but regardless, if it's generated by the actual

683
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,618
AI, we can do stuff like, you know,

684
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,699
look through the cost the cost estimation

685
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:07,809
and look through set up policies to make it

686
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:09,979
to where even if it does spit out a bunch of code, we're

687
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:12,309
only letting it through if it passes certain,

688
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,380
certain hoops and the like.

689
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,088
So let's talk about the the architecture

690
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:17,969
a little bit here.

691
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,699
You can see here we've got the cluster

692
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:23,229
that's actually running this little AI

693
00:24:23,318 --> 00:24:25,368
application. So Kyle, we've got, it's just another

694
00:24:25,368 --> 00:24:27,410
EKS cluster, but immediately there's some

695
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,509
differences here in terms of like the node groups.

696
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:31,729
So yeah, so we have two different node groups

697
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:33,729
that that are down there. One is gonna be your, your

698
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:36,368
CPU node group, and the other one is gonna be your GPU

699
00:24:36,368 --> 00:24:37,309
node group.

700
00:24:37,729 --> 00:24:38,318
But you know,

701
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:39,189
essentially again,

702
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:41,541
you're just managing that. The same way that you have

703
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,281
all node groups, yeah,

704
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,821
so if you've never done this before, the way to think

705
00:24:45,821 --> 00:24:47,972
about this when you're gonna go to set one of these

706
00:24:47,972 --> 00:24:49,761
things up again, if you're just using

707
00:24:50,182 --> 00:24:51,742
like Bedrock or something like that,

708
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:54,261
you can just skip the GPU thing altogether,

709
00:24:54,311 --> 00:24:56,343
which is the value of it, right? You just deploy

710
00:24:56,343 --> 00:24:58,422
a normal app, it makes API calls, and

711
00:24:58,422 --> 00:25:00,583
it's just another day in Kubernete's world.

712
00:25:00,843 --> 00:25:02,492
Now if you wanna host your own model,

713
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,301
you're gonna actually need to get a GPU

714
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:07,175
instance. In our case we're using,

715
00:25:07,836 --> 00:25:09,605
we're using IBM's Granite,

716
00:25:09,905 --> 00:25:11,994
and the reason why we're able to do this, and this is the

717
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:13,994
smallest GPU instance that that

718
00:25:13,994 --> 00:25:15,994
AWS has, we're still, we've got our own

719
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:17,994
model running is because Granite here

720
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:20,036
is only 3 gigs, right,

721
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:22,115
so it's really small. You get it up and

722
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:24,115
running and you've got more than enough. Now

723
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:26,155
you might say, well, what's the difference between the

724
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:28,435
small language model and the large language model? For

725
00:25:28,435 --> 00:25:30,655
most intents and purposes, you're not gonna

726
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:31,415
notice it.

727
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,799
If you're

728
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,420
like depending upon the space, it's trained

729
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,660
on a much smaller data set, so if you start asking

730
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,818
it really weird stuff about Reddit, it's

731
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:41,979
probably not gonna know it. It's gonna confidently

732
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:43,358
tell you something though, right?

733
00:25:43,828 --> 00:25:46,108
Um, yeah, do you have any thought on the small language

734
00:25:46,108 --> 00:25:47,729
models there, uh, Kyle?

735
00:25:48,108 --> 00:25:50,150
Uh, I, I think they're really unique in the way

736
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,348
that, uh, you know, you can kind of use them in, in

737
00:25:52,348 --> 00:25:53,390
various facets,

738
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,989
um, and especially use them in low cost ways

739
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:58,140
like I, I mean, I've personally ran

740
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,689
a couple of these like the smaller,

741
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,108
uh, LLMs or SLMs

742
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:04,184
on, on like a raspberry pie, you know. You

743
00:26:04,184 --> 00:26:05,184
can run that locally.

744
00:26:05,505 --> 00:26:07,505
You can do all kinds of, you know, really neat things

745
00:26:07,505 --> 00:26:09,805
with it. You can start playing around with kind of code

746
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:10,654
generation in a very,

747
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:13,384
you know, low risk type of environment

748
00:26:13,384 --> 00:26:15,384
without incurring a lot of cost. Mm hmm.

749
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:17,674
In fact, I've got an SLM. I've got Granite

750
00:26:17,674 --> 00:26:19,084
actually running on my MacBook

751
00:26:19,493 --> 00:26:21,134
right now, so,

752
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:23,505
you know, my battery's not even budging, so that's pretty

753
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:24,125
good. OK,

754
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,265
so.

755
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,838
But I will say for the agent part you're like, well

756
00:26:27,838 --> 00:26:30,000
do I need a, do I need a GP

757
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,509
for the agent? Actually, no,

758
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,000
the agent still sits on the CPU

759
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,039
nodes, OK, it's just the model that's

760
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:36,880
on the GPU

761
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,400
and now suddenly you're treating that

762
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,630
small language model just like you're treating Bedrock,

763
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,019
right? So that's, that's the way to reason. About these things,

764
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:46,500
um, pretty, pretty straightforward

765
00:26:46,598 --> 00:26:47,140
there,

766
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,640
uh, I think, and what we're gonna do throughout

767
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,670
this is we're gonna use this application and this

768
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,769
playground as a test ground just to,

769
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,459
to drive our points home about the different

770
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:57,939
aspects and areas of things. So

771
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:00,660
let's hop back over to the slides.

772
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,150
All right, so that was a look at the, the two

773
00:27:03,608 --> 00:27:04,799
planes that we had talked about,

774
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,410
you know, the model plane, ops plane.

775
00:27:07,848 --> 00:27:09,930
So let's start talking about some of

776
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,949
the, uh, you know, the various,

777
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:14,489
you know, paths, if you will, as we, we

778
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:16,568
start going through kind of adoption and, and kind of

779
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,699
what the variances kind of look like there.

780
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,529
Now when it comes down to the two of us

781
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:24,529
between myself and Cole, I find myself as the

782
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:27,289
ops person that I'm probably more on the deterministic

783
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:29,509
side. I, I won't

784
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,650
necessarily call myself normal, but I will liken

785
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,689
myself to say a normal

786
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:35,848
program where you know you're gonna have your, your.

787
00:27:35,924 --> 00:27:37,973
Your goals, you're gonna have some tools that

788
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:39,993
go along with that, but you're gonna have a

789
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,703
pretty well defined path

790
00:27:41,963 --> 00:27:43,963
in terms of how you go from point A

791
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:46,184
to point B and trying to provide,

792
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:48,473
you know, whatever value that you're trying to,

793
00:27:48,574 --> 00:27:51,265
to, uh, to provide as part of a service.

794
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,318
Yeah, and that's, that makes it a lot more

795
00:27:54,318 --> 00:27:56,709
predictable for the offside, right, because there's

796
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,838
only so many control paths, so you know what's

797
00:27:58,838 --> 00:27:59,459
gonna happen

798
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:02,358
on say Black Friday. You kind of have an

799
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:04,598
idea you can extrapolate because it can only get

800
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:06,598
so bad or good, however it is

801
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:07,479
that you wanna see it.

802
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,160
But what we wanted to do here is comfort you

803
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,279
all with the first principle of actually not a lot

804
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,279
changes in an agent program. If you think about the

805
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:16,078
business logic in a normal program,

806
00:28:16,338 --> 00:28:17,799
it's just saying if A,

807
00:28:18,118 --> 00:28:20,759
use this tool, if B use this tool, evaluate

808
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:22,838
if we've got it done. The only thing we're

809
00:28:22,838 --> 00:28:24,920
changing in an agent program, so you're not scared

810
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,959
of it is instead of your programmer writing

811
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:29,239
a control flow for the hundreds of different.

812
00:28:29,314 --> 00:28:31,334
Was that your customer can send you a complaint

813
00:28:31,814 --> 00:28:33,875
you just give the tools to the

814
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:35,993
LLM. We say, hey, this is my goal,

815
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:38,114
right? I've got some tools to solve it.

816
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:40,314
This is what I know about the customer.

817
00:28:40,713 --> 00:28:42,834
What do you think we should, what tool do you think we should use? And

818
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:44,824
it's just gonna go in a loop. It's gonna say, well,

819
00:28:45,114 --> 00:28:46,775
Kyle's asking about, you know,

820
00:28:47,154 --> 00:28:48,223
shaving kits

821
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:50,434
in in haiku format.

822
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,088
And it's like, OK, and it's still gonna be able to

823
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:54,430
figure that out better than

824
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:56,969
asking your programming team to write a control flow

825
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:59,049
for it, and it's going to keep going, but I, we

826
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:01,049
have the word stochastic up here, mainly because I didn't

827
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:03,489
want to use determinism again and say nondeterministic

828
00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:05,049
because that would be your side,

829
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:06,949
because you don't necessarily know

830
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,410
how many times it's gonna happen. Like sometimes

831
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,789
it's gonna get it done pretty quickly,

832
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,989
sometimes it's gonna get caught in an infinite loop.

833
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,140
But when do you choose

834
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,250
agents then? Because if Kyle, like,

835
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:20,989
you love determinism, right?

836
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,779
In fact, do you believe in fate?

837
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,059
I, I greatly enjoy a fixed path

838
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:28,150
on, on how we go from point A to point

839
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,348
B. That's definitely how I found myself as,

840
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,809
as at least I consider myself successful

841
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:35,269
on the operation side of the house was being

842
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:37,108
able to follow that line.

843
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,588
Yeah, so the question is, well, why would you ever

844
00:29:39,588 --> 00:29:40,630
use one then? Well,

845
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,068
this is where if you look at the, the market in terms

846
00:29:43,068 --> 00:29:44,828
of a lot of the new applications coming up,

847
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:46,170
one of the root

848
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,930
ideas that they're trying to deal with is messy input.

849
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:51,233
All right, when you go to a. Form and you're

850
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:53,394
filling it out and you've got a defined number of

851
00:29:53,394 --> 00:29:55,654
drop downs. The reality is, is because

852
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:58,305
I don't wanna deal with all the different, the, the

853
00:29:58,305 --> 00:30:00,414
ways that you could ask me stuff. I only wanna write

854
00:30:00,414 --> 00:30:02,404
so many if statements and wish statements.

855
00:30:02,755 --> 00:30:04,914
But now with an agent you can send

856
00:30:04,914 --> 00:30:07,154
me whatever gobbledygook you want to,

857
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:09,275
and we can figure out something. So personalization,

858
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:11,914
so messy inputs a big one, and then personalization

859
00:30:11,914 --> 00:30:14,233
the way you want to be spoken to, OK? People

860
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:16,594
get up and they talk, I don't know, for 10 minutes

861
00:30:16,594 --> 00:30:17,233
about.

862
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,239
I have what

863
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:20,279
the Dodgers.

864
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:22,588
Well, you can't say shaving kits anymore. Yeah,

865
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,078
I can't say shaving kits, so we'll go to,

866
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:26,750
to, to, to baseball. You have no idea what they're saying,

867
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,949
OK? You can get it like, hey, can

868
00:30:28,949 --> 00:30:30,959
you just tell it to me in plain English or

869
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,299
whatever now that can actually happen.

870
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,719
And, but if your developer's gotta do that, that's,

871
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,199
that's gonna be, it's gonna be,

872
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:38,900
you know, not as well. But long tail

873
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,130
questions and edge cases, Kyle, how much do you love

874
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,059
filing tickets and dealing with tickets for that,

875
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,578
uh, as the receiver of tickets.

876
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,279
I do not love that,

877
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,769
right? And that's something we both vibe on, right?

878
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,338
We code and develop for the 80%,

879
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:54,539
and then the other 20% are a nonstop

880
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:56,640
stream of tickets. And then of course

881
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,000
there's tons of data,

882
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,439
tons and tons of data. If you think about the

883
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:02,439
way that these things are going nowadays, tons and tons

884
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:04,559
of data is a lot easier to deal with, right? It's just

885
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,618
all pattern matching.

886
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,068
But bigger blast radius

887
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,209
is still at the end of the day

888
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:13,709
all that changes here is this

889
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:15,818
If you understand those two, those two

890
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:18,150
things we just said, you can kind of fill in the blanks

891
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,189
of everything else that we're gonna do here, right? You can

892
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:22,229
kind of understand. So the analogy we wanted

893
00:31:22,229 --> 00:31:24,309
to throw as a working through line through all

894
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:26,549
of this was think of your infrastructure

895
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:28,750
and the into it like a venue, OK?

896
00:31:28,949 --> 00:31:30,979
You have the rate at which people Coming in

897
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:33,059
and moving about, you have the reach

898
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,338
in terms of what they can access

899
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:37,420
inside of it and out from it. And you have

900
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,568
the resourcing, which is how big should the venue be,

901
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,380
how much bigger should we make it, how many rooms should we open

902
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,160
it up, how much does it cost, and the like.

903
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:47,088
It's something that we experience every day

904
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:49,259
as we go, come into and leave

905
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:49,979
this event.

906
00:31:50,939 --> 00:31:52,598
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we do, don't we?

907
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,549
So let's step into actually

908
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:57,588
going through these three.

909
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,630
So in terms of rate, Kyle,

910
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,949
when you're looking at your infrastructure, how does that

911
00:32:01,949 --> 00:32:04,000
look in a normal programs world?

912
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:06,390
Yeah, so in, in the normal programs world, that's

913
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,640
something that you have well defined. You know

914
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,789
exactly what that workflow is going to look

915
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:12,848
like. You're going To know that a person is going to have to

916
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:15,170
reach out to say a web page to

917
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,170
access something. That web page is then going to hit

918
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,410
something on the back end that's probably a database,

919
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,769
and then from that point there's probably going

920
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:23,769
to be some level of computation that

921
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:26,170
is required and so you know exactly

922
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,250
the step by step process that that workflow

923
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,150
is going to take.

924
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,049
And yet on the agent's side, all those things

925
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:34,328
and tools and capabilities might be available

926
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:35,049
to the agent,

927
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,449
but you don't know which one it's gonna try first.

928
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,689
You you generally know that if your agent

929
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:41,848
walks into a kitchen, it's gonna get a plate out

930
00:32:41,848 --> 00:32:43,848
first, but sometimes it comes out and gets

931
00:32:43,848 --> 00:32:46,000
the meat out and puts it right on the counter. And it

932
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,209
eventually gets the sandwich. And so as a

933
00:32:48,209 --> 00:32:50,529
result, the rate at which it does it is

934
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:52,608
gonna be a little bit more unpredictable. It might

935
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:54,769
call the same tool 3 or 4 times

936
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:56,809
as it's trying to figure out, as opposed to just

937
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:57,469
1 time.

938
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,868
But of course the implications for that are

939
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:01,269
the problems.

940
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,009
Yeah, and that's that's

941
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:08,650
that that and part of the problems there

942
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,729
is, is that when you kind of don't know what that

943
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:12,969
path is going to be, you run into

944
00:33:12,969 --> 00:33:15,049
those issues of what happens when

945
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:16,150
requests start queuing up

946
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:18,608
or you have too many like, you

947
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:20,680
know, using the venue example, you know what

948
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,729
happens when everybody tries to get into a

949
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:24,769
keynote at the very same time and

950
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,189
it starts flooding the system.

951
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,239
You know, and then then at that point you have to look into,

952
00:33:29,618 --> 00:33:31,818
you know, OK, so what's the, what's the response

953
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:33,848
to that if there's too many people waiting, maybe

954
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:36,098
you need to bring in additional workers to

955
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,410
then start, you know, helping, you know, queue

956
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,618
the line in, in more appropriate terms.

957
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,098
However, if you move workers from one place to

958
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:45,328
another, what happens to the, uh, the workers

959
00:33:45,328 --> 00:33:47,338
that were existing and what happens to the

960
00:33:47,338 --> 00:33:49,463
lines at at work. They, you know, used

961
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:50,104
to exist,

962
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:53,914
turned it into a very noisy neighbor type scenario.

963
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:55,914
Yep, noisy neighbors. Good job.

964
00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:58,344
And there's retries too,

965
00:33:58,614 --> 00:34:00,644
right? We're as humans, at least polite enough

966
00:34:00,644 --> 00:34:02,854
to stop asking after a few times. Well,

967
00:34:03,203 --> 00:34:04,584
maybe not all of us, but

968
00:34:04,963 --> 00:34:07,174
agents are gonna just keep going. They're just gonna be like, hey,

969
00:34:07,324 --> 00:34:07,943
can we get in?

970
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:09,264
So, all right.

971
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,610
So this comes down to 3 big problems.

972
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,659
And in context of the, the through line of

973
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,688
our analogy here, we want you to think about pacing the

974
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,340
front door in your infrastructure.

975
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,898
We want you to pace the number of

976
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:23,898
workers that you've got going about, right? You don't

977
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:24,458
want to just

978
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:26,938
optimistically hire like, I don't know how many

979
00:34:26,938 --> 00:34:29,139
bartenders for the venue if no one's gonna show up,

980
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:31,228
right? And then the retries, that's the

981
00:34:31,228 --> 00:34:33,349
other thing, the main things that you need to deal with as

982
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:35,208
the ops people. The other stuff,

983
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,668
and the reason we're focusing in on these, because again,

984
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,829
those two planes, it is what

985
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,909
can you control? Well, these are the areas that you

986
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:44,019
can control without diving into the software and ever having

987
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:46,429
to talk to the programmers themselves. Let's

988
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,369
go through those.

989
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,449
First one, pacing the front door,

990
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,389
Kyle. So

991
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:52,869
I have got a program,

992
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:55,409
you know that it's gonna get hammered by all sorts of stuff

993
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:56,809
because we've labeled it with AI

994
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,208
and we've had our marketing folks pushing it out

995
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:01,329
so, so much like Jay Fry here

996
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:03,438
is in the audience who is one of the marketing folks.

997
00:35:03,494 --> 00:35:05,534
And so we've got a ton of volume coming in,

998
00:35:05,695 --> 00:35:07,934
but you can't touch the code because I won't let you. So

999
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:09,074
how are you gonna deal with it?

1000
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,574
Well, and that's where you, you put levels

1001
00:35:11,574 --> 00:35:13,773
of guardrails around that, you know, at that point

1002
00:35:13,773 --> 00:35:15,813
you, you establish control in

1003
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,894
how many things can be processed at, at

1004
00:35:17,894 --> 00:35:18,773
the same time.

1005
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,360
Um, you start going through and,

1006
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,369
you know, enforcing best practices. You make

1007
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:23,918
sure that, you know,

1008
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,369
everybody has a good understanding of what they're

1009
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:28,449
supposed to do, what the process is going to

1010
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:30,550
be, you know, this is a very similar

1011
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,648
to like a TSA type scenario where if you know

1012
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:34,648
that you're going through the TSA line, you're gonna have to

1013
00:35:34,648 --> 00:35:36,769
take off your shoes, you're gonna have to remove stuff from your

1014
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:38,889
bag. It's a very similar process

1015
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:41,550
just now applied to your workflows.

1016
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,050
Are you saying that because you got stopped and specially

1017
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,050
searched when we were coming in here? Uh, that did not

1018
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,235
help us get here on time. That was. That was

1019
00:35:48,235 --> 00:35:49,083
special. Yeah,

1020
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:51,474
that was from the, and then of course from the

1021
00:35:51,474 --> 00:35:53,394
infrastructures code side of things,

1022
00:35:53,894 --> 00:35:55,974
look, you're gonna see this as a recurring piece,

1023
00:35:56,474 --> 00:35:58,675
but in is, is the module on the policy

1024
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:00,753
story. If you've got stuff like cues

1025
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:02,753
and so me being the programmer

1026
00:36:02,753 --> 00:36:04,914
and we already don't want to talk a bunch, and

1027
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:07,195
I'm like, yeah, but I don't know what that is, you say, here's

1028
00:36:07,195 --> 00:36:09,235
a module, go do it, right? Or if

1029
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:11,474
I'm the optimistic one who's like, I wanna own the upside,

1030
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:13,554
I'm gonna just start coding up terraform and I'm just gonna

1031
00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:14,414
push it out the door,

1032
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:16,293
and you don't know about it. Well.

1033
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:18,780
That's where policies come into play, which actually,

1034
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,059
Kyle, maybe this is kind of a good time to like drop

1035
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:22,349
what policies are so we don't

1036
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:24,699
keep. Yeah, so, so before we get too far, this is

1037
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:26,860
what I was referring to when I said guardrails.

1038
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:29,199
So policy is code is a way that you can take,

1039
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:31,458
you know, in essence, let's talk terraform for a

1040
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,539
second. You can take your terraform, apply, you

1041
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:35,699
can get the results from that apply, and then

1042
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:37,820
push it through a set of policies that

1043
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,820
you have established as code. This allows

1044
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,820
you to say that, you know, in certain cases, you know,

1045
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:42,809
hey, you can only,

1046
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:45,179
you know, deploy certain types of EC2

1047
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:47,445
instances. You can only define or

1048
00:36:47,445 --> 00:36:48,764
you know have access to

1049
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,715
to certain uh compute nodes you can only do

1050
00:36:51,715 --> 00:36:53,925
or have access to certain policies,

1051
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,514
you know, things along those lines that you can establish

1052
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,425
those as guard rails as

1053
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:00,554
your resources are being, you know,

1054
00:37:00,813 --> 00:37:02,885
prior to the actual deployment stage, but

1055
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:04,965
you're verifying them before they get to that

1056
00:37:04,965 --> 00:37:07,083
deployment stage so that if you have

1057
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,244
known situations where you don't want

1058
00:37:09,244 --> 00:37:11,244
people to apply them, you can stop them in their

1059
00:37:11,244 --> 00:37:13,523
tracks before it ever reaches your

1060
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,125
environment.

1061
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:16,550
So they're really powerful. We have a bunch of

1062
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,599
uh various policy sets that are out there

1063
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,958
that we'll get into in a demo.

1064
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,398
You can apply them to various compliance standards

1065
00:37:22,398 --> 00:37:24,000
or you can build your own.

1066
00:37:24,438 --> 00:37:25,119
All right.

1067
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,679
So I just realized we're, we're burning through time

1068
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,398
here. So we'll,

1069
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,289
we'll, uh,

1070
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,159
so, so then the other thing is, of course, pacing

1071
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:34,478
the workers. If you come in and you've got all sorts of different snap

1072
00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:35,590
and water stations,

1073
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:38,079
how do you make sure that you don't overprovision

1074
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,159
the number of workers? Well, there's, we're gonna get

1075
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:42,199
a little, a little bit more into this later on, but it

1076
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,280
still kind of comes down to the same idea, right? You

1077
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,519
wanna look at the line, you wanna pace it, you wanna

1078
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:48,840
force the line to make sure that, well,

1079
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,579
the workers are only getting so much.

1080
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,070
So let's go to the 3rd point.

1081
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,360
And then of course there is the ones, the story

1082
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,478
where you are gonna have to talk to your developer

1083
00:37:58,478 --> 00:38:00,789
at some point, and those are the retries.

1084
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,978
This is how many times are you gonna let

1085
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:05,458
an agent retry before you're like, OK,

1086
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,699
done, like chill out, go do something else.

1087
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:10,559
I don't know, Kyle, what's, what's a good, what's, how

1088
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,458
have you dealt with that in the past in terms of like microservices?

1089
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,329
I mean you can either establish a, you

1090
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:18,570
know, like a, a, a counter. Counters

1091
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,570
are always very simple, you know, hey, if you

1092
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,688
do this thing more than 3 times, then we're gonna,

1093
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:24,809
we're gonna hit you with a pause. You can do it

1094
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:26,929
based on memory capacity or, or

1095
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,969
allowances there. There's several different ways that you can

1096
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:31,090
kind of use it. That's one of those things that comes

1097
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,208
down to, to having a general understanding of

1098
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:35,329
what your, your, you know, estate kind of looks

1099
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:37,628
like when it comes down to infrastructure and

1100
00:38:37,688 --> 00:38:39,889
what those things are actually trying to accomplish.

1101
00:38:40,398 --> 00:38:42,489
There is one fun thing too if you,

1102
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,769
if you can ask your developers when you ask them for this,

1103
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,228
tell them to make the retry

1104
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:48,989
timing a little bit random

1105
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,728
because if you don't, then they're all gonna retry

1106
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:53,728
at the same time. And while that's very

1107
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:55,769
funny at best, like generally that's gonna

1108
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:57,989
create more problems with the other services, so

1109
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,559
I don't know, injecting uncertainty into

1110
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:02,570
my deterministic workflow. I'm not

1111
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,688
sure how I feel about that, but just a little, just

1112
00:39:04,688 --> 00:39:05,628
a little for the fun.

1113
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,969
So this comes down to the 3 main solutions

1114
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:10,510
to think about paste the front door,

1115
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:13,159
right, paste the number of workers themselves, and

1116
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:15,188
paste the retries in waves.

1117
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,179
Thoughts and we're gonna take a look at some of the stuff in the demo

1118
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:20,378
so we can get to the other things, yeah, yep,

1119
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:22,418
OK, so jump into the demo,

1120
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:24,510
the, the rate side of things.

1121
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:27,369
Actually, LA is a that was LA. That's actually a good

1122
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:29,110
thing. The rate, right in between there

1123
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:32,228
is just to, to mainly show this is

1124
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:34,489
there's a lot of different ways to think about rate.

1125
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:36,550
There's not just the rate at which

1126
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:39,159
the requests are being processed throughout your

1127
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:41,309
network, right? And so if we were to go to say our logs here

1128
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,728
and go into any one of these different logs like

1129
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:45,769
around the API server or, you

1130
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:47,780
know, so. The way that our different applications

1131
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,938
are going through, you would, you're gonna see these

1132
00:39:49,938 --> 00:39:51,978
hammer through and do a lot more,

1133
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:54,019
and that's the nature of those agents trying to do a

1134
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,139
lot more work that you can't necessarily predict.

1135
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,500
But part of that's also going to be the human side. If you

1136
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,978
have someone coming in interacting with your interface

1137
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:03,179
and they're they're trying to build out an infrastructure,

1138
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:04,878
right, if they're trying to say like, OK,

1139
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:07,280
I'd like to deploy an app

1140
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,909
to

1141
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,639
Uh, my EKS cluster.

1142
00:40:10,938 --> 00:40:13,179
Well, I might do this one little

1143
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:15,550
thing at a time, right? But it,

1144
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:17,978
I might do it in 10 steps, I might do it in 20

1145
00:40:17,978 --> 00:40:20,059
steps. That's a lot of more retries

1146
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:22,219
as opposed to one web form where I

1147
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,458
take you and make you fill it all out

1148
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:25,289
very nicely.

1149
00:40:25,864 --> 00:40:27,945
Where you also fail a captcha, which is, you

1150
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:30,034
know, always oddly embarrassing for everyone,

1151
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:32,425
and then we get one request, we know exactly

1152
00:40:32,425 --> 00:40:33,445
what's going to happen.

1153
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:35,945
So here we, by the way, so we see this thing

1154
00:40:35,945 --> 00:40:38,023
right now going and grabbing information from our

1155
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:39,264
HTP terraform account.

1156
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:41,894
So what other, what other stuff should we, oh, the,

1157
00:40:41,905 --> 00:40:42,474
um,

1158
00:40:43,135 --> 00:40:45,184
the policy side of things if we go and we take

1159
00:40:45,184 --> 00:40:47,264
a look at like, well, Kyle, I don't, I

1160
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:49,304
don't know how to do a queue, right?

1161
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:51,583
I don't know how to do something like that. We have stuff like

1162
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:52,965
modules that you can use, right?

1163
00:40:53,688 --> 00:40:55,800
Yeah, and, and modules are, are very simple,

1164
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:58,429
easy way to, to kind of easily consume

1165
00:40:58,429 --> 00:41:00,369
a common set of resources.

1166
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:03,228
So 11 of the things that we've kind of called modules

1167
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:05,289
over time is, you know, it's kind of the building block

1168
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:07,369
of terraform configurations just

1169
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:09,369
because it, it can take some of those much

1170
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:11,829
longer, more verbose kind of configurations

1171
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,050
and isolate them down and consolidate

1172
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,090
them into a much more easier

1173
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,030
to consume

1174
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:19,489
type of block. So instead of, you know, having

1175
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:20,360
to, to generate a.

1176
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,128
Didn't see how many resources are in this one,

1177
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:26,648
but you have 42 inputs for this thing,

1178
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:29,099
just this, that one single module, and you

1179
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:31,099
can consolidate that all into the module block

1180
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:33,340
that's right there on the right hand side. So you're, you're

1181
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,500
taking 42 different inputs and

1182
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,579
breaking it down into literally 4 lines of

1183
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:40,539
code in order to get this, uh, SQS

1184
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,398
resource deployed.

1185
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,860
So that's the human in the loop side of it

1186
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,579
in the sense that you get to give both a.

1187
00:41:45,914 --> 00:41:47,215
And a stick they're like, hey,

1188
00:41:47,594 --> 00:41:49,905
um, go use our modules.

1189
00:41:50,184 --> 00:41:52,195
So this is like a networking, for example, where maybe

1190
00:41:52,195 --> 00:41:53,773
we paste the reach maybe we put

1191
00:41:54,235 --> 00:41:56,273
a networking firewall or a gateway in front of

1192
00:41:56,273 --> 00:41:58,313
it and said so only so many things can come in.

1193
00:41:58,635 --> 00:42:00,994
So that's the nice carrot way go use this approved

1194
00:42:00,994 --> 00:42:03,574
thing and then you can also of course set up policies

1195
00:42:03,715 --> 00:42:05,793
and this is where you get the stick sides's like, well,

1196
00:42:05,804 --> 00:42:07,954
you can deploy stuff, but we're gonna stop it

1197
00:42:07,954 --> 00:42:08,465
anyways,

1198
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,800
so. Yeah, and this is where

1199
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,119
you come into, you know, having a level of permissions

1200
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,929
that are set within an environment,

1201
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,639
uh, and the other thing that Cole was showing was, was also

1202
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:19,820
a private registry, so you have access to both

1203
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:22,300
modules that are in the public registry

1204
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,679
or modules that are in a private registry

1205
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:27,199
and that private registry allows you to customize

1206
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,019
those those resources

1207
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,679
for your particular organization or

1208
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:32,840
particular use case.

1209
00:42:33,394 --> 00:42:35,474
Then getting into the policy side of the

1210
00:42:35,474 --> 00:42:37,753
house, there are also a bunch of sentinel policies

1211
00:42:37,753 --> 00:42:40,195
that are available out on the registry

1212
00:42:40,195 --> 00:42:42,195
as well. This is where we were talking about some

1213
00:42:42,195 --> 00:42:44,235
of those compliance standards that are out there.

1214
00:42:44,273 --> 00:42:46,414
We see the CIS, uh, version

1215
00:42:46,414 --> 00:42:48,813
there or, uh, yep, exactly

1216
00:42:49,253 --> 00:42:51,454
that's out there that's available. There's a whole bunch of,

1217
00:42:51,474 --> 00:42:53,594
uh, policies that are available as part of that. You

1218
00:42:53,594 --> 00:42:55,934
can easily invoke those within your.

1219
00:42:56,188 --> 00:42:58,250
Your HCP terraform environment

1220
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,550
or of course because these are also

1221
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,628
you know publicly available on GitHub, you

1222
00:43:02,628 --> 00:43:04,628
can also customize these to however you want

1223
00:43:04,628 --> 00:43:06,699
to and start applying them in

1224
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:08,869
your HCP environment which is what Cole

1225
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:10,949
was showing just prior to this as part

1226
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:12,398
of the policy sets

1227
00:43:12,668 --> 00:43:14,668
so there you can see that we've kind of consolidated

1228
00:43:14,668 --> 00:43:16,750
those policies and applied them by

1229
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,789
resource type so you have your RDS

1230
00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:20,864
policy. Set you have your S3 policy

1231
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,144
set and you can do that and apply those

1232
00:43:23,425 --> 00:43:24,324
and you know

1233
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,664
you can apply those broadly as well so you

1234
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:28,824
can apply these at like your entire

1235
00:43:28,824 --> 00:43:30,945
organization level or individual workspace

1236
00:43:30,945 --> 00:43:33,023
level but like the nice

1237
00:43:33,023 --> 00:43:35,144
part is that if there's no S3 buckets in in

1238
00:43:35,144 --> 00:43:37,445
your resources there's nothing for it to check

1239
00:43:37,704 --> 00:43:40,224
so there's also not really any harm or overhead

1240
00:43:40,224 --> 00:43:42,003
when you apply it in in that type of way.

1241
00:43:43,409 --> 00:43:45,409
All right, so for time, let's hop

1242
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:46,000
back over

1243
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:48,418
into our stuff, and we're gonna,

1244
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:51,019
I mean we were like, are we gonna be able to fill 60

1245
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:53,179
minutes? It's like, well, if we're late and we

1246
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:55,159
talk for a long time on one thing maybe.

1247
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,168
So let's go ahead act two here.

1248
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,398
This is the reach side of things. So this

1249
00:44:00,398 --> 00:44:02,599
is in context of what your services

1250
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,090
reach out to, Kyle. So

1251
00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:06,478
yeah, so on the, uh, you know, the quote unquote

1252
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:08,599
normal side, we kind of know exactly

1253
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:10,719
what our service is going to reach out to. Those things

1254
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:12,820
have been predefined. We have probably

1255
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,208
created. Created some either IM roles

1256
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:17,250
or or you know different you know depending

1257
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,688
upon which environment you're using established

1258
00:44:19,688 --> 00:44:21,889
a set of permissions in order for that we

1259
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:23,949
know that this thing is only going to talk to

1260
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:26,340
these couple services which is, you know, kind of

1261
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,159
uh displayed there with the arrows

1262
00:44:28,909 --> 00:44:29,668
agents,

1263
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,309
I mean in theory you know what they're gonna reach out to.

1264
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,320
Well, well, you hope you know what they're going to

1265
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,398
reach out to, but that doesn't mean it's not

1266
00:44:37,398 --> 00:44:39,418
a determined path yet. Yeah, and you're like,

1267
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:41,840
but it's like, well, well, hold on, it can, they only,

1268
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,208
you know, they don't have access to so many tools. It's like, yeah,

1269
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:46,478
but what you don't know is Cole gave it

1270
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:48,179
access to an HTTP tool,

1271
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:50,269
and now we can go anywhere that it wants.

1272
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:52,750
So let's walk through the solutions to the reach. Well, let's

1273
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,849
name the reach problems here, all right. And

1274
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:57,000
of course there's many agents too, so you gotta think

1275
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,340
about this, them all doing it, right? So,

1276
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:01,898
all right, so we have 4 main reach problems, Kyle.

1277
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,010
Yeah, so there's the overprivileged reach, you

1278
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:05,628
know, and

1279
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:08,449
I, I, I mean just natural

1280
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:10,469
motion right there at this point, you know,

1281
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,750
um, you know, somebody has maybe too

1282
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,829
many permissions or too much access

1283
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:16,829
to all of those, uh, resources that maybe

1284
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:18,628
they shouldn't have access to.

1285
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:21,648
Unfettered tools. This is what Cole was just

1286
00:45:21,648 --> 00:45:23,688
talking about with HTTP. You can do a lot

1287
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:25,938
of things with HTTP these days,

1288
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:28,250
uh, and it's getting simpler and simpler as we

1289
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,250
were just walking through some of the, the, you

1290
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,409
know, removal of WebSocket requirements

1291
00:45:32,409 --> 00:45:34,889
for, for even some of those HTTP,

1292
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,070
uh, offerings

1293
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:39,010
default open, you know, these are just known

1294
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,289
open configurations where, you know, you

1295
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:43,510
just by default have access to stuff.

1296
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:45,619
Or then how do you get out?

1297
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,188
So how do you know, think about the next

1298
00:45:48,188 --> 00:45:50,309
steps, the next iterations along that

1299
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:52,349
process, that agent reaching out to something, and then

1300
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,148
where does that go from there?

1301
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:57,110
Nice. So let's go ahead and walk through

1302
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:59,510
each of the solutions real quick here for this. First

1303
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,989
up, for your agents, give them all their own identity.

1304
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,349
All right. Do not give them your user credentials. Don't

1305
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:06,510
give them your machine's credentials. Give them their

1306
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:07,628
own separate credentials.

1307
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:09,449
Give them their own separate credentials.

1308
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,128
This makes auditing boring

1309
00:46:12,128 --> 00:46:14,228
in a good way, right, because you know exactly

1310
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:16,228
what agent was doing what and when and where. If

1311
00:46:16,228 --> 00:46:18,309
it's bound to your user of the machine, then you've got

1312
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:20,309
that all stacked up in one place and it's a lot

1313
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:21,610
more difficult to deal with.

1314
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,280
Why don't you do the next, yeah, there we go.

1315
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,530
Yep and then you can bound it so you

1316
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,610
make sure that uh that they don't have access to

1317
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:31,780
tools that they shouldn't,

1318
00:46:32,128 --> 00:46:34,250
you know, making sure that you know if it's a specific

1319
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,110
service it only has access to

1320
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:38,409
those services that you have defined that it

1321
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:39,289
actually should

1322
00:46:39,648 --> 00:46:41,679
instead of just giving it kind of, you know,

1323
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:43,969
unfettered access to all the things you

1324
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:46,010
actually go through and make sure that you vetted

1325
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,188
the exact things that it should have access to

1326
00:46:48,449 --> 00:46:50,559
kind of still applying those levels of guard

1327
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,599
rails to those uh those agents and

1328
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:53,269
workloads.

1329
00:46:55,289 --> 00:46:57,340
There's the outbound story too. Even though you

1330
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,418
might have an MCP server that has cleared

1331
00:46:59,418 --> 00:47:01,619
agents to only use certain tools,

1332
00:47:01,978 --> 00:47:04,019
we can go another certain, like, look, if

1333
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:06,199
we're putting these agents in a kitchen, what if we just

1334
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:08,570
cut, don't put a knife in the kitchen at all? What's this,

1335
00:47:08,628 --> 00:47:10,719
this is the blunt force way and this is something you all have

1336
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:11,250
control over just.

1337
00:47:11,659 --> 00:47:13,780
Cut them off from the from a network level,

1338
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:16,148
from a firewall perspective, from even reaching

1339
00:47:16,148 --> 00:47:18,148
the tool. So even if it does try, even

1340
00:47:18,148 --> 00:47:20,269
if you've put a ticket in to say, hey, don't

1341
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:22,329
to the MCP server, whoever's

1342
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:24,329
managing the access to that or to the software,

1343
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,469
you know for a fact even if they try the network's

1344
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:27,019
gotta cut it off,

1345
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:30,179
cut off. Then

1346
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:32,300
you get into the exit points, you know, this is where you

1347
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,489
can consolidate those into a single gateway

1348
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:36,708
so that instead of, you know, your agent reaching

1349
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,708
out into, you know, various services and

1350
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:40,628
those services going outbound from that point,

1351
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:42,949
restrict them back in so that you know where

1352
00:47:42,949 --> 00:47:45,309
that entry and exit point actually

1353
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:47,429
are and you have better control over those

1354
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:49,619
things because you can establish various monitoring

1355
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,179
tools and, and how you apply it to that

1356
00:47:52,188 --> 00:47:54,409
process. All right,

1357
00:47:54,849 --> 00:47:56,969
so this is in essence

1358
00:47:56,969 --> 00:47:59,168
how to deal with each of those problems. And again, the

1359
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:00,188
value of this

1360
00:48:00,489 --> 00:48:02,699
is hopefully for the ops folks,

1361
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:03,938
this doesn't sound

1362
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:06,648
new, right? There's some new things to think

1363
00:48:06,648 --> 00:48:08,769
about in context of how the programs are, but this is

1364
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:10,849
still probably stuff you're already used to. We

1365
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,969
just call them different things. We use different

1366
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:14,628
acronyms and the like, so.

1367
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,090
I think let's uh we'll just batch the demo

1368
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:20,099
here at the at the end so we can get through this

1369
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:20,760
next one,

1370
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:23,168
which is going to be resourcing. Now this

1371
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:25,418
is the fun money one, right, Kyle?

1372
00:48:26,429 --> 00:48:28,039
Yeah, so this is how do you, you know,

1373
00:48:28,398 --> 00:48:30,398
going through and, and thinking through the, the kind of

1374
00:48:30,398 --> 00:48:32,429
the, the deterministic workflow,

1375
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:34,800
you know, we kind of know what level of

1376
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,878
compute or what amount of compute that we're going to

1377
00:48:36,878 --> 00:48:39,030
need for that, what level of storage that we need, what

1378
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,159
level of everything else that kind of goes

1379
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:43,289
along with that, but when it comes down to our,

1380
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:44,500
our agent side,

1381
00:48:45,478 --> 00:48:47,769
agent side. Because of the two things we've talked

1382
00:48:47,769 --> 00:48:49,789
about, because we don't know how much rate's gonna happen,

1383
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,570
we can have a good idea, right? Because we don't

1384
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,800
know what it's gonna try to reach out to,

1385
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:56,409
how many times it's gonna reach out to an internal service

1386
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:57,110
and the like,

1387
00:48:57,489 --> 00:48:59,489
the amount and the way that we can predict the

1388
00:48:59,489 --> 00:49:01,610
size of the instance, how much of the

1389
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,679
resources are being taken up, well, it's just

1390
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:06,228
as non-deterministic as the agents themselves.

1391
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,619
And that turns us into our resourcing problems

1392
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:12,719
here where we have,

1393
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:16,019
you know, various levels of, of conflictive

1394
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:16,918
resourcing,

1395
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,539
you know, where you can actually set up various levels of

1396
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,418
controls along those, those

1397
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,378
processes.

1398
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:25,070
You can go through and have unmetered

1399
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:26,389
resourcing,

1400
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,688
uh, which you know that gets into various

1401
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:32,114
other. Topic there and then of course drifted

1402
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:34,144
resources which since everybody in here

1403
00:49:34,144 --> 00:49:36,344
has used Terraform before you I'm

1404
00:49:36,344 --> 00:49:38,565
sure have experiences a drifted

1405
00:49:38,565 --> 00:49:40,054
resource at some point in time,

1406
00:49:40,465 --> 00:49:42,585
similar concept uh just much

1407
00:49:42,585 --> 00:49:44,726
larger broader blast radius.

1408
00:49:45,226 --> 00:49:47,706
So let's solve each of these. First one is

1409
00:49:47,706 --> 00:49:50,025
for conflict of resourcing. This is actually

1410
00:49:50,025 --> 00:49:50,706
pretty simple to solve.

1411
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,271
One of those, if it's a model and

1412
00:49:53,271 --> 00:49:55,311
you're hosting your own, you probably

1413
00:49:55,311 --> 00:49:57,422
don't have any other room on your GPU to throw it

1414
00:49:57,422 --> 00:49:59,132
on. So that, that one's pretty simple

1415
00:49:59,391 --> 00:50:00,831
for your agents though,

1416
00:50:01,112 --> 00:50:03,190
put them in their own node pool, right? You put

1417
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:05,402
them in their own node pool, it's a lot easier to figure

1418
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,422
things out and a lot easier to keep them from

1419
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:09,791
overreaching into the resources that your deterministic

1420
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,411
normal programs are reaching into.

1421
00:50:16,168 --> 00:50:17,208
You take this one or you,

1422
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,019
you have at it. Talk about, OK, yeah,

1423
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:22,179
so the, the next thing is the signal

1424
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:24,289
based control. So this comes down to watching what's

1425
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:25,760
going on with your resources.

1426
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,119
So in, in context of this, normally

1427
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:30,119
it's, it's tempting with a deterministic program

1428
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:32,128
to go on patterns of what you're doing with CPU,

1429
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,010
what's going on with the memory usage, maybe storage

1430
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:37,369
usage for certain cases for the agents

1431
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:39,570
themselves, you really wanna start looking at the

1432
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,648
queue, right? I needed to decide, do I need

1433
00:50:41,648 --> 00:50:42,349
to bring another.

1434
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:44,510
Bartender,

1435
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:45,510
whatever, but,

1436
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,708
a bar, another bartender into a bar with like

1437
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:50,789
a line outside instead of saying like, well, how stressed

1438
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:52,090
are you, Kyle, behind the bar?

1439
00:50:52,389 --> 00:50:54,429
Say, even though I'm concerned about

1440
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:56,469
your mental health, right? I actually

1441
00:50:56,469 --> 00:50:58,500
care about how much big of a line there is. So let's

1442
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,550
actually decide if I bring someone on based on the

1443
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,628
line. So in this case, we're gonna look at the number of

1444
00:51:02,628 --> 00:51:04,829
requests coming into the agent as opposed to

1445
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:06,949
how stressed the agent or how stressed the actual

1446
00:51:06,949 --> 00:51:08,090
resources itself.

1447
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,688
And then for the last one here.

1448
00:51:11,929 --> 00:51:13,978
Yeah, at this point it gets into, you know, how do you kind

1449
00:51:13,978 --> 00:51:16,469
of throttle control for those various

1450
00:51:16,469 --> 00:51:19,610
resources and how do you start, you know, establishing

1451
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,360
levels of, of either caps,

1452
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:24,019
um, or making sure that, uh, you know, various

1453
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:26,030
resources don't grow out of control and,

1454
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:28,539
and kind of get into that, you know, unmaintainable,

1455
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,398
unmanageable,

1456
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,938
uh, type of format because that's also how we get

1457
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:33,820
back to the point of having surprise bills.

1458
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:36,159
Yeah, yeah, so just

1459
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:38,793
that's we'll show. Some of that here as we get into the demo.

1460
00:51:38,885 --> 00:51:41,204
So those are the 3 solutions

1461
00:51:41,204 --> 00:51:43,324
here, but for time, why don't we go

1462
00:51:43,324 --> 00:51:44,543
ahead and head into,

1463
00:51:45,003 --> 00:51:47,164
uh, the last part. We,

1464
00:51:47,724 --> 00:51:49,885
we're gonna just show all the demo at the end here at this

1465
00:51:49,885 --> 00:51:52,003
point. So the point we want you to take

1466
00:51:52,003 --> 00:51:54,485
away from this is hopefully if all of this sounds

1467
00:51:54,485 --> 00:51:56,925
pretty familiar, it is because it is familiar.

1468
00:51:57,003 --> 00:51:59,003
It is the same thing, right? It is

1469
00:51:59,003 --> 00:52:01,034
just the same workflow, but

1470
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,744
just a bigger blast radius here.

1471
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:06,949
So again we have the analogy up here for

1472
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:08,148
you and let's take,

1473
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:10,510
let's do one more look at the demo here

1474
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:12,449
just so we can kind of see everything

1475
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:14,309
that's going on.

1476
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:16,878
So we hop back over into

1477
00:52:16,878 --> 00:52:19,309
the into HCP terraform

1478
00:52:19,309 --> 00:52:21,349
here. Let's see here what is the, what is

1479
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:23,539
the, the, the, the, the. Biggest

1480
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:26,050
sort of win here. Well, if you have

1481
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,559
say a developer that

1482
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,728
has just generated a bunch of new code

1483
00:52:30,728 --> 00:52:32,760
and they've just gone in and they've done a

1484
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,128
G AI thing like, look, I'm gonna make my own S3

1485
00:52:35,128 --> 00:52:37,208
bucket and they wanna come over here and

1486
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:39,250
say provision it. So let's go into our one of

1487
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,469
our projects here

1488
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,989
and let's provision this new bucket here.

1489
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:45,010
So we're gonna see the, the, the pretty

1490
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:47,010
straightforward workflow of connecting this.

1491
00:52:48,739 --> 00:52:50,099
Come on, you can do it, thingy.

1492
00:52:50,539 --> 00:52:52,820
There we go, and that was

1493
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,559
the.

1494
00:52:54,489 --> 00:52:55,708
The example

1495
00:52:56,809 --> 00:52:58,929
we're just gonna go ahead and create it

1496
00:52:58,929 --> 00:52:59,708
here.

1497
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:03,128
Now this is one, this is the other side of the story

1498
00:53:03,128 --> 00:53:05,469
that we haven't really touched on as much, but this is,

1499
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,708
I, before your developer was gonna be,

1500
00:53:07,969 --> 00:53:10,090
you know, they're gonna be looking through stuff. This time they just

1501
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,289
went into GitHub co-pilot or Kira or whatever

1502
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,360
and just got this done today. Now,

1503
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:16,610
if you aren't watching for it, well, this

1504
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,849
might not be very fun,

1505
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,500
uh, very fun for you,

1506
00:53:19,969 --> 00:53:22,208
but let me go in here and just show you real

1507
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:23,429
quick if I add

1508
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:25,019
a, uh,

1509
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,610
variable, I don't remember what variable

1510
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,789
I needed for this. Let me see, what did I need?

1511
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:32,958
Oh, I didn't need any. So this is just gonna try

1512
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:33,659
to provision

1513
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:35,659
a, a bucket in general.

1514
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Oh, that's named something. OK, we got something, we're good, we're good,

1515
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:39,438
we're good. I trust,

1516
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:41,708
I like, trust me, this is going somewhere, so we're gonna

1517
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:42,539
put this in here.

1518
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,579
So if we put this in here,

1519
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:48,059
this is that Gen AI thing, and what we

1520
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:49,280
already see that is going to happen,

1521
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:51,619
Kyle, is something Kyle has gone and passive

1522
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:54,030
aggressively done here, right, which is

1523
00:53:54,728 --> 00:53:56,728
Set up and established all kinds of guardrails so

1524
00:53:56,728 --> 00:53:58,809
that uh while you do have access to

1525
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:00,849
plan out your terraform configuration that you

1526
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:01,599
pulled in from,

1527
00:54:01,929 --> 00:54:04,010
from your repo, it is going to apply

1528
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:06,168
it, uh, take that output from

1529
00:54:06,168 --> 00:54:08,168
the plan that we'll see here in just a second

1530
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:10,478
and then start applying some of those guardrails that we've

1531
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:12,648
established through Sentinel, which is our policy

1532
00:54:12,648 --> 00:54:13,958
is code framework.

1533
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:16,360
So once we know those resources that are

1534
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,750
going to be created or otherwise managed.

1535
00:54:18,992 --> 00:54:21,452
Then we can start applying the policies

1536
00:54:21,742 --> 00:54:24,152
uh and you know you can do anything from

1537
00:54:24,152 --> 00:54:26,751
time based you can pull in other

1538
00:54:26,751 --> 00:54:29,012
information such as what you'll see after the Sentinel

1539
00:54:29,012 --> 00:54:29,731
policies

1540
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:32,521
uh are are performed and interrogated.

1541
00:54:32,632 --> 00:54:34,711
There's also cost estimation so you can have a

1542
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:36,791
level of costing so you have a level of

1543
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:39,052
awareness of you know what this configuration

1544
00:54:39,052 --> 00:54:40,572
is actually going to cost

1545
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,353
in terms of uh uh cloud billing.

1546
00:54:43,505 --> 00:54:45,855
Agencies are all, as we can see, AWS based

1547
00:54:45,855 --> 00:54:46,456
resources

1548
00:54:46,735 --> 00:54:48,936
and then it'll continue going on from there

1549
00:54:48,936 --> 00:54:51,094
and we can make some determinations based on

1550
00:54:51,094 --> 00:54:53,335
that too so you know we can take

1551
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:55,456
some of those as 3 policy sets

1552
00:54:55,456 --> 00:54:57,534
we can make sure that that coal is uh

1553
00:54:57,976 --> 00:55:00,125
provisioning all of those resources through the,

1554
00:55:00,135 --> 00:55:02,255
uh, using best practices both,

1555
00:55:02,456 --> 00:55:04,735
you know, industry standard wise

1556
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:06,775
as well as internally uh

1557
00:55:06,775 --> 00:55:07,635
as well.

1558
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,739
And then we'll also get a nice little readout of

1559
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:13,260
that once the uh plan rolls

1560
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,938
through and completes,

1561
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,418
which is taking a little longer than it probably

1562
00:55:17,418 --> 00:55:19,878
should be because that's just the way the live demos

1563
00:55:19,878 --> 00:55:22,079
kind of operate the way that they work. So,

1564
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:23,958
um, as we wait for this to finish,

1565
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:26,739
I, I can go and spoil this for you, which is

1566
00:55:26,739 --> 00:55:28,289
that I made this bucket public because,

1567
00:55:28,978 --> 00:55:30,119
you know, I roll like that,

1568
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:32,659
but that's gonna get blocked. But in the

1569
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:34,793
background, Kyle's gone. And made a

1570
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:36,514
module for me to actually use. He's like,

1571
00:55:36,905 --> 00:55:38,054
look man, I know that you need

1572
00:55:38,675 --> 00:55:40,715
like a bucket, so why don't I just give you

1573
00:55:40,715 --> 00:55:42,594
a pre-approved module, right?

1574
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:44,994
And so this is where you get to this neat story to

1575
00:55:44,994 --> 00:55:47,074
where let's say we go to

1576
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:49,594
your, your little application here and say like

1577
00:55:49,594 --> 00:55:51,175
I'd like to deploy

1578
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:52,635
an S3 bucket.

1579
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:55,708
And this is another area if you ever get around

1580
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:57,849
to provisioning your own infrastructure

1581
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:00,309
and you want an agent to decide to do it, that's

1582
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:02,309
kind of a scary story unless you

1583
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:04,349
think about everything we just did here,

1584
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:06,628
right? If the agents coming up with this stuff,

1585
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,750
just think of them like a rogue developer. Give

1586
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,148
them two big things. Here are some

1587
00:56:11,148 --> 00:56:13,148
standard modules that you can use

1588
00:56:13,148 --> 00:56:15,429
to build from. Only use the modules. They're

1589
00:56:15,429 --> 00:56:17,590
only using the modules, that means they're only using

1590
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:19,590
stuff that you've vetted and you know is good. And

1591
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:21,829
then even if they're not using the modules, if

1592
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:24,289
you set up the guardrails. Those policies,

1593
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:26,648
it's gonna, you know, well apparently in our case, oh

1594
00:56:26,648 --> 00:56:27,168
look, here we go,

1595
00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:29,769
it's gonna stop. It's gonna say, hey, well this

1596
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:31,849
is actually trying to make a public

1597
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:33,929
access bucket, and suddenly you don't even necessarily have

1598
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:35,929
to have the individual standardized building

1599
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:38,168
blocks. You've got the guardrail set up so it can

1600
00:56:38,168 --> 00:56:40,239
just generate terraform. This becomes a human

1601
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:42,329
in the loop. Kyle can come in here and be like,

1602
00:56:42,648 --> 00:56:44,250
Cole, and also,

1603
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,570
you know, the cost apparently we

1604
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,728
couldn't estimate the cost of an S3 bucket. It is

1605
00:56:48,728 --> 00:56:49,289
empty.

1606
00:56:49,889 --> 00:56:52,289
But there's also we have cloudability

1607
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:53,250
with IBM. We have a.

1608
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,769
Tasks set up through here through through them

1609
00:56:55,869 --> 00:56:57,978
that you can add pretty easily and Kyle, why don't you tell

1610
00:56:57,978 --> 00:57:00,030
them about that real quick because that is an important part of the

1611
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:00,909
policy story.

1612
00:57:01,228 --> 00:57:03,309
Yeah, so another part of a capability that

1613
00:57:03,309 --> 00:57:05,469
you can add to your terraform workflow

1614
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:07,619
here is the ability to reach out to third party

1615
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:08,289
systems

1616
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,550
and we're doing that through what's known as run

1617
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:12,889
tasks. And what happens is a run task

1618
00:57:13,148 --> 00:57:15,260
takes that plan output and it can send it

1619
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:15,840
off to,

1620
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:18,239
say, you know, cloud already or Cole

1621
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:20,619
already introduced IBM's cloudability offering,

1622
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:22,489
which is a financial operations

1623
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:25,050
type of. Tool set so you can see, you know, some level

1624
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:27,128
of cost visibility through there but you

1625
00:57:27,128 --> 00:57:29,289
can also start using that with other

1626
00:57:29,289 --> 00:57:31,489
security based toolings you can use that with like

1627
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,519
bridge crew and and PrismaCloud and

1628
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:35,570
those types uh Cole was showing

1629
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:38,050
us uh the run task uh registry

1630
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:38,628
that's out there,

1631
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:41,329
you know, there's drift detection, there's infrastructure

1632
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:43,389
management, there's policy, there's quite a different

1633
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:45,849
uh areas that are out there because we know

1634
00:57:45,849 --> 00:57:47,929
that you all are using other tools within

1635
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:50,550
your environment and so how best can we integrate

1636
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,969
with those existing tools that you have.

1637
00:57:53,909 --> 00:57:55,280
So this of course

1638
00:57:55,659 --> 00:57:57,820
helps the human in the loop side of the

1639
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,938
story. This makes it so that the

1640
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:00,458
speed,

1641
00:58:00,739 --> 00:58:01,418
right, you know,

1642
00:58:01,898 --> 00:58:03,978
having a car that goes 50 miles an hour is fun.

1643
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:06,260
Having a car that goes 1000 miles an hour,

1644
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,938
I mean that's fun. It's a lot more dangerous.

1645
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:10,889
But if you've got this stuff in place,

1646
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,780
what your Gen AI story is, is

1647
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,019
again just another workload. Now

1648
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:18,090
you've got the same things in place. So let's hop

1649
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:19,918
back over and wrap things up.

1650
00:58:20,989 --> 00:58:23,139
And oh, we wrapped things up. So what we have

1651
00:58:23,139 --> 00:58:25,349
up here is a QR code for y'all. We have a

1652
00:58:25,349 --> 00:58:27,389
lot of resources. I know Kyle and I are gonna be doing

1653
00:58:27,389 --> 00:58:29,739
a more in depth technical version where we're gonna dissect

1654
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:31,750
this stuff in depth since we're kind of

1655
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,688
running over here.

1656
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:35,309
And if you, we've got a little form there, if you sign up for

1657
00:58:35,309 --> 00:58:37,360
it, you can get more resources on us in terms

1658
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,639
of infrastructure and cloud and context

1659
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,708
of the AI world. And

1660
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:42,539
what else, Kyle?

1661
00:58:42,909 --> 00:58:45,260
And yeah, please complete the the session survey

1662
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:45,769
as well.

1663
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:48,320
If you like this, if you don't, don't.

1664
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:50,929
Details.
