  "abstract": "Headlines suggest AI is transforming software engineering overnight, but data from 400+ organizations shows a more nuanced reality. Join Justin Reock as he shares a data-driven “state of the union” on AI in engineering, combining large-scale benchmarks with stories from the field. He’ll cover the impact of AI, where adoption drives gains, and emerging trends such as differing effects on junior vs. senior developers, the role of structured rollouts, vendor comparisons, and the evolving definition of who counts as a developer. He’ll conclude with a practical framework to help leaders understand AI’s impact across organizations. This presentation is brought to you by Atlassian, an AWS Partner.",
