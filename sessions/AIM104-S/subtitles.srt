1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
- [Steve] All right.

2
00:00:00,893 --> 00:00:02,790
- [John] All right. Hey
everyone, I'm John Huehn.

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,220
I'm the chief of Launchpad for Pegasystems

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,930
and with me today is Steve Bixby,

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,020
who is our Senior Vice President
of Product Engineering.

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,210
And we are delighted to be spending

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,860
the next 20 minutes with you

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,660
building an enterprise-grade
agentic SaaS application

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,990
that can run a complex
and regulated process,

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,250
and be sold to thousands of B2B clients

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,220
in just five easy steps.

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,860
And those steps include making the design

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,270
with agentic powered blueprint,
making it real here on AWS,

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,570
making it work with
enterprise capabilities,

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,640
making it available to your subscribers

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,080
and making it rain with
real live customer usage.

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,070
So we're going to
demonstrate how a FinTech

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,260
that we're going to call "Homeland"

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,760
can build and sell to banks
an agentic application

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,220
that will dramatically
accelerate processing

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,470
and deliver a great customer experience

22
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,480
for a scenario that many of us

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,830
may have gone through ourselves

24
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,900
or may one day go through in our lives,

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,720
which is mortgage pre-approvals.

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,020
And of course, banks
are like super excited

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,120
to see their work get automated,

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,680
but they also can't afford

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,090
to have AI introduce variability
into important decisions

30
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,860
like credit worthiness.

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,680
And that's where a lot of
agentic applications struggle,

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,110
they have armies of agents

33
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,660
trying to manage other armies of agents

34
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,940
to deliver an outcome, and of course,

35
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,310
that just naturally breeds
all kinds of variability

36
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,490
which can't exist in financial decisions.

37
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,940
So today we're going to use workflows

38
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,330
to manage our AI agents

39
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:50,330
to deliver a controlled,
deterministic, predictable outcome.

40
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,740
The kind of outcomes that
regulated industries,

41
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,590
like banking, actually love.

42
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,490
And to build our application,
we're going to use Launchpad,

43
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,630
the AI-powered low-code app
development platform from Pega.

44
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,510
And if you've never used Launchpad before,

45
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,860
what you should know is

46
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,590
whether you're looking to
build a new application

47
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,170
or enhance maybe a legacy
application with workflow

48
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,970
or Gen AI into it, or
you're looking to replace

49
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,150
or re-platform a tech
debt laden old application

50
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,260
with something new and modern

51
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,150
that you can innovate on faster,

52
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,850
then Launchpad will
dramatically accelerate

53
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,910
your speed to market, reduce
your development time,

54
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,450
and reduce your costs with a
vibe development experience

55
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,780
that helps get your app
started, with a managed database

56
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,290
and secure scalable cloud powered by AWS

57
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,900
with industry leading workflow integration

58
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,270
and UX and reporting capabilities,

59
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,580
and with prebuilt subscriber management,

60
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,470
administration and configurability,

61
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,930
all with a usage based pricing model

62
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,030
that scales with your business.

63
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,230
So ultimately, Launchpad gives
you everything that you need

64
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,180
to build and sell an
enterprise-grade SaaS application

65
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,480
without the cost and complexity
of managing your cloud,

66
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,403
your security, and of course, code.

67
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,680
So we're gonna get started,
here's our scenario.

68
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,780
Homeland, our make-believe FinTech

69
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,280
that builds and sells apps to banks

70
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,300
has identified a gap in the
mortgage pre-approvals process

71
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,090
that impacts people like Sarah.

72
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,910
Sarah's Dream House
just came on the market

73
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,310
and she is super excited.

74
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,160
She very quickly booked
a showing of the house,

75
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,510
contacted her bank,

76
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,850
provided all of her documentation

77
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,140
to get a mortgage pre-approval
and the corresponding letter.

78
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,340
But unfortunately, her bank took two days

79
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,050
to process her application and
get back to her that letter.

80
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,990
And sadly, during that time,

81
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,650
somebody else bought Sarah's dream house.

82
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,600
Imagine how disappointing

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,540
and Homeland understands that pain.

84
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,770
So they're going to build
an agentic SaaS application

85
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,220
for banks to reduce the processing time

86
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,870
from days to seconds and
deliver a great experience

87
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,460
for folks like Sarah,

88
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,310
something that actually looks like this.

89
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,110
An AgTech SaaS application with
a conversational interface.

90
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,890
So Steve, I'm hoping
I can count on you now

91
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,240
to play the role of Homeland
and I wanna build an app

92
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,880
that manages the mortgage
pre-approvals process

93
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,700
and other loan origination stuff.

94
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,010
- All right, well that's a
challenge, we're gonna do it,

95
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,480
well, hopefully the wifi holds up.

96
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,930
We're gonna build this real
quick, last session of the day,

97
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,463
thank you all for being here.

98
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,860
Okay, John, could you actually

99
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,560
just maybe say that one more time?

100
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,070
- Okay Steve, I want to build an app

101
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,340
that manages the mortgage
pre-approvals process

102
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,893
and other loan origination stuff.

103
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,050
- We got it, all right,
brilliant, that's enough.

104
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,060
That's enough to get
started with this process,

105
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,933
so here we go.

106
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,480
We're in Launchpad.

107
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,000
If you want to see Launchpad,
you wanna try it yourself,

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,950
we're at the Pega booth just over there.

109
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,530
Everything I'm showing here
you can do for yourself,

110
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,320
check it out at Launchpad.io.

111
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,770
All right, so it said perfect,
what's your application name?

112
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,603
All right, so-

113
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:24,436
- [John] That's gonna be "Homeland."

114
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:25,269
- [Steve] This is "Homeland."
- [John] Yeah.

115
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:28,527
- [Steve] So "Homeland,"

116
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,880
and, all right, here we go.

117
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,760
I can now build your loan
origination application,

118
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,610
which will include a mortgage
pre-approval process,

119
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,460
it's identified the industry,
the location, et cetera,

120
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,040
all the things that are needed
to build an application.

121
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,747
Obviously we haven't really
provided enough context,

122
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,350
but it's giving us the
option to start building.

123
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,750
So for the sake of time,
let's just go for it.

124
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,800
- [John] Let's build.

125
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,080
- [Steve] All right, so,

126
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:58,267
it now it says, "I'm
building your, I'm starting

127
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:01,147
"with an industry template
and customizing the workflows,

128
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:03,907
"connecting the channels,
setting up the personas

129
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:07,317
"and configuring the
data and integrations."

130
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,200
Boom, all right, awesome.

131
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,660
So the chat is now
pushed over to the right

132
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,200
and we're presented with the
sort of development environment

133
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,610
for Launchpad here.

134
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,860
And you can see that
our Launchpad readiness

135
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,750
is sort of like a quarter of the way done.

136
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,770
We can keep an eye on that

137
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,690
as we walk through the process here.

138
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,990
So it's identified that we
are this Homeland corporation,

139
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,760
we're in the US, retail banking,

140
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,210
and this is a loan origination
application, great.

141
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,110
And if I click here in the
middle of this diagram,

142
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,720
this is gonna show us the
workflows that it created.

143
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,700
So it created eight workflows
it looks like, here they are,

144
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,880
and mortgage pre-approval
is in fact one of them.

145
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,620
- [John] That's good, the rest
of them are the other stuff.

146
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,497
- [Steve] That's right, lots
of other stuff, that's good,

147
00:06:51,497 --> 00:06:53,130
that's what we asked for.

148
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,710
Let's take a look at the
mortgage pre-approval process.

149
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,650
All right, so what Launchpad does for you

150
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,080
is it takes that business process,

151
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,170
breaks it into a series
of stages and steps

152
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,600
to organize the business process.

153
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,170
I can now interact with
this, add steps, add stages,

154
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,560
drag them, drop them, move
them around and update this.

155
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,245
But if we look at it,
it looks like we've got

156
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:19,080
a collect application data,
verifying information,

157
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,970
and then we go through
financial assessment,

158
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,000
pre-approval decision and
then ultimately finalization.

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,740
So this, this actually looks pretty good

160
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,680
in terms of delivering
what Sarah's looking for

161
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,080
in that scenario you described.

162
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,840
So, let's make a few changes to it,

163
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,673
actually before we do that,

164
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:36,120
let me show you the data model over here.

165
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,120
So it's also generated
a data model for us.

166
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,730
This thing's generated a
full UI, it's all there,

167
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,930
we're gonna see it in a minute.

168
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,130
Again, I can update this,
make changes to it as needed.

169
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,440
You see we've got an
applicant name, date of birth,

170
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,800
W2, annual income, all the
things that we would need

171
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,810
for that mortgage pre-approval process,

172
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,780
all created with generative AI

173
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,710
using the bedrock models from AWS.

174
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,870
So let's go back to the lifecycle now,

175
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,030
let's make a change, John,
what should we change?

176
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,020
- [John] So I think, Steve,

177
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,660
maybe we wanna get some human eyeballs,

178
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,190
If somebody's gonna
ask for a pre-approval,

179
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,040
maybe over $5 million.

180
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,873
- [Steve] $5 million.

181
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:14,706
- [John] It might be good to have somebody

182
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:15,539
actually take a look at that.

183
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,090
- [Steve] All right, so in the
pre-approval decision here,

184
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,740
so I could just vibe this
over on the chat on the right,

185
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,510
but I wanna show you a cool feature here

186
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,040
where I can actually do it in line

187
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,670
where I can just click
on the area of the screen

188
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,470
that I want to make the change to,

189
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,127
and I can say, "configure
the system so that

190
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:38,127
"any loan request over 5 million
requires human approval."

191
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,910
Period, boom.

192
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,350
- [John] Nice.

193
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,900
- [Steve] So, awesome.

194
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,690
So this just inserted
this human approval step

195
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,860
where it's a decision actually

196
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,130
to determine if we need
a human approval step.

197
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,350
And if you wanna know
what did this actually do

198
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,850
behind the scenes,

199
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,070
I can open the left-hand panel here

200
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,930
and it's gonna show all of the assets

201
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,900
that have been created that
support this application.

202
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,110
And here's that human approval
down here at the bottom.

203
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,040
It's a decisioning rule, it's private

204
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,460
and it kind of has it has
it generated an expression

205
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,084
for loan amount greater than $5 million.

206
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:18,383
- [John] That's good.
- [Steve] So that's awesome.

207
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,210
All right, let's, let me see,

208
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,820
let me just close this just to show

209
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,130
you can work with the full screen here.

210
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,390
Let's make one more change,

211
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,670
Let's add a like a, gentix step

212
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,430
or at least a placeholder
where we can insert one.

213
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,260
So let me see, let's
integrate the AWS Nova agent

214
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,890
to automate the verification
of the employment

215
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,973
through the approved third party service.

216
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,870
So you can add decision steps,
you can add human steps,

217
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,400
which would require like a screen

218
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,050
or some sort of interaction,

219
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,360
whether it's through self-service

220
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,020
or maybe through a contact
center, agentic conversation.

221
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,790
You can add agent calls, you
can add decisions, automations,

222
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,370
all of that here to build
out this application.

223
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,820
Now because we have such a
short window, we're gonna say,

224
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,620
all right, this is probably
what we need from here.

225
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,460
Let's preview it.

226
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,760
Let's see what does this
application look like

227
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,343
to a potential end user?

228
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,190
All right, so here we go.

229
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,267
This is a, it even says right here,

230
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:30,330
"Preview, demo bank." It's not real.

231
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,070
- [John] That is not real, this is demo.

232
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,350
- [Steve] This is how you
test the application now.

233
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,667
And I'm presented with this
virtual assistant that says,

234
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:39,180
"Hi, I'm your virtual assistant,
how can I help you today?"

235
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,237
I'm gonna tell it,

236
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:45,237
"Hi, I'd like to get
pre-approved for a home loan."

237
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,037
It says, "Sure, I'd be happy to help.

238
00:10:51,037 --> 00:10:52,747
"To get started, could you please provide

239
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:54,450
"your full name and date of birth?"

240
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,170
Of course, my actual name, Steven Bixby,

241
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,410
June 14th, 1983, not my actual birthday.

242
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,030
- [John] I was gonna say I did not realize

243
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,030
how much younger you are than me, Steve.

244
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:08,527
- [Steve] "Thank you, what loan amount

245
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:11,190
"would you like to be pre-approved for?"

246
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,223
I'm looking for $1 million.

247
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:19,145
(Steve laughs)

248
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,000
Got it, to proceed, so do you
understand what this is doing?

249
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,600
It's actually going through
the first step of the process

250
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,810
and trying to collect the
information that's necessary.

251
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,820
To visualize that further,

252
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,800
in this preview portal here we can say

253
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,180
okay, that's what it's gonna look like

254
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,160
through this self-service chat,

255
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,200
but what would it look like,

256
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,250
like in the bank back office
in the desktop application.

257
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,610
So this is the application
that it's created for us

258
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,460
and you can see there's a
dashboard, there's chat,

259
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,010
there's all kinds of stuff
that's going on here.

260
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:57,090
And I can actually create
any one of these workflows

261
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,400
right from here, or
instance of the workflow,

262
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,130
including that mortgage pre-approval.

263
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,240
And now I'm gonna see those
fields that were prompted

264
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,460
in that first step of the first stage,

265
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,670
which included the applicant
name, the date of birth, email,

266
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,730
phone, annual income, and the W2 file.

267
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,563
- [John] So that's pretty cool

268
00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:18,780
because you just built
the core logic of the app

269
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,240
and we're showing it in the
conversational interface.

270
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,410
But you can actually do the same thing

271
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,970
on the employee desktop

272
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,180
and it also would work on
your website for self service.

273
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,050
- [Steve] Mobile app.

274
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,780
- [John] Mobile app, you know,
build that logic in the core

275
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,160
in the center one time and it deploys

276
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,390
across all of your channels.

277
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,230
- [Steve] Exactly.

278
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,830
All right, so let's assume
that this app is perfect,

279
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,670
there's all kinds of things

280
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,930
that we probably would want to go tweak

281
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,280
to make this our own,

282
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,460
make it actually serve
the purpose that we need.

283
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,240
But from here, I think we
can, let's launch this thing.

284
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,220
So what's unique about Launchpad

285
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,800
is that it's built
specifically for organizations

286
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,320
that are building products, SaaS products,

287
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,210
that they are going to then go sell.

288
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,210
So we're, this is, we're a provider here

289
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,360
and we're gonna go sell
this to our subscribers.

290
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,100
So when you launch it,

291
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,890
it's actually gonna take this
blueprint of our application

292
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,790
and make it real.

293
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,090
So it's doing the domain
data modeling, the workflow,

294
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,490
the UI screen generation,
the integration setup,

295
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,550
the security configuration, all of that

296
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,460
to make sure that we have an
app that we can actually deploy

297
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,650
so that our subscribers could use it.

298
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,290
So I'm presented now with
my list of subscribers,

299
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,350
like Homeland subscribers,
there's five banks here.

300
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,270
I'm just gonna say let's deploy it

301
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,120
so that all of them have access to it

302
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,033
and let's deploy this application.

303
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,570
All right, so now that I've done that,

304
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,610
made this available to all my subscribers,

305
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,980
I'm looking at my subscribers dashboard.

306
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,680
So as a provider, I can
now see what's happening

307
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,410
with other apps that I've built
and that have been deployed.

308
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,550
I can see the usage, I
can see even revenue,

309
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,660
things like that.

310
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,670
And right here I'm seeing those banks

311
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,530
and seeing that the Homeland subscription

312
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,660
is active for all of them.

313
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,110
So now that we've built this application,

314
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,210
I'm gonna do a little bit of fantasy here.

315
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,830
We're going to flip to one
of these bank's websites

316
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,350
and assume that they've already deployed

317
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,600
this virtual assistant on their website.

318
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,320
So it's no longer the, you
know, "This is not real" bank,

319
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,800
it's actually the UBank
or U Plus Bank website.

320
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,286
So here we are on their website,

321
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:33,210
they've deployed this assistant
here and I can click on it

322
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,237
and it says, "I'm your U
Plus Bank virtual assistant.

323
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:38,460
"How can I help you today?"

324
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,800
So very similar to what
we saw in the preview

325
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,940
in the development environment,

326
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,210
we're now seeing live
for a real subscriber

327
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,880
and this time I'm going
to say I'm Sarah, right?

328
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,980
So let's be Sarah in this use case.

329
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,980
And "Hi, I'd like to get
pre-approved for a home loan."

330
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,997
All right, "Sure, happy to help.

331
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:02,700
"To get started please
provide your full name."

332
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,590
So this is gonna take us
through that same process.

333
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,900
Again, I'm gonna say I'm Sarah this time.

334
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,333
Sarah Wilson, March 18th, 1974.

335
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:15,547
"Thank you, what loan amount

336
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,800
"would you like to be approved for?"

337
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,328
Let's do a million dollars again.

338
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:19,161
- [John] All right, everybody,

339
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:21,108
a million dollars for Steve,
a million dollars for Sarah,

340
00:15:21,108 --> 00:15:23,941
everybody a million dollars today.

341
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,120
- [Steve] And now it's asking for the W2,

342
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,490
same as we saw before, let's
actually do that this time.

343
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,403
Let's upload the W2,

344
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,493
submit that,

345
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:39,487
"W2 was received securely

346
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:41,167
"I'm now evaluating your finances

347
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:43,087
"to determine pre-approval amount.

348
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:44,670
"I'll have the decision for you shortly."

349
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,300
Here we go, fingers crossed,
let's hope Sarah gets approved.

350
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,640
It's not over $5 million

351
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,140
so that rule's not gonna
be in play that we added.

352
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,917
Boom, "Congratulations, awesome,
you've been pre-approved.

353
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,260
"Would you like me to email?"

354
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,793
Yes, definitely.

355
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:02,077
"Check your inbox.

356
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:04,140
"Is there anything else
we can help you with?"

357
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,487
Let's say, "That was it.

358
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:10,437
"Thanks for getting back to me so fast."

359
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,030
Awesome.

360
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,820
All right, John, so I think I did it.

361
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,020
I built the application, I
think Sarah's gonna be happy.

362
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,330
So, let's flip back.

363
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,980
- That is awesome.

364
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,070
Thanks so much for
sharing all that with us.

365
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,500
So I'm just gonna quickly recap.

366
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,060
You know, going back to our five steps

367
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,170
with what Steve has shown us.

368
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,730
So the first thing, Steve, you did,

369
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,763
you made the design
leveraging vibe development,

370
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,690
to create your gen AI powered blueprint.

371
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,980
And then you made it
real, secure, scalable

372
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,570
on a pre-built and or ready
built AWS architecture.

373
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,570
You made it work with
enterprise-grade capabilities

374
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,083
and with workflows
managing your AI agents.

375
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,140
And you made it available
to your subscribers,

376
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,490
like U Plus Bank,

377
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,280
to configure and deploy
to their customers.

378
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,960
And you made it rain

379
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,470
with real life customer
usage from folks like Sarah

380
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,503
who are using the U Plus
Bank deployment of the app.

381
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,490
So in five simple steps, you
built an enterprise-grade,

382
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,070
agentic SaaS application

383
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,260
that dramatically
shortened processing time

384
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,220
and delivered a great
experience for Sarah.

385
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,660
And you took, you know, a
cumbersome bank workflow

386
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,780
and you enabled, you
know, that to be automated

387
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,280
to deliver an experience for Sarah

388
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,060
whose story can now finally
have a happy ending.

389
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,980
So there's really not much more

390
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,850
for Steve and I to share,

391
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,670
