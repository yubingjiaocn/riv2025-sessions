00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,070
- [Tiffany] How to build a multi-agent

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,313
role-playing Game Master
with Strands Agent.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,263
Quick question right before starting.

4
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:14,700
Like, raise your hand if you know

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,700
what is a role-playing tabletop game.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,263
- [Olivier] Who's played it?

7
00:00:21,263 --> 00:00:22,170
- [Tiffany] Okay.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,079
- [Olivier] Few people
don't, so if you wanna

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:24,912
make introduction.
- [Tiffany] Yeah.

10
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:25,860
Most people know, that's cool.

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,820
Sometimes we play this presentation
in different countries,

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,990
and depending on cultures,

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,150
maybe sometimes people don't know.

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,500
- [Olivier] I see some people
didn't raise their hand,

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,460
so if you want to make a brief-

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,293
- [Tiffany] Yeah, yeah.

17
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:37,126
So,

18
00:00:40,142 --> 00:00:42,300
a tabletop role-playing game is,

19
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,730
you might have heard of Dungeons & Dragons

20
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,080
or games like this.

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,780
So basically, this is...

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,903
How can I...

23
00:00:50,903 --> 00:00:52,300
Like, this is an open world

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,460
with a universe that already exists,

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,490
that has a playbook, like a
rule book that you can read.

26
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,000
It's like 400, I think, pages long.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,360
And basically, you can
play in this universe

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,803
where you can play, like
for example, elves, orcs.

29
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,563
- [Olivier] Druids.

30
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:19,080
- [Tiffany] Yeah, dwarves,
and have your own characters,

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,290
and you can play a campaign.

32
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,040
And for example, you have
what we call a Dungeon Master.

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,870
So the role of the Dungeon
Master or the Game Master

34
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,740
is to build a campaign

35
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,410
to embark the players into
a story in this universe.

36
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,700
And the idea of this project

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,080
was because I am myself a
Dungeons & Dragon player,

38
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,660
and I sometimes have
troubles finding Game Masters

39
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,570
because it's really hard to
be a Game Master, actually.

40
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,550
You need to know all of
the rules of the game.

41
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,990
You need to know a lot
of things to be able to

42
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,990
drive your players into a campaign.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,830
And I was thinking

44
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,830
that maybe artificial
intelligence could be cool,

45
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,580
a cool tool to help Game
Masters in assisting them,

46
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,550
and we'll see today how we can build

47
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,430
a multi-agent workflow for this.

48
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,363
So first, I will introduce
you the concept of agents.

49
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,550
At the very beginning
of when generative AI

50
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,790
became very public...

51
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,830
I don't know if you
remember, because I remember

52
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,833
the announcement was made during ReInvent.

53
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,160
It was three years ago for...

54
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,140
Oh, yeah, yeah.

55
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,830
For the well-known, like, ChatGPT.

56
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,340
But generative AI existed before that,

57
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,280
but it became well known
by the public by this day

58
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,010
because it was a tool that suddenly

59
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,740
everybody could use and
see the power of it.

60
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,560
So you could chat with those LLMs.

61
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,330
You can have a conversation
with them, but this is about it.

62
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,570
When you chat with an LLM,
you can have a conversation.

63
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,440
This is very powerful, but
what you'd want is also

64
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,800
this LLM to be able to
perform actions for you,

65
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,640
and this is where agents come into play.

66
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,980
Agents have agency.

67
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,900
That's why we call them agents.

68
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,510
They're able to make actions for you.

69
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,910
And the way they do those actions

70
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,370
is because they have access to tools.

71
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,590
Tools can be a lot of different things.

72
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,910
They can be APIs.

73
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,560
They can be functions.

74
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,363
They can be databases.

75
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,420
They can also be other agents

76
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,020
that also themselves have
access to other tools.

77
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,903
So you can see how this can
build up pretty quickly.

78
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,310
Usually, like in...

79
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,490
There's no standard,
really, but at the moment,

80
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,790
when you have multiple
agents working together,

81
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,950
you usually have one orchestrator

82
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,880
that has access to multiple
agents that each are specialized

83
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,053
and experts into a certain
task or a certain field.

84
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:22,550
One example that I like to give
sometimes is when you want,

85
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,730
for example, a coach, a
studying coach for a student,

86
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,000
you'll have the coach
that might be connected

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,670
to a team of different agents

88
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,190
that are all experts in different fields,

89
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,000
in math, in physics, in
history, in geographics.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,160
And so you have all of your different ages

91
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,070
that are all of the teachers, for example.

92
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,840
And whenever your student
has a question to the coach

93
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,630
or maybe is asking for a set of exercises

94
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,090
or maybe questions about something,

95
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,930
then the orchestrator
redirects the questions

96
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,050
to the right expert, to the right agent

97
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,980
to be able to perform to answer the query.

98
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,973
So,

99
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,037
yes, to connect those tools...

100
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:12,594
Oh, so sorry.

101
00:05:12,594 --> 00:05:16,713
To connect the tools with the agent,

102
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,810
we have what we call the protocol MCP.

103
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,623
So MCP stands for model context protocol.

104
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,220
You might have heard of it

105
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,220
because it's been doing this
this boom for this entire year.

106
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,370
So basically, this protocol standardizes

107
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,370
the way your agents can discover tools,

108
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,970
basically.

109
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,813
It's like REST for AI agents.

110
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,670
If you've tried to build
agents before with tools

111
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,670
before the MCP protocol,
maybe if you remember,

112
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,370
but it was pretty complex.

113
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,370
You had to maintain the way
you'd connect to the tool,

114
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,483
for example, a function.

115
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,300
There was no standardized way of doing it.

116
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,180
So, I mean, you were the only one

117
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,720
who was maintaining this whole workflow.

118
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,050
And in the same time, you weren't able,

119
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,640
unless you were talking to that person,

120
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,560
but you weren't able to connect to a tool

121
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,990
that someone else would have built.

122
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,160
And the power of MCP is that now,

123
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,160
if someone builds a tool
and puts it on a server,

124
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,780
on a certain endpoint,

125
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,080
and give it to you, then
you, on the other side,

126
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,070
with your agent, is able
to connect to that tool.

127
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,990
This is making things very powerful

128
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,450
'cause now, a lot of people
are creating a lot of tools,

129
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,783
and with your agent, you are
capable of using their tools.

130
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,870
And also, there is another protocol

131
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,390
that has been very famous
also for this year.

132
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,680
It's A2A, which stands for agent to agent,

133
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,530
and this protocol standardizes

134
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,520
the way agent connects to other agents.

135
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,790
So, two very different things.

136
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,390
One protocol is to connect to tools,

137
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,900
and the other protocol
is to connect to agents.

138
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,970
Why are those protocols different?

139
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,090
Because the way they
communicate is different.

140
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,950
Between agents, you need to be
able to build a conversation.

141
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,620
They both have a thought process.

142
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,490
They both have

143
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,470
planning,

144
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,560
and so they need to be able
to have this conversation.

145
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,681
Meanwhile, for a tool,

146
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,610
you don't necessarily
need to talk with it.

147
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,920
Actually, they don't have
this thought process.

148
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,330
The tools are just, like,

149
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,430
functions, or API calls, or databases,

150
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,500
so they're just gonna
give you an information.

151
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,600
They are going to perform
an action for you,

152
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,103
but that's pretty much it.

153
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,690
So for...

154
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,540
Oh, yeah.

155
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,590
Oops, sorry.

156
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,703
So basically,

157
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,450
to sum it up, MCP versus A2A,

158
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,370
MCP is to communicate between
tools, agents and tools,

159
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,403
and A2A is for the
communication between agents.

160
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,170
So today, we are going to
work on this little project.

161
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,890
Actually, Olivier is going to
build it live in front of you,

162
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,028
which is really cool to see.
- [Olivier] A part of it.

163
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:31,980
- [Tiffany] Yeah, a part of it.

164
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,500
So when I was building my project

165
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,500
for my Dungeon and Dungeon
Master AI assistant,

166
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,790
I wanted it to be able
to do a lot of things.

167
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,500
Actually, if you start thinking about it,

168
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,510
the task is pretty tremendous

169
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,603
if you want an AI
assistant for Game Masters.

170
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,470
So the first thing I did is
that I had the orchestrator.

171
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,290
So that's the AI Game Master
that is talking to me,

172
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,850
but as I said before, it
has access to other tools

173
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,220
and other agents that are each specialized

174
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,470
into their different tasks.

175
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,400
So this agent that I'm talking to

176
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,980
has access to another agent

177
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,520
that will be the character
manager, for example.

178
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,660
So the character manager is
able to create characters

179
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,100
on the fly for you.

180
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,560
It has access to a database of characters,

181
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,313
so it can also get characters
for you from the campaign.

182
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,750
And it also has access to...

183
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,090
Oh, it just has access
to the database, right?

184
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,130
- [Olivier] It has tools to
access the database, yeah.

185
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,600
- [Tiffany] Yeah.

186
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,560
And a second agent

187
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,960
is the rule agent.

188
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,180
So the rule agent has access

189
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,180
to the full book of rules
of Dungeons & Dragons,

190
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,503
so it basically is a RAG.

191
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,480
So to make sure

192
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,930
that whenever I want to
do something in the game,

193
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,930
then my orchestrator is actually
able to ask the rule agent,

194
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,180
is this possible,

195
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,890
or in the mechanics of
the game, is this logic.

196
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,890
And finally, there is an
MCP server that we have

197
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,390
where we run a tool.

198
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,100
So it's a very simple tool.

199
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,940
I will show you.

200
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,660
I just needed my agent to be
able to roll dices for me,

201
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,370
like a Dungeon Master
usually takes decisions

202
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,040
as he rolls dices for you, like do D20

203
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,680
or other types of dices also.

204
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,210
And so I put this
function into a MCP server

205
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,723
and use the MCP protocol
to connect it to my agent.

206
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,860
Yeah, so that's what we'll build.

207
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,028
- [Olivier] Yeah, let's do it.

208
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,861
Let's do it.
- [Tiffany] Okay.

209
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:56,280
At the end of it, we'll show you

210
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,280
a more complex version of that
demo, but just to show you...

211
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,610
Oh, yeah.

212
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,679
- [Olivier] We build it, yeah.

213
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,150
- [Tiffany] Yeah, of course.

214
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,540
We are going to build this in
the timeframe of this session

215
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,460
thanks to an SDK.

216
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,920
So Strands Agents is a
software developer kit

217
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,590
for Python, but we'll announce maybe-

218
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,423
- [Olivier] Stay tuned this week.

219
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:21,780
- [Tiffany] Yes.

220
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,910
For building agents in
just a few lines of code.

221
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,620
And you'll see that this is literally

222
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,230
just a few lines of code,
which is really cool.

223
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,550
If you've built agents and
multi-agent workflows before,

224
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,303
you'll see how much simpler
this is now with Strands.

225
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:39,090
And it supports MCP
and A2A, which is great

226
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,940
because we've been waiting
for this for a while.

227
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,390
So this is what we use at AWS
internally, Strands Agents.

228
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,223
This is-

229
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:48,630
- [Olivier] Yeah, if you've
been using like Amazon Q,

230
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,990
that's using like Strands
Agents in the back.

231
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,823
- [Tiffany] Exactly.
- [Olivier] And that's when

232
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:53,760
we open sourced it like a few months ago,

233
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,700
but we've been using it at
Amazon Q for quite some time now.

234
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,080
- [Tiffany] Yeah, there's
a lot of internet tools

235
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,583
that actually have been built
with Strands internally.

236
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,520
So this also gives you an
idea of how robust this can be

237
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,520
'cause we run on huge
projects with multiple agents.

238
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,760
- [Olivier] And it's very easy to install.

239
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,593
- [Tiffany] Yeah.

240
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:20,250
So the first thing you need to do

241
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,430
is to install this library,
pip install strands-agents,

242
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,470
and then you're good to go.

243
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,763
Let's do this demo.
- [Olivier] All right,

244
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:27,603
demo time.

245
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,610
Ooh, nice.

246
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,453
Are you ready?

247
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,935
Yeah, okay, if you are ready
there, I'm gonna do it for you.

248
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:37,320
(chuckles) All right,
so here, I have my...

249
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,720
So it's Kiro, it's like my IDE,

250
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,220
and basically, have basically nothing.

251
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,700
I have like a app.py, an empty file,

252
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,305
and a requirement.txt

253
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:49,110
where I have my strands-agents
and strands-agents-tools.

254
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,140
We're gonna see later what it is used for.

255
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,437
But I wanted to, like, start
with like a blank project

256
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:57,960
so you can see from start how it works.

257
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,040
So first things I'm gonna do

258
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,153
is I'm going to import Strands, okay?

259
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,420
So I import the agent class,

260
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,920
so I'm going to create an agent object,

261
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,570
and then I'm gonna call it.

262
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,690
I'll say, "Good morning Vegas!"

263
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,770
Okay, let's do it.

264
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,960
So I have three lines of code.

265
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,433
Let's see if I execute them.

266
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,280
So what's happening now is like

267
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,660
it's replying, "Good Morning!

268
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,060
I'm actually Claude, an
assistant," blah blah, blah,

269
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,893
not in Vegas.

270
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:28,726
Okay, you're an AI.

271
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:29,559
You're not in Vegas.

272
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,820
But what you can see here is
like in three lines of code,

273
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,820
I've created an agent and
called an LLM of my agent.

274
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,150
So now you may wonder,

275
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,340
so what kind of LLM is
called in the background?

276
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,593
So you can actually print that out.

277
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,240
I can check my model here.

278
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,253
And if I code it again,

279
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,170
you see that by default,
Strand used Amazon Bedrock,

280
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,760
and here, by default, is
the claude-sonnet-4 LLM.

281
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,110
But we can change that, actually.

282
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,490
If I import the Bedrock model class,

283
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,463
I can create a new object,

284
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,110
BedrockModel, where I can
specify any Bedrock model

285
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,850
you can find on Amazon Bedrock.

286
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,550
If I do that, I'm just
gonna tell my agent.

287
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,900
So as a model, instead
of using the default one,

288
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,020
you can use, please, the
Bedrock model I just created.

289
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,510
So now, if I execute it
again, you can see that now,

290
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,090
it's using Amazon Nova Premier.

291
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,950
And you can play with
all the configuration.

292
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,070
If I want to change the
temperature, for example,

293
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,243
I wanna to select 0.7,
whatever, and you can send that

294
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:42,690
and you see that the temperature
is changed for my call.

295
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,110
And so if you look at these
Strands documentation here,

296
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,760
strandsagent.com, in the user guide,

297
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,680
you have the model providers here.

298
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,660
And actually, you have
access to a lot of models.

299
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,730
We saw that there's Amazon Bedrock.

300
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,810
You have Anthropic.

301
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,380
So if you're like an Anthropic
API key, you can use it.

302
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,130
So Strands is model agnostic
and even provider agnostic.

303
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,980
You have, like, Gemini, Llama.

304
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,450
You have a Mistral.

305
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,580
We're French, so let's promote that.

306
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,930
You have an API key for Mistral.

307
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,700
You can use it directly here.

308
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,590
You can use basically everything you want.

309
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,480
You can even use, like, Ollama here.

310
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,280
Say you have a provider for Ollama.

311
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,915
Do you know Ollama?

312
00:15:18,915 --> 00:15:22,590
If you don't know Ollama,
basically, it's a tool

313
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,870
that allows you to
download a lot of models.

314
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,850
If you go under models
here, you have literally

315
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,190
a lot, a lot, a lot of models.

316
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,450
And what it allows you is it allows you

317
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,560
to, like, download these models.

318
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,910
They can go from like a few megabytes

319
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,970
to, like, a lot of gigabytes,
and to run them locally.

320
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,440
And it gives you access
to, like, an endpoint,

321
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,980
like an API endpoint so
you can call these models.

322
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,240
So you can even use that.

323
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,800
For example, if I import
like the Ollama class instead

324
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,190
and I say, okay, I'm just, like,

325
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,160
gonna create like an Ollama object,

326
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,420
I need to give it the host.

327
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,563
So here,

328
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,580
I have Ollama running on this here.

329
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,740
So it's running locally on my computer.

330
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,780
And then you specify the model idea.

331
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,560
So in Ollama, to run a model,

332
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,110
if I do that, it's going
to download the model

333
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,310
I'm running on my computer.

334
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,620
So I have a bunch already installed.

335
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,580
These are all the one I have installed.

336
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,340
You can see they can go from two megabytes

337
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,010
to a lot of gigabytes, and even,
like, way bigger than that.

338
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,863
So let me take like the
Llama 3.2, for example, here.

339
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,833
Oops.

340
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:31,920
Here you go.

341
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,910
And here, I'm gonna tell him,

342
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,750
okay, use the Ollama
model I just created here.

343
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,390
So if I run my code again,

344
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,580
you can see that now,
it's using Llama 3.2.

345
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,520
It's taking a bit longer because
it's running on my computer

346
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,140
so there's no cloud involved there,

347
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,550
and it's still replying to me.

348
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:52,350
So now, I use like a model
locally on my computer.

349
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,030
So okay, cool?

350
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,867
Yeah, that's cool.

351
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:57,420
- [Tiffany] But it's not yet an agent.

352
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,563
- [Olivier] It's an agent

353
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:00,160
but it's just running the LLM for now.

354
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,950
- [Tiffany] Yeah, it's an
instance of class agent,

355
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,370
but now, what's interesting is
that you can add tools to it.

356
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,190
- [Olivier] Yes, because
the good thing with LLM

357
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,790
is that they know a lot of things.

358
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,070
They've been trained on
a huge amount of data,

359
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,770
so you can ask them pretty much everything

360
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,820
and they will have an answer.

361
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,740
But sometimes, you're like
very simple questions,

362
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,200
like if I ask what time is it.

363
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,820
Very simple, right?

364
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,810
But if I ask that to my agent,
it's going to reply to me.

365
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,280
We don't need that anymore.

366
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,320
Okay, I don't have access to
the real time information,

367
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,420
so check your device, check your clock.

368
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,290
Thank you.

369
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,630
Ask an assistant, search
on your web browser,

370
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,770
or like, look at your watch.

371
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,760
Thank you very much.

372
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,670
So a very simple question,
but LLMs can't do that.

373
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,340
And that's where agents
are actually useful.

374
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,620
So you can give them access to tools,

375
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,670
and when they don't have the answer,

376
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,780
they will check if they have tools

377
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,540
that can help them answer this question.

378
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,500
And the good thing is Strands,

379
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,980
is that Strands comes
with a package of tools.

380
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,300
So if you go on the documentation again,

381
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,040
you have these tools menu here.

382
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,103
You have a community tools package.

383
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:02,190
If you don't remember,
that's the other package

384
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,040
I had in my requirements.txt.

385
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,210
And if you scroll down here,

386
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,100
you have access to a lot of tools,

387
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,370
some to manage memory,
to read and write files,

388
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,543
to do cron tasks, use_computer,

389
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:16,950
it's going to move your mouse
for you, doing HTTP requests,

390
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,800
read images, generate images, calculation.

391
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,870
There's one called current_time here.

392
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,060
So for example, we can use
this one to answer a question.

393
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,230
So if I do, okay, from

394
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,470
strands_tools, I want
to import current_time.

395
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,730
So now, I've imported the current_time,

396
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,790
and all I have to do is to tell my agent,

397
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,630
okay, you have access to all these tools.

398
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,020
So I put them in an array,

399
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,730
so right now, it's only current_time.

400
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,130
And if I ask again what time is it,

401
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,550
you will see that it's going to...

402
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,833
It's going to...

403
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,400
Yeah, it's going to call a tool.

404
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,260
So he is going to call
the tool current_time,

405
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,910
and then it's going to
reply to me, "It's nine."

406
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,380
Okay, let's...

407
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,520
In Las Vegas.

408
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,753
Let's be precise.

409
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,540
It's not 9:00 PM.

410
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,960
So I ask him again, it's
calling the current tool,

411
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,570
current_time tool, and
it's giving me the time.

412
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,300
So they can see that we enhanced

413
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,683
our LLM with tools thanks to the agent.

414
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:15,480
And you can do things pretty
cool, like file_write.

415
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,760
You can generate code.

416
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,990
I don't know if you use
like a code assistant

417
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,270
like Amazon Q, but
basically, you can recreate

418
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,030
like a very, very small,
like, version of it.

419
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,150
So for example, I have my
agent and I gave access

420
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,090
to, like, this tool,
file_write, and python_repl.

421
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,250
Python_repl is a tool that gives you

422
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,640
the possibility to execute Python code.

423
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,020
So I can do something pretty cool.

424
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,210
I can say, okay, let's write some code.

425
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,970
Like, write a function

426
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,610
in a file called

427
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,700
fib.py that generates the first

428
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,800
x ite

429
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:54,363
of Fibonacci.

430
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,310
Okay, and then execute it.

431
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,960
So I'm just asking that to my agent.

432
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,820
And if I execute it, what is happening

433
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,620
is that he's going to write the code

434
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,630
so that LLMs know how to write code.

435
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,620
That's okay.

436
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,453
Then it says,

437
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:10,530
"Okay, I need to write the
file because you asked me.

438
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,690
So I have this tool, write file."

439
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,760
So for some of the tools,
like write file, for example,

440
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,070
it's going to perform
actions on your computer.

441
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,237
There's a safeguard where it's asking you,

442
00:20:19,237 --> 00:20:22,170
"Is it okay for me to write a file?"

443
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,010
You can bypass that

444
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,337
because in the CI/CD, you don't want that.

445
00:20:24,337 --> 00:20:26,910
So you have like a environmental variable

446
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,310
that can allow you to
bypass these questions.

447
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,450
So I say yes.

448
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,870
So now, you can see that I
have this feedback.py file

449
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,910
that has been written, which is,

450
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,540
I trust it like the Fibonacci function.

451
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,608
And then again, the python_ripl one

452
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:42,600
is going to execute code.

453
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,160
So it's asking you, as a safeguard,

454
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,978
"Are you sure you want
me to execute code?"

455
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,006
And then it's going to execute the file

456
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:49,920
with the Python one just created.

457
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,170
So you can see that now, with
just like a few lines of code,

458
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:56,520
give it access to like a few
tools, it can create files,

459
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,663
execute Python code, and it's
actually pretty cool, right?

460
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,560
Yes, amazing. (laughs)

461
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,850
All right, so...

462
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,683
But we're not doing,

463
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,820
we're not here to, like, rewrite Amazon Q.

464
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,040
We're here to write a Game Master.

465
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,560
So when I write a Game Master,
I want access to other tools.

466
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,120
Like for example, Tiffany mentioned it,

467
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,220
we want a tool to roll dice.

468
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,200
So actually, if you ask
your LLM to roll a dice,

469
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,430
it's going to answer to you

470
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,920
because it's been trained
on data that roll dice,

471
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,960
but it's not like a natural random.

472
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,970
So we want to have a tool that roll dice.

473
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,390
And I don't know why the
Strands team didn't think

474
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,930
that having a roll dicing
tool was generic enough

475
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,610
to add it in the toolbox.

476
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:40,050
So, but I can actually write
a function to roll dice

477
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,130
with a number of faces.

478
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,980
Or I can write, or I can
ask an LLM, actually.

479
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,410
Write the function that...

480
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,250
It's telling five.

481
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,140
Come on, I'm going to write the code.

482
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,060
Roll a dice with a number of faces

483
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,073
given as a string.

484
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,050
Manage errors.

485
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,730
Okay, write me a function.

486
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,210
That's not the point of this talk.

487
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,043
Accept.

488
00:22:04,043 --> 00:22:06,090
Okay, please indent it.

489
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:06,990
Nice.

490
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,700
So here, I have some code, okay?

491
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,320
And wouldn't it be nice to
just say, okay, I want my...

492
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,153
Whoop.

493
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,820
I want my function to become a tool.

494
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,350
That'd be cool, right?

495
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,000
But it's not that easy, unfortunately,

496
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,980
but it's not that much complicated.

497
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,890
I just have to import this
tool here from Strands

498
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,750
and then add a decorator on my function.

499
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,982
And just by doing that my
function here, roll_dice,

500
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,641
is becoming a tool.

501
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:36,391
So now if I ask it,
okay, roll a dice of six,

502
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,240
and I execute it, I execute it

503
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,517
here, it's going to
call my tool, roll_dice,

504
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:45,360
that I just wrote

505
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,970
and then, yeah, rolled
two on a dice of six.

506
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,030
But I can also ask,
like, roll a, like, 3D20,

507
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,450
which means three dice of 20 faces.

508
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,410
And while I'm doing that,

509
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:00,180
it's going to call three
times my roll_dice tool,

510
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,100
and then give me the
result and even the total

511
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,770
even though I didn't
ask for it, but bonus.

512
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,653
But you can see that it called
my roll_dice three times.

513
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,360
Pretty cool, right?

514
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,240
I just wrote a function, it became a tool.

515
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,380
Now as Tiffany mentioned,
there's two cases, two use cases

516
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,830
where I don't want my actual
tool to be written here.

517
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:23,460
There's one use case where
maybe someone else somewhere

518
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,380
wrote a tool that is already doing that

519
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,180
and put it behind an MCP server,

520
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,090
so I want to be able to,
like, use this MCP server.

521
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,110
Or nobody did that, and I'm
like, oh, I'm a nice guy

522
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,720
so I'm going to, like, put
this tool behind an MCP server

523
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,853
so anyone else can use it, right?

524
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,770
So let's see how we can do that.

525
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,163
I'm going to create a new file, mcp_dice.

526
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,950
Okay, and so the goal is to
take my roll_dice here...

527
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,600
Okay, remove that.

528
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,880
So my agent doesn't do much

529
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,740
but it has access to an MCP server here

530
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,383
that is going to be the one
that has my tool, right?

531
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,102
So to do that, I'm going to FastMCP.

532
00:24:02,102 --> 00:24:03,390
So FastMCP is not part of Strands.

533
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,140
Strands is here to call MCP servers.

534
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,870
Strands is not meant to,
like, create MCP servers.

535
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,510
So FastMCP is a well-known library

536
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,250
that allows you to do a
lot of things with MCPs,

537
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,053
including creating servers.

538
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,413
So I'm going to create a server here.

539
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,840
I'm going to give it a name.

540
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,610
It's gonna be like DnD dice roll service.

541
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,970
Roll service.

542
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:30,960
Okay, I'm gonna...

543
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,370
You don't have to put
all this information,

544
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,340
but I'm gonna say, okay,
you run on my local host,

545
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,630
and I want you to run on port

546
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,473
8081, okay?

547
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,440
Okay, so I've done that,

548
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,860
and then I'm going to run my MCP server.

549
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,050
So I'm gonna say, okay,
I want you to run...

550
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,220
And MCP servers,

551
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,260
there are, like, three
ways of running them.

552
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,080
Either it's like on a CDIO
when you run them locally.

553
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,390
If you've done that with
Amazon Q, for example,

554
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,430
you can pull, like, NPX

555
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,080
or whatever, how you want to run them,

556
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,260
or SSE, which is like server
with pushing messages.

557
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,830
Or what I prefer is like

558
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,310
a streamable HTTP, so
it's like an HTTP stream.

559
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,623
So I'm going to specify the transport.

560
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,313
I'm gonna say, okay, I
want a streamable HTTP.

561
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,100
Let's do it.

562
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,230
Okay, so now, I have my
server, it's running.

563
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,610
All I need to do is to say,

564
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,350
okay, I want this function to be a tool.

565
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,230
So it works a bit like
in Strands, FastMCP.

566
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,890
It's like you put your
server and a tool decorator.

567
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,440
So by doing that, I have a MCP server,

568
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,690
normally, that's running.

569
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,390
All right, uh-huh.

570
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,530
Or not.

571
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,530
What did I do wrong?

572
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,613
Oh, it's run.

573
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,790
My bad, wrong function.

574
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,990
So here you go.

575
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,823
On the bottom right,

576
00:25:52,823 --> 00:25:54,630
bottom left, here, I have my MCP server

577
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,690
running on my local host on the port 8081.

578
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,120
So now, what I want to do,
I want my Game Master agent

579
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,983
to be able to call this MCP server.

580
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,720
So I'm gonna import the MCP client class,

581
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,730
and because I'm using
like streamable HTTP,

582
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,550
also the streamablehttp function.

583
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,510
And so I'm gonna say, okay, my dice_mcp,

584
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,820
I'm going to create an MCP client.

585
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,793
I'll give the function streamablehttp,

586
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,090
and I only need to give it the URL.

587
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:27,003
So I'm gonna take the endpoint here.

588
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,770
What do you want?

589
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,610
You want paste?

590
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,443
Okay.

591
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,650
8081.

592
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,340
Okay, so now, I have
access to like a client MCP

593
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,470
to my MCP server, and
I'm gonna say, okay...

594
00:26:43,462 --> 00:26:46,380
By just doing that, my
agent is going to be able

595
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,530
to call all the tools of my MCP server.

596
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,180
So let's running again.

597
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,083
Running it.

598
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,120
Yeah, FastMCP give you
a endpoint with 4/MCP.

599
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,053
My bad.

600
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,440
Okay, so you can see here,

601
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,120
you have some things
happening on the bottom left,

602
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,390
so it a request to list all the tools.

603
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,430
And then you can see that
it's calling the tool.

604
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,080
So you have some call to request.

605
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,423
You can see here that I'm
still calling my roll_dice.

606
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,640
Okay, first one didn't work,

607
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,060
but it's calling three times
my MCP server roll_dice tool,

608
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,500
and I have the results again.

609
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,550
So now, I was able to
externalize my MCP server.

610
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,670
And so my main agent doesn't do much,

611
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,880
but he has access to tools
through the MCP server, right?

612
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,713
That is cool?

613
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:35,852
- [Participant] Yeah.

614
00:27:35,852 --> 00:27:37,680
- [Olivier] Thank you. (chuckles)

615
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,140
All right, so that's
basically, we have a function.

616
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,730
It's an MCP, okay?

617
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,470
It has a function as a tool.

618
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,360
And Tiffany mentioned another thing.

619
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,770
We want to have an agent
to manage our characters.

620
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,860
So now, what I want to do, I
want to create another agent

621
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,460
with whom my Game Master can communicate

622
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,643
to ask him to manage characters, okay?

623
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,313
So let's do that.

624
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,393
Let's create a new agent.

625
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,323
Okay.

626
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,970
Blank file.

627
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,160
So you remember how you create an agent?

628
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,483
Yes, we import agent class from
Strands and create an agent.

629
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,750
So here, I'm not gonna be the one

630
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,280
who call the agent manually.

631
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,950
It's going to be my other
agent who's going to call it.

632
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,800
So I need to give it a bit
of context of what it does.

633
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,600
So I'm gonna say, I'm
going to give it a name.

634
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,983
So it's like a management agent.

635
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,870
I'm going to give it a description.

636
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,706
Here we go.

637
00:28:38,706 --> 00:28:39,539
Oh, description.

638
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,990
Okay, description is
like create and manage

639
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,240
Dungeon & Dragon characters
with a name, class, race,

640
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,620
statistics, and background.

641
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,780
And you can write and
read character files.

642
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,080
So in the final project
we're gonna show you after,

643
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,420
Tiffany mentioned that
we are using a database.

644
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,620
Here, for the sake of the demo,

645
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,780
because I don't have the whole afternoon,

646
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,690
I'm not gonna set up a
database for the purpose,

647
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,650
but what I'm gonna use

648
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,280
is I'm gonna use the
tools I have access to.

649
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:10,280
And remember, we have access
to file_read and file_write.

650
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,970
So for the purpose of this demo,

651
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,090
I'm gonna use read and write
on files as a database,

652
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,160
but in a normal project,

653
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,763
you're using a database to
manage your characters, right?

654
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,830
So I give access to the tools here.

655
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,993
I'm gonna say, okay, you
have file_read, file_write.

656
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,740
There you go.

657
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,300
And now, I have my agent.

658
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,133
Good?

659
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:33,480
Okay, so in order for this
agent to be able to be called

660
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,143
by my Game Master, I need
to make it a agent server.

661
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,863
So I'm going to create an A2A server here,

662
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,170
and let me create

663
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:49,080
an object, which I'm going
to give it the agent.

664
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,870
So on this A2A server,
agent to agent server,

665
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,433
I want this agent to run.

666
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,673
Again, I'm gonna say,

667
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:58,080
okay, I want you to run on my local host,

668
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,680
and I want you to run on another
port, like 8082, this one.

669
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,900
It was 8081, the first one, right?

670
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,860
Remember?

671
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,700
Yes.

672
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,320
Let's go with 8082.

673
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,320
And then I'm gonna say, okay,
I want you to run, all right?

674
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,250
So by just doing that,

675
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,970
I created an agent who
has access to tools.

676
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,740
I have an agent to agent server.

677
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,573
I'm just running it.

678
00:30:20,573 --> 00:30:22,533
So that's running.

679
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,263
Let's run it.

680
00:30:24,263 --> 00:30:27,780
Okay, I'm running my
agent, character agent.

681
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,600
So you can see it's running.
So I have my MCP here, server,

682
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,200
and my other agent running here.

683
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,670
So I'm going back to my main Game Master,

684
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:40,230
which, again, we don't want it
to have any, like, capacity.

685
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:44,190
It has to rely on other
agents and tools to work.

686
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,263
So I'm going to, okay,

687
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,200
import a A2A client to provider.

688
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,680
So for the MCP servers, you
need to create an MCP client

689
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,750
for every MCP server you have

690
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,990
because you have to get access
to their tools individually.

691
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,670
So a bit of a difference,

692
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,740
when you have access to an MCP server,

693
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,680
you can list all the tools
he has access to, okay?

694
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,380
And so you call a tool
from this MCP server.

695
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,400
When you call another agent,
you just send even a prompt

696
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,570
and the other agent,

697
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,187
which actually can use a different LLMs,

698
00:31:17,187 --> 00:31:20,580
you can use another model
provider on this other agent,

699
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,680
but these other agents, you
don't know how it functions.

700
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,830
You don't know what
tools it has access to.

701
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,152
You don't know if it's
calling any other agents

702
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,360
because the purpose of
it is to run its own LLM,

703
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,300
to have its own, like,
reflection and iterations,

704
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,433
and then to give you an answer.

705
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,560
So that's why for the MCP,

706
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,413
we need an MCP client
for every MCP server.

707
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:47,220
For the agents, however,
it's a bit different.

708
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,860
I can say, okay...

709
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,480
I can say, okay, I created
like an A2A client provider,

710
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,820
and it takes an array of all the URLs

711
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,290
of all the agents you want to call.

712
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:03,290
So here, I have my agent which
runs on my 8082 port here.

713
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,460
And if you have others, other
agents, you basically just...

714
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,060
It's an array, so just put
them all here, all right?

715
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,100
We only have one now.

716
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,970
And so what I'm gonna do,

717
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,520
I say, okay, this provider, it has tools.

718
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,283
So now, the tools here, it's
not the tools of my agents.

719
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:23,040
It's the tools of the provider

720
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,040
that gives my agent access
to calling other agents.

721
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,760
Yeah, it's gonna make clear in a second.

722
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,780
It's gonna be clear in a second.

723
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,920
Okay, so now I have my MCP
client for my FCP server,

724
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,743
my A2A client to provider
to call my other agent.

725
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,440
Let's give it a try.

726
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,450
Create a

727
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,880
DnD character named...

728
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,713
Give me a name.

729
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,723
- [Participant] Steve.

730
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:48,556
- [Olivier] Steve.

731
00:32:48,556 --> 00:32:51,720
Steve, who is a elf of the night.

732
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,850
Yes, let's be...

733
00:32:53,758 --> 00:32:54,591
- [Tiffany] A night elf.

734
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:55,424
- [Olivier] Night elf.

735
00:32:55,424 --> 00:32:56,493
Oh, it's okay.

736
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:59,860
Roll the dice to generate its

737
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:05,693
characteristics, then
save it in a file, okay?

738
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,550
So we're doing that.

739
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,590
So now, when you start
to have a good practice

740
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,980
when you have agents is
that when you start to have

741
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,053
like a lot of MCP or other,
like, tools or agents

742
00:33:18,053 --> 00:33:20,100
you can communicate with,

743
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,953
a good practice is to
give it a system prompt.

744
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,103
So a system prompt is basically a prompt

745
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:28,470
that is gonna tell him what to do,

746
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,200
what it is responsible to,
but something I like to do

747
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,590
is to give it some guidances
in this system prompt.

748
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,730
So for example, here, I said,

749
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,560
okay, you are a DnD Game Master.

750
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,090
You have access to
different tools and agents.

751
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,260
Use them when you need them.

752
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,910
So like, you can draw dice.

753
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,440
You can create or manage characters.

754
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,540
You don't need to give it,
to tell him how to do it.

755
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,220
Just, like, you have
access to these things.

756
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,170
Just use them if you want.

757
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,030
And because we don't
want it to do anything

758
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,770
but only rely on these tools and agents,

759
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,050
just specify, like,
never answer by yourself,

760
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,630
always use the tools and/or agents, okay?

761
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,683
It's a good practice.

762
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,653
Let's do it.

763
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:02,160
It's gonna work, right?

764
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,180
It's gonna work.

765
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,013
- [Participant] Yeah.

766
00:34:04,013 --> 00:34:06,060
- [Olivier] Yes, it's
gonna work. Okay, let's go.

767
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,140
So, what is happening?

768
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,813
Okay, it's calling my MCP
server list to request,

769
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,840
also doing some agent stuff.

770
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,840
So now, it's rolling dices for
ability score, some things.

771
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,960
It's going to generate, like,
six main abilities, so okay.

772
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,043
Strength, 11.

773
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:24,873
Average Steve.

774
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,180
A 12 in dexterity.

775
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,440
Average Steve.

776
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,150
Eight for constitution.

777
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,650
Not the best.

778
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,480
Steve is quite intelligent.

779
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,313
That's good.

780
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,350
How many dice are we running?

781
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,183
Six in wisdom.

782
00:34:38,183 --> 00:34:41,340
Ah, Steve is not the best
character. (chuckles)

783
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,570
And that's 10 for charisma.

784
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,270
Okay, so now you have the characteristic.

785
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,103
And you can see here...

786
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:51,050
Okay, so here, it's using
this tool, a2a_send_message.

787
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:54,440
And that's what I was talking
when I had the tools here.

788
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,130
So the tools here are these kind of tools

789
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,403
that allows my agent to
call the other agents.

790
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,620
So you can see at the bottom right

791
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,080
that my other agents had been called.

792
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,480
And again, he has access
to, like, a file_write tool,

793
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,330
and he's asking me if I'm okay to use it.

794
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,270
He's writing the tool, and
now, I have a file here,

795
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,810
Steve, night elf character,
with all its characteristics.

796
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,030
So you can ask him to write it as a JSON,

797
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,350
whatever you wanted.

798
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,500
I didn't specify anything,
so it's just like a file.

799
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,370
The same thing I can say,

800
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:28,370
okay, what can you tell me
about the character Steve?

801
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,893
And if I execute that,

802
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,350
again, okay, tools,

803
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,387
we don't need the tools,
normally, for this one.

804
00:35:36,387 --> 00:35:38,670
You say, okay, I need to check
what agents are available

805
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,120
to help me get information
about characters.

806
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,110
You can see that you say,

807
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,630
okay, it's listing the agents.

808
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,880
Say, I have access to a
DnD character management.

809
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,140
It's sending a message.

810
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,900
And if I scroll up here,
you should see that,

811
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,210
tick, tick, tick, tick,

812
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,510
here, it's using the file_read tool.

813
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,830
So it know that he has a file about Steve.

814
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,900
He's reading it, sending the response,

815
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,450
and I have my agent here, my Game Master

816
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,240
who will receive all the
information about Steve.

817
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,500
And he even gives, like, some...

818
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,390
Like, Steve, like, he
relies on studying knowledge

819
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,290
rather than blah, blah, blah.

820
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,340
It gives its opinion.

821
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,910
But basically, we can see
that in a few lines of code,

822
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,570
I have my first agent,
another agent's tools.

823
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,150
Something I didn't mention
though, I forgot to mention,

824
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,200
when you have tools...

825
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,430
So here, it's pretty obvious.

826
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,230
I have a tool that is, the
function is called roll_dice.

827
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,450
I mean, it's pretty obvious.

828
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,540
So when I asked my agent to
roll a dice, it's going to check

829
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,340
and say, okay, there's a
function called roll_dice.

830
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,320
It makes sense that it's rolling dices.

831
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,370
Now, when you don't have...

832
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:45,507
Like, if I generate the docstring,

833
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:51,360
when you have multiple tools,
you have to use docstring.

834
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,933
So that's how, actually,
a agent discover tools,

835
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,180
using the docstring.

836
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,320
Let me just click that in.

837
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,300
So you need to give it a description,

838
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,980
you need to give it the arguments,

839
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,363
and then you return to examples here.

840
00:37:04,363 --> 00:37:05,196
- [Tiffany] Um-

841
00:37:05,196 --> 00:37:06,029
- [Olivier] So when you
have a lot of tools-

842
00:37:06,029 --> 00:37:07,248
- [Tiffany] Yeah, this one makes sense.

843
00:37:07,248 --> 00:37:08,520
- [Olivier] It's actually using
the docstring to use that.

844
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,800
And that's what I use
when I use the tools here,

845
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,730
the current_time.

846
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,320
The first time I said,
okay, give me the time,

847
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,270
and it gave me the time, like UTC.

848
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,980
But if you look at the code,

849
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,510
the source code of the current_time,

850
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,387
you can see that it has a docstring here,

851
00:37:20,387 --> 00:37:22,740
and in the arguments, I
can give you the time zone.

852
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,920
So when I say in Las
Vegas, my Game Master agent

853
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,780
transcribed Las Vegas to the time zone

854
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,700
and called the tool current_time

855
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,710
with the time zone argument.

856
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,670
You wanted to add something?

857
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,730
- [Tiffany] Yeah, just,
so that's interesting.

858
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,613
When you write your tools,

859
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,240
actually, in the
documentation of Strands...

860
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,260
I don't know where it is.

861
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,393
- [Olivier] Yeah, it was there.

862
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:46,410
- [Tiffany] Oh, yeah.

863
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,990
You have examples of good practices,

864
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,360
and it's actually good to look at them.

865
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,490
You have examples of good practices

866
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,620
of how to write a good prompt,

867
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,100
'cause as Olivier said, this
is crucial into your design

868
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,980
because it uses this description

869
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,110
to know exactly what the tool is doing.

870
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:08,310
So there's a standard way of
writing those docstrings now.

871
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,050
And what I would recommend for you

872
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,910
is not to write it on your own,

873
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,620
but rather give the example
to your AI code assistant,

874
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,540
but make it generate by an AI

875
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,510
and give them the example
of the good practices

876
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,670
that is in the Strands documentation

877
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,750
and then give them the function

878
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,200
and they will write a
perfect docstrings for you.

879
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,210
But yeah, I, like, almost never

880
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,133
write my docstrings myself anymore.

881
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,001
- [Olivier] Yeah, most of the time,

882
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:35,400
it generates it by default so...

883
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,720
But yeah, it's a good,
it's a recommendation

884
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,324
to use the docstring because
that's what you're...

885
00:38:38,324 --> 00:38:40,170
If you have, like, multiple tools,

886
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,670
it may not know which one to call,

887
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:45,660
so it's going to use the
docstring to know how it's called,

888
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,030
what it's doing, and what
parameters it needs to take

889
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,040
and the type of the parameters.

890
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,060
Good?

891
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,893
Okay.

892
00:38:51,893 --> 00:38:52,920
- [Participant] I have a question.

893
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,380
- [Olivier] Sure, I don't
know how question works,

894
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,849
but yeah, I'm open to questions.

895
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:02,473
- [Participant] The code
is written from A2A agent,

896
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:05,470
but there's also concept for orchestration

897
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,037
in the Master Strand on the...

898
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,940
- [Olivier] Yeah, so
there's different ways

899
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,490
agents can communicate and work together.

900
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,560
Here, what we did is,
like, we just let the agent

901
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,620
to discover the other agents
and to go the one you want.

902
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,530
But if you go on the
Strands documentation,

903
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,660
there's different ways of creating agents.

904
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,280
You can create, like, workflows.

905
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,650
So basically, you said,
like, I have these agents

906
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:34,830
and I want them to always
be executed in that order.

907
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,930
And you can have, like, graphs of agents

908
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,300
saying, like, oh, these
graphs are connected.

909
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,010
These agents are connected.

910
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,350
You can have, like, swarms of agents.

911
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,870
Actually, if you go to...

912
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,010
Let's look at the agentic workflow here.

913
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:50,910
I think you have a code sample.

914
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,160
So here, you have, like,
an agent researcher,

915
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,120
an agent analyst, an
agent, like, writer agent.

916
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,483
And so you can just...

917
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:00,540
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

918
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,520
Where is the...

919
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,383
Hmm.

920
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,623
It's somewhere, somewhere here.

921
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,953
All right.

922
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:15,930
I don't know exactly, but
there's the example somewhere.

923
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:16,950
You have...

924
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,117
Where is it?

925
00:40:18,117 --> 00:40:19,830
But basically, yeah, you can do,

926
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,740
like, workflow
orchestrations, swarm graphs.

927
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,423
I think that's what you meant.

928
00:40:26,982 --> 00:40:27,815
Hmm?

929
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,600
I mean, it's still going to use

930
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,840
like A2A underneath,

931
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,270
so the protocol, the standard that is used

932
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,773
is the standard protocol.

933
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,093
I don't know if that
answered the question.

934
00:40:45,661 --> 00:40:46,494
Hmm?

935
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,040
The orchestration agent
is still going to use

936
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,780
like A2A, unless you run
all the agents on one code,

937
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,130
which you can do, actually.

938
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,300
You can run all the agents.

939
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,230
The agent to agent...

940
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,070
So what we did here,

941
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,150
okay, I think I got the question,

942
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,390
is that we ran the agent on, like, its own

943
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:10,470
on a server, right, with
its own, like, endpoints.

944
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,303
But you can, actually,

945
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,840
yeah, you can do like they do here.

946
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,470
It's like, okay, I have an agent here,

947
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,170
and I have another agent that
you write in the same file.

948
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,840
And so in that sense, here's
not going to go to use A2A

949
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,573
because they're all running
on the same source code.

950
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,440
I don't know if there's a
good practice or whatever.

951
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,790
The good thing when you have an agent

952
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:33,660
running on its own server
is that anyone can call it

953
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,190
and it's not just for you.

954
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:39,690
But that's the software design (chuckles)

955
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,073
or architecture question.

956
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,170
We have time.

957
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,670
Are we good?

958
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,840
All right.

959
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,760
So that's it for the live coding demo,

960
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,650
but we want to show you the final product.

961
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:53,133
Well, final product, still
a demo but a bit better.

962
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,350
Taking over?

963
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,880
- [Tiffany] Yeah.

964
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,850
- [Olivier] All right, should I run it?

965
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,683
- [Tiffany] Yeah.

966
00:42:00,683 --> 00:42:04,500
So it's really tiny at the screen.

967
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,340
We realize this, but
this is just to show you

968
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,310
all of the different
servers that we're running.

969
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:15,033
So the first one that
Olivier was running was the-

970
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:18,177
- [Olivier] MCP server here.

971
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:20,340
- [Tiffany] The MCP server is here,

972
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,463
then here is the character agent.

973
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,984
- [Olivier] The rules agent.

974
00:42:25,984 --> 00:42:28,356
- [Tiffany] The rules agent and then-

975
00:42:28,356 --> 00:42:29,189
- [Olivier] Our Game Master.

976
00:42:29,189 --> 00:42:30,900
- [Tiffany] The orchestrator.

977
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,900
And we have built a front-end application.

978
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,640
- [Olivier] Do you wanna show
the source code a bit before?

979
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,890
- [Tiffany] Yes, sure.

980
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,510
So-

981
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,823
- [Olivier] Tell me what to show.

982
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,750
- [Tiffany] So the MCP server
is pretty much the same

983
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,000
that we have shown during the demo.

984
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,003
The character, here is the character-

985
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,090
- [Olivier] Agent, yeah.
- [Tiffany] Agent.

986
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,670
So it has access to a database.

987
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:03,186
We have not created a database
together, but here it is.

988
00:43:03,186 --> 00:43:08,186
You can see that we have
given the agent character

989
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,000
a bunch of different tools

990
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,836
to allow it access to
writing into the database,

991
00:43:15,836 --> 00:43:18,090
reading the database,

992
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:22,110
and also, I think deleting things,

993
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:26,590
so it really is managing
this databases of characters

994
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,480
- [Olivier] And you can see
like, basically, each tool here

995
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,420
is literally just
wrapping a database call.

996
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,030
Just like say, oh, find character by name.

997
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,460
If we give it like a name,
there's the docstring.

998
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,190
And then the only important,
like, line of code here

999
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:43,110
is this one db.search.

1000
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,490
It's just, like, wrapping,

1001
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,560
like an API would wrap database code.

1002
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,150
The tools are doing the same.

1003
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:51,150
- [Tiffany] And all of that
wrapped into a tool decorator-

1004
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,290
- [Olivier] Mm-hmm.

1005
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,580
- [Tiffany] Too.

1006
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:58,440
And we've made a massive
system prompt and description-

1007
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,280
- [Olivier] Yeah.

1008
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,120
- [Tiffany] Because you'll see

1009
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,883
as you iterate through your tests,

1010
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,430
prompt engineering is
still a thing. (chuckles)

1011
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,810
You still need to make sure
that your prompt is actually,

1012
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,380
like, describes well the different actions

1013
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,583
that the agents can do.

1014
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:22,590
Specifically, if you want a
certain format as an output,

1015
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:25,980
or specifically, if you
wanted to standardize...

1016
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,310
'Cause, for example, for
creating a character,

1017
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:31,350
this is a pretty standard output for us.

1018
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:33,960
We always want kind of the
same format and everything.

1019
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,810
So we needed to be very specific

1020
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:41,810
into what we wanted the
character agent to perform.

1021
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,016
And also, this is the
system prompt of the-

1022
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:46,849
- [Olivier] Game Master.

1023
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:47,682
- [Tiffany] Game Master.

1024
00:44:47,682 --> 00:44:51,990
So the orchestrator also
has a massive system prompt.

1025
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:59,100
This is through several
iterations of testing this demo

1026
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,133
that we've come up with
this big system prompt.

1027
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,770
I mean, it's a pain that you
have to go through, I guess.

1028
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:12,770
Like, at the moment, testing
how your workflow goes

1029
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,610
and iterating through different prompts

1030
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:20,970
is the way you can reach

1031
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,653
satisfactory outputs.

1032
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,090
Here, we-

1033
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,050
- [Olivier] Especially when you want

1034
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,240
like an exact output type.

1035
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,020
- [Tiffany] Yeah, so we came
up with this JSON format

1036
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,680
specifically because we
had a front end at the end,

1037
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,920
and we wanted to be able
to take each of the outputs

1038
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,230
and put it in the right
place in your front.

1039
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,670
So you're like...

1040
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:45,540
At some point you're like,

1041
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,030
if you want to generate
things automatically,

1042
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,040
you kind of need your orchestrator

1043
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,593
to answer to you in a standardized way.

1044
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,610
And this prompt actually works
pretty well at the moment.

1045
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,979
I'm saying this, but maybe
the demo's gonna fail, but-

1046
00:45:58,979 --> 00:46:01,323
- [Olivier] No, no, it's not.

1047
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:03,451
- [Tiffany] So live demo, huh?

1048
00:46:03,451 --> 00:46:04,284
- [Olivier] No way.

1049
00:46:04,284 --> 00:46:05,220
Yeah, here, we wanted, like, the response

1050
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,420
to be, like, used in web applications,

1051
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,720
where, like, give it a response
based on this response,

1052
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,700
which is like what the
Game Master is saying.

1053
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,710
Give us, like, action that you can suggest

1054
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:19,860
the user does after, the
player, give some details.

1055
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,240
And if you roll some dice,

1056
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,240
just tell us the kind of
dice you rolled, the result,

1057
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,440
and the reason why you
had to roll the dice.

1058
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,010
Should we try?

1059
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:29,843
- [Tiffany] Yes, yes, yes.

1060
00:46:29,843 --> 00:46:31,440
- [Olivier] Okay, all right.

1061
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,150
So Steve, we see that Steve,

1062
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:34,260
Steve is a man.

1063
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,890
He is a dwarf this time,
random, and he's a cleric.

1064
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:41,210
Okay, so I'm gonna take these...

1065
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,863
They draw all of my Game Master.

1066
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,490
Let's go.

1067
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:51,153
- [Tiffany] Okay, so
as we launch the game,

1068
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,350
the AI Game Master has the
instruction to launch a campaign

1069
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,690
and create the character, Steve,

1070
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,150
with the characteristics that we gave him.

1071
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,890
So what is Steve?

1072
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:06,240
It's a human?

1073
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,992
- [Olivier] No, he's a dwarf.
- [Tiffany] Dwarf.

1074
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:08,825
Dwarf cleric.

1075
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:09,658
- [Olivier] Dwarf cleric, yeah.

1076
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:12,690
- [Tiffany] So you'll see
that there are different calls

1077
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:16,083
that have been made by
the game orchestrator.

1078
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,670
- [Olivier] Like, the
dice tool has been called.

1079
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,560
The character agents has been called.

1080
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,820
And it generates, like, an answer

1081
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,260
and send it back to the game.

1082
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,630
So let's see what we have here.

1083
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:28,860
You want to read what it says?

1084
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,540
Welcome to the realm, Steve.

1085
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,070
Your English is better than mine.

1086
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:33,904
- [Tiffany] Well, okay.

1087
00:47:33,904 --> 00:47:34,737
(Olivier laughs)

1088
00:47:34,737 --> 00:47:36,840
Welcome to the realm, Steve.

1089
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:41,490
Your dwarven boots crunch on
frost-covered cobblestones

1090
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:43,680
as you approach the
flickering torch light.

1091
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,550
This is pretty cool.

1092
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:46,470
Like, you can read the entire thing.

1093
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:49,410
I've played so many
different games with this.

1094
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:50,370
This is pretty cool.

1095
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,780
So we have three...

1096
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,880
We asked the orchestrator

1097
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,910
to generate three different
options that you can click

1098
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,830
if you don't wanna type.

1099
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,150
So let's investigate.

1100
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:00,983
- [Olivier] Yes.

1101
00:48:00,983 --> 00:48:01,816
- [Tiffany] Investigating is cool

1102
00:48:01,816 --> 00:48:06,440
'cause it usually leads to
dice rolls, as you can see.

1103
00:48:08,248 --> 00:48:10,680
- [Olivier] Okay, we have
the response already.

1104
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,900
- [Tiffany] So what was the...
Investigate the strange sound

1105
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,870
coming from the alley behind the tavern.

1106
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:20,675
And as the Game Master is rolling dices,

1107
00:48:20,675 --> 00:48:24,630
we can get the results of the rolled dices

1108
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:28,650
and put them in our front application.

1109
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,240
It's cool.

1110
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,982
- [Olivier] Or you can
type whatever you want,

1111
00:48:31,982 --> 00:48:33,899
if it's like, run away,

1112
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:35,957
go home.

1113
00:48:35,957 --> 00:48:37,906
I don't know. (chuckles)

1114
00:48:37,906 --> 00:48:39,056
It's gonna be the same.

1115
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:42,000
Do you want us to try the rule thing?

1116
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
- [Tiffany] Well, so this is where we know

1117
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,810
the boundaries of our demos.

1118
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:49,793
- [Olivier] Retreat.

1119
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:56,090
- [Tiffany] Let's try to make
it invoke the rule agent.

1120
00:48:57,499 --> 00:48:59,099
Say something that has no sense.

1121
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,433
Like...

1122
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:05,220
- [Olivier] Fly to the
moon, take your light saber,

1123
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,320
and kill the monsters.

1124
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,300
- [Tiffany] So basically,
if you wanna do something

1125
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,670
that has no sense in the
mechanics of the game,

1126
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:12,997
usually, the Game Master will be like,

1127
00:49:12,997 --> 00:49:14,940
"Hey, you can't do this."

1128
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,580
But we'll see if...

1129
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,528
So there's an error message, first.

1130
00:49:19,528 --> 00:49:22,064
(Tiffany chuckles)
- [Olivier] Yeah.

1131
00:49:22,064 --> 00:49:22,897
- [Tiffany] But...

1132
00:49:22,897 --> 00:49:24,330
- [Olivier] Okay, let's ask him instead.

1133
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:25,710
Like, can I go to the moon?

1134
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:26,543
Can I,

1135
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,110
can I fly to the moon

1136
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:33,453
and back with my rocket?

1137
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,233
Let's see.

1138
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:42,390
- [Tiffany] It should
request the rule agents.

1139
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:43,223
- [Olivier] Aha.
- [Tiffany] Okay.

1140
00:49:43,223 --> 00:49:44,656
- [Olivier] Yeah, something's happening.

1141
00:49:44,656 --> 00:49:45,489
Yeah.

1142
00:49:45,489 --> 00:49:46,322
- [Tiffany] Yeah.
- [Olivier] And the rules.

1143
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,320
- [Tiffany] Oh, it's working.

1144
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,647
- [Olivier] Yeah.

1145
00:49:50,647 --> 00:49:53,220
- [Tiffany] I'm so happy. (laughs)

1146
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,340
- [Olivier] For the rules
agent, what we did that,

1147
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,090
like, we took the PDF of the game,

1148
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,937
we put it in a vector
database, so it's like a RAG.

1149
00:49:59,937 --> 00:50:03,780
And so that's how our
agent is able to read it

1150
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,970
and say, like, "Steve,
you're still bleeding

1151
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:08,790
in a dark alley facing a dangerous bandit.

1152
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,070
There's no rocket in the
medieval fantasy world of DnD.

1153
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:14,070
You are a first level draw
of cleric with," whatever.

1154
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,450
- [Tiffany] 23 feet of walking-

1155
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:18,150
- [Olivier] No, no, no, travel.
No sci-fi technology, sorry.

1156
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:20,550
- [Tiffany] Well, I mean that, that's good

1157
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,770
'cause it's actually arguing
as to why you can't do

1158
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,790
the things you want to do.

1159
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:27,060
But yeah, it's actually
checked the rules of the games

1160
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,430
to see if you actually could not do this.

1161
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:32,010
So yeah, this is really cool.

1162
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:35,310
So as you can see in, like,
a short amount of time...

1163
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,830
Do we still have time?

1164
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:37,663
- [Olivier] Yeah, well...

1165
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:40,750
- [Tiffany] Yeah, we are able to build

1166
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,817
multi-agentic workflow
with the Strands SDK.

1167
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,670
Do you wanna add anything else to...

1168
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,503
Does anybody want to try something?

1169
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,383
Or...

1170
00:50:54,383 --> 00:50:55,500
- [Olivier] Let me check

1171
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,340
because you should be
able to find these...

1172
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,173
Tick, tick, tick.

1173
00:51:00,173 --> 00:51:02,580
Okay, just for those who
want to see this in action,

1174
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:05,130
if you go on AWS Samples,

1175
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:08,850
you have these
sample-once-upon-agentic-ai.

1176
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,860
This is usually a workshop, but here...

1177
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,290
So by default, you won't
see anything on this branch,

1178
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,570
but if you go on the solution-v3 here,

1179
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:18,990
you have all the source code
to run the demo we just ran.

1180
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,150
And if you go on the UI branch,

1181
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,670
you even have access
to the UI that we used,

1182
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:24,930
which is like an another application,

1183
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,490
so feel free to go check.

1184
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:29,520
- [Tiffany] Let me share QR codes-

1185
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,558
- [Olivier] Yes.

1186
00:51:30,558 --> 00:51:31,391
- [Tiffany] With you.

1187
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:33,453
So if I go back to the presentation,

1188
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,617
so those were, if we failed, we had

1189
00:51:36,617 --> 00:51:37,830
(Olivier chuckles)

1190
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:38,690
video recorded-
- [Olivier] Not good videos.

1191
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,050
- [Tiffany] Of the demo.
- [Olivier] It worked.

1192
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,906
The demo worked.
- [Tiffany] Yeah, it did work.

1193
00:51:41,906 --> 00:51:42,739
(audience cheers and applauds)

1194
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:43,572
Yeah.

1195
00:51:43,572 --> 00:51:44,405
Whew.

1196
00:51:44,405 --> 00:51:45,238
Okay.

1197
00:51:45,238 --> 00:51:46,071
- [Olivier] Phew.

1198
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:47,880
- [Tiffany] So here are the
code samples that you can get,

1199
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,123
also, the Strands documentation
if ever you're interested.

1200
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,280
And if you have any questions,

1201
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,900
we still have a little bit of time.

1202
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,100
So thank you very much for your attention.

1203
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:00,089
(audience applauds)
