1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,910
- Can everybody hear me okay?

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,500
Show of hands. All right, great.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,793
Thank you for joining
this unique experience.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,980
We're calling it here in
the context of re:Invent,

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,550
Anatomy of a Cloud Ransomware
Attack: Live Simulation.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,590
Show of hands, how many
folks in the audience

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,683
have been through a
tabletop exercise before?

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,343
All right, so about
half the audience. Cool.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,690
I'm gonna give you a little
rundown on how this goes down,

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,790
but first I wanted to
introduce "Zero Hour."

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,620
That's what we call this event.

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,270
It's an immersive tabletop experience

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,650
that Rubrik has created
to help our customers

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,620
understand what folks go through

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,333
during a complex cyber attack.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,290
A lot of what we built in this

17
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,060
is based on real cloud tactics,
techniques, and procedures

18
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,890
that threat adversaries use

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,230
to infiltrate cloud environments.

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,060
This is not a real company,
this is not a real scenario,

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,880
but it is based on real TTPs.

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,120
So just want everybody to know that

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,050
what you're gonna see here can happen

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,483
and hopefully will not
happen in your organization.

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,080
Lemme introduce, I guess
first the organization,

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,110
the fictitious organization
that we created, Horizon Retail.

27
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,090
It's a cloud-forward retail organization

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,770
with a multi-country
physical store footprint

29
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,573
with mission-critical deployments in AWS.

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,570
There's three things that we ask

31
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,070
as a part of these exercises.

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,070
The first is observe the
gaps in Horizon's strategy

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,700
and how that led them

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,903
to this no win crisis
situation at the end, right?

35
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,650
The second that we ask
you to do is just reflect,

36
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,870
reflect and bring back
some of those learnings

37
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,300
to your own organization, right?

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,887
There's gonna be pieces here
that you're gonna be like,

39
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,860
"That could never happen to us,"

40
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,060
and, "We've got that covered."

41
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,100
But there may be other pieces here

42
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,537
that you might look at and
be like, "Hmm," you know.

43
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:10,140
"I might wanna bring some of
that back to my security team."

44
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,800
So please use this as an
opportunity to reflect.

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
It's a safe space.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,380
We're gonna try to leave time
for questions at the end.

47
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,870
I can't guarantee we're
gonna get to questions,

48
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,620
but we will try to leave time
for questions at the end.

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,050
That's the participate part.

50
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,360
When we do this in a much smaller setting,

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,190
there's about 200 people
in this room right now,

52
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,200
when we do this in a much smaller setting,

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,910
we usually will have the
participants read the parts,

54
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,360
but unfortunately we're in
a very large group here.

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,580
We will try to pass around
a microphone at the end

56
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,590
so that you can participate.

57
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,190
And when I say participate,
I mean either ask questions,

58
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,200
again, and this is a safe space,

59
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,220
or lend some of your
own experiences, right?

60
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,440
I am sure there are folks in this room

61
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,900
that have been through an attack before.

62
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,280
And it's a scary experience,

63
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,950
and if you think others
in the room could benefit

64
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,280
from your experiences,
we would love to hear it,

65
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,190
because we need more of that, right?

66
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,370
That's ultimately what we try to do

67
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,820
as a part of this exercise,
is to foster that discussion.

68
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,340
So these will be the participants,

69
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,870
these are folks that I work
with day to day at Rubrik,

70
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,503
and they will help me with the
script and the read through.

71
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,580
How's this gonna go down?

72
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,050
It's about a one hour event,

73
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,880
and usually it's a one hour event

74
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,390
because we foster discussion
after every scene.

75
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,490
Very big room here, lots of people.

76
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,250
We're not gonna be able to
have a very deep discussion.

77
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,270
So what I'm gonna do is

78
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,600
I'm gonna summarize the key
takeaways after every scene.

79
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,760
I will have a key takeaways slide.

80
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,730
We'll go through it,
and again, at the end,

81
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,010
hopefully we can pass around a mic

82
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,020
and have time for questions.

83
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,400
There will be five scenes.
Scene one will be a video.

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,510
Scenes two, three, and
four will be read throughs.

85
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,960
These folks behind me are playing parts.

86
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,510
You could maybe read these signs,

87
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,490
and if you can't read these signs,

88
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,860
I'll give you some idea
of the type of personas

89
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,840
that will be involved in this.

90
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,140
People like an ops analyst
or a head of cloud ops

91
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,030
or a CIO, right?

92
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,320
Those are the kinds of folks

93
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,020
that are gonna be involved in a MIM call

94
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,870
that gets called when these things go down

95
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,450
and they will play those roles.

96
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,610
Again, sorry for the font size.

97
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,740
Sorry that these signs
may not be big enough

98
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,660
for the folks in the back to see.

99
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,160
If you wanna come up

100
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,040
and get an understanding
of who's speaking,

101
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,300
we can do that.

102
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,400
There are more than these roles,

103
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,200
there are four more roles.

104
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,120
They will be done virtually,

105
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,850
and my friend Anirudh
here will orchestrate

106
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,313
all of it flawlessly, right?

107
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,550
We've had a lot of discussions

108
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,080
about how we orchestrate this thing,

109
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,943
so it's kind of an inside joke.

110
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,640
As I mentioned, normally
we facilitate discussion

111
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,630
after each scene,

112
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,130
and it's folks that are just
trying to either vent, right?

113
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,353
Because again, if you've been through,

114
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,350
it's a hairy experience.

115
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,590
So we have folks that just
like to vent, and that's cool,

116
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,930
but we also have people that just wanna

117
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,600
lend some expertise to the
discussion or ask questions

118
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,370
or ask further clarification.

119
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,260
Again, we'll try to do that at the end.

120
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,870
I am going to give you key
insights after every scene

121
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,880
and the learnings that
our customers hopefully

122
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,710
take away at the end of every scene.

123
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,710
And as I mentioned,
hopefully we'll leave time

124
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,593
for an interactive audience
discussion at the end.

125
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,193
With that, let's start with scene one.

126
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,820
- [Narrator 1] A modern enterprise

127
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,710
is a marvel of efficiency.

128
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,050
Every transaction, every shipment,

129
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,560
every customer interaction
is a seamless flow of data

130
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,180
orchestrated in the cloud.

131
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,390
The business is the
application, the database,

132
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,490
and the cloud services that run them.

133
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,873
But what happens when the
cloud that powers it all falls.

134
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,900
We are inside the IT Operations Center,

135
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,720
a room that is usually quiet at this hour.

136
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,430
The team is starting a shift

137
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,220
that is about to become
anything but routine.

138
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,990
The first sign of trouble appears

139
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,140
not as a single critical alert...

140
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,520
- Hey, Alex.

141
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,643
- [Narrator 1] But as a chorus
of discordant data points.

142
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,210
- Can you look at this?
- Yeah.

143
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,130
- The right latency on
the primary EBS volumes

144
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,610
is through the roof, but
read I/O's completely flat.

145
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,233
That's weird for Sunday morning.

146
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,210
- Well, yeah, you're right.
It's not a DDoS attack.

147
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,370
External traffic is normal.

148
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,640
I mean, we haven't even pushed
a new code since last Friday.

149
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,900
It's like a single process just
keeps writing over and over.

150
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,910
What about the S3 buckets?

151
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,473
- Checking now. Oh, wow.

152
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,800
I'm seeing thousands
of API calls per minute

153
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,660
against the critical buckets.

154
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,941
Put object, put object,
delete object versions.

155
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,313
- Whoa, lemme see, lemme see, lemme see.

156
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:27,690
It says the object names,
they're all being rewritten.

157
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,123
There's a new suffix. Locked.

158
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,473
This is not a runaway
script. This is hostile.

159
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,913
This is an active attack.
(dramatic music)

160
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:44,742
(phone buzzing)

161
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:49,890
(dramatic music)

162
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,960
- You're calling early. What's going on?

163
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,120
- We are under active attack.

164
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,740
I'm seeing what looks like mass encryption

165
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,020
across our core S3 buckets.

166
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,520
I'm also getting high I/O alerts

167
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,380
from the primary RDS instance now too.

168
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,330
I mean, the customer facing websites,

169
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,770
they're throwing 503 errors.

170
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,810
I mean, this feels coordinated

171
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,450
and it is moving incredibly fast.

172
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,480
- Define coordinated. What
do you see in CloudTrail?

173
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,750
Is it one IAM role being used? Multiple?

174
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,490
Is activity coming from a known IP range

175
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,430
or something external?
- CloudTrail is flooded.

176
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,570
It looks like thousands

177
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,060
of unauthorized SSEC
encryption calls originating

178
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,310
from within our own VPC.

179
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,840
I mean, they aren't
trying to pull data out.

180
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,030
They're encrypting everything in place.

181
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,560
GuardDuty is lighting up with alerts

182
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,010
for unusual activity from
a single EC2 instance,

183
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,180
a QA server I've never even
seen trigger an alert before.

184
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,570
This is bad. They're inside.

185
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,050
- Start a log dump to a
secure, isolated account now,

186
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,700
before they can purge them.

187
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,830
Use the out-of-band management network,

188
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,300
get the CIO on the line,

189
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,940
and initiate a major
incident management call

190
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,770
for the entire crisis team.

191
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,103
I'm on my way in.
(dramatic music)

192
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,140
- [Narrator 1] By 6:30
AM the first members

193
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,223
of the crisis team are online.
(dramatic music)

194
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,740
- Give me the situation report,

195
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,480
and blast radius is not an answer.

196
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,717
I need application names,
business units impacted,

197
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:22,110
and a preliminary assessment
of potential data loss.

198
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,150
- It's a sophisticated ransomware attack

199
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,720
and it appears to be centered
on our US East 1 region.

200
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,840
We've confirmed active
encryption on the EC2 instances

201
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,430
hosting the web front end,

202
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,830
the S3 buckets that hold
all our process data

203
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,510
for BI and analytics,

204
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,520
as well as the primary RDS database

205
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,280
that manages inventory and logistics.

206
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,860
We've also found a ransom
note in the root directory

207
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,750
of a dozen servers.

208
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,130
- Let me be clear about what that means.

209
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,290
If that RDS instance is compromised,

210
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,750
the stores are operating completely blind.

211
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,300
The handheld scanners in our
warehouses that associates use

212
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,760
for picking orders are effectively bricks.

213
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,380
The system that optimizes truck routes

214
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,970
for daily restocking is offline.

215
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,020
The point of sale systems

216
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,730
can't even validate gift card balances

217
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,890
or process returns correctly,

218
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,670
from in-store staffing to
deliveries and inventory intake.

219
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,860
We have to assume every
single digital service

220
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,080
that touches a physical
store is either down

221
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,910
or about to go down.

222
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,490
- Yeah, this isn't just a website outage.

223
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,130
This is a direct decapitating strike

224
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,160
against our core retail operations.

225
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,740
I mean, the east coast
stores are scheduled to open

226
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,243
in less than 90 minutes.

227
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,990
I'm activating the full
incident response plan,

228
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,850
get the entire crisis team assembled.

229
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,060
I need the CISO and the
general counsel on a call

230
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,250
in the next 15 minutes.

231
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,040
We need to decide if we
even open the stores.

232
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,850
- Just to reiterate, we can't
just reboot the servers.

233
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,700
This isn't a hardware
failure or simple outage.

234
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,090
This is a hostile takeover
of our environment.

235
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,790
Every move we make has to be deliberate

236
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,490
or we could accelerate the damage.

237
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,073
- All right. Very dramatic.

238
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,550
And we have a star in our midst,

239
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,440
our applications board
manager is right here,

240
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,790
who has now changed roles.

241
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,040
He's now operations
analyst of Horizon Retail.

242
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,633
So, yeah, he's got a new job.

243
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,440
So I guess the first takeaway here, right?

244
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,047
Modern attacks begin as
a whisper, not a bang,

245
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:20,790
"a chorus of discordant
data points," right?

246
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,653
That was was mentioned in this scene.

247
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,420
You know, cloud attacks are complex.

248
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,790
It usually involves multiple services.

249
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,700
It requires specialization,
a troubleshoot.

250
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,160
You've got EBS latency at play here.

251
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,440
You've got S3 API calls at play here.

252
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,960
You've got GuardDuty that's lighting up.

253
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,830
It requires specialization
and coordination,

254
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,270
and most importantly, it
requires visibility, right?

255
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,450
Visibility into how all of
these services inter-operate

256
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,090
with each other within your environment

257
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,610
so that when you do have to,

258
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,553
you know, troubleshoot
and ultimately recover,

259
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,423
that you're doing so in
a way that is measured.

260
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,100
The second thing, cloud
attacks, and this was again,

261
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,267
very dramatically said in that scene,

262
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:17,220
"Direct decapitating strike
on our retail operations."

263
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,560
They are business attacks, right?

264
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,450
Your business runs in the cloud.

265
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,280
An attack on a core data service,

266
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,700
like a database or object storage,

267
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,540
it can paralyze everything,
everything in your environment.

268
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,890
And most organizations haven't
mapped the dependencies

269
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,490
between their critical
business functions, right?

270
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,190
Taking a true inventory of what you have

271
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,300
in your environment,

272
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
ensuring that it's all mapped in a CMDB.

273
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,300
How many folks have a CMDB that they feel

274
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,890
is up to date and is
accurate, 100% accurate?

275
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,993
I see one hand in the front here.

276
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,540
I see another one as well. That's cool.

277
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,200
I'm glad that you guys have
that confidence, right?

278
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,270
That's really, really important to ensure

279
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,090
that you have an accurate
inventory of what you have.

280
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,640
If you don't, it ultimately
leaves you flying blind

281
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,230
when some of these services go down

282
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,303
and when that business impact happens.

283
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,050
The last thing, when ransomware strikes,

284
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,600
it strikes at machine speed.

285
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,613
It will encrypt very quickly.

286
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,760
The Codefinger attack from
the beginning of the year,

287
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,940
who remembers the Codefinger
attack from January?

288
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,783
Has anybody heard of it? One
in the front, maybe a couple.

289
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,890
It was essentially
encryption at rest of S3.

290
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,570
It was using customer managed keys, SSEC.

291
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:44,570
As a matter of fact, AWS
will be deprecating SSEC

292
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,770
for S3 in April

293
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,890
as a result of the fact that
there was these vulnerabilities

294
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,283
that were causing impact in
their customers' environments.

295
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,820
And that once the
attacker gains a foothold

296
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,440
into the cloud environment,

297
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,530
they use the same services that you use

298
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,100
to maliciously impact your data, right?

299
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,900
It can encrypt hundreds of
thousands of objects in minutes,

300
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,510
and even if you have versions,

301
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,820
it's not necessarily gonna help you here,

302
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,670
because those versions are
gonna get encrypted as well.

303
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,503
Right?

304
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,950
If you turn on immutability,
that's an option, right?

305
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,450
You can turn on immutable versions

306
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,860
and you can have immutable versions.

307
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,720
That's gonna cost you, right?

308
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,420
So it becomes a cost risk play

309
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,280
and something that you're
gonna have to determine

310
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,480
in your organization.

311
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,070
How secure do you wanna be in the impact,

312
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,290
in case there is an impact?

313
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,650
And again, versions are most
likely gonna save your bacon

314
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,600
when it comes to operational recovery,

315
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,610
not necessarily from a
cyber recovery event.

316
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,500
And we're gonna talk about the differences

317
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,297
between operational recovery

318
00:14:54,297 --> 00:14:56,343
and cyber recovery in a future scene.

319
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,733
So let's hop over to scene two,

320
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,323
and we're gonna start
with the read through.

321
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,330
The time is 8:00 AM Eastern.

322
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,930
I play the narrator, by the way.

323
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,220
I do have one. I'm the narrator.

324
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,510
The time is 8:00 AM Eastern.

325
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,610
The first stores on the
east coast are attempting

326
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,100
to open their doors amidst chaos.

327
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,580
The full crisis team, including
the CISO, general counsel,

328
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,260
and the line of business leader,

329
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,290
are now assembled on
the emergency MIM call.

330
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,390
The atmosphere is thick with tension

331
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,920
as the team tries to understand

332
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,783
the full scope of the attack.

333
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,720
- [Employee 1] Our forensics
analysis of the logs

334
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,730
have given us a much clearer picture.

335
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,910
The initial point of entry
seems to be social engineering.

336
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,400
They called the help desk
and somehow got credentials

337
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,083
for a standard employee account.

338
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,110
- [CISO] A standard account?

339
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,700
How did they escalate from there?

340
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,550
Our internal segmentation
should have contained that.

341
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,920
- [Employee 1] It should
have, but from that account,

342
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,940
they scanned our network

343
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,790
and found a single unpatched QA server.

344
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,410
They exploited that to get access

345
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,560
to a misconfigured IAM role
attached to the instance.

346
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,563
This is a piece of technical
debt that we never cleaned up.

347
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,250
- [CISO] And that misconfigured role,

348
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,650
what did it allow them to access?

349
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,640
- [Employee 1] Enough to compromise

350
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,290
one of our cloud admin accounts.

351
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,110
And with that, they took
over the identity provider.

352
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,000
It was a chain reaction of human error,

353
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,340
followed by technical oversights.

354
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,410
Once they controlled
the identity provider,

355
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,580
they could move anywhere.

356
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,460
They basically had the
keys to the kingdom.

357
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,040
- [Employee 2] So with
the control of our SSOs,

358
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,270
they could get to the retail
ETL role, the RDS databases.

359
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,350
- [Employee 3] They did.

360
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,740
That role gave them complete
control over the RDS databases.

361
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,430
They also deployed scripts using
SSEC server side encryption

362
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,000
with their own keys across
our most critical S3 buckets.

363
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,040
It's a nightmare scenario
because it makes recovery

364
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,410
from versions or replicas impossible.

365
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,600
The forensics also show
they were in our environment

366
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,930
for weeks, exfiltrating data
low and slow the whole time.

367
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,723
They didn't just lock our
data, they took a copy first.

368
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:03,060
- [Line Of Business Leader]
I just got off the phone

369
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,970
with our regional manager
for the northeast.

370
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,290
Customers are abandoning full
shopping carts at the register

371
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,090
because the manual checkout process

372
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,150
is taking over 20 minutes per person.

373
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,280
The media has picked up on it.

374
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,330
We have local news vans outside
two of our flagship stores.

375
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,020
Our store managers are asking
for permission to close.

376
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,410
The damage to our brand
is happening in real time

377
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,120
on live television.

378
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,400
Based on our hourly revenue rates,

379
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,880
we are losing hundreds of
thousands of dollars an hour.

380
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,043
This is an absolute catastrophe.

381
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,790
- [Narrator 2] The time
is now 11:00 AM Eastern.

382
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,553
The situation continues to deteriorate.

383
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,020
- [CISO] We have an update.

384
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,140
Our external security
consultant is now engaged.

385
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,630
Based on the attack tactics and techniques

386
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,610
as well as the specific ransom note,

387
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,670
our external consultants
believe with high confidence

388
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,490
that this is the work of Scattered Spider.

389
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,600
- [Employee 4] And I can confirm

390
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,790
that after consulting with the FBI,

391
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,800
we have established
contact with this group

392
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,810
through channels they provided.

393
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,860
The demand is $4 million,
payable in Bitcoin.

394
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,083
The deadline is three days from now.

395
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,390
- [Employee 2] We are not paying.

396
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,970
This is what our disaster
recovery plan is for.

397
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,920
This is why we have backups.

398
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,460
Head of cloud operations,
reports on our recovery posture.

399
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,940
The EC2 instances are
recoverable from AWS Backup.

400
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,800
What about the S3 data?

401
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,480
- [Head Of Cloud] Well, that's
the core of the problem.

402
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,840
While we do have backups for
a portion of our S3 data,

403
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,100
for a critical share,

404
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,600
we've just been relying on versioning

405
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,730
and cross-region replication.

406
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,100
As you can imagine,
versioning's not a backup.

407
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,930
And it specifically does not protect

408
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,700
against this attack vector.

409
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,040
Since the attacker used
server side encryption

410
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,410
to re-encrypt every
version of every object

411
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,850
with their own key,

412
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,540
the objects are there, but
they're indecipherable to us.

413
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,640
The replicas in the other
region are just copies

414
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,950
of the same useless encrypted objects.

415
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,420
- [Employee 2] This is unacceptable.

416
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,920
Who signed off on a policy

417
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,040
that left our new stores
data so vulnerable?

418
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,420
- [Head Of Cloud] It was a decision made

419
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,670
during last year's
capital allocation review

420
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,030
to reduce cloud storage
costs across the board.

421
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,430
The risk was documented
and formally accepted

422
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,290
with the understanding that versioning

423
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,690
would mitigate the accidental deletion.

424
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,023
Nobody anticipated an attack
of this sophistication.

425
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,380
- [Employee 2] How much
data are we talking about?

426
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,900
How bad is the S3 data loss?

427
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,450
- [Head Of Cloud] It's a severe loss.

428
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,080
All operational data,
POS, and sensor logs,

429
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,200
all our BI data sets for
our entire fleet of stores

430
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,300
opened in the last fiscal year.

431
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,980
A full year of our company's growth

432
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,110
has been effectively wiped out.

433
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,263
It's almost like the stores
have never been in operation.

434
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,440
- [Narrator 2] The main call ends.

435
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,200
The operations analyst leans over

436
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,187
to the head of cloud operations.

437
00:19:57,187 --> 00:20:00,060
- [Operations Analyst] My
team filed seven tickets

438
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,730
over the last year about
inconsistent backup validation

439
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,980
and coverage gaps in
our cloud environment.

440
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,870
They were all deprioritized in favor

441
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,610
of new feature development.

442
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,530
- [Head Of Cloud] Those
tickets, document them

443
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,793
and keep the files ready.

444
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:15,142
- All right, great job,
everybody. Thank you.

445
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,180
Yeah, little CYA being played there

446
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,373
on the Horizon Retail part, right?

447
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:24,397
"I filed those tickets."

448
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:27,810
"Those tickets, document
them, keep them ready." Right?

449
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,897
How many times have you as
an organization deprioritized

450
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,260
quality of life and security
for new features, right?

451
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,270
It happens all the time.

452
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,543
It happens across our
customer base all the time.

453
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,990
So let's talk a little
bit about the attacks

454
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,910
and how they got in, right?

455
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,100
It was a human and process failure

456
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,630
in this particular instance.

457
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,420
And one of the things that

458
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,590
is fairly unrealistic about this scenario,

459
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,540
you guys probably, some of you,

460
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,060
if you've been through a
tabletop exercise before,

461
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,800
have already caught on to this.

462
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,710
It was fairly unrealistic that Horizon has

463
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,860
that much of the attack chain understood

464
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,053
in scene two, right?

465
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,630
That usually takes weeks.
It could take months.

466
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,630
Sometimes there's never
root cause analysis

467
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,280
of how the attackers got in,

468
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,020
of how they infiltrated the environment,

469
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,170
and ultimately, the
scope of impact, right?

470
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,560
So because we have to
keep these to an hour,

471
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,060
we accelerated things a little bit,

472
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,490
and Horizon Retail in scene
two, bam, they got it.

473
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,500
So what happened? How did they get in?

474
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,150
Unpatched QA server.
Okay, that could happen.

475
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:44,150
Misconfigured IAM role, an
overly permissive identity.

476
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,193
How many of those do you have
in your environment, right?

477
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,783
SentinelOne in their cloud
security risk report,

478
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,590
our friends on the perimeter
side, SentinelOne, CrowdStrike,

479
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,570
I'm gonna reference a
lot of their stats here

480
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,120
as we go through this, IBM.

481
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,140
We use a lot of their stats on

482
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,750
trying to understand the
cloud security landscape.

483
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,700
They basically say

484
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,920
that almost all cloud environment failures

485
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,010
can be attributed to
some form of human error.

486
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,530
In this particular instance,

487
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,890
it was a socially engineered credential

488
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,420
that they got ahold of.

489
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,300
Once they got ahold of that
socially engineered credential,

490
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,700
they found the retail ETL role,

491
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,330
which was essentially an
overly permissive identity

492
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,730
that gave them cross-account access.

493
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,130
Once they had cross-account access,

494
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,990
read/write cross-account access,

495
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,420
they had the keys to the kingdom, right?

496
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,310
CrowdStrike, in their report,

497
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,560
that abuse of valid accounts

498
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,910
is the primary initial access
vector for cloud breaches.

499
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:52,910
It's about 35% of all
cloud incidents come from

500
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,080
abuse of valid accounts.

501
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,640
Attackers are not hacking in,

502
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,133
they're logging into your environment.

503
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,300
They are compromising credentials
and they're logging in.

504
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,750
Maybe they're finding
AWS keys that got leaked.

505
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,860
Maybe they're socially engineering

506
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,920
some identity within the environment,

507
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,630
but they're logging in,
they're not hacking in.

508
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,030
And as a matter of fact, they
look like an authenticated,

509
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,223
a valid user on your network.

510
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,630
Bottom line is, if you had to count

511
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,000
how many times you
found a misconfiguration

512
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,373
or forgotten server or some shadow IT

513
00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:35,250
that was sitting out in
your cloud environment,

514
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,850
you're basically playing a
bad game of whack-a-mole.

515
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,740
Because you're gonna find
those things all the time.

516
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,650
You're gonna tamp 'em down.
You'll probably find them again.

517
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,810
80%, according to SentinelOne,

518
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,460
of data breaches can be attributed

519
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,743
to some sort of misconfiguration.

520
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,103
Second, operational recovery.
Versioning, it's not a backup.

521
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,300
Versioning is not gonna save your bacon.

522
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,940
If you had to recover
hundreds of thousands

523
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,490
of objects from versions

524
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,550
and you didn't know the point
of time you had to go back to,

525
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,550
how would you do it?

526
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,480
You gonna write a script to do it?

527
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,660
I'd like to meet the person
who writes that script.

528
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,630
It's fine for operational recovery.

529
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,027
It's fine when your data

530
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:28,680
and your identity are still
in a trusted zone, right?

531
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,320
But in a cyber recovery scenario,

532
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,010
your data and identity
are inherently mistrusted.

533
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,510
So because of that,

534
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,030
you wouldn't know what
to recover from, right?

535
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,340
How would you potentially
recover hundreds of thousands

536
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,903
of objects from versions?

537
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:48,183
The third, today's breach
was yesterday's budget cut.

538
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,083
Right?

539
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:54,030
How many times in our careers
have we been faced with

540
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,330
hardening efforts or
quality of life things

541
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,290
being deprioritized for
new feature development?

542
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,880
It happens all the time.

543
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,520
And that's as much a management failure

544
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,040
as it is the support person's credentials

545
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,810
that got pilfered, right?

546
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,270
Everybody's gonna blame
it on the support person.

547
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,490
But ultimately, it was
a management failure

548
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:19,490
at the very beginning to
deprioritize this hardening

549
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,663
over new future development.

550
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,330
So again, two critical things
brought into focus here.

551
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,300
The first, prevention alone isn't enough.

552
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,680
The attacks started with human error,

553
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,690
exploited the chain of vulnerabilities.

554
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,300
Those vulnerabilities
could exist anywhere.

555
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,470
Second, if we adopt an
assumed breach mindset,

556
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:44,820
the ability to recover
is everything, right?

557
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,440
If you assume that at some point

558
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,640
you're going to get breached,

559
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,540
you need the ability to get that back.

560
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,230
In this instance, their recovery plan

561
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,900
was based on a flawed assumption that,

562
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,760
based on operational recovery, right?

563
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,460
And not based on cyber
recovery techniques.

564
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,510
All right, let's hop over to scene three.

565
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,030
The time is 9:00 PM on Sunday evening.

566
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,550
The teams in the IT Operations
Center have been working

567
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,190
for 15 hours straight.

568
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,380
The initial shock of
the attack is worn off,

569
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,320
replaced by a grim, bone-deep exhaustion.

570
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,970
The mood in the room is
heavy with the weight

571
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,710
of finding a path to recovery,

572
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,890
as every attempt so far
has ended in failure.

573
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,750
- [Employee 5] I've mounted
the 10th EBS snapshot

574
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,280
from our backup vaults.

575
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,560
I'm running a deep
forensics scan on it now,

576
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,230
but it takes nearly an
hour to scan each terabyte.

577
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,450
At this rate, it will take us days

578
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,620
just to validate the backups

579
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,690
for a single critical application.

580
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,890
We're looking for a clean needle

581
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,590
in a mountain of infected haystacks.

582
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,380
- [Employee 6] I know it's
slow, but we have to be certain.

583
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,660
They were in our environment
for more than a month.

584
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,570
They knew our backup retention
policies better than we did.

585
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,490
They waited until their
malware was replicated

586
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,860
across all of their recent restore points

587
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,570
before they launched the main attack.

588
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,130
We're not just defining encryption,

589
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,480
we're fighting their 30
days of reconnaissance.

590
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,080
- [Employee 7] And this
is a completely manual

591
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,610
hit or miss process.

592
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,410
Our backup tools have served us well

593
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,210
for operational recoveries,

594
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,920
but I'm only realizing now

595
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,570
that they're greatly lacking in dealing

596
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,820
with such sophisticated attacks.

597
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,290
They were never designed to withstand

598
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,110
a direct malicious assault by an attacker

599
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,820
with admin credentials.

600
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,520
And they can't even tell
us which backups are safe.

601
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,890
- [Employee 5] Wait, I
think I have something.

602
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,930
An EC2 snapshot from two weeks ago

603
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,930
just before we believe the
main malware was planted.

604
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,480
The initial scans, they look clean.

605
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,850
The rootkit signatures aren't there.

606
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,990
- [Employee 6] It's a risk,

607
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,540
but it could contain
a time delayed payload

608
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,040
that our scanners are missing.

609
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,780
But it's the best lead we've had all day.

610
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,580
- [Employee 8] It's the only
shot we have. Let's do it.

611
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,740
Kick off the restoration
process into a new,

612
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,630
completely isolated VPC.

613
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,160
What's the ETA?

614
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,900
- [Employee 5] If we push it
and if everything goes right,

615
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,190
we can have a test environment

616
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,203
of our core application up by midnight.

617
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,210
- [Narrator 2] The time is
now 1:00 AM on Monday morning.

618
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,130
For the first time in nearly 24 hours,

619
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,140
there's a flicker of hope in the room.

620
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,870
On a monitor, the core
application is initializing

621
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,073
in a clean environment.

622
00:28:10,838 --> 00:28:11,820
- [App Support Manager] We are online.

623
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,970
The app service is up and
the database is connected.

624
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,440
We are running the first test
transaction now. It worked!

625
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,960
For about five seconds it
worked. (indistinct) sharing.

626
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,210
Wait, wait, wait, no.
The dashboard just died.

627
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,370
CP utilization inspected hundred percent

628
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,870
and the file system...

629
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,010
I can see it happening.

630
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,440
The files are being
re-encrypted right now.

631
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,820
- [Employee 7] How's this possible?

632
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,460
We scanned that snapshot. It was clean.

633
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,380
- [Employee 6] The malware
must've been dormant.

634
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,450
It was waiting for a specific event,

635
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,870
a connection to a database,
a specific API call.

636
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,270
It was a time bomb, and
we just triggered it.

637
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,583
Shut it down now, terminate
the instances now.

638
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,980
- [Narrator 2] The time is 2:00 AM.

639
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,010
The brief moment of hope has
been utterly extinguished.

640
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,150
On the video conference,

641
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,180
the faces of the CFO and
the general counsel appear.

642
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,843
They look grim. The CIO has
to deliver the bad news.

643
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,100
- [CFO] I'll get straight to the point.

644
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,770
The financial consequences are severe.

645
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,090
Our financial modeling for Sunday

646
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,760
shows a loss of over a million dollars.

647
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,970
Our stock is projected
to open at least 8% down.

648
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,640
That's half a billion
dollars in market cap.

649
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,770
Are you now telling us
that our only viable backup

650
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,670
has just failed and we're
essentially back to square one?

651
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,023
Time is of the essence.

652
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,460
- [Employee 2] It was
a significant setback.

653
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,090
The attack is more complex
than we anticipated.

654
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,740
The team is now working to analyze

655
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,483
much older restore points.

656
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,510
- [CFO] I appreciate that
we're all understandably tired

657
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,480
and that your team is
working incredibly hard.

658
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,880
While I value your technical explanation,

659
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,190
my primary concern is that the company

660
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,680
seems to be in a financial free fall,

661
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,470
and that's worsening every hour.

662
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,710
To put it bluntly, what is the plan here?

663
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,450
- [Employee 4] While you formulate one,

664
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:06,570
I must inform you that we
have received another email

665
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,070
from the attackers.

666
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,080
They have seen our
failed recovery attempt.

667
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,423
They're raising their
ransom to $6 million.

668
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,470
They feel they have the upper
hand, and legally, they might.

669
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,620
The story is now being picked
up by national news outlets.

670
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,713
We are losing control of the narrative.

671
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:29,823
- Yeah, tough spot. It keeps
getting tougher for Horizon.

672
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,340
So the primary objective of the attackers

673
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,300
first is to go after your backups, right?

674
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,530
If they can go after your backups,

675
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,180
then they can infiltrate your backups

676
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,740
or poison your backups,

677
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,860
you have no recovery and
their chances of getting paid

678
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,223
just incrementally went
up significantly, right?

679
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,100
They use that long dwell time,

680
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,960
the time that they're doing reconnaissance

681
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,920
in your environment,

682
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,830
to study your recovery policies

683
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,330
and to ensure that the malware is planted

684
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,060
and across any of the
restore points that you have.

685
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,420
And, you know, ultimately our own research

686
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,680
has found that 93% of organizations

687
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,270
reported malicious attackers

688
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,510
attempting to impact data
backups during a cyber attack.

689
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,150
It happens in every
cyber attack, basically,

690
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,860
that they're looking for the backups

691
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,730
and to poison those
backups so that, you know,

692
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,280
obviously you have no recovery.

693
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,910
But that clean backup, if
you really don't find clean,

694
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,090
that clean backup could be
your ticking time bomb, right?

695
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,690
In this particular instance,

696
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,480
there's one thing that
Horizon Retail did right here.

697
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,280
First thing is that they

698
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,390
had it recovered in an isolated VPC.

699
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:45,420
So they had an isolated
account in a separate VPC

700
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,970
where they instantiated
these backups, right?

701
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,200
And that is important.

702
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,580
Everybody in this room

703
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,610
should have an isolated
recovery environment

704
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,830
or accounts that they recover from

705
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,793
that should be separate from
your primary identity domain.

706
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,250
I can't stress that enough.

707
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,570
Credential isolation is
really, really important

708
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,533
in the cloud.

709
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,890
But just because you have that backup,

710
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:13,500
it doesn't mean that it's clean.

711
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,860
You know, the reconnaissance,
the lateral movement,

712
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,310
they all can involve planting malware

713
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,730
and delayed detonation techniques

714
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,950
that ultimately the attackers used here.

715
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,637
And that was the

716
00:32:27,637 --> 00:32:31,140
"needle in the mountain of
infected haystacks" problem

717
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,963
that was articulated in this scene.

718
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,820
One of the things I
think that this brings up

719
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,127
is the stark difference
between an operational recovery

720
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:42,240
and a cyber recovery,

721
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,090
and I already mentioned
this a little earlier.

722
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,320
In operational recovery,

723
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,720
your data and your identity are trusted.

724
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,990
You just need to go back and
rewind to a point in time.

725
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,460
It's easy.

726
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,910
Cyber recovery, you're dealing
with inherently mistrusted

727
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,590
data and identities.

728
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,450
You need to ensure that everything

729
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,820
that you bring back into
the environment is clean.

730
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,053
Forensic work needs to
happen against all of it.

731
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:13,500
And really, if you're not
ensuring that your recovery

732
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,260
and that the data that you're recovering

733
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,550
into these environments is clean,

734
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,460
your recovery plan turns
into a lottery ticket

735
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,873
and that's just not gonna
be acceptable, right?

736
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,840
Those repeated recoveries
into an IRE, right,

737
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,860
let's talk about that.

738
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,890
They went in a separate VPC,

739
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,300
which was the right thing to do,

740
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,890
started a recovery that
turned out to be bad.

741
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,230
Those repeated recoveries into an IRE

742
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,510
and the forensic work that
has to happen after the fact

743
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,253
takes time and time is money.

744
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,460
And your systems are down
and the CFO is screaming

745
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,490
that the stock just lost 8% yesterday

746
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,540
and you're under pressure.

747
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,740
You have that time pressure
in this scenario, right?

748
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,023
Time pressure is going
to be a factor here.

749
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,250
So what are the really
two key takeaways here?

750
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,310
Cyber recovery, different than
operational recovery, right?

751
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,503
I think we can kinda all agree on that.

752
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,190
The second thing I think
we kinda learned here

753
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,460
is that traditional
tools tend to fall down

754
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,650
in a cyber recovery scenario.

755
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:30,600
They were built to protect
against operational issues

756
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,600
and not protect you against
a malicious adversary

757
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,230
who is authenticated into your
environment as a valid user.

758
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,943
They're acting as a valid user.

759
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,230
So really have to know
which ones are compromised,

760
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,300
which ones aren't, before
you start the recovery.

761
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,090
And doing that ideally
against the backup chain

762
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:55,740
is what's gonna save you time.

763
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:59,940
Hence why one of the announcements at AWS,

764
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,320
at re:Invent this year,

765
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,170
was GuardDuty integration with AWS Backup.

766
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,170
Right? May have heard it.
This is because of this.

767
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,223
All right, let's move on to scene four.

768
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,140
It is now Tuesday afternoon,

769
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,510
more than 48 hours since the attack began.

770
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,930
The company stocks
plummeted by more than 10%.

771
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:29,490
The recovery efforts have been
a brutal demoralizing slog.

772
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,460
The team now knows the attackers
were inside their systems

773
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,260
for at least 36 days.

774
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,790
The cyber incident response manager

775
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,980
has called a critical meeting
with the IT and legal teams

776
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,230
to address the scariest question of all,

777
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,780
what exactly did the attackers take?

778
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,430
- [Employee 6] We need to
get to the ground truth

779
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,050
of our data exposure.

780
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,530
The integrity of our S3
inventory is now in question,

781
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,410
especially considering the lost data.

782
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,960
The legal team needs an accurate inventory

783
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,880
of the compromised S3 data,

784
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,420
specifically what type of
data was in those buckets.

785
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,910
We must know if we're
dealing with a data breach.

786
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,990
- [Employee 9] I've
been running a deep scan

787
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,370
of our S3 environment,

788
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,070
trying to reconcile our
inventory with reality.

789
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,300
I'm running a Regex search

790
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,870
for PII patterns across bucket
manifests and object names.

791
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,250
The problem is, many of these buckets

792
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,340
don't have data classification
tags, so I'm flying blind.

793
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,930
- [Employee 10] What are you seeing?

794
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,160
- [Employee 9] I'm seeing files named

795
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,250
Q3rewardsmembersfulldump.csv

796
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:27,390
and loyaltytestdataprodsample.json.

797
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,670
The file names themselves
are screaming PII.

798
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,370
And worse, our S3 inventory is a mess.

799
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,973
It shows 920 S3 buckets in
our production environment.

800
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,560
My deep scan has found 965.

801
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,200
There are 45 buckets that
are completely untracked,

802
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,780
unmonitored, and unbacked up.

803
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,880
- [Narrator 2] The group
reconvenes late Tuesday night

804
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,450
with the general counsel and
the CIO also on the call.

805
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,310
The mood is grave.

806
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,560
- [Employee 11] Yeah,
those untracked buckets,

807
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,180
they appear to have been spun up

808
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,890
for the customer loyalty program

809
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,440
that was in development last quarter.

810
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,020
- [Employee 4] The
customer loyalty program?

811
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,700
You managed that project.

812
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,943
What was the data schema for
those development buckets?

813
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:14,430
- [App Support Manager] It
was a development environment.

814
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,500
It shouldn't have had production data,

815
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,260
but to properly test the
new predictive models,

816
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,450
the development team may,

817
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,680
they may have pulled a sample

818
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,840
from the production customer database.

819
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,280
- [Employee 5] I can confirm they did.

820
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,720
I've decrypted a single file

821
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,570
from the proof of life
sample the attacker sent us.

822
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:34,260
It's a CSV file from one
of those untracked buckets.

823
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,100
It contains over 1 million
records with full names,

824
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,250
email addresses, mailing
addresses, and birth dates.

825
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,970
This is all personally
identifiable information.

826
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,773
This is officially a data breach.

827
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,620
- [Employee 4] I need to
pause everyone for a moment.

828
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:57,240
This discovery is fundamentally
changing our legal position.

829
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,040
The moment PII was confirmed,

830
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,380
we moved from a business continuity crisis

831
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,470
to a major regulatory and legal event.

832
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,210
We likely have 72 hours

833
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,140
to notify the California
Attorney General under CCPA.

834
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,290
We have other notification
deadlines in every other state

835
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,510
and country which we operate.

836
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,610
We need to retain outside counsel

837
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,700
specializing in breach
notification tonight.

838
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,430
We need to establish a
budget for credit monitoring

839
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,040
for every customer in that database.

840
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,720
The cost of this incident just grew

841
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,270
by an order of magnitude,

842
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,480
and that is just before
class action lawsuits begin.

843
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,573
Does everyone understand the
gravity of this situation?

844
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,630
- [Employee 12] Yes.

845
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,464
- [Employee 6] We understand. (laughs)

846
00:38:41,464 --> 00:38:45,507
(audience laughing)
- "Yes."

847
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:52,140
A few takeaways here. You can't
protect what you can't see.

848
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,910
Shadow IT is real, right?

849
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,640
Thank you guys for this. I appreciate it.

850
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,537
We'll give 'em a round
of applause at the end.

851
00:38:58,537 --> 00:39:01,260
(audience applauds)
Oh, thank you. Thanks. Thanks.

852
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,220
It's hard to get up here

853
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,690
and talk in front of this many people.

854
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,150
Thank you, guys. We appreciate that.

855
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:10,890
Can't protect what you can't
see. Shadow IT is real.

856
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:15,870
965 buckets. 920 in the manifest.

857
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,630
45 buckets untracked, unaccounted for.

858
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:22,560
Turns out one of those
buckets had dumps from

859
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,170
production databases
that weren't obfuscated,

860
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,613
that weren't masked,

861
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,330
because the development
team needed production data

862
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,740
in order to develop an application.

863
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,763
That happens all the time.
Deal with it all the time.

864
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:39,510
And it's endemic in large cloud estates.

865
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,730
Our friends over at IBM in their 2024

866
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,960
cost of data breach report,

867
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,390
which by the way, there
is 2025 report out.

868
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,070
I would ask you to read it.

869
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,600
These data breach reports

870
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:53,070
and state of data security reports that

871
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:56,490
our friends on the perimeter release

872
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,980
are most definitely worth a read.

873
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,540
If you don't read them,

874
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,860
they are most definitely worth a read.

875
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,640
35% of breaches involve shadow data,

876
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,640
untracked data residing
in unmanaged data sources.

877
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,510
And those breaches have a
16% greater cost on average.

878
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,340
Right? So the stats prove it out.

879
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,450
Untracked data is real

880
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,700
and it costs more when it gets breached.

881
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,610
Second, production data
and development environment

882
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,450
is an absolute disaster, right?

883
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:30,600
I understand and I think we all understand

884
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,670
that our development
teams need production data

885
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,470
to develop their applications,

886
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:38,613
but that data has to be
properly obfuscated and masked.

887
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,050
And that's a really difficult
thing to do. It just is.

888
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,480
To keep the data integrity intact,

889
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,373
that's a very difficult thing to do.

890
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,320
The third thing I think
we learned here is that

891
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,710
when a data breach is in
play, when PII is in play,

892
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,383
it changes everything about an attack.

893
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,920
It turns it from a short term catastrophe

894
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,440
that I need to get my
systems back up and running

895
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,377
into long tail costs that
exceed this event by months.

896
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,140
Most of the cost in a cyber attack

897
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,520
are associated with the long tail costs

898
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,660
if a data breach is involved,

899
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,110
and those long tail costs
include brand damage,

900
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:25,230
customer loyalty being impacted,

901
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:28,860
regulatory fines,

902
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,860
class action lawsuits,
LifeLock subscriptions.

903
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,130
How many of you folks have
gotten a data breach letter

904
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,783
that says, yeah, right.

905
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:42,270
That says, "Oh, we give you
a free year of LifeLock."

906
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,190
Unfortunately, they don't stack them.

907
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,630
I've got a stack of them at home.

908
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,820
They don't stack the
LifeLock subscriptions.

909
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,580
If so, I would probably
have a LifeLock subscription

910
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,350
until I die.

911
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,653
That's how many of those
I've gotten. Right?

912
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:00,300
So to recap this scene, PII,

913
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,550
that's what the attackers
are after, right?

914
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,880
Primary objective, find and
exfiltrate sensitive data.

915
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,100
I can monetize that regardless

916
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,143
of whether you decide to pay me or not.

917
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,380
They may give you their word

918
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,050
that they're not going to release it,

919
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,080
but are we gonna take an
attacker's word for it, right?

920
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,970
Data sprawl's real. That
problem of shadow data is real.

921
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,380
And when you combine that

922
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,460
with the increasing regulatory burden

923
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,040
and financial penalties that
are associated with that,

924
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,743
it leads to massive long tail costs.

925
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:41,310
And ultimately, IT tools need the ability

926
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:45,780
to proactively reduce the risk
of sensitive data exposure

927
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,350
through automated discovery
and classification, right?

928
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,630
You should be doing automated
discovery and classification

929
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,430
across your environment.

930
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,500
If you're only doing it in S3,

931
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,270
you're not covering your whole estate.

932
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:00,170
I understand most of your data
estate probably sits in S3.

933
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:02,850
If a breach happens,

934
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:06,300
those teams need to be
able to quickly respond

935
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,500
and understand the data that was impacted.

936
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,680
There are breach reporting requirements.

937
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,810
In California, that's 72 hours.

938
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:20,580
That was modeled after GDPR,
which is an EU standard.

939
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,970
The EU has a standard across the board

940
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:27,990
for reporting after a data breach.

941
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:30,690
California created their
own data privacy law.

942
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:33,270
There are data privacy laws on the books

943
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,553
in most of the states in this country.

944
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,943
Which means that if
there is a data breach,

945
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:44,130
you have to find counsel that
specializes in reporting that

946
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,680
to the state's attorney general

947
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,360
across all of the states

948
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,613
in which your organizations do business.

949
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:55,560
And if you're talking about Europe,

950
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,790
if you do business overseas,

951
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,500
if you're a global organization,

952
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,990
you are beholden to their
regulations as well.

953
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:05,550
Those regulations have
teeth, significant teeth.

954
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:10,293
GDPR I think is 2%. Maximum
fine, 2% of overall revenue.

955
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,750
It's massive. Right?

956
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:19,620
So again, PII changes
the entire landscape.

957
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,450
All right, let's move on to
scene five. It's a video and...

958
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,190
- [Narrator 1] It has been three days.

959
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:32,550
Three days of failed
recoveries, mounting losses,

960
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,350
and public humiliation.

961
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,510
The company's leadership is now assembled

962
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,273
for a final agonizing decision.

963
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,830
- So a full clean rebuild
of our environment

964
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,610
from the ground up will
take at least three weeks.

965
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:51,540
Given the sophistication of
the malware in our backups,

966
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,660
that is the most realistic estimate.

967
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,170
- Direct revenue loss currently
stands at 3.4 million.

968
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,000
Our projections show that
we'll continue to lose

969
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,370
nearly a million dollars
for each additional day

970
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:03,870
of significant outage.

971
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,450
We're hemorrhaging money by the day.

972
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,970
- I must advise in the
strongest possible terms

973
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,290
not to pay these criminals.

974
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,670
It's rewarding their actions

975
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,590
and funding their next
attack on another company.

976
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,900
We get a decryption key
that might not even work

977
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,100
for data that we're gonna have to scrub

978
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,420
and validate for weeks,

979
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,310
this doesn't get us any of our data back

980
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:21,990
and it absolutely doesn't
remove the attackers

981
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,250
from our environment.

982
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,720
It paints a giant target on our back

983
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,030
for every ransomware group on the planet.

984
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,260
We have to rebuild.

985
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,115
It's the only way to be sure we're clean.

986
00:45:30,115 --> 00:45:32,970
(tense music)

987
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,620
- Rebuilding is a fantasy of control

988
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,810
that we can no longer afford.

989
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,430
Your clean rebuild will take a month,

990
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,370
and in a month there won't be
any company left to secure.

991
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,470
We will have lost massive
shares of our revenue.

992
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,090
Our brand reputation will be in tatters

993
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,350
and our stock will be worthless.

994
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:49,230
Look, I get it, principles are important,

995
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,120
but they don't keep the lights on.

996
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,500
- From a legal standpoint,

997
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,600
our situation has fundamentally changed.

998
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,730
We're no longer just managing an outage.

999
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,350
We're mitigating liability.

1000
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:01,050
The single biggest
quantifiable risk we face

1001
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,960
is the public leak of that PII data.

1002
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,700
Our CISO is correct.

1003
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,230
Paying the ransom doesn't guarantee

1004
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,030
that the attackers won't leak it.

1005
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:12,630
However, refusing to pay
it makes it a certainty.

1006
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,360
They will leak it to maximize our pain

1007
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,040
and make an example of us.

1008
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,910
The reality is, paying the
ransom is our only leverage,

1009
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,580
however small, to prevent that outcome.

1010
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,740
More importantly, we must
be able to demonstrate

1011
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,180
to the courts and regulators

1012
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,810
that we took every possible
step, however distasteful,

1013
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:32,790
to protect our customers' data

1014
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,890
after the breach was discovered.

1015
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,540
- The general counsel's right.

1016
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,460
From purely a financial perspective,

1017
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,270
paying the $6 million,
as painful as it is,

1018
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,650
is the only move we've got.

1019
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,990
You know, it's an ugly
but necessary transaction

1020
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:48,960
to ensure that we stop the
financial hemorrhaging.

1021
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,210
It's the only business
decision on the table.

1022
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,450
- They were right, the security team,

1023
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:56,400
the operation analysts.

1024
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,520
They told us our backup strategy
for the cloud was flawed.

1025
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,490
They told us we needed better
visibility into our data.

1026
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,980
We deprioritized the
projects and the funding

1027
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,173
to meet the deadlines for new features.

1028
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:12,450
We made this choice months ago.
Not in this room, not today.

1029
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,070
Now we're just paying the bill.

1030
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:17,313
So I agree with the CFO
and the general counsel.

1031
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:19,283
We have to pay.

1032
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:23,970
- Then it's decided.
Authorize the payment.

1033
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:27,240
And the first non-negotiable
line item in next year's budget

1034
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,880
will be a complete overhaul
of our data security

1035
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,920
and cyber resilience strategy,

1036
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,220
to be led by the CIO's office.

1037
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,080
This will not happen again.

1038
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,960
- For the record, I'm formally
objecting to the payment,

1039
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,877
but I have advised on the
legal rationale for doing so.

1040
00:47:42,877 --> 00:47:45,377
(tense music)

1041
00:47:46,854 --> 00:47:50,370
- All right. Spoken like
a true lawyer, by the way.

1042
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,750
Kind of a weird way to end the scene.

1043
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,350
But, you know, it is what it is.

1044
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:57,007
And the CEO being so confident,

1045
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:58,560
"This will not happen again."

1046
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,350
Well, stats prove him wrong.

1047
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:04,860
80% of people who are impacted
by a ransomware attack

1048
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,220
are usually re-impacted after six months.

1049
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,490
That's because they either
didn't do a good job

1050
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,740
of finding the initial entry point,

1051
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,530
or unfortunately, how the attackers got in

1052
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,750
ends up getting sold, right?

1053
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,450
Attackers are just looking to monetize

1054
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:24,570
and they will monetize
their TTPs that they used

1055
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,430
to infiltrate your environment

1056
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:29,340
to go after someone else
in your industry sector.

1057
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,590
We're seeing what Scattered Spider today,

1058
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:33,750
tearing through industry sectors.

1059
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:38,477
Retail, airlines, insurance, right?

1060
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,930
And it's because a lot
of the industry sector,

1061
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,060
a lot of the organizations
in those industry sectors

1062
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,970
use common tools, right?

1063
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,010
And they have common vulnerabilities.

1064
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,290
And those common
vulnerabilities can be shared

1065
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,650
amongst the community of bad guys.

1066
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,233
Nation state bad guys.

1067
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,103
Who woulda paid?

1068
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:07,263
Wow, nobody? Come on.

1069
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:10,800
Come on, based on what was faced here,

1070
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,700
who would've paid?

1071
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,720
Okay, thank you. One brave
soul says he woulda paid.

1072
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,220
Couple now. Okay.

1073
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,050
I don't really think
they had a choice here.

1074
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:20,220
I mean, let's be honest.

1075
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,640
If it's gonna take them three
more weeks to rebuild, right,

1076
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,163
which is what the CIO was saying,

1077
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,500
there may not be a company
left after the rebuild, right?

1078
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,420
Really don't think they had a choice here.

1079
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,010
I am not advocating that you pay.

1080
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,480
As a matter of fact,

1081
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,633
that may be illegal at some point, to pay.

1082
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:46,113
It is considered paying essentially

1083
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,840
a hostage fee to a nation state actor

1084
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,660
who are enemies of the US.

1085
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,420
So it may become illegal at some point.

1086
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:00,630
Ultimately, paying is a decision,
it's a business decision.

1087
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,700
I really didn't think
Horizon had much choice here,

1088
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,740
just based on what they were faced with.

1089
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,810
When a clean recovery is impossible,

1090
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:09,540
the focus shifts from financial survival

1091
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,960
to mitigating the legal liability, right,

1092
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,243
of a leak, of a public data breach.

1093
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,630
Second thing, and I thought
this, we really, like,

1094
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:20,167
I love this statement,

1095
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:22,080
"That choice was made months ago.

1096
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,697
We're just paying the bill now."

1097
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,940
Right? That is ultimately
what happened here.

1098
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,893
That choice was made last year.

1099
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,400
They deprioritized security investments.

1100
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,680
They accepted those risks.

1101
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,100
This is a management failure
as much as it is a failure

1102
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,213
of the person whose
credentials were lifted, right?

1103
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,800
And that's the typical
push-pull in any organization.

1104
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,780
That constant trade off between

1105
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:53,193
investing in cyber
preparedness and velocity.

1106
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,043
Right?

1107
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,160
Ultimately, we believe
that true cyber resilience

1108
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,370
is the power to say no,
the power not to pay.

1109
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:03,810
And in order to do that,

1110
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,850
you have to have certain things in place

1111
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:08,070
that we're gonna go
through on the next slide.

1112
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,390
According to our own research,

1113
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:12,870
39% of IT and security leaders believe

1114
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,390
that their board of directors or C-suite

1115
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:18,180
have little to no confidence
in their organization's ability

1116
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,400
to recover critical data.

1117
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,263
That's a pretty sobering statistic.

1118
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:30,803
All right.

1119
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,510
Like I said, cyber resilience,

1120
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:37,170
true cyber resilience is the
power to keep your data safe

1121
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:38,490
and your business running,

1122
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:41,550
assuming that you have
executive alignment,

1123
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:44,700
which, again, did not happen here,

1124
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,533
and proactive investment.

1125
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:51,690
Some things have to be foundational.

1126
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:55,233
The first, survivable backups.

1127
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,050
Immutable and air-gapped.

1128
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,940
You might say, how do
I air-gap in the cloud?

1129
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,340
It's all about credential isolation.

1130
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,490
That's how you air-gap
in the cloud, right?

1131
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:09,753
Every single time you
write your backup data,

1132
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,450
not only to an immutable bucket,

1133
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:15,630
you should be writing with
Object Lock as well, right?

1134
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:18,630
Immutable and air-gapped,
survivable backups.

1135
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:19,463
That's number one.

1136
00:52:19,463 --> 00:52:20,296
If you don't have backups,

1137
00:52:20,296 --> 00:52:22,260
you don't have a recovery strategy,

1138
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,450
and ultimately the ability
to be able to guarantee

1139
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:26,280
that you can recover that back.

1140
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,070
Now, the other things that
I think are really important

1141
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,390
when we talk about resiliency

1142
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:31,980
is understanding the type of data you have

1143
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,690
and who has access to it.

1144
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:35,643
If you're doing proactive,

1145
00:52:38,861 --> 00:52:43,350
you know, proactive data
governance in your organization,

1146
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:45,220
you should be ensuring that

1147
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:50,523
you adopt a least privileged
model across the board, right?

1148
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,330
Folks in your organization
should only have access to data

1149
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:56,490
if they need access to it.

1150
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:59,310
It has to be on a need-to-know basis.

1151
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:02,403
I know that's easier said
than done. I know that.

1152
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,120
Trust me, I've been through it.

1153
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,480
And then having that complete
sensitive data visibility

1154
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,530
and management is
ultimately going to limit

1155
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:16,830
the amount of data and limit
your risk surface area,

1156
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,510
limit the amount of
data that the attackers

1157
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:19,810
ultimately have access to.

1158
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:26,760
So I think we're gonna
go for any questions.

1159
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,080
Actually, before we go to questions,

1160
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,340
I do wanna put this up here.

1161
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,750
I noticed some folks were taking pictures

1162
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,310
of that last slide.

1163
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,590
Please take a picture of this QR code.

1164
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,830
Go and visit Rubrik's website.
Please stop by our booth.

1165
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:42,573
We've got a massive
booth on the expo floor.

1166
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,490
We've got lots of folks there
that are demoing Rubrik,

1167
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,320
Rubrik protection.

1168
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,120
We've got lots of different innovations

1169
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,170
we wanna share with you.

1170
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,970
This was not a Rubrik commercial,

1171
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:57,120
so I hope you found that
really valuable, right?

1172
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,620
But I have to put this slide up here

1173
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,263
because we don't do this for free.

1174
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,613
So thank you. I really
appreciate everybody attending.
