I understand you'd like me to summarize this AWS session, but I'm having difficulty creating a meaningful summary from the provided transcript. The text appears to contain fragmented words, mixed languages, and incomplete sentences that don't form coherent technical content about AWS services.

The transcript seems to mention some AWS-related terms like:
- Amazon services
- AI agents
- Multimodal embedding
- Amazon Nova
- Enterprise applications
- Amazon shopping (Rufus)

However, without clear, coherent sentences and proper technical context, I cannot create an accurate Chinese summary with reliable timestamps and key points as requested.

Could you please provide a cleaner version of the transcript, or verify that this is the correct subtitle file for the AWS re:Invent 2025 session you'd like summarized? This would help me create the comprehensive Chinese summary you're looking for.
