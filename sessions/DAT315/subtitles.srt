1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,440
- All right, hi.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,110
Welcome to DAT315.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,400
Hopefully some of you are
practitioners in data, maybe.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,925
Right, I'm a practitioner in data.

5
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:13,530
Maybe you're a practitioner in agentic AI.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,363
Anybody?

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,590
Well, by the end of this,

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,237
hopefully you'll probably
be practitioners in data

9
00:00:18,237 --> 00:00:20,160
and agentic AI together.

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,990
So that's what we aim to do.

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,080
My name's Tim, I'm a senior
principal engineer in Aurora.

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,630
I'll be joined shortly by my friend Siva,

13
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,620
who's the director

14
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,905
of Worldwide Specialist
Solutions Architects,

15
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:35,550
and we're gonna talk about
practitioner's guide to data

16
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,410
for agentic AI.

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,290
So if anybody thinks they've
completely got their arms

18
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,750
around all of this, congratulations,

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,250
you're doing better than most
of the rest of the world.

20
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,617
This is changing really fast.

21
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:47,340
So the first thing I wanna do is just

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,670
look at this evolving
landscape a little bit.

23
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,045
So we started off in 2023.

24
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:55,230
Not very long ago we had these chat bots,

25
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,850
we were talking about vector search,

26
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,810
we were talking about LLMs just beginning.

27
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,420
We had these single shot
interactions with the agents,

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,130
that's what we could do.

29
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,040
Then in 2024, we got these
more advanced chat bots.

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,150
We got context, the ability
for an agent to remember

31
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,536
a little bit about what it was doing,

32
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:16,470
to do hybrid search, to
bring in other data types.

33
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,200
In here we had RAG, retrieval
augmented generation.

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,420
That was all the rage last year.

35
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,893
That was so 2024.

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,249
Then, near the end of 2024,

37
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:28,530
came MCP, Model Context Protocol,

38
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,250
which gave these agents some
tools to talk to each other

39
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,120
in data sources.

40
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,100
It standardized things.

41
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,590
And then now 2025, nearly the end,

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,350
we got to autonomous AI agents.

43
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,220
They can reason and plan
and they can execute tasks.

44
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,340
This all happened in, count
'em, just a few years.

45
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,190
And we are still, I don't
think anywhere near the end.

46
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,110
But now we can have a much
more natural conversation

47
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:52,943
with our agents,

48
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:56,760
and they can do things much
more autonomously for us.

49
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,530
So today we're gonna follow an example.

50
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,450
We're gonna buy some car insurance,

51
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,540
which is, I think, what everybody
loves to do all the time.

52
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,710
Buy some car insurance,

53
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,360
and we're gonna pretend that we are Terry,

54
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,890
who wants to buy some car insurance.

55
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,420
Back in 2023, your AI experience
would've been interesting,

56
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,370
but it would've been
probably just a thin wrapper

57
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,810
around some pre-processing

58
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,960
and then hand off to a human
to actually do the work.

59
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,565
Now in 2025 with our auto insurer example,

60
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:26,880
the agent's able to have a
much more fluid conversation,

61
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,180
and it's able to actually
do probably the entire task

62
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,647
for Terry rather than, excuse me,

63
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:35,571
rather than handing off to a human.

64
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,283
Whether we like it or not.

65
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,580
That's what's gonna happen.

66
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,920
That's what we're gonna dig through today.

67
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,240
So we'll cover some fundamentals.

68
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,700
We've got these three
pillars of agentic AI.

69
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,530
So first off, we have reasoning.

70
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,830
This is where we use our
large language models

71
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:52,470
and then we have action.

72
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,220
We are able to take
action from these models.

73
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,030
We're gonna call some tools,
we're gonna do some things

74
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,530
as instructed by the LLMs.

75
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,170
And then we have this memory.

76
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,820
We have to remember things.

77
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,220
Otherwise it's like talking to a goldfish.

78
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,180
You can't remember anything.

79
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,854
It's very frustrating, not very useful.

80
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,890
The agentic AI thing, the
special sauce there is,

81
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,923
we put this in a loop.

82
00:03:12,923 --> 00:03:13,756
We're able to iterate this,

83
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:15,450
and if you've done any
computer science stuff,

84
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,078
writing a program without loops,

85
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:19,590
pretty difficult, pretty boring.

86
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,990
Once we've got this loop, this ReAct loop,

87
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,810
reason and act loop, now
we're in agentic AI space.

88
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,760
That's where we are today.

89
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,076
Okay, so any company car insurance,

90
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,200
Terry needs to buy some car insurance.

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,630
We'll come through this
loop probably a ton of times

92
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,040
before we make some answer,

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,620
like, "Your insurance quote is X dollars,

94
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,300
thanks for your business."

95
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,510
Okay, so we'll dig in just
in one iteration of that loop

96
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,120
to start with, reasoning and planning.

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,879
So the user puts in their request.

98
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,170
Inside here we have the system prompt.

99
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,580
We are managing context.

100
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,080
The system prompt comes in,

101
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,210
we have some existing state, maybe,

102
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,957
we have the user request come in, saying,

103
00:03:55,957 --> 00:03:58,496
"Oh I need insurance for
my Buick or whatever."

104
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:00,653
Next part, we go through the LLM.

105
00:04:00,653 --> 00:04:02,400
The LLM does magic stuff.

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,720
I'm not a scientist who can tell you

107
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,390
about how LLMs actually do their work.

108
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,490
And then we pass the
output from this thing.

109
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,370
We make an action plan,
agent makes an action plan.

110
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,203
We need to work out

111
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:14,339
what the next step in the action plan is.

112
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:16,350
We might be stopping,

113
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,843
we might be sending a
response back to the user.

114
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,770
We talk about this acting
and managing context thing,

115
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,092
'cause that's where we can
first start to talk about data.

116
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:27,750
After we've called a tool,

117
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,850
or maybe we call the tool to get the data

118
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,460
and send a response back to the user.

119
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,616
So that tool does whatever
the tool's gonna do,

120
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:37,680
and then it maybe
accessed some data store.

121
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,360
This is what we're gonna talk about today.

122
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,890
And then we're gonna feed these results

123
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,050
into this context manager.

124
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,463
And that's gonna maybe do some caching,

125
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:47,910
it's gonna do some updating
the conversation history,

126
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,290
so we can remember.

127
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,600
And it's also gonna
evaluate what it was doing

128
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,620
for reinforcement learning,

129
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,350
so that we can make a better
experience of this iteration

130
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,000
for the next time we come through,

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,230
maybe for the next customer.

132
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,480
That's important as well.

133
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,540
So knowing all of that,
we'll actually step through

134
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,610
our car insurance example
just a little bit,

135
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,040
and I need you to pay
attention to the colors here.

136
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,657
So the first interaction says,
from the customer, Terry,

137
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:12,266
"I need some car insurance."

138
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:15,180
We get the system prompt,
that's the purple thing here.

139
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,620
We go to the agent, we give that,

140
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,330
we give whatever other context we have,

141
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,196
maybe from previous conversation
history or something.

142
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:24,240
We format this up, we give it to the LLM,

143
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,360
it does whatever its does,
we get the output out again.

144
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,060
We determine the next step,

145
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,500
and maybe the next step is to call a tool.

146
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,898
Now this is the first interaction.

147
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:35,730
So we dunno anything
about this customer yet.

148
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,450
So we need to just call a tool
called get_driver_details.

149
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,580
We need to work out what this
driver's history is about.

150
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,253
So this gives us a purple kind of result.

151
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,270
So now we're gonna go
around this loop again.

152
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,290
You can see in this state

153
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,910
we've remembered the purple result.

154
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,680
We remember the driver's information,

155
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,910
and now we're gonna go around

156
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,290
and we're gonna invoke a different tool

157
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,816
to find out about the
vehicle's information.

158
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,260
Again, the pink information
comes in, we remember that,

159
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,390
now we're gonna sort
of calculate some risk

160
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,416
about that vehicle and that person.

161
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,890
Again, we're gonna get a quote.

162
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,563
So see how this the
context is stacking up.

163
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,970
Finally, we have enough
information to generate a response

164
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,350
for the user, give it to the user,

165
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,020
and wait for their input returning again.

166
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,130
You can see how the context,

167
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,010
all those colors are stacking up together.

168
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,970
So this is great.

169
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,100
What happens, though, when
we need to keep going,

170
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,070
that context is not infinitely large.

171
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,380
I'm a really good artist, you
can see from my great colors.

172
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,540
So we need to do something
called compaction

173
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,370
on our context here.

174
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,470
What we've done is we've
merged those colors.

175
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,690
So there's a few different
algorithms we can be using here.

176
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,040
You don't have to worry
about this too much.

177
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,360
The framework provides it for you,

178
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,320
but we can be doing summarization,
we can be asking the LLM

179
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,550
to summarize it for you,

180
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,890
we can be doing simple
like least recently used

181
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,240
kind of thing in there.

182
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,190
Different algorithms
to throw away the bits

183
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,010
that we maybe don't want,
remember the bits that we do.

184
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,560
The important thing is that
we've gone around this loop

185
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,030
seven times in this case,

186
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,950
and we've remembered
most of what we've done.

187
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,283
That's the react loop.

188
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:06,750
So the memory thing, this
is the interesting part.

189
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,180
We've got this continuum,
short-term memory on the left,

190
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,830
long-term memory on the right.

191
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,551
We're gonna dig into this
some more with agentic memory.

192
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:16,230
In the short term memory,
we have this agent state.

193
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,300
This is kind of like the agent's RAM,

194
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,590
if you like to think about it that way.

195
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,240
It's working memory.

196
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,880
This is where the framework's
probably dealing with it

197
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,350
for you, you probably don't actually

198
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,930
have to code this thing up yourself.

199
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,010
You want it to be fast.

200
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,473
It might be like
ElastiCache for Valkey here.

201
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,127
Strands Agents as a framework,
LangGraph as a framework,

202
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:38,580
they typically provide these
things for you, all right?

203
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,270
And they're simple to
use, small, short term.

204
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,110
And in the middle we have this
medium term semantic memory,

205
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,190
episodic memory.

206
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,370
So this is typically, we are
retrieving it using tools.

207
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,300
We're going through a tool

208
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,100
to get to the source of the memory

209
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,998
or to put stuff into the memory there.

210
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:57,606
This is where we'll talk
about enterprise databases,

211
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:59,687
vector stores, other things like that.

212
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:03,000
So you probably are more
aware of what's going on here.

213
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,760
Then on the far right we have prompts.

214
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,980
So this is more, you're
probably treating them

215
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,040
like infrastructure as
code kind of things.

216
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,860
This is where your builders are
putting in the system prompt

217
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,540
to say you are an insurance agent,

218
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,580
here are your guardrails
and things like that.

219
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,650
You're probably manage them like code

220
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,800
in a code artifact repository,
or a key value store,

221
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,150
or something like that.

222
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,660
You're not accessing them very often.

223
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,990
You're not modifying them very often.

224
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,810
That's the way to think about
these three kinds of memory.

225
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,850
Okay, so now we're just gonna
see a little bit of code.

226
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,070
I'm an engineer, this
makes it look easier to me.

227
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,780
We have two different examples here.

228
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,950
I've chosen Strands Agents
and LangChain and LangGraph.

229
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,810
Now if you don't follow
code, that's completely fine,

230
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,210
'cause there's not really very much here.

231
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,030
All we really need to focus
on is just couple of lines

232
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,800
at the top there which says I'm gonna use

233
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,120
an AgentCore session memory
manager in this case.

234
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,890
You could use another one.

235
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,370
I'm gonna use a conversation manager,

236
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,590
summarizing conversation
manager in this case.

237
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,930
That's one that uses that
summarization algorithm

238
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,200
to smush the colors together
like I showed before.

239
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,000
And then I'm just gonna pass
it down to the framework.

240
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,290
That's it.

241
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,240
In the LangChain version,
it's pretty similar.

242
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,890
They just use a different name for things

243
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,940
and bundle it all together

244
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,100
into a thing called a check pointer.

245
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,000
Same idea.

246
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,071
So you're not really
writing all this code,

247
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:19,289
the agent's probably
writing it for you anyway.

248
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:21,537
But very simple.

249
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:23,910
Okay, so we'll dig in a little bit more.

250
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,783
We'll just talk about how we
connect the agents to the data.

251
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,560
So we get our inbound user query,

252
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,330
we go through an MCP server, probably.

253
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,830
We'll dig into what that
means in a little bit,

254
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,360
and we'll talk to some database

255
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,073
to maybe get customer profiles.

256
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,170
And then we'll go around again,

257
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,090
maybe we'll talk to a different database

258
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,680
to get vehicle data and telemetry,

259
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,850
and we'll go around again.

260
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,490
You can see we are talking to
different kinds of databases.

261
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,430
Maybe they're relational ones,
maybe they're key value ones,

262
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,380
maybe they're vector ones.

263
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,290
Maybe some of them belong
to our company already.

264
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,060
Maybe some of them are third party ones,

265
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,653
like the Department of Motor
Vehicles in my example.

266
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:03,063
You're calling these things
all through tools, MCP service.

267
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,560
All right, so the same
basic pattern is applied

268
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,850
across everything here.

269
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,410
That's the joy of MCP.

270
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,910
We don't have to write
all this special code

271
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,843
to deal with this.

272
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,120
So how did we get there?

273
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,340
Those tools, we need to find them first.

274
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,461
So the same example, we just
look at the other part there.

275
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:23,220
I'm creating an agent,
instantiating an agent,

276
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,410
I'm creating a bedrock
model to go with it,

277
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,263
and I'm giving it a list of tools.

278
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:29,951
There are four tools there,
search documents and so on,

279
00:10:29,951 --> 00:10:33,321
and a system prompt, you
are an insurance agent.

280
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:36,810
Now I'm not in love with
how I had to specify

281
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,670
or hard code the tool names there,

282
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,410
so I'm gonna come back
to that one in a minute.

283
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,933
But you can still see
this as pretty simple.

284
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,500
I'm going to change gears a little bit

285
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,690
and talk about the power of
caching here for a minute.

286
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,030
So you know all the fundamentals here.

287
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,530
You would've probably
noticed that every time

288
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,330
we go around this loop,
we seem like we're doing

289
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,280
a bunch of maybe duplicate work.

290
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,460
We're fetching some data
again, over and over again.

291
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,320
Maybe some of that will
make things slower.

292
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,390
Maybe some of that will
cost us some more money.

293
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,230
We don't like that.

294
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,600
Caching is a pretty natural approach here.

295
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,670
So here's our similar picture,

296
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,720
and we'll talk about places

297
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,846
where we can put caching into this.

298
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:13,530
Why would we do it?

299
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,215
We can reduce latency,
that's pretty standard.

300
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:19,500
These LLMs, large language models,

301
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,230
they're not called SLMs,
small language models.

302
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,790
They have a bit of a cost to them.

303
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,500
So if we can avoid calling them,

304
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,530
or we can avoid using
up their token space,

305
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,750
we can save ourselves money and time.

306
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,970
So caching is a really
good way to do that.

307
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,270
Even if the backend system is not an LLM,

308
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,590
if it's some other kind of database,

309
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,740
it still has a finite capacity
to deliver some performance.

310
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,160
So reducing load on that's
probably good as well.

311
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,563
And again, with this
reinforcement learning thing,

312
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:48,690
caching is a really
important way to get signals

313
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,370
to see if something is popular.

314
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,290
So if I'm getting lots
of hits in the cache,

315
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,469
then it's probably a popular thing,

316
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:55,302
and I should cache it more,

317
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:58,170
and I should update my plan
to do more of this thing.

318
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,150
So where can we insert some caches?

319
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,260
Over on the right hand side,

320
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,660
this is the closest to the data source.

321
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,330
So the lowest in the stack, if you like.

322
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,520
This is probably the most familiar

323
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,960
to what you do already today.

324
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,670
You've got a database, you
put a cache in front of it,

325
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,716
right, an ElastiCache
or something like that.

326
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:16,032
This makes your tool responses faster,

327
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:19,830
but it doesn't do anything to
avoid going around this loop.

328
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,990
Just lets you go around
this loop a bit quicker.

329
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,820
So it probably doesn't save you any money

330
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,433
or context on your LLMs.

331
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,870
Next step up, we can put a cache

332
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,340
in the memory context manager

333
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,890
just after it's called the tool.

334
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,140
All right, this is on the tool results.

335
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,480
So this might reduce your LLM usage.

336
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,490
This is the first one that does this.

337
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,860
You can reuse an existing
action plan maybe

338
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,520
and the sequence of tools
that are gonna be called,

339
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,290
so you don't have to
ask the LLM to do this

340
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,490
every single time.

341
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,290
This is pretty optimistic
if it helps here,

342
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,840
but it's useful to think about.

343
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,650
Next we can cache

344
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,741
on the other side of the
memory context manager,

345
00:12:58,741 --> 00:12:59,580
on the output side if you like.

346
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,270
So this is within the scope
of a user's session, probably.

347
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,300
So if your session contains a
lot of cacheable information,

348
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,446
messages that don't change very
often, like in our example,

349
00:13:08,446 --> 00:13:11,670
we're going around and telling
them the vehicle information

350
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,591
over and over again, that kind of thing.

351
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:16,650
That's the kind of thing
we'll be using here.

352
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,260
This won't affect your
LLM usage appreciably,

353
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,693
but it will make things go a lot quicker.

354
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,170
And finally you can
implement a semantic cache,

355
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,570
which is as close to
the user as you can get

356
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,183
before this whole loop iterates at all.

357
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,050
So if this works for you, this
is really, really powerful,

358
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,510
because you can avoid calling everything.

359
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,800
Now this works for things

360
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,570
where you don't have personal information

361
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,130
inside your agent responses.

362
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,400
Maybe your agent was being
asked a question like,

363
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,990
just tell me the legal requirements

364
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,940
for insurance in Nevada.

365
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,740
There's nothing specific to me about that.

366
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,690
So I could cache that response.

367
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,030
That's the kind of thing
we would use there.

368
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,430
So this saves latency, saves cost,

369
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,480
makes your customers happier,

370
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,513
'cause their interactions are more smooth.

371
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,000
Right, so now you're all kind of experts,

372
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,250
or maybe you're all just bedazzled.

373
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,121
So one thing that, I'm a
crusty old Unix gray beard.

374
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:12,390
And so I would like to share
with you a bit of an analogy

375
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,580
to see if this helps understand

376
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,870
what's going on here a little bit.

377
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,420
So I'm gonna draw an
analogy between agentic AI

378
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,710
and relational databases.

379
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,870
If you know relational databases,
great, maybe this works.

380
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,070
If you don't, don't worry.

381
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,691
It's not gonna be on the
take home assignment.

382
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:27,990
So first we'll talk about the interface.

383
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,970
What's the interface into
a relational database?

384
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,100
Well, it's SQL and it's JDBC.

385
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,350
It's all this very standardized stuff.

386
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,020
And Agentic AI is getting
that as well with MCP.

387
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,370
So they're kind of similar.

388
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,830
Then there's this idea of memory

389
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,810
we've been talking about along today.

390
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,640
You've got short term
memory and long term memory

391
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,083
for agentic AI.

392
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,270
And inside a relational database,

393
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,740
of course you've got
memory, you've got B-trees,

394
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,060
you've got heaps, you've got indexes,

395
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,430
you've got all that kind of thing.

396
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,830
Then there's the execution angle to this.

397
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,260
So we just talked about this react loop

398
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,261
where we plan and then we
execute the steps of the plan.

399
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:04,710
Well, in a SQL engine, you
have a SQL query planner

400
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,310
that's planning how to use
indexes, and heap sorts,

401
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,900
and all those other kinds of things.

402
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,370
Quite similar.

403
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,930
And we got caching we just talked about.

404
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,430
That's very one for one.

405
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,350
Databases work heavily on caching.

406
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,710
And finally we've got this
thing we call canned execution.

407
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,290
So MCP, you can put whatever tool you like

408
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,462
behind an MCP server to execute
whatever operation you want,

409
00:15:25,462 --> 00:15:28,020
and inside a SQL engine
you have stored procedures,

410
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,743
you have PLPG SQL, got lots
of other pre-canned execution.

411
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,650
If that makes you draw a
complete blank, I'm sorry.

412
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,600
If this helps, maybe it's good for you.

413
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,410
All right, so MCP, model context protocol.

414
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,540
We dig into this a little bit more.

415
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,080
So this standardizes the
interaction between your agents

416
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,600
and the tools that they're
calling in two ways.

417
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,150
It lets them find the tools
that they're gonna call,

418
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,580
work out what they're for,
and it lets them call them.

419
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,470
Two very important separate steps.

420
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,627
So here's our car insurance agent.

421
00:15:57,627 --> 00:16:00,450
Inside that agent, there's an MCP client,

422
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,380
standard Python, it's
talking to an MCP server.

423
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,160
MCP server advertises, in
this case, three tools,

424
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,110
get owner vehicles and so on.

425
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,930
The tools have parameters,
they have some documentation

426
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,370
that goes with them to tell the humans

427
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,070
and to tell the tool what they do.

428
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,590
That tool probably
calls off to a database,

429
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,910
so it's just doing normal stuff.

430
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,980
It's like running a
regular database driver,

431
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,620
talking to a regular relational,
maybe, database, okay?

432
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,323
It's nothing magic once you
get underneath MCP server.

433
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,803
So we'll zoom in, next level down.

434
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,160
That agent embeds that MCP client.

435
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,060
What is the MCP server actually doing?

436
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,323
So inside the agent,
we have a tool catalog.

437
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,230
It's now got two tools inside it.

438
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,790
How did they get there?

439
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,363
Well, the MCP server
advertises these two tools.

440
00:16:48,363 --> 00:16:52,320
There's an MCP operation
called tools/list.

441
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,213
MCP works on JSSON-RPC.

442
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:58,740
So the first thing that
the MCP client does is say,

443
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,223
list me the tools, and
you'll get vehicle by VIN,

444
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:04,890
get vehicle owners, get owner vehicles.

445
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,830
We know how to call them or
add them into our catalog.

446
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,950
And the agent understands
then how it's useful

447
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,783
to call that tool.

448
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:14,370
So you don't have to tell
the agent call the tool,

449
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,860
which is named X with parameters Y.

450
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,090
It's already worked all this out.

451
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,350
That's the job of the tool catalog,

452
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,810
which got discovered by using MCP.

453
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,570
So that hard coding that I
didn't like in the example

454
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,580
gets replaced by this.

455
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,260
We don't hard code tools anymore.

456
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,410
You can if you like,
but you don't have to.

457
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,290
Now we can have many MCP servers

458
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,409
plugged into one of our
agents, one of our MCP clients.

459
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:40,410
So we can continue to build our catalog

460
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,320
by querying multiple MCP
servers along the way.

461
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,283
And this is how we build, for example,

462
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:49,110
our internal data stores, and
then we talk to the DMV ones,

463
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,720
and the other ones that we're
trying to build up over time.

464
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,100
Okay, so we're building this catalog,

465
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,353
this is all internal to how MCP works.

466
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,460
So let's implement an
MCP client and server,

467
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,230
those purple boxes that we had before.

468
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,030
Little bit more Python.

469
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,350
On the left, standard MCP
SDK, nothing to do with me.

470
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,630
All we're doing is we're
creating a client session.

471
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,850
On the right hand side, MCP server.

472
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,170
This is the thing that's maybe off

473
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,463
talking to your database and so on.

474
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:17,340
Important part on the client side.

475
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,524
We initialize the session

476
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:21,690
and we call that list tools function.

477
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,523
That's it.

478
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,110
On the right hand side,

479
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,880
there's actually no
python code there at all

480
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,490
that's interesting, there's
just a couple of decorators,

481
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,343
the little pink things,
and all they say is,

482
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:35,040
this function is the
function I want you to call

483
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,710
when you want to list
the tools, for example,

484
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,853
or call the tools.

485
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,520
So the takeaway for you here, I hope,

486
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,030
is that it's very, very
low barrier to entry here.

487
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,610
Making an MCP server, not too difficult.

488
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,220
Just put a couple of
annotations on the code

489
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,963
that you probably already have.

490
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:57,210
All right, so as we go on,

491
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,090
we've gotta talk about how
to choose the right tools

492
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,241
for the right job.

493
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:04,620
So I've kind of made this taxonomy here.

494
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,990
We've got the X axis is read only,

495
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,450
data retrieval versus data mutation,

496
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,970
and the Y axis is whether
it's a general purpose tool,

497
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,070
where it can do pretty much anything,

498
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,193
or a specialized tool like
we've been talking about so far.

499
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,800
So on the top left there,

500
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,000
we have general purpose
retrieval tools, read only tools.

501
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,160
So this is maybe your business analyst

502
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,839
inside an insurance company,

503
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,860
which needs the full power of a SQL query,

504
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,480
a read only SQL query,

505
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,020
and it wants to call this
through Agentic AI workflow.

506
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,660
So this might be the MCP server,

507
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,980
tools that we ship inside AWS
for a bunch of our databases

508
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,260
like Aurora DSQL.

509
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,570
And on the right hand side of that,

510
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,060
you've got the data
mutation version of that.

511
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,140
This is very powerful.

512
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,930
This is basically general
purpose SQL execution

513
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,160
or something like that.

514
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,110
They can create, they can delete,

515
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,920
and they can read general
purpose data in your data stores.

516
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,230
You're probably not giving
that to your customers.

517
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,807
You're probably giving that
to your internal developers.

518
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,290
Maybe you're accessing that through KIRO

519
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,090
or something like that, Claude code.

520
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,740
Now down the bottom, the
specialized read only calls,

521
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,410
that's like what we've been
making in our examples so far.

522
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,200
The get vehicle by VIN
and that kind of thing.

523
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,660
We are getting, so it's read
only, but it's specialized.

524
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,220
I can't go and learn about tractors,

525
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,270
I can only learn about cars or something.

526
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,090
And then the data
mutating versions of that,

527
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,620
the specialized one.

528
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,867
So in our example, this is
maybe when we get to the end

529
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:39,193
and we wanna save the
progress on the quote

530
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:42,570
or we want to calculate some
premium or something like that.

531
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,030
So this is your highest business value

532
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,640
is packed into probably
that bottom row there,

533
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,720
the specialized ones,

534
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,040
they're the tools that you are building

535
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,470
for your customers to call.

536
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,270
They're for frequently executed tasks.

537
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,784
So it's worthwhile you
investing the effort in there.

538
00:20:57,784 --> 00:21:00,663
And they'll give the
higher performance as well.

539
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,490
So now that we have this
taxonomy, we can see how that maps

540
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,320
to the personas of the users

541
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,040
that you are maybe trying
to have inside your business

542
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,810
or as your customers.

543
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,670
So the top left, you have the data analyst

544
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,880
or the engineer, they're
doing those read-only queries

545
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,983
against the general purpose data.

546
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,640
If I took the words MCP
out of your mind right now,

547
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,280
this picture probably looks
pretty familiar anyway.

548
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,070
This is what business
intelligence tools and so on do,

549
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,310
and MCP, just giving you a
different lens to think about it.

550
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,160
Top right, that's your developers
and your DevOps people.

551
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,410
And down the bottom, it's
your end users and consumers,

552
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,131
depending if they're
doing reads and writes.

553
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:43,920
So hopefully that sets the framework here

554
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,570
so that we can think about this some more.

555
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,610
I'm gonna hand over to Siva now

556
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,360
and he's gonna tell us about
the data behind the tools.

557
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,310
- Thank you, Tim.

558
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,140
So good afternoon everyone.

559
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,230
So where does the data
behind the tool comes from?

560
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,288
And you're probably wondering,

561
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:09,970
I already have a lot of
challenges on my data side,

562
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,453
I have data quality issues,

563
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:16,349
maybe I need to figure out
how to get data lineage.

564
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:20,880
And then how do I have an
existing system that's working?

565
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,740
Then maybe you have some APIs.

566
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,910
How do I convert that into an MCP tool,

567
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,587
hand this off to the the agent,

568
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:34,468
and what happens to
security along end to end?

569
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:37,230
This is what customers are asking us.

570
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,765
The next section I'm gonna go through

571
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:43,740
how to address these challenges.

572
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,680
Also, as an architect,
I always think about,

573
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,590
is there a reference architecture
that I can give customers?

574
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,840
So I kept the best for the last.

575
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,280
So I think we're gonna
end the presentation

576
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,596
with the reference architecture

577
00:22:54,596 --> 00:22:56,640
and a call to action, obviously.

578
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,663
So let's dive in.

579
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,930
So where does, on a technical level,

580
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,850
where does the data come from?

581
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,190
The data comes from your
operational databases.

582
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,717
This could be MySQL, or Postgres, Oracle,

583
00:23:08,717 --> 00:23:10,440
or SQL server that you're running,

584
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,563
or it could be NoSQL
databases such as DynamoDB,

585
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:16,710
DocumentDB, MongoDB and other things.

586
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,026
It could also come from
your data warehouses,

587
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:23,325
data warehouses such as Redshift,
or Snowflake, or others.

588
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:27,990
Or you probably have data
in an Open Table format,

589
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,420
like Iceberg, and you
probably have this data

590
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,666
in a parquet format on top of S3.

591
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:36,630
SageMaker LakeHouse.

592
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,030
Or other LakeHouses,

593
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,650
or maybe you have a streaming data

594
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,060
coming into your organization

595
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,700
that is in your streaming data source,

596
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,911
such as Kinesis or Kafka.

597
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:50,493
Now, let's look at this
challenge from a business level.

598
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,691
Like this is anycompany.com insurance.

599
00:23:54,691 --> 00:23:58,080
This is an example company
that Tim alluded to

600
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,840
that Terry is gonna buy an
insurance from this company.

601
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,180
When you look at this, in Any Company,

602
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,653
there's multiple departments.

603
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,875
For example, the claims history

604
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,710
comes from the claims department.

605
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,100
They are data producers of this data set.

606
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,250
And then maybe the legal
department has information

607
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,440
about rules and regulations,

608
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,040
and then potentially this
company sources data from the DMV

609
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,590
in terms of accident
records and other things.

610
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,943
If they have pay-as-you-go insurance,

611
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:29,220
maybe that data has to be sourced

612
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,183
from some telemetric data sets.

613
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:35,824
So essentially you have data producers

614
00:24:35,824 --> 00:24:39,033
and data consumers in the setup.

615
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:44,033
And then, well, anytime you
have multiple departments,

616
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,330
producers, and consumers
you're dealing with data silos

617
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,330
and data quality issues come in.

618
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,490
If, for example, the sales
and marketing department

619
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,222
have information about the customer,

620
00:24:55,222 --> 00:24:57,360
all the fields have to kind of be merged

621
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,682
and then the customer
360 should reflect that.

622
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:02,130
And then the data lineage issues.

623
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,823
How do we track data lineage?

624
00:25:03,823 --> 00:25:06,810
There's this personally
identifiable information,

625
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,610
such as social security number.

626
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,040
If there is a collision, there's a claim,

627
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,660
then there's some medical
information involved.

628
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,273
You cannot pass this on to every user.

629
00:25:15,273 --> 00:25:19,170
And then access control,
who has access to this?

630
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,940
What are their entitlements?

631
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,940
So all of these challenges get magnified

632
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,291
in the world of agents, because
agents are applications,

633
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,941
they're going much faster than the humans.

634
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:35,024
They know how to navigate various paths.

635
00:25:35,024 --> 00:25:37,923
And then you wanna make sure

636
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:40,350
you are sending them on
along the right paths,

637
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,480
there's proper governance along the way

638
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,310
and proper security checks along the way,

639
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,810
and filters along the way,

640
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,329
so they don't hand off
the incorrect data set

641
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:51,379
to the end user or an internal user.

642
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:53,400
So how do we address that?

643
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,770
As an architect, probably you're familiar

644
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,318
with the data marketplace architecture.

645
00:25:58,318 --> 00:26:00,900
People call this data
mesh and other things.

646
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,076
I'm gonna use the term data
marketplace architecture.

647
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:05,460
What this architecture says is,

648
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,323
let's imagine our
company as data producers

649
00:26:09,323 --> 00:26:12,060
and data consumers.

650
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,347
For example, the claims department

651
00:26:15,347 --> 00:26:19,863
is a data producer of claims.

652
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,109
And then the underwriting department,

653
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:24,780
which consumes this data set

654
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,310
and evaluates the customer risk,

655
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,327
is actually a data consumer.

656
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:31,470
Then typically data
producers are responsible

657
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,520
for data quality.

658
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,110
Because they produce the data,

659
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,850
it's probably much easy for them

660
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,010
to actually put some data quality rules,

661
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,470
ensure that this data that they produce

662
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,720
actually conforms to the standards

663
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,240
that they expect the data to be at.

664
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,840
And then data consumers, like
this underwriting department

665
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,190
is the data consumer.

666
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,170
Typically they discover the data set

667
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,570
and then they subscribe to the data set.

668
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,109
So we can use these
primitives to help us address

669
00:26:57,109 --> 00:26:59,400
some of these issues as well.

670
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,570
So let's see, there's probably three steps

671
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,403
that you want to do.

672
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:08,760
First build data products marketplace.

673
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,830
Now, when I say this to customers,

674
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,767
they often ask us like,

675
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:13,440
"Well, that's gonna
take a couple of years,

676
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,210
maybe more to do that."

677
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,710
So here's where I think we need to be

678
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,629
a little more pragmatic.

679
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:21,300
You can boil the ocean and
build all these data products

680
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,800
for your company.

681
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,900
Probably you should be
keeping keep on doing that.

682
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,170
But as you identify some important
use cases for agentic AI,

683
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,540
you should probably
prioritize those use cases

684
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,760
and build data products relevant to them,

685
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,860
identify the data producers and consumers,

686
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,770
and get started there
to be fairly pragmatic.

687
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:42,770
And then now, how do we feed
this data products to agents?

688
00:27:43,218 --> 00:27:46,650
Let's build some data APIs on top of them.

689
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,690
If you have a claims history,

690
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,230
given the customer information,

691
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,600
it could actually get all
the claims information

692
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,070
pertaining to that customer.

693
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,900
Why should we do that?

694
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,700
The fact that you created a data product,

695
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,570
maybe that's a table in your Lakehouse,

696
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,550
the agent is able to
actually select everything

697
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,660
from the table,

698
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,940
but actually you wanna
be a little more careful.

699
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,680
You want to create a specialized path.

700
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,210
So if you're an external customer

701
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:15,180
coming through your agent
and asking for that,

702
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,160
you want to actually restrict that use

703
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,010
to just the data set that belongs to them.

704
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,760
Like building an API on top
of that makes a lot of sense.

705
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,636
And the other thing is like,
nobody can do this for you.

706
00:28:26,636 --> 00:28:30,960
You own your data, you
know what this data set is,

707
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,800
you know what your business
procedures or practices are,

708
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,430
and this belongs to us, as
data producers and consumers,

709
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,010
to actually build these APIs.

710
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,259
And then again, one of
the other challenges

711
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:46,740
with agents and our
industry right now is that,

712
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,730
everything is changing by
the day or by the week.

713
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,170
How do I, as an architect,
I always think about,

714
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,920
how do I build things in a
completely changing world?

715
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,629
So I build primitives, but
those can be extremely helpful,

716
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:01,759
now today, tomorrow, and day after.

717
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,720
And then obviously I can
leverage the agentic IDs

718
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,270
to build these APIs that are
making my life a lot easier.

719
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,620
But you do have to verify them,

720
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,938
you have to build them yourself.

721
00:29:11,938 --> 00:29:15,979
After we do that, then the
next thing is to hand this off.

722
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:19,439
How do we hand this off to the agent?

723
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:24,157
We can expose this API as MCP tools.

724
00:29:24,157 --> 00:29:26,490
Tim went through an example.

725
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,318
Here's where things like AgentCore gateway

726
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:32,310
are gonna come in fairly handy.

727
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,500
You know, as long as you have an API,

728
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,130
you can actually define that
API using open API standard,

729
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,290
you can register that with the AgentCore.

730
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,990
It'll actually expose that API

731
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,240
as an MCP server undertool on your behalf.

732
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,950
So you don't necessarily have to do that.

733
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,860
Or, if you want to actually create an API,

734
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,350
you could simply write a
lambda function in Python

735
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,730
or your favorite language,

736
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:58,410
and then expose that to AgentCore gateway,

737
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,680
and therefore magically
these tools are available

738
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,660
for your agents.

739
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,377
Now, when you do that, what happens?

740
00:30:05,377 --> 00:30:09,275
Your agent has the brain to
pick the right tool for the job.

741
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:14,190
When the user says, I want
a specific functionality,

742
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,990
it is able to reason out that request,

743
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,290
it looks in the tool
repository that it has

744
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,420
and identifies the right tool for the job.

745
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,746
Or you can guide this by
prompt templates as well.

746
00:30:24,746 --> 00:30:29,746
So we maybe addressed some
of the data silos issues.

747
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,490
Let's say, let's take these principles

748
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:36,441
and apply this to how do you
move a traditional application

749
00:30:36,441 --> 00:30:39,318
to an agentic AI application?

750
00:30:39,318 --> 00:30:43,410
Before we get there, I wanna address,

751
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,420
we should understand who the audience is,

752
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,060
who the user is of this agentic experience

753
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,080
that we're creating.

754
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,640
Again, I'm gonna go back into
the AnyCompany insurance.

755
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,750
It's easier to explain there.

756
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,260
So Tim talked about Terry
wanting to buy car insurance,

757
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,820
or maybe filing a claim.

758
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,476
That's one class of users.

759
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:05,970
People outside our company
that want to get something done

760
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:06,840
talking to us.

761
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,280
That's the external customer.

762
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,260
Now, when you look within the company,

763
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,440
this may be data producers
and data consumers.

764
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,396
In this case I'm gonna use Nikki,

765
00:31:14,396 --> 00:31:17,400
as Nikki is a claims investigator.

766
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,594
Nikki wants to actually
look at all the claims

767
00:31:19,594 --> 00:31:22,440
that happened in a specific state.

768
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,416
Nikki is responsible
for the state of Nevada.

769
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:29,550
And then when she investigates the claims,

770
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,940
she wants to get all the
claims beyond a certain value

771
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,430
and take a look at this, just
to see if there's any fraud.

772
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,593
That's an internal user.

773
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,890
And then again, you could
have data engineers,

774
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,146
like in this case, Jane is a data engineer

775
00:31:43,146 --> 00:31:45,366
and wants to build a new data product.

776
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:48,390
You know, I talked about this telematics.

777
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,820
Maybe she wants to subscribe
a telematics data set

778
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,560
from a telematics provider

779
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,960
and then host the
dataset as a data product

780
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,690
that the underwriting department
and others can consume.

781
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,280
So in general, you can generalize this to,

782
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,360
there are potentially three access paths

783
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,250
for our agentic applications.

784
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,821
Now, with that as the backdrop, Terry,

785
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:13,133
maybe this AnyCompany doesn't
have an agentic experience.

786
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:16,470
Today, what Terry does
is maybe goes through

787
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,770
an insurance website, fills
out the appropriate form,

788
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,895
and says, "I wanna buy insurance,

789
00:32:21,895 --> 00:32:23,641
or I want to file a claim."

790
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:28,641
Now, how do we transform that
into an agentic experience?

791
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,050
You potentially already have the API,

792
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,150
when you fill out the
form and Terry submits it,

793
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,297
chances are your web server
is already calling an API

794
00:32:36,297 --> 00:32:39,510
and that's implemented in
your application server.

795
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,650
And by simply converting
that into an MCP tool,

796
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,600
all of a sudden you can hook that tool

797
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,600
up to your agentic application
and great, now voila,

798
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,632
you have the agentic
experience that you can present

799
00:32:53,632 --> 00:32:56,100
and start building on this one.

800
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,136
So in general, what we see play out today,

801
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,141
it's not a complete revolution.

802
00:33:01,141 --> 00:33:05,850
The moving an application
from non-agentic experience

803
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,710
to an agentic experience is an
evolution for most customers.

804
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,210
And this thinking of the
existing functionality as an API,

805
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,790
exposing that as an MCP tool,

806
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:21,360
and handing it off with an
agent is a powerful mechanism

807
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,800
to actually plug that in.

808
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,470
Now, we talked about RAG.

809
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,940
Two years ago, RAG was the answer

810
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,397
no matter what the question was.

811
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:30,390
RAG hasn't gone anywhere else.

812
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,640
Like the beauty of RAG is that,

813
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,670
if I say I live in the state of Nevada

814
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,077
and I want insurance, it's able to say,

815
00:33:38,077 --> 00:33:39,636
"Maybe there's some rules and regulations

816
00:33:39,636 --> 00:33:40,950
associated with that."

817
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,160
If you have a vector database
with all these documents

818
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,990
that explains the rules
of buying insurance

819
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,294
in the state of Nevada,
maybe that's already chunked

820
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:51,120
and then stored in a vector data store.

821
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,950
And what this does is, given a string,

822
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,180
I wanna buy car insurance,

823
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,310
it retrieves the related information

824
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,353
and then hands it off to the agentic,

825
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,653
the reasoning loop.

826
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,850
And then now you can simply
expose that as an API, too.

827
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,610
Input is a string and
output is a set of documents

828
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,510
that comes in.

829
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,130
So you could potentially expose them

830
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,324
as semantic APIs as well.

831
00:34:13,324 --> 00:34:16,410
Now let's look at the
internal user experience.

832
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,216
How does this play out?

833
00:34:18,216 --> 00:34:21,090
So in the case of internal user,

834
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:26,077
again, I'm gonna take Nikki,
who's a data consumer.

835
00:34:26,077 --> 00:34:29,430
And then in this case,
Jane is a data producer.

836
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:33,990
Typically today Nikki goes to
sort of a BI tool of some sort

837
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,173
and says, hey, gimme the list of claims

838
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,539
that are greater than a certain value,

839
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:47,007
maybe sort this, and then
let's pick the top five or 10,

840
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:49,077
and then she starts investigating that.

841
00:34:49,077 --> 00:34:50,635
And that's the current experience.

842
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:55,530
Now Jane probably, to move this data set,

843
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,200
Jane probably wants to
figure out how to subscribe

844
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,770
to this telematics provider
since it's IoT data,

845
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,980
land this data in Kinesis,
for example, or Kafka,

846
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,080
and build some kind of
a streaming workflow

847
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,390
to build data pipelines to land this

848
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,580
in an Open Table format on S3.

849
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,900
That's the current path.

850
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,900
Now, AWS is very busy
building a lot of MCP servers

851
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,847
for all the services that we have.

852
00:35:20,847 --> 00:35:23,940
When I looked at it, we
had various MCP servers

853
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,950
and various levels of maturity.

854
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,560
As Tim pointed out you can
build these things yourself

855
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,705
if you want to enhance them as well.

856
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:34,720
And then imagine all your query engines

857
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,100
and data processing engines as front-ended

858
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,440
by the MCP servers and tools.

859
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,650
As soon as you register
the tool with your agent,

860
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,600
now all of a sudden Nikki can,

861
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,210
rather than specifying
writing the SQL query,

862
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,467
could simply ask the agent,

863
00:35:50,467 --> 00:35:52,890
"Hey, gimme a list of high value claims

864
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,750
in the state of Nevada."

865
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,730
As simple as that, the underlying tool

866
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,750
knows how to convert that,

867
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,700
we'll go through the complete
end-to-end experience

868
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,900
in a little bit.

869
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,460
Similarly, Jane could come
up with a long-term memory,

870
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,750
a prompt template.

871
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,980
In the data engineering team,

872
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,350
maybe there's a data engineering agent

873
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,890
that they have trained
with templates that say,

874
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,040
here's what you do when
you actually have IoT data.

875
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,810
Maybe you want to use,

876
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,410
maybe the organizational
standard is Kafka, maybe use MSK,

877
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,480
which is a managed service for Kafka.

878
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,130
Maybe they're familiar with Spark,

879
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,020
maybe they want to use Spark Streaming.

880
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,777
If all of this is templated,
again, Jane could simply say,

881
00:36:31,777 --> 00:36:36,777
"Hey, by the way, can you
please create me an MSK topic,

882
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,140
a Kafka topic, and get the data

883
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,089
from this third party provider,
and then stage this in S3."

884
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:47,040
It knows what the tools
are, it's able to actually

885
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,990
go through the reasoning loop, understand,

886
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:53,220
get the confirmation from Jane,
and deploy this whole thing.

887
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,590
That magic happens by simply exposing

888
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,169
your existing functionality as tools

889
00:36:58,169 --> 00:37:01,050
to your agentic applications.

890
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,860
And with that, now we
are getting into, okay,

891
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,570
looks pretty good, right?

892
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,930
Now, how does really governance
work under the covers?

893
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,430
It's kind of pretty important.

894
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,280
And then let's actually
play this thing out,

895
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,829
like, how does this really work?

896
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:21,829
when Nikki, as a claims
investigator, she has a role,

897
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:24,480
and user roles of a claim investigator.

898
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,479
Say, "Show me all the high value claims

899
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:28,139
in the state of Nevada."

900
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:29,419
What happens?

901
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:33,079
The moment Nikki connects to the agent,

902
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:36,840
the agent kind of inherits
that characteristic,

903
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,689
assumes the agent that
I'm an investigator.

904
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:42,679
And then what happens is that
it is smart enough to say,

905
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:47,430
by the way, Nikki is asking
something about the collision,

906
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,840
claims, et cetera.

907
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,283
I need to look up in the
business catalog what this means.

908
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,599
So assuming you have the tool registered,

909
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:01,140
what it does is it does, let me look,

910
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,761
let me find the data product.

911
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:07,761
And then it actually
calls kind of a SageMaker

912
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,380
business catalog and says,

913
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,260
hey, you have any data
products pertaining to claims?

914
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,580
There's metadata in this catalog

915
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,490
that says what those data products are,

916
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,770
claims and policies, et cetera.

917
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,386
Then as soon as the first call goes out,

918
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:27,180
it gets a list of claims and policies.

919
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,830
Now, since the tool, the agent here

920
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:36,270
inherits the investigator
role, it has restrictions.

921
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,950
It cannot look at all the data products.

922
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:42,120
It only has access to what a
claims investigator department

923
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,953
has access to.

924
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,738
Basically, it only only
lists all the data products

925
00:38:45,738 --> 00:38:50,190
from their catalog that's
relevant to the user,

926
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:55,102
that's relevant to this use
case that Nikki has access to.

927
00:38:55,102 --> 00:38:57,180
Again, the similar thing happens.

928
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,490
The next thing it does is
it takes the data product

929
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,470
and says it's backed
by a couple of tables,

930
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,050
the claims tables and the policy tables.

931
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,270
Then it looks up in the technical catalog

932
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,776
and says, lemme get the
structure of these tables.

933
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:10,620
And then once it gets that, again,

934
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,010
the context keeps on
building, as Tim showed you,

935
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,830
we're in that loop building the context

936
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,987
for this agentic application.

937
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:21,660
And the next thing it does is
like, well, I have the table,

938
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,520
now I need to retrieve data from this.

939
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,571
It says, let me call,
I have a list of tools.

940
00:39:26,571 --> 00:39:30,384
AWS has created the data
processing MCP server

941
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:33,540
that has Athena as an engine.

942
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,030
So it says, hey, let
me actually use Athena,

943
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,520
which is like query as
a query as a service,

944
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,680
and then I don't have to
provision a cluster, et cetera.

945
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,780
I can simply present the
query, it'll execute that

946
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,059
and get me the results.

947
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:48,330
It fires off a session into Athena,

948
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,810
simply packages the select
statement it has built

949
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,210
from the table metadata.

950
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,370
Remember, Nikki doesn't say
anything about the query.

951
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,770
The agent builds it for her

952
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,630
and then passes it on to Athena.

953
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,210
Now Athena also, before retrieving this,

954
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,301
it talks to Lake Formation,

955
00:40:05,301 --> 00:40:07,590
and then it applies some filters,

956
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,206
column level filters
and role level filters.

957
00:40:10,206 --> 00:40:12,690
Let's say, if the dataset and the claims

958
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,133
has some personally
identifiable information,

959
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:17,760
and then it has for all the states,

960
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,530
it actually looks at the query and says,

961
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,082
well, you're asking for all
this dataset, every dataset.

962
00:40:22,082 --> 00:40:24,390
Now I'm not gonna allow you to do that.

963
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,670
Lake Formation says, I'm
gonna put a column filter,

964
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,550
I'm gonna rewrite your query
and put a where clause,

965
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,340
because you're only
responsible for Nevada.

966
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,830
I'm gonna only show you
records from Nevada,

967
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,870
and then I'm gonna
actually mask and remove

968
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:39,450
this social security number column.

969
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,250
You shouldn't have access to that.

970
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,540
That happens automatically.

971
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,280
Isn't that pretty amazing?

972
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,310
Now, remember, the user
didn't ask anything about it.

973
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,650
It's simply looking at Lake Formation,

974
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,090
looking at the permission,

975
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,450
and this thing magically
happens under the covers.

976
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,570
And then the regular
thing happens after that,

977
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,770
Athena executes the query,

978
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,776
again, in the context of an investigator,

979
00:41:00,776 --> 00:41:04,447
and then ensures that only she has access,

980
00:41:04,447 --> 00:41:07,050
the other agent has
access to only the portion

981
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,830
of the S3 key space, and to
get this to retrieve this data,

982
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,680
and then it sends back to the user,

983
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,050
and then it the agent creates a report,

984
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,630
and then sends it back to Nikki.

985
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:22,686
This is how governance plays
out for an internal consumer.

986
00:41:22,686 --> 00:41:25,957
Now, let's actually look at
some of the critical pieces

987
00:41:25,957 --> 00:41:29,460
that the agentic data
consumer priorities are.

988
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,460
Like, if you are capturing an
experience to a data consumer,

989
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,720
you should be worried about data quality.

990
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,540
In the loop, if there
is a data quality score

991
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,526
associated with that, Nikki,

992
00:41:41,526 --> 00:41:45,840
the agent on behalf of Nikki
might also put a constraint

993
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,670
saying, expose this data set

994
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,580
only if the data quality rule on a column

995
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,250
is greater than 95%.

996
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,660
I didn't show that in the agentic loop,

997
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,480
but that could be part of
your prompt template as well.

998
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,940
If you want data quality,

999
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,630
you can bake that into your agentic calls.

1000
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,180
And data discoverability is
gonna be pretty important.

1001
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,970
Your agents have to look
up your business catalog,

1002
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:11,250
obtain potentially data products,

1003
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:15,780
and then associate them
with the column metadata

1004
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,830
in your technical catalog,
and retrieve the results.

1005
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,270
Actually, I'm gonna talk
a little more detail

1006
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,700
into how this trusted
identity propagation works.

1007
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,870
Let's hold off for a second,

1008
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:28,296
but you also have to
be, when Nikki logs in,

1009
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:31,380
I simply said like, hey, by the way,

1010
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,280
this agent is going to
actually take on that role.

1011
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,390
How does that really happen?

1012
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,460
I'll actually dig into
that towards the end.

1013
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,660
Let's hold onto that.

1014
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,151
And fine grained access control.

1015
00:42:41,151 --> 00:42:44,100
Users should only have
access to the dataset

1016
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,080
that they need to look at.

1017
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,296
We demonstrated this by
Athena rewriting the query

1018
00:42:49,296 --> 00:42:52,238
looking up Lake Formation.

1019
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:55,580
And then the other piece is
performance is super important.

1020
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,624
For example, if this report
takes forever to come back,

1021
00:42:59,624 --> 00:43:02,210
Nikki has to go get a coffee
or something like that.

1022
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,810
Now maybe what we can do is actually use

1023
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:07,650
a materialized view.

1024
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,950
We've launched Glue Materialized
View last week, I think,

1025
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,450
and then you can create,

1026
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,880
Nikki can potentially create
a materialized view that says,

1027
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,356
hey, create a materialized view for me

1028
00:43:16,356 --> 00:43:18,720
that only has records
from the state of Nevada.

1029
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,896
So you don't have to actually,

1030
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:23,340
Athena doesn't have to
actually scan all of that.

1031
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:27,636
That should be baked in
in consumer priorities.

1032
00:43:27,636 --> 00:43:28,940
So far so good?

1033
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,106
Okay, let's keep going.

1034
00:43:31,106 --> 00:43:33,723
Now, let's look at the
data producer experience.

1035
00:43:33,723 --> 00:43:36,870
Like what is the experience for Jane?

1036
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,840
Jane, as I mentioned, is a data engineer.

1037
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,596
In this example, Jane's task is gonna be

1038
00:43:42,596 --> 00:43:45,390
creating a data product,

1039
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,790
and then Jane is going to
actually get this data set

1040
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,685
from a telematics provider

1041
00:43:49,685 --> 00:43:53,310
and then host this in their environment.

1042
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:58,310
Now, again, here, as Jane
starts talking to the agent,

1043
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,790
the agent, first thing does
is inherits the user's role,

1044
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,530
which is a data engineer.

1045
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:09,530
Then this tool has all the
various tools required for,

1046
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:15,297
like say MSK, MSK has a MCP server

1047
00:44:15,297 --> 00:44:19,260
and tools to provision a cluster

1048
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,327
that's already exposed to this agent.

1049
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,840
And then it simply says like, oh, okay,

1050
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,940
I'm gonna create an MSK cluster,

1051
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,330
and then creates the cluster,
and then actually fires up.

1052
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,005
Then it realizes it needs
to also create a topic.

1053
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:35,400
This is a placeholder for
all the streaming data

1054
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,840
that's coming in.

1055
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,420
Interestingly, the MCP
server there for MSK

1056
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,283
does not have data plane access yet,

1057
00:44:42,283 --> 00:44:44,490
so it's gonna go through,
it's gonna realize,

1058
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,660
hey, I don't see that tool there.

1059
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,950
Maybe I should go through the front end

1060
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,170
and actually create that.

1061
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,490
So the agents are smart enough

1062
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,050
to actually come up with code templates

1063
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,790
that actually could go on with this,

1064
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,800
with some prompts or
automatically realizing,

1065
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,401
hey, I don't know how to
log on and create a topic.

1066
00:44:58,401 --> 00:45:02,314
And then that happens, and
then the thing unfolds.

1067
00:45:02,314 --> 00:45:05,317
The next step is it needs to provision

1068
00:45:05,317 --> 00:45:10,317
a kind of a Glue job,
since the template says

1069
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,650
you want to use Spark, maybe
it uses Spark Streaming

1070
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:16,230
to actually retrieve that data set.

1071
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,480
And then actually the next thing it does

1072
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,590
is it needs to create a table

1073
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,720
where it needs to put that data set.

1074
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,910
Remember the data quality
that we talked about?

1075
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:24,750
This is the place

1076
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,120
the producer has to
think about data quality.

1077
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,470
Now, as part of doing that,

1078
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,270
Jane also kind of writes,

1079
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,280
data quality definition
language is something

1080
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,310
that Amazon invented, and
we open source this as well.

1081
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,954
A lot of our actually tools
automatically use this.

1082
00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:42,780
So what you can describe,

1083
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,510
the data quality definition
language, what you want to do.

1084
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,640
Like for example, if you
have GPS coordinates,

1085
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,040
if you have speech, you can
simply say GPS coordinates

1086
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,870
have to be within this range,

1087
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,300
or speed has to be within this range.

1088
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,860
All that is kind of baked in.

1089
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,188
So as a part of creating this
table in the Glue catalog,

1090
00:45:59,188 --> 00:46:01,680
those quality rules can also be specified.

1091
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,460
When you specify that, Glue
actually runs a batch job

1092
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,915
and actually evaluate this rule,

1093
00:46:06,915 --> 00:46:09,630
and at the column level
says, here's the data quality

1094
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,790
for your specific column, it's at 95%

1095
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:16,530
or 90% based on how many
records are out of sync

1096
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:18,480
with the rule specified there.

1097
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,070
That's automatically built in.

1098
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,378
It is Jane's responsibility
to go out and do that.

1099
00:46:22,378 --> 00:46:25,320
And then obviously the table gets created,

1100
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,153
and that's the demo over.

1101
00:46:26,153 --> 00:46:27,303
In this case, Jane simply said like,

1102
00:46:27,303 --> 00:46:29,662
hey, don't create all this
stuff in my beta environment,

1103
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,710
gimme the infrastructure as code.

1104
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:34,050
I wanna validate this
code and then deploy this

1105
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,210
using my classic CICD pipelines.

1106
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,710
It's probably a good practice.

1107
00:46:38,676 --> 00:46:41,610
Don't have this running in
your production cluster.

1108
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,470
Use a beta cluster if you want,

1109
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,823
or at least create
infrastructure in the code

1110
00:46:44,823 --> 00:46:47,400
when you inspect this and
before you deploy this,

1111
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,913
because otherwise you would
be affecting a running system.

1112
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:56,430
And again, as the agentic loop spins,

1113
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,370
it also realizes it needs to publish.

1114
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,090
Jane is trying to publish a data,

1115
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:05,670
this entire data set in
the business catalog.

1116
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:08,850
It also publishes and enters
in the business catalog

1117
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,920
for consumers to consume this.

1118
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,370
And again, a data engineer has the ability

1119
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,170
to publish to the business catalog.

1120
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,080
That is the role that you already created.

1121
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,813
And finally, it also associates,

1122
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:25,750
it also says, let me actually
create Lake Formation

1123
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,000
fine grained access control rules,

1124
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
only these consumers can
access this data set,

1125
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:37,380
that's actually baked in Lake Formation.

1126
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,143
So all of this magic
happens behind the covers.

1127
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,310
So this is a data producer experience

1128
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:45,750
in the world of agents.

1129
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,280
So let's look at the
priorities of the data producer

1130
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,790
in the world of agents.

1131
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:54,870
You know, we talked about
creating infrastructure,

1132
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:55,980
the code, and verifying it.

1133
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,900
The accuracy is still your job.

1134
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,060
The agent is gonna come up with some code.

1135
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,790
You want to ensure that
you have test scripts

1136
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:04,890
and others to ensure that
this is actually doing

1137
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:06,000
what you intend it to do.

1138
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,100
That is the responsibility
of the producer.

1139
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,500
And it's our responsibility,
it doesn't go away.

1140
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,610
And data quality rules,

1141
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:14,250
we saw how data quality definition rules

1142
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,930
are associated with this data set.

1143
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,780
That's a data producer's responsibility.

1144
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,506
And also putting the
information a data catalog.

1145
00:48:21,506 --> 00:48:24,000
What does these columns mean?

1146
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,520
What are the various bounds
and how should they be used?

1147
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,390
All of that should be part
of your business catalog.

1148
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:31,953
And then auditing.

1149
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,966
Sometimes you figure out
why this happened, though.

1150
00:48:36,966 --> 00:48:39,930
So making sure that the audit is enabled,

1151
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,090
so all of these accesses to Lake Formation

1152
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,200
are already logged.

1153
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,060
It can show up as a cloud trail.

1154
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:48,930
That's a responsibility
of the data producer.

1155
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:49,863
So far so good?

1156
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,336
You know, I skipped one detail

1157
00:48:52,336 --> 00:48:53,790
as I was telling you, though.

1158
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:58,790
I said, "By the way, the
agent inherits the role

1159
00:48:59,426 --> 00:49:02,697
of the user coming in."

1160
00:49:02,697 --> 00:49:04,953
Like, how does that really happen?

1161
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:08,580
You only need a couple
of parameters, AWS IAM

1162
00:49:10,056 --> 00:49:13,470
as well as the OpenID Connect and OAuth2.

1163
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,330
Rather than delving into
the details of this,

1164
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,440
I'm gonna actually show you

1165
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,390
how this really works under the covers.

1166
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:23,430
Let's say you have a user,
the user first logs in

1167
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,670
through their portal,
through the agent portal.

1168
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:31,110
What happens at that point is,
the user gets authenticated

1169
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,240
with the federated identity provider.

1170
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,360
Now for Enterprise
Identity, it could be Okta.

1171
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,550
Basically the user says,
hey, here's my user ID,

1172
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:42,900
here's my login, here is your
MFA token that's in my device.

1173
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,070
It plugs that in.

1174
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,050
What that does is it sends out this thing

1175
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,613
called a JWT token.

1176
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,950
I didn't quite understand what this is.

1177
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:52,350
I was trying to understand
what this is in detail.

1178
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:54,120
Here's where, as data practitioners,

1179
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,500
we have to understand the primitives

1180
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,140
of what these things mean.

1181
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,810
The easiest way to imagine
this is your license,

1182
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:01,863
driver's license.

1183
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,970
We're talking about insurance,
easy to use driver's license.

1184
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:07,320
In your driver's license,
you have your name,

1185
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,240
you have your picture,
you have your signature,

1186
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,190
and the age details, et cetera.

1187
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,131
That's your ID.

1188
00:50:12,131 --> 00:50:14,880
And you give that ID to
someone else they know,

1189
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,590
they look at this thing and
they look at your picture

1190
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:18,960
and says, yeah, I think that's the person.

1191
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,120
And it also has this entitlements.

1192
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,950
Which is what class of car,

1193
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,410
I live in the state of Washington,

1194
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:27,570
default is a driver C class license.

1195
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:29,632
It doesn't say that,
but that's the default.

1196
00:50:29,632 --> 00:50:33,090
And it also has a restriction
for me called restriction B,

1197
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:35,552
which means, in the US it
means I have to wear glasses

1198
00:50:35,552 --> 00:50:37,650
or contact lenses to drive my car.

1199
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,420
That's the entitlements.

1200
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,290
So what the JWT token
is, it's the access token

1201
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,212
and the permission token.

1202
00:50:44,212 --> 00:50:46,032
So that's what this thing is like.

1203
00:50:46,032 --> 00:50:48,131
You send the token to the agent,

1204
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:50,956
that token has to be passed along.

1205
00:50:50,956 --> 00:50:52,863
There are a couple of use cases here.

1206
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,670
One, where the identity
provider doesn't change

1207
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:57,690
in your organization.

1208
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,280
That is Nikki's use case.

1209
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,220
Nikki runs a query

1210
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,780
and then that gets passed
onto the tool, et cetera.

1211
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,120
At each stage it checks
with the identity provider

1212
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,710
if need be, and then passes
faithfully the token along,

1213
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,530
the identity token and the
access token along to the APIs.

1214
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,974
And beyond the APIs, it's the same path.

1215
00:51:15,974 --> 00:51:18,605
Those credentials may be exchanged

1216
00:51:18,605 --> 00:51:21,090
with their temporary AWS credentials.

1217
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:23,660
You know, single sign on, and
then it talks to the database,

1218
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,061
or it could be using a user ID, password,

1219
00:51:26,061 --> 00:51:30,363
and then you get the details
from your secure store.

1220
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:33,073
Then there's another path sometimes.

1221
00:51:33,073 --> 00:51:37,800
Remember, in the case of Jane,

1222
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,660
Jane is actually getting a data set

1223
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,250
from a telematics provider.

1224
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,080
The telematics provider might use

1225
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,820
a different identity provider.

1226
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,860
In that case, what happens is that,

1227
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,279
you need to exchange your credentials.

1228
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:51,177
Like you're showing your driver's license,

1229
00:51:51,177 --> 00:51:53,280
and if you're gonna go to another country,

1230
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,810
they don't take US driver's license.

1231
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:55,987
You gotta go to AAA and say,

1232
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:59,220
"Can you gimme an international
driver's license?"

1233
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,810
What they take is they look at your ID

1234
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:02,730
and then actually they
give you new credentials.

1235
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:03,727
They print this paper and say,

1236
00:52:03,727 --> 00:52:05,220
"This is your international
driver's license."

1237
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,290
Then if you go to another
country, you show them,

1238
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,610
and they let you rent the car.

1239
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:09,540
That's really what happens.

1240
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,100
The Bedrock identity allows
you to actually do that

1241
00:52:13,327 --> 00:52:14,500
on your behalf.

1242
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,620
It's like accessing a
token winding machine.

1243
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,660
It takes that and gives you other tokens

1244
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,886
that you can use in your other systems.

1245
00:52:21,886 --> 00:52:25,500
So that thing is what happens,
as you can just see here.

1246
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,659
Then you send those tokens
faithfully to your tools,

1247
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:31,410
and then that gets
propagated to the API call

1248
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:32,580
that you're making,

1249
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:36,240
and at that point those
credentials could get transformed

1250
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,180
into IAM credentials that can be used

1251
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,320
to access your data store.

1252
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,280
Or in this case whatever
credentials that's required

1253
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,042
to access this third party telematics,

1254
00:52:46,042 --> 00:52:47,700
telematics use case.

1255
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,960
So, this thing is super important.

1256
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,840
As data practitioners
and AI practitioners,

1257
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,529
we really have to delve into,

1258
00:52:52,529 --> 00:52:57,179
how do we tell our agent
to act on our behalf,

1259
00:52:57,179 --> 00:52:58,560
and it's super important,

1260
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,799
otherwise it can go do kind
of unpredictable things.

1261
00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:03,240
Now putting it all together.

1262
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,770
This is the final set of slides.

1263
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:05,610
Are you ready?

1264
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:07,209
Five minutes, all right?

1265
00:53:07,209 --> 00:53:09,919
This is the most exciting part for me.

1266
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:12,090
So I'm gonna try to put all this

1267
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,160
in a single reference architecture

1268
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,121
that you can probably take a look at.

1269
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:17,448
Here we go, let's go.

1270
00:53:17,448 --> 00:53:19,170
This is external user.

1271
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,870
This is Terry coming in
and asking a question.

1272
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:23,283
I wanna buy car insurance.

1273
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,800
So you're building an agentic app.

1274
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,620
Maybe you're using Strands,
maybe you're using LangChain,

1275
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,600
maybe you're using other frameworks.

1276
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,660
Now, we think that
Amazon Bedrock Agent Code

1277
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,920
is the best place to run this,

1278
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,170
because it gives you a runtime,

1279
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:42,404
which is pretty secure, containerized.

1280
00:53:42,404 --> 00:53:46,770
So that's just owned by that execution.

1281
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,090
Tim talked about memory,

1282
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:49,710
short term memory and long term memory,

1283
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,450
those constructs are there.

1284
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,032
We talked about the Gateway.

1285
00:53:53,032 --> 00:53:55,890
Like if you have APIs, you
can quickly expose them

1286
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,860
as tools by using Gateway.

1287
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,390
We talked about identity,

1288
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:04,140
this thing where you show your ID to AAA

1289
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,810
and get that other ID, all of that magic

1290
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:10,530
can be actually simplified
by your AgentCore identity.

1291
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,790
That's why we feel this is,

1292
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,400
I haven't discussed a
few other things there,

1293
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,175
AgentCore is the best place to run this.

1294
00:54:16,175 --> 00:54:19,650
Now, this doesn't have to be
for your external customers.

1295
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:22,650
All your internal teams are
going to, as we move forward,

1296
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:25,527
are gonna have agents that
they potentially build,

1297
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:30,450
or this may be like IDs,
like KIRO or other IDs,

1298
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,190
agent IDs that you can prompt

1299
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:34,260
and use that for internal
deployments as well,

1300
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,467
as long as you can hook
up all your tools to this.

1301
00:54:36,467 --> 00:54:38,645
This is the way this looks.

1302
00:54:38,645 --> 00:54:41,520
Remember Amazon Bedrock LLMs,

1303
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,130
Amazon Bedrock has a choice of LLM,

1304
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:48,177
all the way from Nova, to Anthropic, to,

1305
00:54:48,177 --> 00:54:51,488
every year we add a few more LLMs,

1306
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,310
because you can use the right LLM

1307
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:54,997
for your reasoning tasks.

1308
00:54:54,997 --> 00:54:57,990
So we give you a choice of LLMs.

1309
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:00,333
And then remember Bedrock knowledge bases.

1310
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:05,340
You can basically, Bedrock
can actually take your string

1311
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,530
and then actually look up, on your behalf,

1312
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:09,900
the knowledge base and retrieve
other pieces of information.

1313
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,000
Like we have a host of functionality there

1314
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,450
in terms of Postgres, if
you have a Postgres engine,

1315
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,714
if you're doing a SQL, if
you're familiar with that,

1316
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:18,600
if you wanna use the engine,

1317
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,060
you can use the Vector
capability in Postgres,

1318
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,230
through PG Vector.

1319
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:25,080
OpenSearch is fantastic
to combine vector searches

1320
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,258
along with the classic searches.

1321
00:55:27,258 --> 00:55:29,220
So we have a host of tools there.

1322
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,630
If you're doing Graph
Rag, you can use Neptune

1323
00:55:32,603 --> 00:55:33,600
as your vector store,

1324
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,031
where you can do both the graph reversals

1325
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:39,916
as well as vector searches together.

1326
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:42,750
We also have S3 vectors that we added.

1327
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,450
Milan yesterday talked about that.

1328
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,520
And then you can use that,

1329
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,958
and then you can also
expose them as MCP tools.

1330
00:55:49,958 --> 00:55:52,560
Like we talked about this
API where you give the string

1331
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,780
and it it fetches a related
piece of information.

1332
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,540
If you have an MCP server,
you can build an MCP

1333
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:01,080
for this server for that and
expose that as a tool as well.

1334
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,340
Now this is sort of the front end.

1335
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:06,900
Now Tim talked about
packaging this as APIs.

1336
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,050
Remember the special purpose
path that Tim talked about?

1337
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,510
You creating canned queries or APIs?

1338
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:15,450
Now, those things, if you
expose them as MCP tools,

1339
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:19,860
both your customer facing
agents and your internal agents

1340
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,590
can actually talk to
those backend engines.

1341
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,840
Now we have a lot of capability,

1342
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,440
starting from Aurora, to
DynamoDB, to ElastiCache,

1343
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,826
to Redshift, Athena, and
the list keeps on growing.

1344
00:56:30,826 --> 00:56:32,460
Based on what tool you want,

1345
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,490
what engine runs it the
best, you can expose your API

1346
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,920
or general purpose query via this tool.

1347
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,293
Now what happens to your backend?

1348
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:41,963
There we go.

1349
00:56:41,963 --> 00:56:43,486
That's the data processing engine.

1350
00:56:43,486 --> 00:56:48,486
This is where Jane goes and
provisions a Kafka topic

1351
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:53,340
and then actually runs a Glue job.

1352
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,593
That whole thing can be
orchestrated by tools.

1353
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:59,580
With that, this is the picture

1354
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,890
I've been very intensely drawing.

1355
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,930
Hopefully this makes sense.

1356
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:06,990
So this is, I feel like
a reference architecture,

1357
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,550
at least for me, until I keep changing it,

1358
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,020
we'll keep on tweaking this.

1359
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,180
Any feedback on this is welcome.

1360
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,580
On the left side is the agent.

1361
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,270
On the right side is the data.

1362
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,670
The MCP is this big USB, USB-C thing

1363
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,770
that connects the data and AI together,

1364
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:25,920
and this is how the magic happens, folks.

1365
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,064
And with that, I wanna leave
you with a call for action.

1366
00:57:29,064 --> 00:57:32,939
To me, I think the special purpose paths

1367
00:57:32,939 --> 00:57:35,160
are something that you have to build.

1368
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,607
I would start building data APIs.

1369
00:57:37,607 --> 00:57:40,740
As Tim pointed out, these
are very easy to build.

1370
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,363
It gives you a secure path,

1371
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:44,970
but you can also build data products

1372
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,170
and give you a general purpose path.

1373
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,628
That's a little more risky.

1374
00:57:47,628 --> 00:57:49,560
So you can use both,

1375
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,900
but I would urge you to build APIs,

1376
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:55,650
expose them as MCP tools
via the MCP protocol.

1377
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,610
As we talked about data governance,

1378
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:01,440
end-to-end security are the top priority.

1379
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,150
You should be thinking about them day one,

1380
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,580
not after the fact when your
agent vents out the data

1381
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,260
that it should not vent out.

1382
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:11,250
And finally, we are working very hard

1383
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,040
to simplify this experience for you

1384
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,960
so you can focus on your business

1385
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,850
and leave the other muck to us.

1386
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:20,340
So with that, I wanna end the session.

1387
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,173
Thank you very much.

1388
00:58:21,173 --> 00:58:22,740
I hope this was meaningful.

1389
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,953
