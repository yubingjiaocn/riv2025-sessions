1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
- Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,570
Welcome, this is SEC316.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,850
I am Rick Anthony,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,630
I'm a senior manager for
the Amazon inspection team.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,450
I'm here with Anthony and Nirali.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,430
They'll be speaking to you later.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,920
And we're gonna talk to
you about Amazon Inspector

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,923
and strategies for
vulnerability management.

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,150
So quick agenda for this morning,

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,430
we're gonna talk about
some of the challenges

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,130
of traditional vulnerability management.

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,040
We're gonna talk about
what is Amazon Inspector,

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,460
how does it work, what are
some of the key capabilities,

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,470
show you a couple of
demos, and talk to you

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,083
about one of our newer
features, code security.

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,150
So first, challenges with traditional

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,620
vulnerability management.

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,630
A lot of traditional solutions

19
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,910
haven't been built for the cloud.

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,190
And one of the superpowers of the cloud

21
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,110
is that it's elastic.

22
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,750
Resources can be scaled up,

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,360
they can be scaled down
to meet your needs.

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,060
And there's a lot of
different types of compute

25
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,530
that you can use as a customer.

26
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,120
You can use virtual machines,

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,830
you can use containers,

28
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,297
you can use serverless,

29
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:14,640
and you want to be able
to cover all of those

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,230
with your solution.

31
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,090
And so some of the environments

32
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,800
that your developers are gonna create

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,810
can be really complex

34
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,460
and that really also leads
into some resource constraints.

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,800
How do you know what
resources are out there

36
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,650
and running if they're
going to be that dynamic?

37
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,390
Some of the traditional solutions

38
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,230
also ask you to license
each of your resources.

39
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,280
Well, how do you do that

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,690
when all of your resources

41
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,270
are going up and down together?

42
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,930
How are you also ensuring
that you're seeing all of them

43
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,020
if you're only scanning periodically?

44
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,490
Once you do scan,

45
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,160
you end up with a lot of findings.

46
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,140
And if you scan on Monday,

47
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,270
you generate a thousand findings.

48
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,370
You scan again on Tuesday,

49
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,080
you have another thousand.

50
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,520
How do you deal with all those?

51
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,300
How do you prioritize the
findings that you're getting?

52
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,190
You could use some simple methods.

53
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,050
You could look at the severity,

54
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,730
start with the criticals,

55
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,200
but more and more,

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,450
there are a lot of critical
vulnerabilities out there

57
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,390
and they may not be the
most important ones for you

58
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,413
to remediate based off
of your environment.

59
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,330
So this is where Amazon
Inspector comes in.

60
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,870
We launched Amazon Inspector
a couple of years ago,

61
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,030
and we created Amazon Inspector

62
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,360
to be an automated
vulnerability management service

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,570
that continually monitors your workloads

64
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,490
for software vulnerabilities

65
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,340
and unintended network exposures.

66
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,140
And you can see that we've highlighted

67
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,620
two really key features
of Inspector right here.

68
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,240
One is automated.

69
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,300
And what this means is that
once you enable Inspector

70
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,970
and configure it, it does
all the work for you.

71
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,040
You don't have to manage it.

72
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,020
You don't have to tell it what to do.

73
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,950
Number two, it continually
scans your resources.

74
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,140
So in that dynamic cloud environment,

75
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,750
as resources come up,

76
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,580
Inspector sees them, it scans them,

77
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,187
and as resources goes
down, Amazon sees that

78
00:03:15,187 --> 00:03:17,937
and will automatically
close findings for you.

79
00:03:17,937 --> 00:03:20,610
You don't have to manage
the service for you,

80
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,750
it does it.

81
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,493
Our goal is for you to
worry about remediation

82
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:26,490
and taking action,

83
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,870
and that's it.

84
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,180
So when we launched Amazon Inspector,

85
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,560
we launched it with support

86
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,460
for virtual machines through Amazon EC2,

87
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,730
container images through Amazon ECR,

88
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,270
and then we added support
for serverless functions

89
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,010
through AWS Lambda.

90
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,780
And then most recently this year,

91
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,260
we also support manage code repositories

92
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,610
through our interactions

93
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,073
and interfaces to GitHub and GitLab.

94
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,360
So really a quick overview
of Amazon Inspector.

95
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,700
When we talk about Amazon Inspector

96
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,320
and how you use it,

97
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,560
we really talk about
four different phases.

98
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,450
Phase one is enablement.

99
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,010
And this is, as a customer,

100
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,923
you going in and turning
Amazon Inspector on

101
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:16,470
either for your account

102
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,080
or for your entire organization.

103
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,520
You can do both.

104
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,620
Second, once you do that,

105
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,820
Amazon Inspector will start
looking at your environment.

106
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,340
It will discover all your resources

107
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,110
and scan those resources

108
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,340
to get a initial set of findings

109
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,320
so that you know where you are from

110
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,090
in terms of your exposures

111
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,700
and then it'll start monitoring.

112
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,640
So as changes take place,

113
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,700
Amazon Inspector follows suit.

114
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,700
Third phase is looking at your findings.

115
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,820
Inspector will contextualize your findings

116
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,300
so that you can prioritize
what's important.

117
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,463
Severity is not the only critical thing.

118
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:02,370
Some of your resources are exposed

119
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,410
to the internet, some of them are not.

120
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,360
Some of them have vulnerabilities

121
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,440
that can be exploited,

122
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,610
some of them don't.

123
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,760
Inspector takes a lot of different pieces

124
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,270
of information together to
give you a prioritization score

125
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,430
that you can use to take action.

126
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,550
And taking action is our fourth phase

127
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,500
where once you have your findings,

128
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,240
where do you want to do your work?

129
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,040
You can do your work in Inspector,

130
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,330
you can do it in Security Hub.

131
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,060
We give you lots of different options.

132
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,913
We're gonna dig into each
one of these quickly.

133
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,368
So number one, like I said,

134
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:39,930
when you turn on Amazon Inspector,

135
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,300
you can enable it for your account

136
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,350
or you can enable it for
your entire organization.

137
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,830
We see most of our customers
turning on Inspector

138
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,620
for their entire organization.

139
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,410
What they do is they use
their management account

140
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,860
to assign a delegated administrator.

141
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,620
And from that delegated
administrator account,

142
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,060
they can tell Amazon
Inspector what to scan

143
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,770
and based on what settings.

144
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,660
And we also provide you a way

145
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,420
of automatically enabling Inspector

146
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,410
for all new accounts added
to your organization.

147
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,260
And the power of that is
once you get it set up,

148
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,320
if you say turn it on
for all new accounts,

149
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,470
you no longer have to worry
about having gaps in coverage.

150
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,070
Inspector will enable
itself automatically.

151
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,150
Secondly, that delegated
administrator account,

152
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,200
not only does it configure
your entire organization,

153
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,250
it also has visibility into
your entire organization.

154
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,269
So as a user within the
delegated administrator account,

155
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:46,890
you have a centralized view

156
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,770
of all your findings
regardless of the account.

157
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,970
As a customer,

158
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,090
you can manage all your
findings for your organization

159
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,330
from that one view while
your individual accounts

160
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,320
still have visibility
into their own findings.

161
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,800
So if you cut a ticket to
one of your teams saying,

162
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,750
hey, you have this vulnerability,

163
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,890
they can go in Inspector,

164
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,200
they'll see the exact same details

165
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,828
that the delegated administrator sees.

166
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:15,143
We launched with this capability

167
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,000
when Inspector launched
a couple years ago,

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,670
and we also upgraded that capability

169
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,670
to do an organization
configuration enablement

170
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,280
through support for organization policies

171
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,730
that just launched this year.

172
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,580
Phase two is the discover,
scan and monitor phase.

173
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,300
And this is where Amazon
Inspector, when you turn it on,

174
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,120
it sees all of your resources.

175
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,110
So if you ever want to know
what are your accounts running,

176
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,360
what are the resources,
what do they look like,

177
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,130
Amazon Inspector knows.

178
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,710
It sees these resources as they launch,

179
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,511
it sees these resources as they terminate

180
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,960
and it updates accordingly.

181
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,800
Like I said before, we
support EC2 instances,

182
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,760
container images and ECR, Lambda functions

183
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,760
and now manage code repositories.

184
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,790
Inspector works in near real time.

185
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,620
So that as changes occur,

186
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,653
you get those findings right away.

187
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,610
Amazon Inspector is also intelligent.

188
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,710
We talked about one of the challenges

189
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,320
of traditional vulnerability management

190
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,020
where you, as a customer, have to decide

191
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,760
when you're going to scan.

192
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,830
You don't know if you're
catching everything.

193
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,670
Here, Inspector monitors your environment

194
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,070
and scans when it needs to scan.

195
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,200
If a new resource is launched,

196
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,270
Amazon Inspector scans it.

197
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,780
If you install a new software
package on a resource,

198
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,820
Amazon Inspector scans it.

199
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,810
If you patch, Amazon Inspector
sees that patch, rescans

200
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,800
and the findings for
vulnerability are now remediated,

201
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,750
it will close those findings.

202
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,571
If there's a new CVE published,
Amazon Inspector knows

203
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:07,140
which of your resources have that package

204
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,407
and will automatically re-scan.

205
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:11,170
So that at any point in time,

206
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,250
you can go to Amazon Inspector know

207
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,550
what is your security posture
at that moment in time.

208
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,700
You don't have to do
any work to get there.

209
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,180
And then phase three is contextualization

210
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,830
of those findings.

211
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,540
Amazon Inspector supports

212
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,720
what we call the Amazon Inspector Score,

213
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,010
and this tries to answer

214
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,710
a whole bunch of questions that you have.

215
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,340
One question may be: what is
the most severe vulnerability

216
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,980
that I need to remediate?

217
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,580
Is it for a resource that's exposed?

218
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,000
Does that vulnerability have a exploit?

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,460
Is that exploit common in a wild?

220
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,830
Amazon uses all that information

221
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,180
in order to score up or score
down your vulnerabilities.

222
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,150
So that when you look at
Amazon Inspector's score,

223
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,670
you're truly looking at
the most important things

224
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,283
for you to fix within your environment.

225
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,560
We do this using a bunch of advanced

226
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,260
vulnerability intelligence information

227
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,370
that we partner with
Recorded Future to gather.

228
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,340
So as a security professional,

229
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,470
you can go in and see,

230
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,113
okay, this vulnerability,

231
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:27,840
how is it mapped to MITRE ATT&CK TTPs?

232
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,040
Is there a known CISA exploit?

233
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,820
Is it there a malware kit for it?

234
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,030
Is this commonly exploited in the wild

235
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,860
so that you can double check our work

236
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,450
and make your own decisions as well

237
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,703
as to what you wanna remediate first?

238
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,590
We package all of our
vulnerability information

239
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,610
into a format

240
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,610
where you can search it for yourself.

241
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,359
You can look at CVEs, you can know,

242
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:56,370
okay, does Inspector know about the CVE?

243
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,350
What are the details?

244
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,430
Is it a high?

245
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,930
Is it a low?

246
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,890
I can check to see what type
of resources it impacts.

247
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,350
And I can also immediately know

248
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,890
which of my resources
are impacted by this.

249
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,210
A couple of years ago,

250
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,060
we did a talk very similar to this talk

251
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,190
where we had a customer join us

252
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,400
from Volkswagen Financial Services.

253
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,910
They are a user of Inspector

254
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,790
and the speaker, Crispin talked about

255
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,160
having a call from his boss

256
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,010
on a Monday morning as
he was commuting to work.

257
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,050
His boss said, "Hey, I just read about

258
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,890
this brand new Windows vulnerability.

259
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,150
Looks pretty severe.

260
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,010
Are we impacted?"

261
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,920
And so Crispin said that
sitting at his desk,

262
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,140
he was able to go into Inspector,

263
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,150
type the number of the CVE,

264
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,280
see that Inspector supported it.

265
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,750
And because Inspector had
already all of his resources,

266
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,600
'cause this is done
dynamically in near real time,

267
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,110
he was able to identify every account

268
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,720
and every resource that had an impact

269
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,460
and was able to email a
note out to all those owners

270
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,850
to do a remediation within 14 minutes

271
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,310
because all the information was fresh

272
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,140
and it was at his fingertips.

273
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,690
That's the power of near real time

274
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,763
and always knowing what your posture is.

275
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,840
One of the new pieces of information

276
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,350
that Inspector reports on,
which we're really proud of

277
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,300
and we're excited to talk about,

278
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,050
is near real time malicious
package detection.

279
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,190
So through a partnership with the OpenSSF,

280
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,300
we now pull in malicious
package information

281
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,180
and we use that in order to determine

282
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,030
do you have packages that are malicious?

283
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,220
Are these going to cause some unknown

284
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,950
or unwanted behavior within your account?

285
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,093
Not only are we using the
information from OpenSSF,

286
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,201
we are con contributing as well.

287
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:03,300
In fact, right now we are one
of the largest contributors.

288
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Earlier this year, we started
scanning NPM registries

289
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,750
and through a set of our own
specialized detection rules

290
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,380
that are a combination of
static/dynamic AI rules,

291
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,210
we are able in near real time
to detect malicious packages.

292
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,460
We post this to OpenSSF,

293
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,580
they assign a malware ID.

294
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,770
We put this into Inspector immediately

295
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,500
and we begin reporting on this

296
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,990
within your own environments.

297
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,350
We published a blog a couple of weeks ago

298
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,390
where using these techniques,

299
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:43,050
we found one of the largest campaigns

300
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:48,050
to do tokenization farming
what we think ever occurred.

301
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:52,740
So we detected over
150,000 malicious packages

302
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,390
in NPM registries.

303
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,770
It's a great blog article.

304
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,039
I encourage you to go out and read it.

305
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,270
We're really excited about this program

306
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,190
and this is something
that we're going to expand

307
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,263
into other forms as registries.

308
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,530
So really, let me spend a couple minutes

309
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,553
to give you a quick demo
of how this would work.

310
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,290
All right, so one of
our security researchers

311
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,200
put together a docker file

312
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,160
where he installed a
known malicious package.

313
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,250
It's that one called anhackle/test.

314
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,410
And as a note, please don't repeat this,

315
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,383
this is actually a real malicious package.

316
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,040
He built the docker file.

317
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,400
He pushed it into the ECR registry.

318
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,660
ECR is one of the formats
that Inspector supports.

319
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,520
Here you can see within this account

320
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,350
we have Amazon Inspector running.

321
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,860
We have scanning for ECR enabled.

322
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,210
This is the repository
where the file was pushed.

323
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,790
And here you can see we've detected

324
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,050
that malware package
automatically in near real time.

325
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,950
Obviously, we've accelerated
this for today's demo,

326
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,340
but along with the information
for this malware finding,

327
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,250
you can see we've detected
other CVEs as well.

328
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,860
And as a customer there's a
lot of different information

329
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,210
we provide you.

330
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,820
So you can either feed
it into other systems

331
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,530
or just go in and look at it yourself.

332
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,640
Here you can see this has
an Inspector score of 9.8.

333
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,770
It's sourced from OSSF.

334
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,657
This is something we detected
the version of the package

335
00:15:30,657 --> 00:15:34,091
and where this package lives.

336
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:37,860
And if you want to look
up more information,

337
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,870
we give you a reference so you can go back

338
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,667
and see that this was
truly a malicious package

339
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,470
published by OSSF.

340
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,450
And here this is credited

341
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,553
to Amazon Inspector as the finding.

342
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,750
Okay, and then finally our fourth phase

343
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,980
of using Amazon Inspector is
taking action with findings.

344
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,220
So within Amazon Inspector,

345
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,230
using that delegated
administrator account,

346
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,560
you see the findings for
your entire organization.

347
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,000
You can operate directly
within Amazon Inspector.

348
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,666
You could send your
findings into Security Hub

349
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,500
as another one of our tools

350
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,740
to help you focus on
your remediation efforts.

351
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,870
But you have other options as well.

352
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,810
We send our findings out to EventBridge

353
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,390
so you can hook those
up into other systems

354
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,173
using Lambda functions.

355
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:35,850
You can have partner applications
that pull into this data

356
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,290
or you can look at it in some
of our other services as well.

357
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,790
As an example, Amazon ECR
also will show findings

358
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,773
for your container images.

359
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,403
And then finally,

360
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:51,720
as a last way of looking at your data

361
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,020
and taking action is
software bill of materials.

362
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,110
So Amazon Inspector, at any point in time,

363
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,730
you can say to Inspector,

364
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,480
please export SBOM for my environment.

365
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,540
And you can choose your
account, your organization,

366
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,450
you can filter the data any way you want.

367
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,185
We support SBOM in CycloneDx format.

368
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:15,570
We support it in SPDX format.

369
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,390
And once you have that data,

370
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,450
there's all different ways
you can slice and dice it.

371
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,060
You could send it into Amazon Athena

372
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,370
to do different types of queries

373
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,650
or you could send it into QuickSight.

374
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,420
Lots of different ways.

375
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,760
That SBOM data is free of charge

376
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,810
and you can do whatever you want with it.

377
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,490
All right, I'm gonna hand off to Anthony

378
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,510
and he's gonna talk about

379
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,940
some of the other capabilities
of Amazon Inspector.

380
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,773
Thank you.

381
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:47,100
- Thank you, Rick.

382
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,450
Can everyone hear me okay?

383
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,890
Great.

384
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,723
My name is Anthony.

385
00:17:50,723 --> 00:17:52,627
I'm a product manager in Inspector.

386
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:54,420
I work closely with Rick and Nirali.

387
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,790
And my purpose of this section

388
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,530
is to give you an overview of actually

389
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,910
how do you, as a customer,

390
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,463
go about using Inspector as a product

391
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:04,800
to meet those effective
vulnerability management use cases

392
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,060
that Rick talked about.

393
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,070
And hopefully, as an
objective of this section

394
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,290
of the presentation, you
have a deeper understanding

395
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,900
of actually how to use Inspector
to go start this journey

396
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,609
of setting up Inspector and
working through these problems.

397
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:17,820
A quick pull of hands,

398
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,320
how many of you're already
using Amazon Inspector?

399
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,103
Okay, great.

400
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:23,850
So quite a few people there to learn about

401
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,850
how to set this up and use this product.

402
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,290
So before I get going,

403
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,780
I just wanted to touch
on sort of where we are

404
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,200
in the overall like
life cycle of developing

405
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,033
and launching products

406
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:36,567
and managing software vulnerabilities.

407
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:38,640
And the section that
I'm gonna focus on here

408
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,680
is really monitor and respond

409
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,350
as well as some components
of build and test.

410
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,185
So the core capabilities of
Inspectors really monitoring

411
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:48,540
and providing you that visibility,

412
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,125
near time visibility on those
resources and those findings

413
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,330
so that you have an accurate understanding

414
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,166
of your security posture.

415
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,320
But as a customer, what
you really wanna do

416
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,790
is start shifting left,

417
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,320
but I'm gonna focus here a little bit more

418
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,000
on what we do today to help you

419
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,773
in this monitor and respond area.

420
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,830
This slide is gonna be sort of our map,

421
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,020
which is just gonna kind of help guide

422
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,030
all the capabilities I'm
gonna talk to you about

423
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,440
and it's gonna help just orient you

424
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,350
as we go section by
section on each of these.

425
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,200
So as a metal model,
there's really two different

426
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,731
sort of groups of capabilities

427
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,380
as I like to think of them.

428
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,360
For Inspector, there's
continuous monitoring,

429
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,203
which is providing that
real time visibility

430
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:31,320
into those resources.

431
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,980
And that covers EC2 Lambda and ECR images.

432
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,250
And then we have some
additional utility capabilities,

433
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,520
I call 'em ad hoc, which
include managing SBOM,

434
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,569
some of that is what Rick talked about,

435
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:45,630
CIS benchmark scanning.

436
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,190
And then we also have some other tools

437
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,803
that help you shift left
in build and deploy.

438
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,280
Before I get started with that,

439
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,230
I wanted to just take a second to talk

440
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,440
and underline the importance
of continuous scanning.

441
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,870
So the purpose of continuous scanning

442
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,380
is that essentially as the days go by

443
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,480
and you're doing your day job,

444
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,910
the goalposts are always
moving in security.

445
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,740
So I have this very simple illustration

446
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,390
of just why that's important

447
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,790
in terms of why scanning today, tomorrow,

448
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,710
and two days from now

449
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,390
helps you understand, as a customer,

450
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,340
when you need to take action or not.

451
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,900
So we can imagine a scenario

452
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,920
where on the 1st of January,
you have 10 packages

453
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,990
that Inspector is detecting,

454
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,830
Inspector is not finding any
packages associated with a CVE

455
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,320
and therefore it's not
cutting any findings.

456
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,140
We can imagine 10 days
later on January 10th,

457
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,170
there is a new CVE
published for a package.

458
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,720
But that package is not in
something like let's say

459
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,780
your ECR container image.

460
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,260
But on the 15th of there's
a new CVE published

461
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,900
and we actually do observe as we scan

462
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,350
that that package is associated
with a vulnerability.

463
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,230
And at that moment, we're
gonna cut a finding to you

464
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,600
and you're gonna have a
finding which you can choose

465
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,530
to react to or not react to
depending on your risk appetite.

466
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,360
So this is really important

467
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,198
just to illustrate the fact
that it's an ongoing job

468
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:11,820
that you have to understand
your security posture

469
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,400
and the information that
Inspector provides you

470
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,290
is informing what you, as a customer,

471
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,940
need to do to take action
to secure your environment.

472
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,715
And I'm gonna go ahead
and jump to EC2 scanning.

473
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,820
So I'll go EC2 scanning
Lambda, ECR image scanning

474
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,870
and then I'll touch ad hoc functionality.

475
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,050
So there's a few key points

476
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,600
to understand about Amazon EC2 scanning.

477
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,650
An EC2 instance is
obviously a virtual machine

478
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,540
and one of the key decisions

479
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,190
that you have to make as a customer,

480
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,050
and hopefully you'll
be making this decision

481
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,182
as that Inspector delegated administrator

482
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,980
across your entire organization,

483
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,350
is what kind of scanning mode

484
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,320
do you want to implement
across your environment?

485
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,640
So there's two different modes

486
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,570
that you, as a customer,
have the choice to choose.

487
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,430
You have an agent based approach

488
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,753
which uses the AWS systems
manager agent, the SSM agent.

489
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:10,622
We like to use the term to
describe it as ubiquitous

490
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,080
and it's meant to be as easy as possible

491
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,300
to install across your fleet.

492
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,262
When the SSM agent is installed

493
00:22:17,262 --> 00:22:20,970
and operating correctly on an EC2 instance

494
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,280
and you enable EC2 scanning,

495
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,530
Inspector will use the SSM agent

496
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,200
and a small piece of
technology that we have

497
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,590
to go actually execute
those scans, do the work,

498
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,090
and then cut the findings to you

499
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,914
via the Inspector service.

500
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:38,031
There are some capabilities
within systems manager

501
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:39,690
that you can also leverage

502
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,817
to have a full view across
your entire AWS organization

503
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:46,350
for every single EC2 instance
that's gonna tell you

504
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,110
whether every single EC2 instance

505
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,690
is being managed by the SSM agent.

506
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,770
If not, why not?

507
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,560
And there's also some tools
that help you diagnose

508
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,010
and remediate common
operational issues with that.

509
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,600
Now we have a second scanning mode,

510
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,950
which we call hybrid,

511
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,110
which came after our agent-based approach.

512
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,347
And this is actually what we
most recommend to customers

513
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:09,660
and is the default
experience for new customers.

514
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,070
In the hybrid experience,

515
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,714
we are gonna be scanning
using the SSM agent

516
00:23:13,714 --> 00:23:15,990
in the agent-based approach.

517
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,342
If the SSM agent is there

518
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:19,222
and if the SSM agent is not there,

519
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:22,443
we'll use an agentless scanning approach.

520
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,200
The benefit of this approach

521
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,210
is that you can effectively ensure

522
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,180
that you have close to 100% coverage

523
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,340
across all your EC2 instances.

524
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,350
Mainly there could be
operational challenges

525
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,623
with managing an agent or
getting that agent there as well.

526
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,650
In our agent list technology approach,

527
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,480
we use EBS snapshots.

528
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,560
And an important note here

529
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,890
is we'll never take that
data outside of your account,

530
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,432
which could be a compliance
concern for certain customers.

531
00:23:50,432 --> 00:23:52,830
So again, if you're gonna take one thing

532
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,560
out of this talk in terms of turning on

533
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,140
EC2 scanning for Inspector, use hybrid.

534
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,310
It's really simple to set up.

535
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,110
I'm gonna show you that in the demo

536
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,730
and you should get full coverage

537
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,743
across all your EC2 instances.

538
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:09,333
Oops, go back.

539
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,090
I just want to touch on
a couple other points

540
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,180
about EC2 scanning for Inspector.

541
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,511
The first is that Amazon Inspector

542
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:20,100
has network reachability analysis.

543
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,870
So it uses automated reasoning

544
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,510
to actually determine whether or not a VM

545
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,480
or an EC2 instance is
reachable via the internet.

546
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,370
This is an important indicator

547
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,583
because that's gonna help
you prioritize those findings

548
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:35,133
that are generated in Inspector.

549
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,440
We use the network reachability score

550
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,030
based on our analysis

551
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,940
to actually inform the
Amazon Inspector score,

552
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,481
which is our proprietary scoring

553
00:24:46,481 --> 00:24:49,133
that takes the base score from the vendors

554
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,630
and our vulnerability
intelligence information.

555
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,400
And then it overlays information

556
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,940
like network reachability to
provide you a better indicator

557
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,720
of the actual security risk
for that specific finding

558
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,973
on that specific EC2 instance.

559
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,500
The next capability is
Linux deep inspection.

560
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,750
So as a customer within an account

561
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,660
or as operating as the
delegated administrator,

562
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,780
you have the ability
to specify custom paths

563
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,299
that SSM or Inspector
will go ahead and analyze

564
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:23,370
and look for software vulnerabilities

565
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,790
as well as application programming
package vulnerabilities

566
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,170
for those specific paths.

567
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,820
So if there's a specific structure

568
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,680
that you have in place for your developers

569
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,780
or the people managing
your infrastructure,

570
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,950
you can tell them

571
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,780
or you can configure Inspector

572
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,750
to go scan those paths specifically.

573
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,220
An Inspector will do its job

574
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,590
and it'll actually provide a higher volume

575
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,333
of findings for those paths.

576
00:25:48,176 --> 00:25:50,430
So I return to my map,

577
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,050
we'll move on to the next capability,

578
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,343
which is Lambda scanning.

579
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,490
Here, I present a table
and I'll just talk through

580
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,770
more or less how Lambda scanning works.

581
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,504
So Lambda scanning has
essentially two modes.

582
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:07,650
The first is Lambda standard scanning,

583
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,483
which is scanning

584
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,800
for package vulnerabilities.

585
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,390
And the second is code scanning,

586
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,560
which is scanning for
application code vulnerabilities.

587
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,344
As a customer, you'll have the ability

588
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:21,750
to either turn on standard
scanning for an account

589
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:26,220
or standard and code scanning
for a specific account.

590
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,033
So you can't have code scanning
without standard scanning.

591
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,360
And standard scanning
is gonna work similarly

592
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,150
to VM scanning where we're
looking at those packages

593
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,290
and we are cutting
findings for those CVEs.

594
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,393
Code scanning is actually gonna analyze

595
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:43,860
that code and it's gonna look

596
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,960
for things like injection flaws,

597
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,483
data disclosure or weak cryptography.

598
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:53,010
As Rick mentioned with our
continuous scanning approach,

599
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,500
we're gonna be scanning
when new resources,

600
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,510
or in this case functions are detected,

601
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,480
new versions are published of the Lambdas,

602
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,180
or when we have new
information in our database

603
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,460
that tells us that we should reevaluate

604
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,753
those Lambda functions.

605
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,870
From a remediation perspective

606
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,710
for standard scanning
package vulnerabilities,

607
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,060
we're gonna go ahead and tell you

608
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,890
what package you should upgrade to.

609
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,750
That's pretty standard.

610
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,680
But for code scanning,

611
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,660
we're actually gonna highlight to you

612
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,350
what the vulnerable lines of
code are specifically in red.

613
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,250
And then we're gonna give you

614
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,320
basically an AI generated snippet

615
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,300
of how you can adjust that code

616
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,803
to make that more secure.

617
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,440
The third main resource type
that Inspector scans for

618
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,070
are elastic container registry images.

619
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,220
So Inspectors actually scanning images

620
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,780
and not running containers.

621
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,950
And I'll talk a little bit about

622
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,570
how we can help you sort of bridge the gap

623
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,090
between how you're actually
leveraging containers

624
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,000
versus what Inspectors providing you.

625
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,933
And I'll get into some of the
details about how this works.

626
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,323
So as a customer, ECR
actually out of the box.

627
00:28:05,323 --> 00:28:09,030
You can turn on Inspector basic scanning

628
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,490
and that's gonna scan OS vulnerabilities,

629
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,650
operating system vulnerabilities only.

630
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,840
And it will also scan those images

631
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,300
when they're pushed into the repository.

632
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,310
So that's an on-push action only.

633
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,400
So this effectively
does not have continuous

634
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,460
real-time monitoring

635
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,260
and we provide some light
vulnerability intelligence

636
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,510
about those OS vulnerabilities

637
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,100
when we do cut those findings,

638
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,023
which are then visible in Inspector.

639
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,680
Now enhanced ECR image scanning

640
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,054
is basically our
Inspector level capability

641
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:44,520
of continuous ECR image scanning

642
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,350
that's gonna scan OS vulnerabilities

643
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,998
and programming language packages.

644
00:28:48,998 --> 00:28:52,050
As a customer, we are gonna scan,

645
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,210
you can configure it to scan on push,

646
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,740
but you also have the ability

647
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,610
to control which images you wanna monitor

648
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,270
based on their pull or
their last in use state.

649
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,920
So the reason why this
is important to know

650
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,980
in terms of just how you're
setting up and using Inspector

651
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,380
is that you're not gonna
wanna necessarily scan

652
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,660
every single image in the repository.

653
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,930
That may be a operational
challenge for you to manage that,

654
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,400
but you can use these settings

655
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,010
to control which images are
actually getting scanned

656
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,930
based on those dates and those metrics.

657
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,570
These are the knobs
that you have to control

658
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,493
the volumes of those findings.

659
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,640
And then in terms of enhanced standing,

660
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,690
we're also just providing

661
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,390
the full suite of vulnerability
intelligence like we do

662
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,153
for all the other continuous
monitoring capabilities.

663
00:29:39,646 --> 00:29:41,640
And I wanna touch on
a few other components

664
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,070
of ECR image scanning.

665
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,660
The first is that earlier this year

666
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,850
we launched a feature that enables you

667
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,300
to map the image to running containers.

668
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,171
So we're actually looking at EKS

669
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:56,640
and ECS information to
tell you how many pods

670
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,120
or containers are
running a specific image.

671
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,440
The reason why this is important

672
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,910
is because as a customer,

673
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:07,530
if you have a finding or a
variety of critical findings

674
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,120
on a specific image,

675
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,550
you may or may not wanna
prioritize those findings

676
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,320
based on the number of containers

677
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,930
that are actually using the images, right?

678
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:19,170
So that level of visibility
is gonna help you prioritize

679
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,400
and in the demo in a few minutes,

680
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,900
I'll show you what that
looks like in the console.

681
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,224
Lastly, just a call out,

682
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:28,198
we're always expanding the
ecosystems that we're scanning

683
00:30:28,198 --> 00:30:31,650
and we're we're generating
vulnerabilities for.

684
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,700
So just a few examples, WordPress, Tomcat.

685
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,960
We continue to expand on this

686
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,723
and we do that based on
customer demand as well.

687
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,040
The last things I want to cover

688
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,650
are essentially some of
the ad hoc functionality

689
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,920
related to additional utility capabilities

690
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,650
that we provide you as a
customer for Inspector.

691
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,240
So just take a step back, I walked through

692
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,280
some of those continuous
scanning capabilities

693
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,420
as a customer.

694
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,670
You can change some of
those settings to control

695
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,120
how you're actually using
Inspector to meet those use cases.

696
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,390
But we also provide some other
capabilities that you can use

697
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,390
as part of your effective
vulnerability management strategy.

698
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,823
The first of these is I'm loosely

699
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:21,600
referring to as manage SBOM,

700
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,550
but as Rick mentioned,

701
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:27,780
you can have the ability
to basically export an SBOM

702
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,820
that Amazon Inspector is detecting

703
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,130
because we're actually
monitoring those resources

704
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,740
and near real time you have
the ability to export those,

705
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,310
but you also have the ability
to use our scan SBOM API,

706
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,680
which takes an SBOM as an input

707
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,950
and then generates findings in Inspector

708
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,600
based on that actual SBOM.

709
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,762
So that that's really the
evaluation of the SBOM,

710
00:31:48,762 --> 00:31:51,300
but you can make that API call yourself

711
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,310
and that can give you some flexibility

712
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,860
in terms of how you use the intelligence

713
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,293
and the capabilities of Amazon Inspector.

714
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,203
The SBOMs are in
CyclingDx and SPDX format.

715
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,405
The second capability is CIS
benchmark scanning for EC2.

716
00:32:10,405 --> 00:32:12,030
So you can execute ad hoc

717
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,690
or schedule scanning of
EC2 against EC2 instances.

718
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,150
You can use tags on this.

719
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,190
So this is not quite as real time

720
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,753
as our other capabilities,

721
00:32:21,753 --> 00:32:24,390
but in terms of this
use case that we believe

722
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,220
that that meets the customer needs,

723
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,110
you can view those results.

724
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,850
Certain customers in certain industries

725
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,830
are gonna need this more than others,

726
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,609
but again, this is a piece of capability

727
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:35,973
that you have the ability to use.

728
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,140
And lastly, we have a
few CI/CD integrations.

729
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,470
You can see here, we have
an example with Jenkins,

730
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,140
but you can use popular CI/CD tools

731
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,386
to orchestrate the integration

732
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:50,995
of the SBOM generation and scan SBOM

733
00:32:50,995 --> 00:32:55,170
to meet use cases like
scanning container images

734
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:57,720
before you push them to a registry.

735
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,130
So you can use these tools

736
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,070
to bake into your operational
or development process.

737
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,979
And this is part of your
journey to sort of shift left.

738
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:06,870
It's a taste in our journey to shift left

739
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,570
and we'll be talking more
about that in a few minutes.

740
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,800
So with that I'm gonna
go ahead and show a demo.

741
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,440
We're basically gonna walk
through some of the console

742
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,990
to show you actually where
to go and Inspector to go

743
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,790
and leverage these capabilities
and how to control them.

744
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,300
So this page here is account management.

745
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,240
And as a delegated administrator,

746
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,250
basically what you have the ability to do

747
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,290
is see this giant grid

748
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,110
of all the different
accounts in your organization

749
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,360
and which capabilities are turned on.

750
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,250
And you can granularly control

751
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,930
which ones to turn on or not.

752
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,023
So in this example, you can see
this account when all sixes.

753
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,840
Doesn't have Lambda scanning enabled,

754
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,930
but I was able to just
simply click that, turn on

755
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,633
and activate Lambda
standard and code scanning.

756
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,450
In account management as well,

757
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,380
we have this coverage.

758
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,437
You can see resources
coverage on the left.

759
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:05,970
That's gonna fire through
some of these screens,

760
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:10,110
but effectively across
your entire organization

761
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,670
what is every single VM

762
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,890
that's being scanned or not scanned?

763
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,210
And then I can drill in

764
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:19,110
and see those details about
those resources themselves.

765
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,120
You can see we have the same thing here

766
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,200
with Lambda functions and
also container images.

767
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,970
So we're decorating that information

768
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,320
that you have an understanding

769
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,390
what's actually being covered and not.

770
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,430
The key point there
being you cannot manage

771
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,453
what you cannot see.

772
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,250
And then we just have some
other information here

773
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,270
in the console showing

774
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,310
like why is something not being scanned

775
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,740
that would be relevant to understand

776
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,850
from a security perspective

777
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:49,323
or if you're reporting to your managers.

778
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:51,263
You can see here also I'm just firing

779
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:53,405
through the SBOM export.

780
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:58,180
So Inspector is continuously
monitoring all those resources

781
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,720
and you have the ability to simply decide

782
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,340
which resources to generate
the export, the SBOM for.

783
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,433
And then you can put
that in S3 bucket or not.

784
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,260
This page here is our
EC2 scanning setting.

785
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,390
Simply enough, I talk
about the hybrid mode

786
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,740
versus the agent base mode,

787
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,640
but it's easy enough to
just go to the console,

788
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,730
click the EC2 scanning settings

789
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,830
and then turn on hybrid scanning.

790
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,350
At that point, Inspector is
gonna start doing the work

791
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,210
to detect all those other resources

792
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,910
and use our agent list technology.

793
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:32,310
And then the last real knob
you have, which I talked about,

794
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,550
is a major piece of control
for container image scanning.

795
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,930
You have the ability to determine

796
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:40,050
when a image is going to be re-scanned

797
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,930
or enter scanning eligibility.

798
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:46,740
And you can do this by either
choosing elastin use date

799
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,040
or a last pull date, plus a push date.

800
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,616
So you can use those dates
to control the images

801
00:35:53,616 --> 00:35:55,743
that are eligible for scanning.

802
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,830
And lastly, I'm just showing here

803
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,663
the vulnerability database search.

804
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,680
So we're decorating the findings

805
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,000
with the information is here,

806
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,080
but if any time you want to go

807
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,700
to your research about a specific CVE,

808
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,620
you can simply type that in.

809
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,530
We'll provide all the information
here about the finding

810
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,020
as well as any other
intelligence that we have

811
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,670
to help you understand more
about that vulnerability.

812
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:29,520
So this will be a quick minute demo.

813
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,060
I'm gonna show you what
the container image

814
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,940
to container mapping capability is.

815
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,110
You can see here I drilled

816
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,350
into some critical findings
for container images

817
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,510
or I'm here in the dashboard,

818
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,250
I drilled into some of the findings

819
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,023
for this particular image.

820
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,910
I'm here on the container image.

821
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,440
You can see I have a variety

822
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,330
of findings here, many findings.

823
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,600
I can go view those findings
if that makes sense.

824
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,850
So I have visibility into
what those findings are

825
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,320
for this specific resource.

826
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,120
And then you can see
here there's a hyperlink

827
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,740
to the deployed ECS/EKS tasks and pods.

828
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,570
I can see that workload name there

829
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,600
and then I can simply just
go click into that workload

830
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,360
and explore all the details about that

831
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,303
where I'm actually using
that, which is in ECR itself.

832
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,530
Okay, so I gave a quick overview

833
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,530
on basically how to use Inspector

834
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,940
to meet some of those use cases.

835
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,670
There's plenty of additional
content to help you do that.

836
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,160
More or less you want to
be able to set up Inspector

837
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,570
to start doing that scanning

838
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,210
and play with the knobs
as an administrator,

839
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,620
how to actually use Inspector

840
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,050
to start that vulnerability detection.

841
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,277
And with that, I'll pass it to Nirali.

842
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,313
- Thank you.

843
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,050
Thank you, Anthony.

844
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,353
Okay, moving on.

845
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:00,093
How many developers here in the audience?

846
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:01,814
A few?

847
00:38:01,814 --> 00:38:03,332
Good, oh actually more than a few.

848
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:06,960
I like to start talking
about code security

849
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,350
from the perspective
of this iceberg image.

850
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,260
What we talked so far in our journey

851
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,750
was the tip of the iceberg.

852
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,490
Everything that a security person

853
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:20,580
gets to see when their workloads

854
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,343
or images are running in production.

855
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,080
Oftentimes it is harder to patch these

856
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,623
running environment
workloads in production.

857
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,850
The challenges become that's visible,

858
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,370
which is underneath the surface,

859
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,723
basically under the water.

860
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,610
Our developers are iterating writing codes

861
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:48,780
on a daily basis with a
sprint to make changes.

862
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,960
Oftentimes not knowing what
security vulnerabilities

863
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,943
or exposures that they may run into.

864
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,640
Let's take an example.

865
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,950
Business wants a brand new feature

866
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,483
that's gonna change the world.

867
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,240
Product managers and business owners

868
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,770
are working on defining it.

869
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,040
Your customers are
eagerly waiting for that.

870
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,560
Developers have actually
worked weeks and weeks

871
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,190
trying to write code to
get that ready for launch.

872
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,917
Monday morning, the launch is set to go.

873
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:19,860
And before you hit the green button,

874
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,233
you discover a new critical vulnerability.

875
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,760
You're now faced a decision point.

876
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,380
What do you do?

877
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,530
Do you actually hit the
button and launch it?

878
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,030
Or do you actually scale back,

879
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,130
go back, fix the vulnerability

880
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,470
and delay the launch?

881
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,990
How many of us have actually
run into that scenario

882
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,850
where you've had to make
that decision, right?

883
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:42,813
Sounds familiar?

884
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:48,830
I wish there was a way for
developers to know earlier

885
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,350
that hey, what I'm writing
has these vulnerabilities,

886
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,390
has these critical vulnerabilities

887
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,610
so I don't have to wait
all the way till Monday

888
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,017
or Saturday or Sunday to
to discover them, right?

889
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:02,010
That's what code security is doing.

890
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,500
Throwing light underneath
that water surface

891
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,473
to be able to catch things earlier.

892
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,220
Their production workloads
have vulnerabilities.

893
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,670
You have to patch them with
high urgency obviously.

894
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,720
But what's below the
surface is all the code

895
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,030
that your developer's writing,

896
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,700
all the dependencies
with open source packages

897
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,970
that they may have, that
may have vulnerabilities

898
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,830
that you may not be aware of.

899
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,570
And your infrastructure as code, right?

900
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:33,000
Like I'm writing code to
scale my infrastructure

901
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,900
and I want them to be secure
before I actually go ahead

902
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,883
and scale up my infra in production.

903
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,010
And we started the journey with Inspector

904
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,200
all the way to the right

905
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,480
where we started to monitor everything

906
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,052
right from the EC2
instances, Lambda functions,

907
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:56,940
the images that are used to
bring up your pods and tasks.

908
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,330
We introduced an ability
to actually build and test

909
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,700
with your CI/CD pipeline,

910
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,100
but you told us that's not enough.

911
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,110
The same iceberg analogy.

912
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:07,943
It's not enough.

913
00:41:07,943 --> 00:41:10,080
You have to start catching these early.

914
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,790
It's very expensive.

915
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:16,170
And to patch and fix these
vulnerabilities in production,

916
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,033
oftentimes you cannot even touch it.

917
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,700
And you own that risk.

918
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,130
And we wanna actually
allow you to balance it.

919
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,860
So we're further shifting left

920
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,053
based on the feedback that you told us.

921
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,710
Let me give you an example
why it's important.

922
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:36,710
How many of us here know
about Log4J or Log4Shell?

923
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,933
Very good.

924
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,510
To your surprise,

925
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,530
the graph actually shows the downloads

926
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:51,530
of vulnerable Log4J since January of 2021.

927
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:58,080
If you see this scaling up even today,

928
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,510
it's been around for four plus years.

929
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,740
It was detected in December

930
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:06,390
and of December the previous
year, even till date,

931
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,380
30% of the downloads that
happen are vulnerable.

932
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,890
And oftentimes we push
that code to production

933
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:17,463
and we now have to go and
patch it as security owners.

934
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,930
So it's very important to
catch this early enough

935
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,760
where we don't need to worry about fixing

936
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,133
and patching things in production.

937
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,430
And that's the reason why
we further shifted left

938
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:35,640
in the development cycle
to catch vulnerabilities

939
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,157
not only in your third party dependencies

940
00:42:38,157 --> 00:42:42,540
of open source packages the
developers are using or pulling,

941
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,520
but also your first party code,

942
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,400
which is like your propriety
code that you're running.

943
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,610
So scanning right where your developers

944
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,250
are working and iterating on your code

945
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,760
with native integration into GitHub

946
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,463
as well as GitLab repositories.

947
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,990
It's very expensive and costly

948
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,660
to actually find these
defects further right.

949
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,750
And so we're shifting as left as we can

950
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,830
to meet your developers

951
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,580
and allow them to do security
right from the beginning.

952
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,967
What is part of code security

953
00:43:18,967 --> 00:43:20,460
and what are we gonna scan?

954
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,372
So we'll integrate with
your GitHub and GitLab.

955
00:43:24,372 --> 00:43:27,802
We will go ahead and
expand our capabilities.

956
00:43:27,802 --> 00:43:29,907
Inspector natively does third-party

957
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,269
and open-source package dependencies

958
00:43:32,269 --> 00:43:35,910
to detect vulnerabilities
in your compute environment.

959
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,587
So we're expanding the same capability.

960
00:43:37,587 --> 00:43:41,460
The software composition
analysis further left.

961
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,210
So in your GitHub or GitLab repositories,

962
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,880
if your developer is using third-party

963
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,990
or open-source packages

964
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:50,670
that they're pulled into your code base,

965
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,520
we'll scan them to detect
vulnerabilities early

966
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,270
as they write and iterate the code.

967
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:59,813
But we understand that even
though 80% of your code

968
00:43:59,813 --> 00:44:01,363
may still be open source

969
00:44:01,363 --> 00:44:04,470
and your source code analysis important,

970
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,580
we still have proprietary
first party code that we write

971
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,100
and it's important to scan that as well.

972
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,560
So we are expanding the capability

973
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,350
from not just supply
chain or SCA capability,

974
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:20,040
we're also adding static
application security testing scan,

975
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,950
which is scanning for
security vulnerabilities

976
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,620
in your first party code as well.

977
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:30,620
And then, we all typically
use infrastructure as code

978
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,020
to scale our environment,

979
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:39,020
making sure that the IaC
configurations and my files

980
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:45,030
are secure inherently
before I use to scale

981
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:49,020
my cloud environment is very important.

982
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,740
So no different than scanning
the rest of your repository.

983
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,473
We will also scan your IaC files.

984
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:01,230
Terraform CDK will also be scanned

985
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:05,070
using the same mechanism
to find security flaws

986
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,540
such as hard coded secrets

987
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,673
and other detectors built into it.

988
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,850
Now we often talk about security person

989
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:18,003
or persona wanting to
implement guardrails.

990
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,000
But from a developer persona,

991
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,280
it is very difficult to
kind of follow through

992
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,140
and always adhere to those guardrails.

993
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,450
And oftentimes it comes late in the system

994
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:30,810
where a developer is
mad at a security person

995
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,490
to get that finding generated

996
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,846
a lot later in the system, right?

997
00:45:34,846 --> 00:45:36,660
We talk about DevSecOps,

998
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,700
it's been around for a very long time,

999
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,510
but in reality, it's
very hard to implement

1000
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:47,340
that entire DevSecOps journey
unless you natively embed

1001
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,223
and bring the culture in
the developer's workflows.

1002
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:54,000
So with code security,

1003
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,240
we're adding an improved governance model.

1004
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,680
And what do I mean by that, right?

1005
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,210
Like typically a developer

1006
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,580
will work in its own environment,

1007
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,190
write code, go through the sprint

1008
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,020
and at the tail end of the sprint,

1009
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,120
we'll get to know about
the vulnerabilities.

1010
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,770
There'll be a bunch of back and forth,

1011
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,790
we'll have to go fix,

1012
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,740
negotiate with the security person,

1013
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,880
fix the critical ones,

1014
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,197
and then move on.

1015
00:46:16,197 --> 00:46:19,110
But what if I told you
that with this capability,

1016
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,140
we are gonna change the governance model

1017
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:27,140
where we're natively embedding
security within the workflows

1018
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:31,230
of the developer tools without
them having to switch tools

1019
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,480
or even go to the security persona

1020
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,193
to look at what the findings are.

1021
00:46:36,387 --> 00:46:38,460
So instead of the developers

1022
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,490
having full freedom to
just iterate the code

1023
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:44,310
but then find out later
and slow them down,

1024
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:47,460
we wanna give them incremental information

1025
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,860
as they're doing PRs, as
they're merging code back

1026
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,870
to the main to show them that hey,

1027
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:54,780
here are your top vulnerabilities,
let's go fix them.

1028
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,260
Give them guidance of here's
what I recommend your fixes

1029
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,280
to be as well as you write the code

1030
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,570
and here's the guardrail defined

1031
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,990
so that we can build a culture

1032
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,030
where security is not a blocker,

1033
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:12,921
but an enabler for allowing developers

1034
00:47:12,921 --> 00:47:15,600
to write code fast,

1035
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,805
be agile with security in their mindset

1036
00:47:18,805 --> 00:47:23,013
and write secure code
right from the beginning.

1037
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,010
All of this can be set
by a security persona

1038
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,080
to set and define the guardrails

1039
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,180
for what your code should look like

1040
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,940
before you actually merge into main

1041
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,210
or before you actually go to production.

1042
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:40,920
And within those guardrails,

1043
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,830
your developer now have unvetted freedom

1044
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:47,520
to quickly treat the
code, learn, fail fast

1045
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,060
and improve so that overall
the business has agility,

1046
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,570
able to launch features
faster in a secure manner,

1047
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,130
and you're actually de-risking

1048
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,323
your entire development lifecycle.

1049
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,640
The other thing that was very important

1050
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,000
that we touched upon

1051
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,020
is you have to meet them where they are.

1052
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,660
The challenge with some other
code security capability

1053
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,010
was security persona wants to go ahead

1054
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,467
and build out guardrails,

1055
00:48:15,467 --> 00:48:18,990
build out visibility
into the code repository,

1056
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,970
but the only way to look at it

1057
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,520
was to come into a security
per persona's view.

1058
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,210
So you'd have to, hypothetically,
come into Inspector

1059
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,520
to see what the vulnerabilities look like.

1060
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,680
And developers often
don't wanna switch tools,

1061
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,790
like I'm writing code
in my IDE environment,

1062
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,950
I pushed it to my code
repository in GitHub

1063
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:41,040
and I'm iterating on GitHub with PRs

1064
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,020
and pushing back code into my main branch

1065
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,060
and I'm ready to go

1066
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,520
and you're asking me
now to switch context,

1067
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,400
go and find the vulnerability
somewhere else, right?

1068
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,280
So it was very important for us

1069
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,160
to have the experience natively embedded

1070
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,310
into the workflows where the developer is.

1071
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,410
So you have both personas.

1072
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:02,850
If you are a security owner,

1073
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:06,060
you certainly have a centralized
view with an Inspector

1074
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,997
to look at all the repositories
that you actually have

1075
00:49:09,997 --> 00:49:12,930
or a subset depending on
what's important to you,

1076
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:17,130
such as show me the findings
only for production environment

1077
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,950
or anything tagged pink for that matter.

1078
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:21,300
So what's important to you,

1079
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,250
you define and you see the vulnerabilities

1080
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,750
no different than how you
do with Inspector today.

1081
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,200
But if you're a developer,

1082
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,960
you do not have to leave
the tools you're using.

1083
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,200
Your writing code in your
GitHub as you do PRs,

1084
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,420
as you merge the code back in,

1085
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,710
you will get to see

1086
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:41,250
all your security
vulnerabilities as comments,

1087
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,700
as well as recommendations on
how you would fix the code.

1088
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,590
Let's quickly go through a demo.

1089
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,813
I promise it's a short
one and the last one.

1090
00:49:50,352 --> 00:49:53,348
I'm gonna wear a hat of a developer,

1091
00:49:53,348 --> 00:49:56,055
not a very security savvy developer.

1092
00:49:56,055 --> 00:49:58,113
I just wanna move fast.

1093
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,807
This is my standard Python application.

1094
00:50:02,807 --> 00:50:05,036
I have infrastructure as code,

1095
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:09,660
as well as the web application
with builtin vulnerabilities

1096
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,700
that I want to show you
and walk you through

1097
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,380
in terms of the scenario.

1098
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:18,380
I'm now committing it back
to my GitHub environment.

1099
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:21,150
It's a standard flask application.

1100
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,250
It's for demo purposes,

1101
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:25,830
has a bunch of vulnerabilities
as you can see,

1102
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:27,030
application vulnerabilities

1103
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,400
as well as infrastructure
as code vulnerabilities

1104
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,610
that I wanna walk you
through and identify them

1105
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,340
within my setup in Inspector.

1106
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,230
As a security person,

1107
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,300
the setup is no different
than how you would do it

1108
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,710
for the rest of the environment, right?

1109
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:44,190
So you'd come in, set up an integration

1110
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:48,060
depending on what code
repository platform you may have,

1111
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,350
you'll go ahead and set up

1112
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,200
a configuration integration with GitHub.

1113
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,300
In my case, we'll also highlight

1114
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,280
all the default configuration settings

1115
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,510
that we are recommending, right?

1116
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:58,920
So we're gonna say go ahead

1117
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,460
and scan them every time
you're doing a pull request,

1118
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,320
pushing back to the main,

1119
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,930
you also wanna scan them weekly

1120
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,612
and scan across all of it, right?

1121
00:51:08,612 --> 00:51:10,980
Scan across your first party code,

1122
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,230
third party dependencies,

1123
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,870
as well as your infrastructure as code.

1124
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:17,890
By default, go ahead and scan all of it

1125
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,760
and create this scan configuration

1126
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,297
for you to be able to know
exactly what's happening

1127
00:51:24,297 --> 00:51:26,043
in your code repository.

1128
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,527
You certainly can filter out

1129
00:51:29,527 --> 00:51:31,864
depending on what you may need.

1130
00:51:31,864 --> 00:51:35,020
I'm gonna go ahead and
finish the installation.

1131
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,744
There is an app that
gets installed natively.

1132
00:51:37,744 --> 00:51:40,440
It'll walk you through
that entire workflow.

1133
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,660
What the app is actually
doing is allowing,

1134
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,177
giving you permissions.

1135
00:51:45,177 --> 00:51:47,130
Read/write permissions, so read only

1136
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:49,920
so that I can discover
all the repos and write

1137
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,170
so that I can put comments on your PR.

1138
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:53,700
And the write permissions only for PR

1139
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,550
so that I can get you comments
from security findings

1140
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,740
directly natively into GitHub.

1141
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,570
Let's go back to Inspector.

1142
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:03,150
I've now discovered the three repositories

1143
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,953
that I actually had in my setup.

1144
00:52:06,608 --> 00:52:11,310
We'll go ahead and quickly
look at the findings

1145
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:14,583
from the setup in my web application.

1146
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:21,450
And if you can see, I have
not run any scans right now.

1147
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:25,683
I'll go ahead and initiate
a scan in my repository,

1148
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,050
generate the findings.

1149
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:31,410
I'll go ahead and quickly
just run on demand scan

1150
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:33,120
because I set it up for weekly scans

1151
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,530
starting Wednesday, today's Monday.

1152
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,690
So the next scan will
happen on a Wednesday.

1153
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,880
We'll go ahead and set the scan up

1154
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,470
to go see the critical findings

1155
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,030
that are generated.

1156
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:44,160
Automatically, we'll go ahead

1157
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,320
and see the findings on my web app

1158
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,863
that I had written poorly
what those findings are.

1159
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,340
It was scanned.

1160
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,870
I can see the project ID.

1161
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,250
It's important so that you know

1162
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,130
which project I actually
scan and what the ARN is

1163
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:01,080
and what are the vulnerabilities.

1164
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,490
If you notice here I have
restricted IAM policies,

1165
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,260
I also have hardcoded secrets

1166
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:12,180
and I have a public read ACL in my repo,

1167
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,680
which means I have an S3 bucket

1168
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,883
with access publicly
allowed from the outside in.

1169
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,770
We'll go ahead and highlight
what the vulnerability is,

1170
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,630
when was it actually detected.

1171
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,613
This one's package vulnerability.

1172
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:30,389
What are the affected packages,

1173
00:53:30,389 --> 00:53:33,557
if it is a code, where exactly in the code

1174
00:53:33,557 --> 00:53:36,002
the vulnerability exists as well

1175
00:53:36,002 --> 00:53:38,193
and what the recommendations are.

1176
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,700
Real quick, I'm gonna
actually make a quick change

1177
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,739
on my Terraform file.

1178
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:45,270
I'm gonna add a new feature.

1179
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,940
I'm gonna actually commit
it back to the main

1180
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,448
and then run another scan

1181
00:53:49,448 --> 00:53:52,470
to see if it generates the finding.

1182
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:55,890
And we could do the same on...

1183
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:59,223
we could do the same on PR as well.

1184
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,840
If you notice, the scan commit ID changed.

1185
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:10,350
We've generated a new finding,

1186
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:13,560
certainly sort by the age.

1187
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,468
The finding generated this time

1188
00:54:15,468 --> 00:54:19,050
has the restricted actions
with the principle S3 bucket.

1189
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:22,377
I continue to write bad code
and I get all the findings.

1190
00:54:22,377 --> 00:54:26,490
Here are the 15 lines of
code that has an issue

1191
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:27,690
and it was all detected.

1192
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:29,460
Now real quick, let's just see

1193
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,260
what happens when I'm
doing a pull request,

1194
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,479
I am gonna continue to
write bad code more.

1195
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:36,690
Things I'm gonna add in here.

1196
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,340
I'm gonna have a hard coded secret.

1197
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,750
I'm also gonna expose

1198
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,990
with remote code execution if exploited.

1199
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:46,260
So just bad practice continue to happen.

1200
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,610
And when I'm doing that,

1201
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,320
what happens when I do a pull request,

1202
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,603
the findings actually will
get generated automatically

1203
00:54:52,603 --> 00:54:55,863
within the native tool that I have.

1204
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,829
And there's a pull request.

1205
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,590
I think it's a great code.

1206
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,570
I'm excellent, it's good to go.

1207
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:06,240
Let's just do a pull request
and see what happens.

1208
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,440
And there are no conflicts.

1209
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,270
And I'm gonna start generating

1210
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,610
all the findings associated with it.

1211
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,460
For me to now realize that the code

1212
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,803
that I have written is
actually not very good.

1213
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:22,140
Here are all the hardcoded
secrets that I need to go fix

1214
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,803
as well as our remote code
execution, if exploited,

1215
00:55:25,803 --> 00:55:27,720
would actually put me at risk

1216
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,990
so I can go ahead and make
the changes in the code

1217
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:33,093
while I'm actually doing pull requests.

1218
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:37,080
Just to summarize, we talked
about scheduled scans,

1219
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,930
on-demand scans and Git event-based scans

1220
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,340
which allows your developers

1221
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,890
to actually iterate code securely,

1222
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:46,110
full visibility governance model

1223
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:49,620
that allows them both
to collaborate together.

1224
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,090
And with all of that

1225
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:55,200
right from the production workloads

1226
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,340
to scanning right in the
beginning at the code repository,

1227
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,790
we wanna make the secure
thing the easy thing

1228
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:05,130
for your developers and
your security persona.

1229
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,080
So the organizations can

1230
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,370
and should build secure software

1231
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,173
to get the speed and
agility that we need today.

1232
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:18,300
And just to summarize the same iceberg

1233
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,870
with Inspector for
vulnerability management.

1234
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:25,440
We're not only just showing
you what's in production

1235
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,780
and the the vulnerabilities
that are available,

1236
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,150
but we're also shining
light underneath that.

1237
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:34,170
So you can start early to
understand all your code,

1238
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:35,910
the dependencies infrastructure

1239
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,820
as code security vulnerabilities earlier,

1240
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,490
fix them in the life cycle.

1241
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,432
And then when it comes to security,

1242
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:45,750
it's not just about
vulnerabilities, right?

1243
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:47,523
Like that's one of your problem.

1244
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:53,610
Many of you probably already
are familiar with Security Hub,

1245
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,170
like our original Security Hub

1246
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:57,990
is now rebranded as Security Hub CSPM.

1247
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:02,040
We have a new platform for
security finding aggregation

1248
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,930
that aggregates findings

1249
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:06,090
from threat findings from GuardDuty,

1250
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:09,549
vulnerability from in Inspector controls

1251
00:57:09,549 --> 00:57:14,549
for resources, exposures
and configurations

1252
00:57:14,741 --> 00:57:16,890
along with sensitive data from Macie,

1253
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:21,890
all of that together to
have a combined risk score.

1254
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,113
We will automatically correlate
these findings for you,

1255
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:28,180
generate a prioritized risk

1256
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:33,180
so that you can take action on
what's more important to you

1257
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,480
rather than just looking
at one aspect of risk.

1258
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,480
This is a combined
correlated aggregated view.

1259
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,610
So you can prioritize take action

1260
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:43,200
based on what's important.

1261
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,674
And it already has automated
response capability

1262
00:57:45,674 --> 00:57:49,620
built into it for you to do investigation

1263
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,453
on all your critical findings.

1264
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,000
Lastly, there are additional sessions

1265
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,420
to go deeper into Security hub, Inspector,

1266
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,576
code security, or AppSec capabilities.

1267
00:58:02,576 --> 00:58:06,690
So feel free to just step
into one of these code talks

1268
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,520
or breakout sessions or workshops

1269
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,210
to get hands on some important blogs

1270
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:14,790
and other useful information on Inspector

1271
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,863
if you were curious to learn more.

1272
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:21,030
