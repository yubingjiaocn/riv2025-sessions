1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,253
- Okay.

2
00:00:01,253 --> 00:00:03,360
Good afternoon, everyone,
nice to see you all here.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,430
Thank you so much for
coming to our talk today.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,780
My name is Nick,

5
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,910
I lead product management
for cloud security

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,640
and exposure managements
here at SentinelOne.

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,020
I'm joined by my colleague, Joe.

8
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,610
- Yeah, and my name is Joe Poyner,

9
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,810
I'm a Senior Solutions Engineering
Director at SentinelOne.

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,643
- Yeah.

11
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:22,770
And we wanna talk to you all
today about autonomous SOC;

12
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,690
moving from a collection of tools

13
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,670
to using an autonomous SOC,

14
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,200
and I'd like to lay out

15
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,670
maybe the groundwork for you a little bit.

16
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,050
So, where I'd like to start
is the current challenges

17
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,230
that Security Operations
Centers, or SOCs, face,

18
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,650
what the current attack
landscape actually looks like,

19
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,460
and then how we can leverage generative AI

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,600
and agentic workflows

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,720
to move to a more
autonomous security model.

22
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,280
And at the end, we'll
tell you a little bit

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,350
about how you can get
hands on with these tools

24
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,083
after the presentation,
if you're so interested.

25
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,170
Now, before I get started,

26
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,280
I'm gonna ask you guys a quick question,

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,420
make sure everybody's awake.

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,160
Has anyone in here ever worked

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,490
in a security operations
center, or works in one now?

30
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,400
Okay, more people than I
expected, that's awesome.

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,830
So, look, I think those folks know,

32
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,870
and the rest of you are about to learn,

33
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,860
security analyst work is super
unsustainable today, right?

34
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,480
So if you think about the current

35
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,300
sort of security operations
center lifecycle,

36
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,990
it's incredibly manual,
it's incredibly intense.

37
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,800
SOC analysts have to go through
an endless number of alerts,

38
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,100
it can take hours just
to triage those alerts,

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,357
and even more time to then
investigate the things

40
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:36,510
that need to be investigated,

41
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,490
ideally respond to threats

42
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,010
if they do exist in your environments.

43
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,000
And forget ever trying to get
proactive with risk management

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,830
and preventing these things from happening

45
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,850
in the first place,

46
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,600
it takes days at the
best of organizations.

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,083
So, our mission is to make
this better for all of you.

48
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,730
And we're starting to
do that today with...

49
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,470
Well, actually, before I talk about that,

50
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,430
let's talk about why.

51
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,520
So we can use AI to make those
things better for you all,

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,110
and we'll learn that in a second.

53
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,240
But, on the flip side,

54
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,070
while you defenders are hampered
by governance and policies

55
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,010
and maybe even politics
in your organizations,

56
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,330
and org charts,

57
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,710
attackers are not.

58
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,360
They're completely unencumbered,

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,220
they can use whatever tools they want,

60
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,530
whenever they want to,
to get the job done,

61
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,323
and we're seeing that
live in the world today.

62
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,170
Google Threat Intelligence
released an interesting report

63
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,740
of new polymorphic malware,

64
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,630
generative AI generated payloads

65
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,480
that are different every single
time the malware executes,

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,950
called Prompt FLUX.

67
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,560
I'm sure everyone here probably saw

68
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,350
a very interesting report by Anthropic

69
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,350
about attackers using AI to
automate attacks at scale,

70
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,020
both reconnaissance and initial access.

71
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,930
Now, what I think is so
interesting about that example

72
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,460
is that the attack itself,

73
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,650
if you go read the Anthropic report,

74
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,780
which I highly suggest all of you do

75
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,640
if you're interested in this space,

76
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,450
the attack itself wasn't
particularly special, right?

77
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,330
Find an open port, find
a vulnerable application,

78
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,610
find your way into the environment, right?

79
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,480
These are the types of things

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,550
that we all deal with every single day,

81
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,360
humans have been doing them
for many, many, many years.

82
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,190
The special part about this

83
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,800
was that attackers were
able to automate away

84
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,750
90% of the grunt work,

85
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,980
and do this at scale

86
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,440
without ever having a
human touch the keyboard.

87
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,380
And, yes, at the end,
it'll need some adjustment,

88
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,690
some fine-tuning to really drive through

89
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,740
and breach through those environments,

90
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,180
but they're able to zoom out of the grind,

91
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,670
and defenders haven't
been able to do that yet.

92
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,260
- I mean, can you imagine?

93
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,610
You know, I myself,

94
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,070
I use Gen AI to write a lot of my emails,

95
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,600
and it's fantastic for doing that,

96
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,707
I jot down a couple of
sentences and I say,

97
00:03:56,707 --> 00:03:57,810
"Hey, beef this up,

98
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,880
make it look a little
bit more professional."

99
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,970
Who here remembers when you
used to get a spam email

100
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,190
and the way that you would
detect that it was spam

101
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,760
was because of misspellings,
or because of poor grammar?

102
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,140
I mean, we've all seen it,

103
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,587
you know, grandma calls you up and says,

104
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:12,600
"I think I've been hacked,"

105
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,137
and you see the email and you're like,

106
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:16,470
"How did you fall for that?"

107
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,450
But we're at the point now with Gen AI,

108
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,030
and attackers can use these tools

109
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,860
rather than us using them for good,

110
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,110
they're using them for evil.

111
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,830
And so, they're coming in
with now emails, images

112
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,110
that are perfectly crafted,

113
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,240
that even somebody like myself

114
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,580
who lives in this day in and day out,

115
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,720
I take a look at one of these

116
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,940
and I can't tell anymore

117
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,800
whether it's spam or whether
it's an actual, valid email.

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,050
It's really getting terrifying out there.

119
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,010
- Yeah.

120
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,410
So two pieces here, right?

121
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,040
Generative AI malware, like Prompt FLUX,

122
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,800
or what SentinelLABS found MalTerminal,

123
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,400
which uses GPT-4 to
auto-generate new payloads,

124
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,260
and the automation of processes
at scale, at machine speed,

125
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,260
using AI to do that and
getting rid of the grunt work.

126
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,210
So we're fighting adversaries

127
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,270
that are rewriting their
playbooks every single day,

128
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,530
and ultimately moving
faster than a human can.

129
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,510
So, what do we wanna do about that?

130
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,830
At SentinelOne,

131
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,320
Purple AI is sort of
the engine and the brain

132
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,770
that powers our response to that problem.

133
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,740
It provides not just your normal,

134
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,160
sort of ChatGPT-style
natural language interface,

135
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,930
which it does also do,

136
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,090
but it provides human-level reasoning

137
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,920
inside of the Singularity platform.

138
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,560
It can do auto triage and investigation

139
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,940
like you'll see in a little bit,

140
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,950
Joe's got a cool demo for you all.

141
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,200
It also integrates with
our automation platform,

142
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,320
so it can orchestrate and
take action on your behalf,

143
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,290
and we even run our own proprietary models

144
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,200
that we've trained using
systems like AWS Bedrock.

145
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,330
We have a set of models
called Ultraviolet,

146
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,090
including, you know, even
our machine learning models

147
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,040
to detect malware at the agent-level

148
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,190
and broad threat intelligence
through partnerships

149
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,443
and private feeds internally.

150
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,800
So, AI is going from assisting
you in doing all of this work

151
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,330
to doing all of the work for you

152
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,510
and getting your approval,
suggestions, changes.

153
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,540
And this is a really,
really important change

154
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,800
in the industry, right?

155
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,080
This is how we start to scale

156
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,830
what we can do in response
to the AI age of threats

157
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,910
in the landscape.

158
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,590
So imagine a world

159
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,840
where instead of, you know, an analyst

160
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,930
going through 10,000
alerts in a single day,

161
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,090
which I have seen in real-life before,

162
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,130
you have an AI agent go
through 10,000 alerts

163
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,450
and surface what it thinks

164
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,540
might be the most interesting 500, right?

165
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,380
Imagine a world

166
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,110
where instead of going and
doing all of that work yourself,

167
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,280
you are simply supervising
and managing your virtual team

168
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,860
of AI agentic SOC users.

169
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,770
- What I think is most exciting
about that is, you know,

170
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,890
when I was in college a long time ago

171
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,560
studying to be an analyst,

172
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,690
I had visions of a world

173
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,820
where I was that guy on the keyboard

174
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,790
hunting down attackers, very "CSI" style.

175
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,987
Little did I know that once
I got out in the real-world,

176
00:07:13,987 --> 00:07:15,450
"No, Joe, sit down in this chair,

177
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,370
you've got a queue of
alerts that are coming in,

178
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,340
and you need to handle several
hundred of these alerts

179
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,173
every single day."

180
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:22,006
If somebody would've told me

181
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:24,690
that that was what security life was like,

182
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,910
I would've gone and
become a used car salesman

183
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,290
or something else.

184
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,840
Now the industry has been promising

185
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,820
these types of advancements
for a long time,

186
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,310
but we're now finally at the stage

187
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,480
where analysts can stop
being firefighters,

188
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,530
and they can truly transition
into a more strategic role,

189
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,100
like you said, managing these
AIs, doing that grunt work,

190
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,150
being more of that "CSI"
style, you know, threat hunter

191
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,310
rather than just a ticket handler.

192
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,180
- Absolutely.

193
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,434
And you might notice something,

194
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,950
and this may be surprising,
hopefully it's not,

195
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,050
what we're not talking about today

196
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,500
is replacing humans in
the security workflow.

197
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,333
- No.
- I don't believe

198
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,630
that will ever happen.
- Mm-mm.

199
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,770
- What we're talking about

200
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,550
is like leveraging humans
to do what they do best.

201
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,750
Another good example,

202
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,850
I think an analogy that we can use here

203
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,070
is self-driving cars, right?

204
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,790
Has anyone here this week used
the Zoox self-driving taxis?

205
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,623
Okay, you're braver

206
00:08:21,623 --> 00:08:23,550
than I am for sure.
(Joe laughing)

207
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,980
But, look, even when you get in that car,

208
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,080
you still have to tell
it where to go, right?

209
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,520
You're in charge of the mission,

210
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,410
what is the journey that you wanna go on?

211
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,110
And so, we believe humans
are the mission commanders

212
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,700
of the security operations center.

213
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,950
They may not be the boots
on the ground forever,

214
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,583
but they're an absolutely
instrumental part of this forever.

215
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,730
So, we started to talk about
autonomy and self-driving cars.

216
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,690
SentinelOne has come up

217
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,480
with an autonomous SOC
model, Maturity Model,

218
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,780
very similar to like a
self-driving car maturity model.

219
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,800
And, back in the day, we
started at zero, right?

220
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,470
We're writing our own
simple rule detections,

221
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,570
we're doing completely
manual investigation,

222
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,820
and, look, over time in the industry,

223
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,290
this has gotten better.

224
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,410
We moved to having automated playbooks,

225
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,020
we even moved into a world many years ago

226
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,720
of AI-assisted automation, right?

227
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,630
I would actually claim that
when SentinelOne was founded,

228
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,400
it was founded in this Level 2 phase.

229
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,650
We've been using machine learning models

230
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,800
to detect malware at scale
across customer environments,

231
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,230
and we call this static
AI, for many, many years,

232
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,090
it's what the company was born on.

233
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,020
Today, we believe we are at
Level 3: Partial Autonomy,

234
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,400
the ability to reason and
predict potential threats

235
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,690
to create detections and
detect suspicious activity,

236
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,080
and more importantly, start
to go down the second half

237
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,100
of that life cycle, right,
triage, investigation, response.

238
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,950
But it is definitely still
AI is assisting humans,

239
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,980
and not necessarily humans
assisting AI as much yet.

240
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,540
So what's next is what we believe
is high-autonomy, Level 4.

241
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,270
This is where you become
those mission commanders,

242
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,003
and it's what we're building
right now at SentinelOne.

243
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,430
So, autonomous security is already real,

244
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,975
like we said, we are at Level 3,

245
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:15,780
we have some level of autonomy in the SOC.

246
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,610
And at SentinelOne, what this looks like

247
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,160
is not just at the end of the cycle,

248
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,650
auto triage, investigation,
all those things,

249
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,260
it actually starts at
the very, very beginning.

250
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,970
Security operations center is only as good

251
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,320
as the data that can be pulled

252
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,180
into that security operations center.

253
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,870
And so, we've built, or
acquired, Observo AI,

254
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,810
which helps us pull in the
right data at the right time

255
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,220
in the right ways, right?

256
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,560
We say here, perfect data, zero noise.

257
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,690
I actually think about
this a little differently,

258
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,450
make sure you have all of
the data that you need,

259
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,640
and none that you don't, right?

260
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,810
If any of you have worked in the SOC

261
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,920
and a few of you have,

262
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,090
hunting through meaningless
like security valueless data

263
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,520
as you're trying to go through an incident

264
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,230
is incredibly infuriating.

265
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,420
You already have enough work to do,

266
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,840
now you have 10 times as
much data to sift through,

267
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,840
90% of which is completely
useless during that incident.

268
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,000
So, you wanna pull in
exactly what you need

269
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,770
and nothing that you don't.

270
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,170
We also need to be able
to answer questions

271
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,700
incredibly quickly,

272
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,250
it's why SentinelOne has
made huge performance

273
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,890
and scalability improvements
to our query engine.

274
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,400
We have an industry-leading
query engine and AI SIEM,

275
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,380
and that's gonna be incredibly important

276
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,990
for the agentic and
autonomous SOC as well.

277
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,920
These toolsets don't disappear,
what uses them changes.

278
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,430
So what took humans hours or days to do

279
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,180
will take agentic users
seconds or minutes.

280
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,800
But in order for that to be true,

281
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,890
the query also has to return
at that timescale, right?

282
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,270
It needs to be able to ask the questions

283
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,410
and get the response it needs,

284
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,640
which is why we've built

285
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,920
this massively parallel query engine

286
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,310
as the basis for our
security operations center.

287
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,210
And, finally, because
we have these toolsets,

288
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,960
we plan to offer a bunch of out
of the box agentic workflows

289
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,220
to all of you on our platform,

290
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,200
and Joe's gonna show you
that in just a minute,

291
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,210
but that will be generally applicable

292
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,700
for all users and all organizations

293
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,860
that partner with SentinelOne.

294
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,590
We're at re:Invent,
most of you build stuff,

295
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,020
you're coding, or you're doing low-code,

296
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,050
or maybe you're using things
like cloud-code-to-prototype,

297
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,540
I know I am, I used to
be a software engineer,

298
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,650
they haven't let me touch that

299
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,780
in a really, really long
time for good reason,

300
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,310
but I'm starting to play with it again

301
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,900
in my personal life, and it's really fun.

302
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,820
So, we've also released the
ability to unleash that data

303
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,650
for your own agentic agents and workflows

304
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,600
via our Purple AI MCP server,

305
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,240
and we'll talk a little bit
more about that in a minute.

306
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,370
- One of the things that I
like to highlight on this,

307
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,120
because as a Solutions
Engineer-focused person,

308
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,010
I love these slides
that they come up with,

309
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,950
but whenever I see 20X
performance upgrades,

310
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,757
it always makes me a little bit like,

311
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:57,870
"Well, is that just a number,
or do you really mean it?"

312
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,670
We just ran something

313
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,130
called the SentinelOne
ThreatOps World Championship

314
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,260
where we ran 3,000 people

315
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,510
through a capture the flag exercise,

316
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,120
and I built it, me and my team.

317
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,250
And one of our biggest concerns was...

318
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,630
We had part of our game

319
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,340
where they would have to craft queries,

320
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,590
and we wanted to see how
quickly they could do it.

321
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,900
Our biggest concern was
they would figure out

322
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,160
our cheat code.

323
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,050
Our system is so fast

324
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,800
that you can do star
contains and then a string,

325
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,740
and it won't tip over like a legacy SIEM,

326
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,060
or a legacy data platform,

327
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,030
or take a week to pull back the data.

328
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,700
You can literally do this
across weeks or months of data,

329
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,890
and it'll handle it just fine.

330
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,500
And that's what the 20X
performance upgrade is,

331
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,720
even on inefficient queries like that,

332
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,230
the backend is so strong and so fast

333
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,760
that we were literally concerned

334
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,980
if one of our players figures out

335
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,600
that they don't have to write a query,

336
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,960
they can just do star contains
the thing and find it,

337
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,310
the game would be over.

338
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,410
Luckily, nobody figured it out,

339
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,480
nobody knew our cheat
code, and our game went on,

340
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,760
and it was an absolute success.

341
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,410
- I would love to see an agentic system,

342
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,550
they might take that approach.

343
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,660
But...
(Joe laughing)

344
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,493
Yeah.

345
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:08,663
So this is what we have today,

346
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:11,970
this is all available right now.

347
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,230
And so, what does this mean?

348
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,720
Like, let's go back to the
human user for a second.

349
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,380
All of this helps enhance and
accelerate that human user,

350
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,213
right?

351
00:14:20,213 --> 00:14:22,350
So, we start with gaining visibility,

352
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,820
that's getting the data in,

353
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,460
we see 80% reduction in noise,

354
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,340
and a hundred times
faster than legacy SIEMs,

355
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,690
that's what we see in our benchmarking

356
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,120
with our current systems.

357
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,320
And because of that,

358
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,620
we'll have faster, more
real-time detection.

359
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,453
What does it say?

360
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:39,510
It's a little small for me right now,

361
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,650
but in the 60% range of
detection, efficiency increases.

362
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,990
And because you're able
to detect things faster,

363
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,480
you can move through to
investigation faster,

364
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,160
you can get that done faster as well.

365
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,167
So triage an investigation with Purple AI

366
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:53,640
and the autonomous SOC,

367
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,000
40% faster than it was
without these tools.

368
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,900
And all of this leads to
just generally a 55% increase

369
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,790
in the ability to respond, remediate,

370
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,870
and move forward, right?

371
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,290
So these have very, very
real efficiency gains

372
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,780
for our users and for organizations,

373
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,680
but it really is still about
that analyst experience.

374
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,800
So, we've talked a little bit
about the analyst experience,

375
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,600
you've seen the sort of like life cycle

376
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,310
from visibility to response,

377
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,730
what are the actual capabilities
in the autonomous SOC

378
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,890
that drive these improvements?

379
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,920
It starts with auto
triage through Purple AI,

380
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,900
helping you surface what you should

381
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,400
or should not care about upfront

382
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,970
out of the large number of like signals

383
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,770
and maybe even large number of detections,

384
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,450
depending on your organization.

385
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,300
We can then help you hunt and investigate

386
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,700
with dynamic agent-based reasoning,

387
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,790
we can even help you enrich
and ask further questions

388
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,850
via our hyper-automation platform.

389
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,800
So something that
actually our internal SOC

390
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,730
at SentinelOne does

391
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,410
is they use agents embedded
in hyper-automation workflows

392
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,930
that not only decide
what questions to ask,

393
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,080
but how to branch to the next
step in the automated workflow

394
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,420
to pull that back and reduce the time

395
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,120
that a human needs to spend
on each individual incident.

396
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,970
And, of course, you have things
like recommended actions,

397
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,500
detection rule creation

398
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,103
as you move towards that more
proactive model of security.

399
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,880
All right, I think this is my
chance to turn it over to Joe

400
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,590
to actually show you, right?

401
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,090
Seeing is believing.

402
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,970
So, let's start to talk
a little bit about this.

403
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,243
- So, let me start with
a very quick story.

404
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,270
Again, what I do, one
of the things that I do,

405
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,190
is I give demonstrations

406
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,700
to people like Forrester and Gartner

407
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,117
where they give us scenarios and they say,

408
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:44,940
"Joe, we wanna see this thing
live in your environment

409
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,530
and how you interact with it."

410
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:50,220
And so, I'm setting up
infrastructure for Forrester,

411
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,040
and they say, "Joe, we wanna
start with a phishing email,

412
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,680
then we wanna see a lateral
movement compromise,

413
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,150
and we wanna see all this other stuff."

414
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,770
So what basically happens is,

415
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:02,640
I have to build hacking infrastructure

416
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,560
in order to show them it's fine.

417
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,393
So what do I do?

418
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:08,670
I turn to a cloud provider
and I choose Microsoft Azure,

419
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,503
and I say, "Okay,

420
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:12,780
I'm gonna spin up a
domain called Forrester,

421
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,823
but it's gonna be F0orrester,

422
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,280
and I'm gonna set up a
fake login page for Okta,

423
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,480
that's where my user's gonna go

424
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,730
and be tricked to give
away their credentials.

425
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,630
I set it up,

426
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,310
and the thing only needs to
live for maybe three days.

427
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,680
And I say, Microsoft is gonna catch me,

428
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,150
'cause they're good, they're Microsoft,

429
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,360
but it'll take at least a week, okay?

430
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,950
I'm out in the backyard with my kids,

431
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,600
we're playing on Saturday,

432
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,140
and all of a sudden my phone
rings, and I pull out my phone,

433
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,140
and it's a guy, a famous guy
in our company named JAGS,

434
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,490
his name is Jose Andres
something Guerrero, but-

435
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,323
- [Nick] I'm not gonna butcher it,

436
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,156
but he runs-
- It's-

437
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:56,034
Our SentinelLabs'

438
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:56,867
research team-
- Yes.

439
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,700
- [Nick] Here at SentinelOne.

440
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,757
- Literally his name,
everybody just calls him JAGS.

441
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:03,960
"Why am I getting a call
from JAGS on a Saturday?"

442
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,017
And I pick up the phone,

443
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,630
"Hey, JAGS, what's going on?"

444
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,040
Never talked to the guy before in my life,

445
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,990
I just know he was kind of famous.

446
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,197
And he goes,

447
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:15,150
"So, Joe, we think your
account has been compromised.

448
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,920
And I'm like, "Oh, that's not good.

449
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,690
You know, what do you need?"

450
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,080
He says, "Well, there's
some hacking infrastructure

451
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,040
in Azure,

452
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,960
we think an attacker is using your account

453
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,430
to create this infrastructure,

454
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,830
and they're impersonating Forrester.

455
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,890
And like we've got all hands on deck,

456
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,230
we're about to nuke your
account from orbit."

457
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,880
And I say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa.

458
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,840
Don't worry, it's not
an attacker, it's me."

459
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,760
And, of course, he goes,
"What do you mean it's you?"

460
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,447
And I say, (imitates muttering)

461
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:44,310
"Let me explain."

462
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,960
And I explained to him the whole scenario,

463
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,670
and he goes, "Well,
it's a little bit late.

464
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,390
Microsoft has destroyed your
entire environment, it's gone.

465
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,350
Good luck."

466
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,367
And afterwards, I asked him, I said,

467
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:57,030
"Well, you know, what
was the process for you?"

468
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,620
And it was interesting to see

469
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,277
they got a call from Microsoft,

470
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:01,980
"One of your employees is compromised,"

471
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,247
he then researches me,

472
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:06,450
"Does Joe have any alerts
inside of our console?

473
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,910
Has Joe traveled anywhere?

474
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,460
Any potential password compromises?"

475
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,460
And they had four or
five hours worth of work,

476
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,150
four or five hours worth of work

477
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,877
that I feel really bad about, okay,

478
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:22,080
'cause they didn't need to do it.

479
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,267
Before they called me to say,

480
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:29,130
"Joe, is this real?"

481
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,300
Four to five hours, it's a
lot of work on a weekend,

482
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,230
I felt really bad.

483
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,770
I sent him a couple of six
packs of beverages for it,

484
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,570
because I felt so bad.

485
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,180
But what we're talking
about with all of this,

486
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,140
with AI, it's no longer four
or five hours on the weekend,

487
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,520
we're talking about the AI
doing all of that work for you,

488
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,980
looking at, "Is Joe Poyner compromised?

489
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,780
Has he received any phishing emails?

490
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,370
Has he gone anywhere suspicious?

491
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,160
Has he been traveling anywhere?"

492
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,390
That's what we're talking about.

493
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,710
So, let me show you.

494
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,240
The very first step is
our agentic AI coming in

495
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,680
and automatically triaging
all of our alerts.

496
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,860
And so, we've got a possible
compromised identity,

497
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,230
and we're gonna tell it
start an investigation.

498
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,463
And what it's going to do,

499
00:20:17,463 --> 00:20:21,720
it's going to process
through the various steps

500
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,410
and not just a static list, okay?

501
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,040
Not a static list of A, B, C, and D,

502
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,810
but a reasoning model,

503
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,407
where it takes a look at it and says,

504
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:34,740
"Is this a possibility?

505
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,480
No, we've ruled that one out.

506
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,180
Now let's try other possibilities."

507
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,710
And so, what we can see is,

508
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,630
it's conducted the investigation

509
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,380
and then highlighted now
that it needs review.

510
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,520
And this one in particular
is very important,

511
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,190
that we want a human in the loop.

512
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,190
So, we can see, here are
the investigation steps

513
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,570
that it went through,

514
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,450
highlighting things
like initial discovery,

515
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,840
alert analysis, and impact assessment.

516
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,840
And these are all
dynamically-generated and executed.

517
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,890
Now, what this is is that our agentic AI

518
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,160
allows you to do this at scale.

519
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,410
So, if you think about it,

520
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,650
where we were talking
about earlier with JAGS,

521
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,600
my poor, suffering JAGS,

522
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,290
who had to investigate my false positive,

523
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,810
imagine there's not just one alert

524
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:35,400
on the weekend for Joe
Poyner, but there's 10.

525
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,070
We've now eaten up his entire weekend,

526
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,140
he's now investigating all of these,

527
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,200
and most of them turn out
to be false positives.

528
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,720
He chases them down the rabbit hole,

529
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,307
but then eventually he gets
to Joe Poyner and he says,

530
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,600
"No, it's okay, don't worry about it."

531
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,810
The AI though, we can let the AI churn

532
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,630
on these types of repetitive tasks,

533
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,830
then it'll bring it to us,

534
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,630
and then all we have to do

535
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,470
is make the five minute
decision of yes or no,

536
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,810
we agree or disagree.

537
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,420
So, let's see this in action

538
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,540
where Purple AI kicks
off the investigation

539
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,230
for the impossible traveler alert

540
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,140
that we showed on our first page.

541
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,550
So what it's going to do

542
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,387
is it's going to take a look and say,

543
00:22:22,387 --> 00:22:24,060
"Who is the user?"

544
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,160
We have an impossible traveler alert,

545
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,230
let's take a look at who the user is,

546
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,310
in this case, it's James
Sabala, he's a Cloud Engineer.

547
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,530
We've gone over to Workday,

548
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,150
pulled all of his information,

549
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,680
and we've noted he's logging
in from an unusual location.

550
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,790
So at this point,

551
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:45,637
Purple AI hypothesizes and says to itself,

552
00:22:45,637 --> 00:22:50,160
"Hey, he's probably had
an account compromise.

553
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,140
So what do we need to do?"

554
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,030
Just like what JAGS did with me,

555
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,550
is he needs to reach out to the end user.

556
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,670
And that's the power of Purple AI

557
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,520
is that it can reach
out via hyper-automation

558
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,500
and ask the end user

559
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,850
whether or not they are
actually compromised.

560
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,950
Now, once we've confirmed with that user,

561
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,430
we wanna go ahead and
review Proofpoint alerts.

562
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,650
We wanna take a look and try and establish

563
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,350
how has that account been compromised?

564
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:24,000
Was it compromised by
phishing or something else?

565
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,980
If we take a look though,

566
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,710
we also have other pieces of telemetry

567
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,420
that we need to pull together

568
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,510
by querying systems like EDR telemetry,

569
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,030
by looking at other sources like Workday,

570
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,810
or even AWS logs to see

571
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:43,683
has this user account been
compromised in some other way?

572
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,970
Now, our AI doesn't stop at investigation,

573
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,220
Purple AI agentically surfaces

574
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,350
pre-approved recommended actions

575
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,100
via hyper-automation or automation suite.

576
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,660
So, for example, we can see here,

577
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,810
it's gonna suggest that
we rotate AWS credentials,

578
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,530
block the attacker IP, and
even restrict S3 access,

579
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,510
and, of course, the most important one,

580
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,973
suspend the user in Okta.

581
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,310
Now the last very most important piece

582
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,867
that I personally like is it says,

583
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:20,670
"Guys, now that we've detected
something in our environment,

584
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,640
we understand how this
attacker potentially works,

585
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,950
let's detect them sooner."

586
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,590
And so, that very last step
that you saw in the video

587
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,310
was one where it asks
to not only take action

588
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,143
on the single user,

589
00:24:33,143 --> 00:24:34,800
but "Let's create a rule

590
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,040
so that any similar
detections down the road

591
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,510
are detected sooner and
understood quicker."

592
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,070
This is the dream, guys,

593
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,280
agentic AI taking away so much work

594
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,080
that we do every single day,

595
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,730
and simply automating it,

596
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,731
and I, for one, welcome
our machine overlords.

597
00:24:53,731 --> 00:24:55,080
(Nick chuckling)
If they wanna take

598
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,410
my boring work away from
me, I say let 'em do it.

599
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,580
- Thanks so much, Joe.

600
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,260
So, look, that went really fast,

601
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,820
and I think that's kind of the point.

602
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,460
But if we think back
to the really painful,

603
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,000
time consuming grind that we
started our presentation with,

604
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
that grind has become less
burdensome and more interesting,

605
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,860
something that a human
can really dive into

606
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,600
and use their time effectively.

607
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,330
No more are we doing
endless triage of alerts,

608
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,210
no more are we pouring
through tons of noisy data

609
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,470
in the SIEM,

610
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,660
we're not even necessarily
having to build out

611
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,250
our automation playbooks anymore,

612
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,130
it's all being done by Purple
AI and the autonomous SOC.

613
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,380
So across the entire life cycle, right,

614
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,240
from triage all the way through

615
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,890
to proactive risk management,

616
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,700
we've seen how agentic workflows
can take away the burden

617
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,553
and leave users in control and in command.

618
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,670
So, from frustrated and very frustrated

619
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,950
and hours and days of work,

620
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,200
the SOC analyst life changes;

621
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,890
from hours to minutes, maybe
from minutes to seconds,

622
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:03,090
from barely keeping up
to always staying ahead,

623
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,160
I think that makes for a happier SOC team,

624
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,560
I'm sure I would feel a lot better

625
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,050
if I wasn't doing 10,000
alerts worth of triage

626
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,550
every single day,

627
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,630
but, most importantly,

628
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,790
I think it helps you
keep your organizations

629
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,710
much, much more secure,

630
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,390
especially in a world where attackers

631
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,600
are trying to leverage the
same types of technologies

632
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,243
in the reverse order, right,
or in the opposite way.

633
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:27,923
All right.

634
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:30,420
So, we talked a little
bit about how SentinelOne

635
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,830
is doing this itself,

636
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,710
just as a quick reminder,
you guys are builders,

637
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,140
you may wanna use AI in your own ways,

638
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,120
you may be building your own agents,

639
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,700
or leveraging other models and agents

640
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,160
that exist out in the ecosystem,

641
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,170
we believe that the Singularity platform

642
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,920
and Purple AI enables a
toolset for those agents,

643
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,290
and those agents could
be ours at SentinelOne,

644
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,090
they could also be yours.

645
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,910
This is why we recently launched GA,

646
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,190
our Purple AI MCP server,

647
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,780
it's actually fully open source,

648
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,940
it's available on GitHub today.

649
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,500
So, you know, personally,

650
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,820
what I'm really hoping for

651
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,900
is that I'm gonna go home,

652
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,580
and next week I'm gonna go take a look

653
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,170
and see all of the amazing stuff

654
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,310
that you all have built

655
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,140
on top of Purple AI MCP

656
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,460
using the autonomous SOC

657
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,350
and some of the ideas
that we've talked about

658
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,403
a little bit today.

659
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,700
All right, how can you
use it this week, Joe,

660
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,533
what can we do?

661
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,040
- Oh my gosh, if you wanna see this,

662
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,590
so we've talked about a
lot of really cool stuff,

663
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,030
but if you wanna actually come and see it,

664
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,500
there's a couple of different things.

665
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,210
One, we have The Security Social,

666
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,280
that's an invite-only exclusive event.

667
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,520
If you have been invited,
we hope to see you there.

668
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,140
But one of our cool events that we do

669
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,700
is Mortal vs. Machine.

670
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,680
This is our booth on the expo,

671
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,270
and we have an analyst with
10-plus years of experience,

672
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,680
the guy is good,

673
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,760
and we invite somebody up from
the audience to take him on.

674
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,740
He doesn't get AI, you get AI,
and you have three questions.

675
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,880
So far, we have
demoralized him very badly,

676
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,670
because he's lost a vast
majority of the time,

677
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,000
but it truly does highlight
that somebody with no experience

678
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,770
inside of the SentinelOne platform

679
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,160
can pick up AI and
become as good or better

680
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,730
than somebody with 10 years of experience.

681
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,110
We also have our AWS GameDay
Experience on Thursday,

682
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,200
we welcome any and all to come sign up

683
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,020
where you're going to be
able to play for some prizes

684
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,250
in AWS GameDay,

685
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,430
and see how SentinelOne
and AWS come together

686
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,140
into a cohesive system.

687
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,800
And then AWS on SentinelOne.com;

688
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,130
so we ask if you're interested
in any of this stuff,

689
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,580
please, go out to these
resources, test us,

690
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,413
you know, say,

691
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:44,280
"You guys said some cool stuff,

692
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,190
let me get my hands on it
to actually prove it out

693
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,230
and see if you mean it."

694
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,180
And I'll just say thank you everybody

695
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,290
for attending our talk today,

696
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,810
and, everybody, have a nice
rest of your conference.

697
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,880
- If you guys have any questions,
please come up and ask,

698
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,850
we'd be happy to answer
