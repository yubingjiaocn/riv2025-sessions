1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,629
Um, good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:03,528
Thank you for coming and joining us today.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,219
Appreciate you joining us

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,219
instead of going to see

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,909
Werner's presentation, obviously we, uh,

6
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:12,118
we're more exciting than he is. It's true,

7
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:12,898
it's true,

8
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:15,759
um. Today

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,978
we're going to be talking about Amazon Leo

10
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,670
and how we built this low Earth orbit satellite

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,699
system on top of AWS.

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,399
I'm Gary.

13
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:27,239
With me is my, with me is my colleague, Andy.

14
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,219
We'll be taking you through this today.

15
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,600
But before we get started,

16
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,798
I just want to highlight that this is a session

17
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:35,899
about Amazon on AWS.

18
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:38,990
Anyone out here familiar with Amazon?

19
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:42,548
Maybe these are some brands that you're familiar with.

20
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,810
Anyone have a fire TV at home?

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,439
Yeah, a little bit of Amazon Music, groceries

22
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,459
delivered from Fresh.

23
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,259
How about watching NFL football on Prime?

24
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,959
Yeah? Alright,

25
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:57,700
so you're familiar with the kind of work that we do.

26
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:00,509
What's interesting is, Amazon is

27
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:02,810
actually treated like any other customer

28
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:04,129
on AWS.

29
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,439
They don't get a lot of special treatment.

30
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:09,040
They ask for a lot of special treatment, but they don't

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,668
always get it.

32
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,909
Which meant what means is

33
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,329
you as customers of AWS get

34
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:16,549
all the same benefits as Amazon does.

35
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,250
They utilize the same resources on AWS

36
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,359
that you do. Now you

37
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,698
may do different things with them.

38
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,278
You may not have events like Prime Day.

39
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,778
These are just some data points from this

40
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:29,939
past summer's Prime Day.

41
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:32,400
Numbers like

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,909
8 8.9 trillion log

43
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:36,019
events in guard duty.

44
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:37,549
Big numbers

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,379
Candisa streams millions,

46
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:42,909
1.5 quadrillion

47
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:44,528
elastic cash requests.

48
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:46,918
I can vouch that my wife

49
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:49,219
in her searches on Amazon that day.

50
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,689
At least delivered a million of those.

51
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:55,870
Now, your services may not

52
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,230
require this type of scale.

53
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,230
But the benefit you get by having Amazon

54
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,769
be a customer on AWS

55
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:05,489
is they really push the envelope and they force

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,448
AWS to push the envelope,

57
00:02:07,948 --> 00:02:09,949
force us to do better, force us to be able

58
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,729
to deliver bigger.

59
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:12,808
And as a result,

60
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,389
US customers of AWS benefit

61
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:16,028
from all of this.

62
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,308
Amazon is constantly pushing us

63
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:21,189
to higher and higher heights.

64
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,389
But today we've gone even higher.

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
L minus 7 minutes

66
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,199
status check to proceed with terminal count.

67
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,710
Atlas systems propulsion. Go

68
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,419
hydraulics go.

69
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:37,278
Sorry, there should be audio. Oh, you guys, you

70
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:38,740
guys can hear the audio. I'm sorry,

71
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:40,699
go LO 2

72
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,409
LH 2.

73
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:51,439
And I'm like

74
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:55,229
striker, you have permission to launch.

75
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,379
Proceeding with the count 321.

76
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:06,669
Yeah C

77
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,118
We are now moving at 4000 miles an hour.

78
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:21,439
nominal mechanical proceeding nominally. All

79
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,659
Kuiper satellites have been deployed successfully.

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,960
Congrats, Kuiper.

81
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,569
Amazon Leo,

82
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:29,558
or some of you may recall it being named Kuiper

83
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:30,360
Project Kuiper.

84
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:34,058
Now pushing the envelope of the

85
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:36,270
planet. We are going now

86
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,929
into space, we're building satellite systems,

87
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:41,550
satellite systems that are bringing reliable

88
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,278
connectivity across the globe

89
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,050
for consumers, businesses and enterprise

90
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,149
and government use cases.

91
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:50,159
AWS is part of that

92
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,479
process. OK,

93
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,349
that's what we're gonna be talking about today.

94
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,580
So let's look at our agenda. It's actually quite

95
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,240
simple. First

96
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,258
we're gonna talk about how Amazon Leo

97
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,860
built its service using AWS.

98
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,919
Again, I want to reiterate they're using the same AWS

99
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,879
services as all of you have access to.

100
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,500
Second, we want to give you some guidance

101
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,520
on how you can take advantage

102
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,939
of Amazon Leo for your own services.

103
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,920
So you can apply it to your business.

104
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,970
OK. So to get us started,

105
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,149
I'm going to hand over to Andy

106
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:28,850
to tell you more about how Amazon Leo was built.

107
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,798
Great. Hi folks. Uh, can you hear me?

108
00:04:32,278 --> 00:04:34,319
Great, cool. So, uh, we are

109
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,358
gonna talk about how we build Amazon Leo

110
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:37,338
on AWS,

111
00:04:37,798 --> 00:04:40,160
and I gotta tell you, building something at the scale of Amazon

112
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,278
Leo is pretty much impossible, and

113
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:44,309
it's not just one impossible problem, it's like 5

114
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:45,500
impossible problems

115
00:04:45,798 --> 00:04:48,000
starting from like building at the lowest layer custom

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,309
AIs and custom hardware to build a 100

117
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:52,720
gigabit per second communication satellite

118
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,160
to building a custom e-commerce stack to

119
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,420
run telecommunication services for the world.

120
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,738
This is not a talk about how AWS

121
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:02,338
solved all those problems for us.

122
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:04,869
This is a talk about how we use AWS

123
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:06,928
to not reinvent

124
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:09,790
the same solutions to commodity problems

125
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,009
that everyone else has already

126
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,540
invented and instead enabling

127
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,509
us to focus on our core business problems.

128
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:19,439
So let's start with an overview of the Kuiper

129
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,649
system. As you might imagine,

130
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:23,769
we have some satellites and some ground

131
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:25,769
stations, and if you zoom like way out from

132
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:27,809
Kuiper, it looks a lot like

133
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:30,290
a cell network that you use to connect

134
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,850
to the internet from your phone every day.

135
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,778
You know, instead of a phone in the Kuiper

136
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:36,838
system, we have a customer terminal

137
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:39,338
on your roof or somewhere with a view of the sky.

138
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,809
And it connects wirelessly not to

139
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,850
a cell tower somewhere nearby, like in

140
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,670
the parking lot,

141
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,358
but to one of our satellites in low Earth orbit

142
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:50,178
about 600 kilometers above the Earth.

143
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,959
You can't run a fiber optic cable up there, so

144
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,119
instead we have to build another wireless link,

145
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,000
our gateway link, to connect our satellites

146
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,069
to our ground gateway antennas,

147
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:03,660
which are in hundreds of locations all over the world.

148
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Once we're back down on the ground, we can do like

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,278
normal things. We can connect our ground gateways

150
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,319
to fiber optics and from there to

151
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:11,838
our

152
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,410
to our network core and then to the internet

153
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,939
or to your private networks.

154
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,028
And by building the wireless links

155
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:20,600
ourselves

156
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,730
and by building the ground network

157
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,910
using AWS Edge sites and

158
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,088
AWS Direct Connect,

159
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,509
we're building the fastest, most secure

160
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:30,850
space-based network in the world.

161
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:32,629
So

162
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,329
When we started on this a few years ago,

163
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,619
You know,

164
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,569
We have to solve 5 impossible problems, so we have to

165
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:40,298
start somewhere.

166
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,189
And where we started was by building,

167
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:43,670
uh, our satellite.

168
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,389
This is not something you just like go buy a satellite

169
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:47,910
that does 100 gigabit per second,

170
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:50,509
you know, uh, 100 gigabit per second

171
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,309
communication, low Earth orbit,

172
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,649
and you can build build thousands of them. We

173
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,798
had to build this from the ground up. This is all,

174
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:58,009
all our technology.

175
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:01,278
And the way you start with something like

176
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:03,399
this is we're going to reuse as much as

177
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,540
we can even though we are building from the ground

178
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,619
up. And so we built with a lot

179
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:08,170
of K

180
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:10,559
KO's commodity off the shelf

181
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:11,689
parts.

182
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,160
And if you look at our satellite,

183
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,579
it's kind of like a data center rack

184
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:17,899
that we launched into space.

185
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:20,319
You know, it has a commodity Ethernet switch,

186
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:22,399
and it has a bunch of line cards to run our network,

187
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:25,019
and they run Linux, and we do IP networking

188
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:27,059
all throughout the satellite. It's just kind of like a

189
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:29,238
big, you know, big rack in space.

190
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:31,399
Our flight computers connected to the switch,

191
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:32,619
all the line cards.

192
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,149
But you know it's also a little bit like

193
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:37,338
another thing which is it's like launching a car into

194
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:39,449
space. It has a canvas like your car does,

195
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:42,149
which is a like a terrestrial, normal

196
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:43,189
terrestrial thing

197
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:45,660
that in your car connects

198
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,809
your computer to all of the sensors

199
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:49,369
and actuators in your car.

200
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:52,500
And on our satellite we do kind of the same thing.

201
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,250
Our flight computer connects through a canvas

202
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,899
to some really interesting space devices like

203
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:59,699
star trackers and reaction wheels

204
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,559
and our propulsion unit

205
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:03,720
and a torque rod,

206
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,540
and um and with those devices

207
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,619
we can sense where we are in space

208
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:09,678
and we can control

209
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:11,980
the attitude of our satellite and we

210
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,178
can propel it.

211
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,420
And you know, on those, though they are interesting

212
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,420
space devices, we again build them on like

213
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,778
normal terrestrial automotive SOCs

214
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:22,338
like a Cyprus SOC.

215
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,350
And all those

216
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:26,970
and for the most part, our custom hardware

217
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,009
that runs in the data center rack in

218
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,119
space, those use also

219
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,119
terrestrial SOCs like a Xylynx

220
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,048
versus SOC.

221
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,399
But you know you can't, you can't just buy all the

222
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,200
parts for this,

223
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,719
you know, uh, the part you can't buy in

224
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,058
particular is the RF modem

225
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:45,119
that is the, the heart of the Kuiper

226
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:47,119
network. We had to build that ourselves. That's

227
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:47,779
a custom ASIC.

228
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:49,580
We built it from scratch.

229
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:52,529
Even when you're building an ASIC from scratch, you don't

230
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:53,408
start from scratch.

231
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,808
You build a with a lot of other people's IP

232
00:08:55,808 --> 00:08:56,450
you use

233
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,029
arm instruction set, and that's what we did.

234
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:01,190
So we built that from the ground up.

235
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:04,500
Using reusable components, and we had to

236
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,399
spend years like optimizing our code,

237
00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:08,979
optimizing that chip, multiple revisions.

238
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,379
That was definitely the hard part. That's what we wanted to

239
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:11,940
focus on.

240
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:15,979
But it turns out no one actually cares

241
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:17,340
if we built the satellite.

242
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,940
What everyone cares about is actually does

243
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,019
it work in space. Like our biggest

244
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,619
responsibility in Kuiper is not actually

245
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:25,879
to get a communications

246
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:28,298
network working. It's to not screw up

247
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:30,538
low Earth orbit. We take that

248
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:32,979
space responsibility really seriously.

249
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:35,580
If we mess it up, like our kids will be cursing

250
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,000
us when they're our age.

251
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,379
So the thing that we have to do

252
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,418
that's most important to building Kuiper.

253
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,729
Is that we have to figure out how to iterate

254
00:09:43,908 --> 00:09:44,889
and test

255
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:47,590
space things before we're in space.

256
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,500
And you know, space is a really interesting environment.

257
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,960
It's like hot and then cold. It's

258
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,690
dark and then bright,

259
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
and it really matters that it's dark and bright

260
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,969
because we get our power from the sun.

261
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,219
So we have to test

262
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,139
hundreds and then thousands and then actually millions

263
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,548
of combinations of how our satellite's

264
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:06,570
going to be in space.

265
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:09,259
And this is something AWS can help us with.

266
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:11,119
So we do a lot of simulation.

267
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:14,129
We stimulate all these combinations, both normal

268
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:16,580
things that we want to have happen

269
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:18,109
like flying and

270
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,489
abnormal things like getting reset

271
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,369
by radiation at just the wrong time.

272
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:23,989
We test all these things.

273
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,658
And how do we do it?

274
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,070
Well, you know, we basically do it by building a

275
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,969
physics-based game engine

276
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:32,418
and putting our satellite in it, putting

277
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:34,548
a model of our satellite, and probably everyone,

278
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,109
you know, everyone's done this, right?

279
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:39,190
So you have to build like a big game

280
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,710
engine loop in which you have like a really precise

281
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,950
physical model of everything you want to simulate.

282
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,349
And so we, we have a very precise

283
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:48,700
physical model of our satellite, for example,

284
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:50,820
like how does it respond to torque,

285
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:53,389
uh, you know, how big is it, how much does it weigh,

286
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:55,570
what is its inertia look like, center,

287
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:58,440
uh, center of mass, all these physical properties.

288
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:00,229
We put this in the simulation.

289
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,908
And then all those interesting space devices I

290
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:04,908
mentioned like reaction wheels that

291
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:07,149
spin and torque rods that also spin

292
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:08,450
and propulsion units that

293
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:10,099
propel us in one direction,

294
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:12,788
and our sensors. We also have precise

295
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:15,250
physical models of all of those things.

296
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,210
So then in our simulation,

297
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:19,820
we wrote this code. It has to be us,

298
00:11:19,908 --> 00:11:21,489
it's our satellite after all.

299
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:24,129
In our satellite and in our simulation,

300
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:25,928
we're constantly updating

301
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:29,469
the position and velocity and rotational

302
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:31,830
rotational acceleration and angular

303
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,070
velocity of our satellite in

304
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,349
all different dimensions so that we can

305
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:38,029
just kind of propagate it straightforward.

306
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:40,928
And then we're also applying forces to it in our

307
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:43,178
simulation. This is what it does. We're applying

308
00:11:43,178 --> 00:11:44,038
like gravity

309
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:46,298
and forces produced

310
00:11:46,298 --> 00:11:48,450
by our by our actuators.

311
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,210
And then we're also applying our

312
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:51,840
controls.

313
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:54,440
We're applying controls from our flight computer

314
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:57,759
in that produce these forces, and we're just

315
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,058
updating that loop over and over again, just like

316
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:00,979
a game engine would.

317
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,918
And we built this. We got it working on like

318
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:07,259
our laptop or like on one Linux box.

319
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,158
But as I mentioned, we have to simulate like

320
00:12:10,158 --> 00:12:12,538
every combination that we're going to see in space

321
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,759
before we fly,

322
00:12:14,038 --> 00:12:15,460
because we really don't want to crash.

323
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,840
And so this is something that AWS can help us

324
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,658
with. And so we basically

325
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,158
use AWS to scale up our simulation.

326
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:25,538
So we built, you know, like a serverless

327
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:27,769
application for spinning up constellation

328
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:28,538
simulations.

329
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,190
And you use this API gateway and you can

330
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,879
like say,

331
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,229
create a simulation for me. And you

332
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:36,308
can ask it like, is my simulation

333
00:12:36,308 --> 00:12:38,308
running? And you can say I'm done with my

334
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:39,450
simulation, kill it.

335
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:40,830
So that's the API.

336
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,739
And then behind that, we're running a bunch of

337
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:45,340
asynchronous workflows that like

338
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,729
start up EC2 instances and

339
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:49,759
wait for AC2 instances, and

340
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,739
tear them down and retry

341
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,239
and load our code, start the simulation, like

342
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,359
this is what the step function workflow does.

343
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,000
And kind of the coolest thing about this

344
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:02,428
is that, you know, inside there when

345
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,918
we're actually ready to run this,

346
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,250
we can run our actual flight code

347
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,759
on graviton instances because as I mentioned,

348
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:11,038
we're, you know, like not reinventing

349
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:12,558
instruction sets or anything

350
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:15,349
we're using ARM and Graviton

351
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:16,658
is an ARM-based

352
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,609
platform

353
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:20,210
and so we can run our unmodified flight code

354
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,668
on bare metal EC2 instances

355
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,548
that run Graviton.

356
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:28,149
And what's even cooler than that is that

357
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:30,399
um you know I mentioned that we're using like

358
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,979
standard automotive SOC which uh

359
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:35,450
often or like always or something

360
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,229
have FPGAs on them and we're using FPG

361
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:40,359
FPGA's field programmable Gatorades

362
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:43,538
for the most time sensitive, uh,

363
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:46,099
time sensitive operations that we do on our

364
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:46,739
satellite

365
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,460
and those typically are like,

366
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:50,950
uh, radio like listening to radios

367
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,269
and, uh, sending radio signals generating

368
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,619
RF. Uh, or

369
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:58,158
a time or packet processing at gigabits

370
00:13:58,259 --> 00:13:58,908
per second,

371
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,469
and we can run that FPGA on the,

372
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,058
um, our FPGA code on the FPGA

373
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:06,119
of bare metal instances with FPGAs

374
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:08,080
so we basically can run the satellite

375
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:09,558
pretty much unmodified.

376
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,090
On bare metal instances.

377
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:13,070
So this

378
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:14,629
enables us

379
00:14:15,048 --> 00:14:16,788
to scale up our testing

380
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:19,849
to where we need it to be to launch the Kuiper

381
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:20,408
satellite.

382
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,359
We did this before we launched our protoflight satellites,

383
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,440
you know, a couple of years ago, as you might have heard, and

384
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,259
once we launched, um,

385
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:31,019
we found that, yeah, it really

386
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,200
worked pretty much exactly the same way.

387
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,279
It was like almost indistinguishable. It

388
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,469
was, uh, pretty spooky that day. Like we were happy,

389
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:39,500
of course that's what we wanted to have happen, but

390
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:42,190
we always worried, and it turned out to be unfounded.

391
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:43,788
It totally worked. So

392
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:46,960
you know this is the first problem the

393
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,000
first problem we had to solve, and AWS helped

394
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,859
us scale up.

395
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:54,788
OK, so

396
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:58,109
But it's not enough to just like have a satellite

397
00:14:58,109 --> 00:15:00,048
that hangs out in orbit and doesn't crash,

398
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,950
uh, you know what you really have to be able to do is

399
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,969
you have to be able to control that satellite. Like again

400
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:07,700
we take space safety really seriously. It's

401
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,019
like way more important than actually serving

402
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:10,690
customers.

403
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:13,690
You know, if we screw this up, we don't get to serve customers,

404
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,099
so we have to be able to talk to our satellites

405
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:17,178
like all the time.

406
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,899
We have to talk to thousands thousands

407
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:20,808
up to 1,000s,

408
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:22,989
but right now like hundreds of satellites,

409
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:25,418
and uh we have to be able to monitor them.

410
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,580
We have to know what their current state is and we

411
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,700
have to be able to command them like please steer

412
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,750
around this thing that you might otherwise run into,

413
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:34,460
uh, so it's really important that we always be

414
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,609
able to know where they are and

415
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:37,820
always be able to command them.

416
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:40,700
And we don't mean always like in the next

417
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,450
second we mean always like,

418
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,119
you know, if you can't talk to your satellite for

419
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,330
after 4 hours, you have a serious

420
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,418
problem because, you know, after 8 hours

421
00:15:49,418 --> 00:15:50,739
you might kind of hit something.

422
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:53,418
So we just always have to be able to talk

423
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:54,219
to our satellite.

424
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,538
Maybe hardware is failing, doesn't matter, you

425
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,509
have to talk to it.

426
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:00,219
Uh, you know, maybe it's spinning in space

427
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:02,359
and it doesn't know which way is up or which way is down,

428
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,529
it doesn't matter. You have to be able to talk to it,

429
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,389
so we have to build

430
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:07,149
kind of from the ground up,

431
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,599
not like a normal IOT

432
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,090
system. hello.

433
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,918
Not like a normal IoT system that you connect

434
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:15,668
to the cloud,

435
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:16,798
but something

436
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,000
kind of like it.

437
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,619
Uh, you know, as I mentioned,

438
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:22,239
uh, Space IoT,

439
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:23,308
you know, we're.

440
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,080
Uh, yeah,

441
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,658
we have to always be able to talk, OK, and um.

442
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:33,918
Because Because,

443
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:36,158
uh, we have to always be able to

444
00:16:36,158 --> 00:16:38,399
talk, we optimize our management

445
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,479
network, our device cloud for space

446
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,038
IOT,

447
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,639
not for a high throughput or not for

448
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,739
high availability,

449
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:45,798
but, uh,

450
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:46,798
but for

451
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:49,440
eventually being able to talk, and

452
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
the inevitable outcome of

453
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,739
this is that we end up with low throughput

454
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,279
because we're just optimized for

455
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,519
being able to talk in any in any context.

456
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,469
So we have to talk to our whole constellation

457
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:03,168
and monitor it and control it

458
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,670
with actually like really pretty low throughput.

459
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:08,489
And what this means is

460
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:11,448
That we are constantly

461
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,307
working with,

462
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:14,327
we're constantly optimizing.

463
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,380
Which satellites we're gonna talk to when because

464
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,029
every second of radio time is

465
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:20,890
uh really

466
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:23,189
important we have to make the most effective

467
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,769
use of it,

468
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,608
so we're optimizing this

469
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,049
and um

470
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:28,769
in order to optimize

471
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,229
which satellites we talk to when and

472
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:33,459
which telemetry we're gonna get from them and which commands

473
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:34,430
we're gonna send when

474
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:36,229
we have to kind of know.

475
00:17:37,318 --> 00:17:39,529
What is where they will be at any given time

476
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:41,910
and whether we will need to send them a command

477
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,479
like it is time to steer

478
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:46,229
uh and what we also need to know

479
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:48,809
whether we will be able to talk to them successfully

480
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:51,348
because there could be RF interference or other satellites

481
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:52,229
around or something like that.

482
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,348
So in the space internet of things,

483
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:57,969
we're constantly communicating based on

484
00:17:57,969 --> 00:17:58,769
predicted state.

485
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:02,509
And to know and to know that we

486
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:04,380
have to create a precise

487
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:07,299
precise model of every object in low Earth

488
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,309
orbit, where it is right now and

489
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:11,509
where it will be in basically every

490
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:13,049
like 5 2nd interval

491
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,500
from now until we need to stop planning, which

492
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,029
is typically several days from now.

493
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:20,059
And there's tens of thousands of objects in low

494
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:20,729
Earth orbit,

495
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:22,239
and so that's many,

496
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:24,979
many, many things, uh, to have

497
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,180
in memory at one time.

498
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:28,180
And so what we do is,

499
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:29,118
uh,

500
00:18:29,578 --> 00:18:30,328
I should mention,

501
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:32,920
you know, people have known for kind of a long time,

502
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,519
uh, how to propagate

503
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:37,098
the state of an object in low Earth orbit, you

504
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:39,259
know, forward in time pretty much

505
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:40,380
as far as you want,

506
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:43,019
you know, if you know that an object is here with a position

507
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:45,199
and a velocity, you will definitely

508
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,400
be able to predict

509
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,019
pretty precisely where it will be in several

510
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:51,019
days or, you know, even in several

511
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:53,098
months, uh, but what we need

512
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,299
to be able to do is to be able to query that

513
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,410
model. To understand

514
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:57,989
where

515
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:01,108
our satellite is in relation to our ground gateways.

516
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,868
At any time in the future so that we can

517
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,930
optimize our communication.

518
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,140
So we built a service for this,

519
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,410
and the cool thing about it is that

520
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,309
it's basically a normal serverless

521
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:15,910
serverless application. And so the way we do this is

522
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,969
we run that model and we create

523
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:19,009
a complete

524
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:21,670
model of where all the objects in the sky will

525
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,608
be for several days,

526
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,299
and then we stick that all into uh

527
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:27,289
into an index.

528
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,900
And then

529
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:31,689
We can query the index anytime we

530
00:19:31,689 --> 00:19:33,699
need to know what is in view

531
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:35,699
of a ground gateway or what ground

532
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:37,618
gateways we can talk to from a satellite.

533
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:40,140
And so we knew the model,

534
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,269
we, we could run the model,

535
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,818
but when we needed to scale up the model,

536
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,338
and we

537
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,680
used AWS technology that you all can use

538
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,559
also, uh, to scale this up.

539
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,390
So Anyway,

540
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:00,588
the purpose of the constellation is not just to be a

541
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:02,989
constellation that is safe in space, it's to serve customers

542
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:05,250
and to provide internet access to the world.

543
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,439
So,

544
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,420
let's

545
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,239
do a brief overview of how does the Kuiper

546
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:12,098
constellation work.

547
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:15,449
You know, I mentioned that we have some satellites

548
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:18,160
in low Earth orbit and we're gonna have about 3200

549
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,848
of them and um.

550
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
They communicate wirelessly to our ground

551
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,380
gateways on Earth.

552
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,949
If we get data up to a satellite

553
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:28,130
from your house,

554
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,650
we're going to have to get it back down to the Earth because that's where the

555
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,229
internet is

556
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,729
today. And um yeah, so

557
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:34,608
we have ground gateways.

558
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:37,890
And the internet is not.

559
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,640
It's not by our ground gateways. Our ground

560
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,799
gateways are more or less like required to be

561
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,838
in faraway places away from

562
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:45,739
people, uh,

563
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:46,759
like in,

564
00:20:47,068 --> 00:20:49,269
you know, yeah, like out in the middle of nowhere

565
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:51,529
and, uh, yeah, like a wheat field.

566
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,459
So the internet is not exactly there,

567
00:20:54,318 --> 00:20:55,160
so um.

568
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:58,019
We, the edge of our network

569
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:00,338
is a point of presence. It's a network point of presence

570
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:02,459
that adapts between our internal Kuiper

571
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:04,578
protocols, which are optimized for space

572
00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:06,900
communication and, uh, fast

573
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,920
changing networks.

574
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,618
We have to adapt between those protocols and like

575
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:13,049
normal internet protocols, BGP, IP,

576
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,699
that kind of thing.

577
00:21:14,328 --> 00:21:16,588
And that's what we do at our Kuiper point of presence.

578
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:20,250
So we connect all of our ground infrastructure

579
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,150
using standard fiber optics

580
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:23,348
and um.

581
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,559
And in particular we connect our ground gateways

582
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,098
to the nearest AWS Direct Connect

583
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:31,318
location. Because once we're at the AWS Direct

584
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:33,469
Connect location, you know, those are,

585
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,289
those are at, those are paired with

586
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,689
internet providers like right there.

587
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:40,170
They have really good internet access, and there are hundreds

588
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,269
of them all over the world.

589
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:51,000
So But

590
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,279
what you're buying as a customer of Amazon

591
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,479
Leo is you're buying access

592
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,479
to our network through a customer terminal on

593
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,019
your roof.

594
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:01,529
And you're buying access to a

595
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,039
radio,

596
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,608
a radio network in which we're using radio

597
00:22:04,608 --> 00:22:05,568
frequency spectrum.

598
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:10,500
About 1.5 gigahertz of spectrum in

599
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,299
the KA band.

600
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,068
Uh, to communicate from our satellites

601
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:16,489
to the customer terminal and back again.

602
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:19,400
And then we have a separate radio

603
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,098
frequency

604
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,160
that

605
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,799
we use to talk between our satellites and our ground

606
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:24,400
gateways.

607
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,459
And um.

608
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:29,509
Leo's

609
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:31,709
Low Earth orbit

610
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:32,769
is.

611
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,519
If you're in low Earth orbit, you're basically moving at

612
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,939
17,000 miles an hour.

613
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:40,519
Uh, and what that means is you're going to pass over

614
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,598
any spot on the ground in like a few minutes,

615
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:44,439
like in about 3 minutes or less.

616
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,189
And what that means for a customer

617
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:49,209
terminal or any spot on the ground

618
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:50,848
to which we're providing service

619
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:52,650
is that we're switching which

620
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,049
satellite is providing service to that spot

621
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:57,618
about every 30 or 40 seconds, maybe

622
00:22:57,618 --> 00:22:59,670
up to 3 minutes, but 30 to 40 seconds.

623
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:02,828
So we designed the whole network around that

624
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:03,358
handoff,

625
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:06,049
around making that handoff and making it smooth.

626
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,219
And our customer terminal basically like

627
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:12,299
stops transmitting to one satellite or receiving

628
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,500
from it and then starts receiving

629
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,098
from the next one.

630
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,019
And this is called handoff.

631
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,689
Now, If you

632
00:23:21,949 --> 00:23:24,108
imagine that we have, yeah, so I have just

633
00:23:24,108 --> 00:23:26,868
told you that we're basically using radio frequency communication

634
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:29,348
and we're doing this handoff, we're doing hands off

635
00:23:29,348 --> 00:23:30,818
on the ground gateway as well,

636
00:23:31,108 --> 00:23:33,229
so we're the network is constantly

637
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:35,439
changing. And so you may imagine

638
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,939
that uh some of these fail. Yes, some

639
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:40,118
of these do fail, and so we're constantly

640
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,150
uh planning for redundancy and failover

641
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,709
if any of these links fail.

642
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,449
So not only do we plan primary links

643
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,779
between our satellites and customer terminals, we also

644
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:50,779
plan backup links between our satellites

645
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:51,880
and customer terminals

646
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,578
and satellites and ground gateways.

647
00:24:01,318 --> 00:24:02,259
So we're providing

648
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:05,098
service to the world, to every spot on the Earth,

649
00:24:05,608 --> 00:24:07,709
and we have satellites that can talk,

650
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:10,049
that can provide service to

651
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,660
many spots on the ground below them,

652
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:14,078
and they require a connection to

653
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,239
hundreds of ground gateway to one of hundreds

654
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:17,338
of ground gateways

655
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,699
that are on the surface of the Earth.

656
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:22,640
So you can see that our network, in

657
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,739
our network we have.

658
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,630
Millions of combinations of

659
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,509
how we can provide service at any given time.

660
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,479
And this is a massive optimization problem

661
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:33,739
because we're not just trying to, we're not just trying

662
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,299
to connect our network,

663
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:37,779
we're trying to optimize our network we're

664
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:39,939
trying to provide the fastest service to every

665
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:41,519
spot where customers are

666
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,098
using just the right amount of our

667
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:46,400
radio frequency so that we're balancing

668
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,900
service between all the different cells in our network.

669
00:24:50,868 --> 00:24:52,910
We just have to simplify this. Like customer

670
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,670
terminals are coming and going like just as

671
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,709
customers register for our service and

672
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:58,588
turn on their satellite.

673
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:02,250
So we have to simplify and the first way that we simplify

674
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:04,709
is that we don't try to

675
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,699
individually plan every customer terminal.

676
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,259
We provide access to cells on the ground.

677
00:25:10,118 --> 00:25:12,118
We provide access to, uh, we provide

678
00:25:12,118 --> 00:25:14,799
service to hexagons on the ground because hexagons

679
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,029
are the bestagons,

680
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:18,680
and this helps us simplify the

681
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,160
network down to just providing access to 1.6

682
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,299
million spots on the ground.

683
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:29,880
But it's still 1.6 million combinations, and we

684
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,959
still have all those satellites and ground station

685
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:32,759
combinations.

686
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,709
But it's even worse

687
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:37,729
because all those customer terminals have

688
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:38,368
different

689
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:40,588
uh quality of service commitments

690
00:25:41,088 --> 00:25:43,250
in Kuiper we're not just providing best effort

691
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,269
like hey we have a bunch of

692
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:47,969
you paid us now we will give you whatever

693
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:49,150
service we can come up with.

694
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,469
We're offering quality of service

695
00:25:52,729 --> 00:25:54,469
to enterprise customers who

696
00:25:54,848 --> 00:25:56,699
pay for like 100 megabits per second.

697
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:58,750
We will give you 100 megabits per second.

698
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:01,400
So that means that when we plan our network, we have

699
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:01,910
to plan

700
00:26:02,568 --> 00:26:04,709
with visibility into all the demand

701
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:06,229
and all the cells on the ground.

702
00:26:07,578 --> 00:26:09,680
We can do this, like we can,

703
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:12,019
we can point our radio frequency.

704
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:14,959
At any spot on the ground we can choose

705
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:17,039
how much radio frequency to give to any spot

706
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:17,680
on the ground.

707
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,160
We can change where we're allocating

708
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,338
that radio frequency

709
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,459
very quickly, many times a second,

710
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,000
and so we have the, we have the knobs

711
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,039
in our physical layer network

712
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:30,519
to optimize this problem, but as you see

713
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,539
it gets even more complicated when we add,

714
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,180
uh, quality of service commitments.

715
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:36,209
But beyond quality of service.

716
00:26:37,469 --> 00:26:39,670
Many factors in the environment also affect

717
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,209
what service we can provide, whether,

718
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:43,650
uh, whether provi uh, whether,

719
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:46,588
uh, the angle at which the satellite is in relation

720
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:47,529
to the ground spot,

721
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:49,890
how far away the satellite is from the

722
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,449
ground the ground gateway itself,

723
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,489
all these factors affect

724
00:26:54,068 --> 00:26:56,108
what service we can provide to any spot on

725
00:26:56,108 --> 00:26:58,549
the ground. So this is this, oh, and

726
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:00,650
the customer demand is changing like

727
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:02,868
on a minute by minute basis just kind of like a

728
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:05,049
normal di diurnal diurnal trend

729
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:06,430
or uh.

730
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:08,880
Yeah, or there might be a World Cup

731
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,989
or some other interesting event right now,

732
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
and all of these affect demand and where we

733
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
should allocate our radio frequency

734
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,719
on the ground.

735
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:18,279
This is a super data intensive, uh, data

736
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:20,400
intensive process to compute the

737
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
right plan for our network at any time.

738
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:23,779
So

739
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,150
One thing about this is that we are not the first

740
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,689
ones to

741
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:32,750
To build a wireless network that uh

742
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,229
involves beam pointing,

743
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,949
so there are well known algorithms for

744
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:39,130
allocating radio resources to spots

745
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:41,630
and uh some of them use like mixed image or

746
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,910
linear programming and generally speaking like

747
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,868
there are uh

748
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:47,390
there are algorithms for this, but when we add all of

749
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,529
these factors into them, then we have to,

750
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:51,608
uh, then it's just our algorithm for

751
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,729
for our network.

752
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:54,420
And um.

753
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:58,108
So we built this algorithm, but, and we

754
00:27:58,108 --> 00:27:58,689
can run it

755
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,430
and we can run it for like the continental United States

756
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,170
and you know we can run it for the world,

757
00:28:03,588 --> 00:28:05,848
but when we wanna scale it up and we want to

758
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:08,289
incorporate all the real-time data

759
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:10,900
that we need about the world, about our customers,

760
00:28:10,949 --> 00:28:12,989
and about, uh, the current

761
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:13,828
state of the network,

762
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,549
this is when we, uh, when we use

763
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:17,328
AWS

764
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,779
and the way we use AWS is to

765
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:20,598
manage our data.

766
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,949
We manage all of our subscriber data and

767
00:28:22,949 --> 00:28:25,000
kind of slow moving data in Sage Maker

768
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,078
Studio. And all of our fast

769
00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:29,098
moving data like the current state of the network,

770
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,858
the current state of customer demand,

771
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,640
this comes into our,

772
00:28:33,318 --> 00:28:35,098
our network planning system

773
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,358
through managed Kafka.

774
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,699
And then we run this big distributed computation

775
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:40,279
that I mentioned

776
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:42,098
on Fargate instances.

777
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:45,670
Once we have a global plan for our network,

778
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:48,289
we push it out to every node at the same time,

779
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,390
and the way we do that is that we have an

780
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,729
active connection

781
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,588
through a network load balancer with every node on the

782
00:28:54,588 --> 00:28:56,588
network, and so we can push it

783
00:28:56,588 --> 00:28:57,670
out using web sockets.

784
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,519
So AWS didn't solve the network

785
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,559
planning problem, but it enabled us to scale

786
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,959
up our solution to the network,

787
00:29:06,368 --> 00:29:07,699
the network planning problem

788
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:10,180
and not have to reinvent data architectures

789
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,279
from scratch.

790
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:21,568
So the cool thing about low Earth orbit

791
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,269
is, uh, it's like really close by.

792
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,029
You know, it's only like 2 to 4 milliseconds

793
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:29,189
away from any, you know, any

794
00:29:29,189 --> 00:29:30,328
spot that we're serving on the ground.

795
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:32,059
And

796
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,868
another cool thing about it

797
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,630
is that the speed of light is faster in a vacuum

798
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,630
than it is in fiber on the ground. So

799
00:29:38,828 --> 00:29:40,828
you know if we're going 600 kilometers up

800
00:29:40,828 --> 00:29:41,588
into space,

801
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:44,459
that's actually a lot faster than going 600 kilometers

802
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:45,630
in a fiber on the ground.

803
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,029
And so, you know, after we built this really

804
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,719
cool network,

805
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:52,588
it would be kind of a shame if

806
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:54,900
network latency were dominated by like fiber

807
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,410
on the ground.

808
00:29:55,848 --> 00:29:58,029
We turned like 8 milliseconds

809
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,029
into like 100 milliseconds by having the

810
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:00,769
wrong ground network.

811
00:30:01,828 --> 00:30:03,890
Um, which we could do because.

812
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:06,939
Yeah, because our ground gateways

813
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:08,459
are in a lot of different places.

814
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:10,088
Um

815
00:30:11,328 --> 00:30:13,519
And so, but what we do instead

816
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:15,979
is that we've built a huge ground

817
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:18,318
network, hundreds of sites all over the world,

818
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,019
and we've connected them using redundant fiber

819
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,459
paths to the nearest AWS Direct Connect

820
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:25,539
locations, and we host the edge of our

821
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:27,739
network, the, the point of presence that I mentioned

822
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:29,779
earlier, in AWS Edge sites.

823
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:34,098
And then from there it's we're right

824
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,309
out to the internet from it uh from AWS

825
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:37,279
edge sites.

826
00:30:38,828 --> 00:30:41,299
And when we need to get to your workload

827
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:41,818
in

828
00:30:42,818 --> 00:30:45,259
EC2 or yeah your workload in EC2 or S3,

829
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:48,000
Gary's gonna tell us about the APIs we provide

830
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,799
to enable that,

831
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:51,160
but that also, uh, goes over

832
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,059
AWS's,

833
00:30:52,449 --> 00:30:54,578
uh, AWS's direct connect network

834
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:57,920
which, and that's been AWS has been optimizing

835
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,578
that for years.

836
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,318
You know,

837
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:06,868
Probably everyone is here. Everyone here has been affected

838
00:31:06,868 --> 00:31:08,900
by a fiber optic fiber,

839
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:10,848
fiber cut at some point.

840
00:31:11,189 --> 00:31:13,189
Like, oh, I thought I had great internet

841
00:31:13,189 --> 00:31:15,309
access, and suddenly it's gone and it turns out

842
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:17,670
that uh someone with a backhoe

843
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,630
did just the wrong thing at just the wrong time.

844
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,239
And um

845
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:23,630
when we're talking about ground gateways all

846
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,608
over the place and like farms and fields,

847
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,949
we kind of expect that

848
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:30,338
from time to time, yes, there will be fiber cuts,

849
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:32,910
but what's cool about the Kuiper network is

850
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,549
that we have a second backbone

851
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:37,509
for our network and that's our backbone in space.

852
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:41,088
And uh we basically have fiber

853
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:43,209
optics without the fiber. We have just the laser

854
00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:45,309
part in space.

855
00:31:45,818 --> 00:31:47,890
And so instead of going over fiber on the

856
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,838
ground, we can use our optical optical

857
00:31:50,838 --> 00:31:53,130
lasers in space to transmit data

858
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,170
not to just the nearest ground gateway to

859
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:55,939
the satellite,

860
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,289
but to a different ground gateway through

861
00:31:58,289 --> 00:31:59,009
another satellite.

862
00:32:00,949 --> 00:32:03,118
And uh you know, as you can see,

863
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,259
this is not,

864
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,160
you know, there's no supermarket here.

865
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,328
OK, Um,

866
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:10,500
yeah, and, uh,

867
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:11,529
as I mentioned,

868
00:32:11,858 --> 00:32:13,890
we have our ground gateways, you know, all

869
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,180
over the world and hundreds of sites, and they're connected

870
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,219
to AWS's edge sites which

871
00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:19,219
there are hundreds of,

872
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:22,140
and from there they're connected to the Internet and to AWS

873
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,660
regions, um, everywhere.

874
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,180
So I just told you about how we're building this

875
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,039
really fast space-based network

876
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,880
involving a couple of hops of radio frequency.

877
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,939
Thousands of kilometers of fiber and it's

878
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:40,068
it's spread all over the world

879
00:32:40,328 --> 00:32:41,910
and so you should

880
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:43,328
kind of wonder

881
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:45,769
if we're taking really good care of your

882
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:47,529
data security and we are.

883
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,608
Data security is built into the lowest layer

884
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:51,680
of the Kuiper network.

885
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:54,009
Our custom chip that I mentioned at the

886
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:56,009
beginning of the talk that runs our network that

887
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:58,078
generates that radio frequency communication,

888
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:58,989
our modem,

889
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,608
it also can do encryption and decryption

890
00:33:01,608 --> 00:33:02,769
at gigabits per second.

891
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:06,598
And uh it has a hardware security module

892
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:08,759
that keeps the keys for that uh

893
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:09,299
for that

894
00:33:09,608 --> 00:33:11,709
um private and it's tamper

895
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:13,078
resistant and we've tested it.

896
00:33:13,949 --> 00:33:14,880
Definitely works.

897
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:17,759
Uh, and the other end of that encrypted connection

898
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:19,949
is all the way at the edge of our

899
00:33:19,949 --> 00:33:21,489
network in the pop that I mentioned.

900
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:24,189
And so it's doing encryption and decryption at gig

901
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:25,588
gigabits per second.

902
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,660
For all the customer terminals that it's connected

903
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,000
to. And

904
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,160
you know if you built like uh

905
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,759
you know

906
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,400
everyone here has built a secure service and

907
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,439
you know it's really easy to get the encryption part

908
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:40,559
wrong but then of course it's really easy

909
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,380
to get the

910
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:44,199
access to keys and identity management part

911
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:45,259
wrong also

912
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,299
uh but by building on

913
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,160
the same cryptographic primitives

914
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,180
that you all use and that other AWS

915
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,979
customers use

916
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:55,078
we can

917
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:56,539
know a few things.

918
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,479
One is that we're using.

919
00:33:59,289 --> 00:33:59,939
Kind of

920
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,799
known standard implementations of cryptographic

921
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,549
algogorithms through like AWSLC

922
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,108
and AWS

923
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,619
using AWSLC

924
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:10,340
and we're also

925
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,398
keeping really good track of our keys.

926
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,398
Our keys are stored in AWS

927
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:16,039
KMS,

928
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,478
and they never leave our, we never

929
00:34:18,478 --> 00:34:20,619
touch them in our data plane code because

930
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:22,750
they go from AWS KMS into nitro

931
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,679
enclaves.

932
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,239
We only get like a short-lived time

933
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,159
drive key

934
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,719
to use in our data plane code for fast encryption

935
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,800
at gigabits per second.

936
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,840
And you know we protect access to all those keys

937
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,820
using IAM just like you would

938
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,159
so that only the services that should have access

939
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,360
to our keys do have access to our keys.

940
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:44,079
Another cool thing about this is that when

941
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,099
we're sending your data over the Direct

942
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:46,898
Connect network,

943
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:49,697
uh, we're also using it's Maxsec on the ground,

944
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:51,637
so, you know, first.

945
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:54,259
If someone were to intercept our radio

946
00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:55,778
radio,

947
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:58,677
they would not see your data. They won't see IP

948
00:34:58,677 --> 00:35:01,079
addresses. They won't see TLS headers. They'll

949
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:03,259
see encapsulated, fully encrypted data,

950
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,358
and they will not see your data.

951
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,340
But then if they go find our fiber they won't

952
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,090
even see our data they'll see, you know, random

953
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,269
encryptable bits

954
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:13,000
protected by Maxec.

955
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,269
So our network is and is

956
00:35:16,269 --> 00:35:18,590
secure in transit from customer

957
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,010
terminal to the edge of our network

958
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:21,389
and uh we

959
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,469
and that is enabled by the same cryptographic

960
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:26,228
primitives that you all use today.

961
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:30,599
So

962
00:35:31,478 --> 00:35:33,519
Those are some of the key problems that we solved

963
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:35,519
in Amazon Leo, to enable us to

964
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:37,668
get into space and to constantly

965
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,110
communicate with our satellites,

966
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:40,780
and then to plan our network.

967
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,070
And to optimize it to give great

968
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,070
quality of service to all the spots on the ground that

969
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,590
we're serving.

970
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,280
And then also to secure communication

971
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,458
and to scale our network

972
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:51,878
to global scale.

973
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:54,989
So now Gary's gonna tell us about how you

974
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:55,889
can use that network

975
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:58,969
from your AWS, uh, from your AWS

976
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:00,688
network. uh, thanks Gary.

977
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:03,889
Thanks, Andy.

978
00:36:04,418 --> 00:36:05,610
That was super cool.

979
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:07,340
If you didn't get the data points,

980
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:08,739
17,000

981
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:10,510
MPH these things are moving at.

982
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,378
Right, they're doing handoffs about every

983
00:36:13,378 --> 00:36:14,340
30 seconds.

984
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,789
There was one there.

985
00:36:18,188 --> 00:36:19,389
There's one, another one.

986
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,929
This is amazing technology that we're building.

987
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:24,478
Andy walked us through

988
00:36:24,938 --> 00:36:27,179
how they used AWS to build

989
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:29,119
these solutions for Amazon Leo.

990
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:31,780
Now, is anyone here in the audience planning to

991
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,539
build a low Earth orbit system? Anyone?

992
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,550
Really,

993
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:37,688
good for you.

994
00:36:38,168 --> 00:36:40,849
How about the rest of you? I bet you're hoping to use

995
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,389
an existing low Earth orbit system like Amazon

996
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:45,469
Leo to improve your systems, right?

997
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,239
OK, great, a few hands.

998
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,019
Well, that's what we wanna talk about.

999
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,688
Leo can be used for multiple different use cases.

1000
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,780
It could be used as internet connectivity

1001
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,829
in remote areas,

1002
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,458
right? That's a kind of a personal use

1003
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,760
case. But more interestingly,

1004
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:06,300
probably for customers of AWS like yourselves,

1005
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:08,019
are the industrial use cases.

1006
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:11,110
Or you may have equipment that runs

1007
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,769
in a far off place of the world,

1008
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:15,539
or you may have equipment that runs

1009
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,500
off the ground and

1010
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,409
actually in the middle of the ocean,

1011
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:21,250
somewhere where bringing fiber or connectivity

1012
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,349
is either difficult,

1013
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:24,188
expensive, or inconsistent.

1014
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,949
Leo can help us with all these use cases.

1015
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,079
So Leo is a networking capability

1016
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,780
from your AWS perspective.

1017
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,500
So let's look at how we can do

1018
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,760
connect to your account from a networking side.

1019
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:40,989
We're going to walk through just a first as a

1020
00:37:40,989 --> 00:37:42,869
really simple customer internet use case example.

1021
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:44,599
You're a customer

1022
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,909
You're somewhere else remote.

1023
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,719
You want to get to the public internet.

1024
00:37:49,648 --> 00:37:51,728
Well, you connect to your customer terminal,

1025
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,409
your antenna, your Leo antenna.

1026
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:55,659
The Leo antenna

1027
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:59,148
Connects up to the LEO satellite up in the sky,

1028
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,840
right, around 600 kilometers

1029
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,280
in the sky, I believe the number was.

1030
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,349
That satellite connects down to a ground

1031
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:08,438
station. From the ground

1032
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:10,000
station to a pop and out to the internet.

1033
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,648
Pretty simple use case.

1034
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:15,099
Doesn't utilize AWS.

1035
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,659
From your account's perspective.

1036
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,510
However, what if we did want to integrate it with our account?

1037
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,280
Well, what can we do then?

1038
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,978
Leo has this concept called the customer

1039
00:38:25,978 --> 00:38:26,878
virtual network.

1040
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:30,510
And what that customer virtual network does

1041
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,590
is it creates a virtual device.

1042
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:36,478
This virtual network interface.

1043
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,010
The VNI,

1044
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:40,079
which is a representation.

1045
00:38:40,898 --> 00:38:43,179
A virtual representation of

1046
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:45,340
your Leo satellite dish.

1047
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,208
Your antenna.

1048
00:38:47,648 --> 00:38:48,750
Every antenna

1049
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,070
basically has a 1 to 1 connection

1050
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:53,090
with a virtual network interface.

1051
00:38:54,909 --> 00:38:57,070
That virtual network interface provides

1052
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,030
IP addresses,

1053
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,389
provides DNS,

1054
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:01,128
and provides some configuration

1055
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:03,208
to what your antenna can do.

1056
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:06,349
And you may have different use cases for different

1057
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:07,030
antennas.

1058
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:09,829
Maybe you have one use case that only

1059
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:12,110
allows for private

1060
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,110
internet access, meaning it only allows access to your

1061
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,250
corporate network. You might have another antenna that

1062
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,550
allows public internet access.

1063
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,449
And it's controlled at the

1064
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:23,019
antenna using the customer virtual

1065
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:26,110
network. Now

1066
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,449
if we look a little bit further,

1067
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,050
there's another component

1068
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:30,188
that we have in here.

1069
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:33,239
There's a component called the virtual

1070
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,070
network gateway.

1071
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,148
With that gateway.

1072
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:39,070
We can now control what our network or what

1073
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,369
our antenna can do.

1074
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:43,000
We've got 3 different gateway opportunities.

1075
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:45,469
One, connect us right to the internet, again,

1076
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,989
more of a consumer use case.

1077
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:48,610
The second

1078
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:51,849
We'll connect you directly to AWS

1079
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,809
direct to AWS D2A.

1080
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,610
We like using number acronyms at AWS, so

1081
00:39:57,809 --> 00:39:58,789
that's the D2A 1.

1082
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:02,010
The 3rd 1 is a private network interconnect,

1083
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:02,829
a PI.

1084
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,929
So whereas the second one there, the D2A,

1085
00:40:05,978 --> 00:40:06,840
will connect to your

1086
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:08,978
AWS VPC.

1087
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,820
The 3rd 1 there will connect to your

1088
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,860
private network through some kind of meet me

1089
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,659
point, network to network connectivity.

1090
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:20,639
Here's what it would look like and why you might want

1091
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,159
to use it.

1092
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,309
So let's say you have a Leo

1093
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:26,019
network. You've got an antenna.

1094
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:28,378
But you've got a corporate data center,

1095
00:40:28,688 --> 00:40:30,829
and in that corporate data center you have some private

1096
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,438
infrastructure. You've got some servers,

1097
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:35,489
some storage, some databases,

1098
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,648
but you need to be able to access it remotely.

1099
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:40,219
Through the private network interface, you

1100
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:41,958
can connect your Leo antenna

1101
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,978
to your private data center.

1102
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:47,409
Again, this is part of what Leo does. This

1103
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:48,829
isn't an AWS

1104
00:40:49,128 --> 00:40:50,610
service that you would do in your account.

1105
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,159
But now let's assume that you did want to do something

1106
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,059
in your account.

1107
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,708
You wanted to access services that were within

1108
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:58,599
your VPC.

1109
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,898
Well, in this case, if we use the direct to

1110
00:41:01,898 --> 00:41:03,969
AWS connection, we could do that.

1111
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,090
Leo connects to your VPC

1112
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,869
and services that are within your VPC, let's

1113
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:12,030
say EC2 or Sagemaker, are

1114
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,309
now accessible from the Leo antenna.

1115
00:41:15,128 --> 00:41:17,378
But what about services that aren't in your VPC?

1116
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,849
There are managed services that AWS

1117
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:20,378
has.

1118
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,949
Well, through a private link you can access those

1119
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:23,510
as well.

1120
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:26,820
So what we've got here now is services

1121
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,469
that you're managing in your VPC,

1122
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,099
your business use case now

1123
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,019
accessible anywhere in the globe.

1124
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:35,878
With a Leo antenna.

1125
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,389
Now we want to connect this to your

1126
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:43,489
AWS account.

1127
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,500
And one thing I want to highlight

1128
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:47,099
is that Leo

1129
00:41:47,628 --> 00:41:49,159
is not an AWS service.

1130
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:52,510
Leo is a service that comes from Amazon, from

1131
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,550
the Amazon Leo team. It is not

1132
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,090
an AWS service. It is not a resource

1133
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,728
in your AWS account.

1134
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:01,378
But we want you to have a seamless interface.

1135
00:42:01,628 --> 00:42:03,869
We want you to have an experience that

1136
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:04,688
looks as if

1137
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:07,188
you are building with native resources.

1138
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,429
One of the ways we do that is to give Leo some permission

1139
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:12,409
in your account.

1140
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:15,769
And we do that through a new temporary

1141
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:17,148
delegation process

1142
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,728
from IAM. This is a new service that was

1143
00:42:19,728 --> 00:42:21,208
announced just a few days ago.

1144
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:23,610
And with that delegation,

1145
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:26,010
the Leo system has access to your

1146
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,090
AWS account.

1147
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,398
And it uses that access

1148
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:30,628
in order to

1149
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:35,260
Provide you with telemetry of what's

1150
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,918
happening in the Leo service

1151
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,590
within your AWS account.

1152
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:40,769
So as the service runs,

1153
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,219
telemetry information is populated into

1154
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:44,418
your AWS account.

1155
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:47,349
In a cloud watch, cloud trail, etc.

1156
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:48,898
So again,

1157
00:42:49,188 --> 00:42:50,989
Leo is not an AWS service,

1158
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:53,579
but We are working in such a way

1159
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:55,699
that it will appear like an AWS

1160
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:56,679
service in your account,

1161
00:42:57,139 --> 00:42:59,139
meaning that you can collect the telemetry,

1162
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,579
you can set up the triggers, you can act on

1163
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,699
events, and you can take action if something goes

1164
00:43:03,699 --> 00:43:07,978
wrong. Now

1165
00:43:07,978 --> 00:43:08,800
let's look at some

1166
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:11,820
D2A direct to AWS Leo

1167
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,418
examples.

1168
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,938
Again, we're builders here, we want to figure

1169
00:43:14,938 --> 00:43:16,539
out what we're going to build, how we're going to build it.

1170
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:19,539
We've got a couple of examples here that we think

1171
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:21,619
may align with hopefully some of you here in the

1172
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:24,059
crowd. What

1173
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,309
if you're running a wind farm?

1174
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,860
And you're running a wind farm and you've got a wind farm

1175
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,478
somewhere out in the ocean.

1176
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:33,199
A lot of wind in the ocean.

1177
00:43:33,909 --> 00:43:35,019
So you put a wind farm there,

1178
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,820
not a lot of network connectivity in the ocean, unfortunate

1179
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,949
part. But we want to

1180
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:40,728
run a wind farm.

1181
00:43:41,878 --> 00:43:44,000
And we want to make sure that we are optimizing our wind

1182
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,059
farm for health.

1183
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:47,289
Predictive maintenance,

1184
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:48,610
all those good things.

1185
00:43:49,949 --> 00:43:52,010
There are some patterns that we know

1186
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,519
have been utilized often in

1187
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:56,628
AWS to monitor something like a

1188
00:43:56,628 --> 00:43:57,228
wind farm.

1189
00:43:57,878 --> 00:44:00,099
IoTre AWS IOTorre

1190
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:01,360
is a common way to do that.

1191
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,978
Collects telemetry

1192
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,519
from your wind farm.

1193
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:07,059
Receives that telemetry,

1194
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:09,878
stores the data in time streams so you know what's

1195
00:44:09,878 --> 00:44:10,918
happening over time.

1196
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:13,148
Maybe you're visualizing it with grafana.

1197
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:16,139
But you may also have a trigger that

1198
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:18,320
occurs when anomalies may be detected

1199
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:19,418
from your wind farm.

1200
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:22,429
And those anomalies may be processed

1201
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:23,809
within something like EKS.

1202
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,309
Or either one.

1203
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,369
To understand whether or not this anomaly actually

1204
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:31,579
needs us to take action.

1205
00:44:31,929 --> 00:44:33,429
And if we do need to take action,

1206
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:35,769
maybe we have an event that then send

1207
00:44:35,769 --> 00:44:37,918
signals back to our wind farm to slow

1208
00:44:37,918 --> 00:44:39,010
down or to halt,

1209
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:41,449
maybe opens up a work order to have a

1210
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:43,530
technician get on a boat and get out there

1211
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,208
to fix the thing.

1212
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:46,909
But again, this wind farm is out in the middle of the ocean.

1213
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,429
No fiber out there

1214
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:51,478
No internet connectivity.

1215
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:52,958
Well, this is where

1216
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,059
Leo comes in.

1217
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:56,719
If we utilize the antenna

1218
00:44:57,179 --> 00:44:58,878
together with our remote wind farm

1219
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,938
and we utilize the.

1220
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,429
Direct to AWS connectivity,

1221
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:05,929
we can now bridge this wind farm in the middle of

1222
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:06,590
the ocean,

1223
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,429
back to the exact same patterns that we would have

1224
00:45:09,648 --> 00:45:10,789
to build

1225
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:13,188
digital twins and monitor

1226
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,289
our wind farms in the cloud.

1227
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,340
There's a link there at the top. There are in the next couple

1228
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,199
of slides as well

1229
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,539
for references to some of these architectures.

1230
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:27,780
Let's look at another example,

1231
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,760
egress traffic inspection.

1232
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:32,619
I think we all know that ingress

1233
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:34,438
traffic, traffic coming into your network,

1234
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,260
everyone puts up a firewall, right? We want to make

1235
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,199
sure none of the traffic coming into us.

1236
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,500
We need to block any nefarious traffic,

1237
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:44,809
right, so we have a firewall.

1238
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:47,668
But what's becoming even more common.

1239
00:45:48,489 --> 00:45:49,989
Is that teams want to have

1240
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,728
ingress or egress verification,

1241
00:45:52,929 --> 00:45:54,648
meaning I don't want data leaving my system

1242
00:45:56,168 --> 00:45:58,030
because my data is proprietary to me.

1243
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:00,550
I don't want to be leaking data to the outside world.

1244
00:46:01,539 --> 00:46:03,949
So I may have egress traffic inspection.

1245
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,679
Very common pattern,

1246
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,239
something we do in the cloud, maybe using

1247
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:10,099
something like AOS network firewall.

1248
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:13,659
But what if I'm operating remotely somewhere?

1249
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,760
I have a remote site,

1250
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:17,219
maybe a mining site. Maybe I'm mining gold,

1251
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,418
and I don't want my competitors to know how much gold

1252
00:46:19,418 --> 00:46:20,099
I've mined.

1253
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:23,500
But my mining process requires a lot of compute.

1254
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:25,449
Which is great,

1255
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:27,418
and I need to do that on premises.

1256
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:30,128
So what do I do? I use Amazon outposts.

1257
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,530
With Amazon AWS outposts, I can have EC2

1258
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:34,059
compute

1259
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:36,898
running in a private subnet on premises.

1260
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:38,949
That's great.

1261
00:46:39,409 --> 00:46:41,489
When I need to launch a new container or

1262
00:46:41,489 --> 00:46:43,530
I need to launch a new piece of software on

1263
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,769
it, I may actually need to have internet

1264
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,878
access. Maybe I need to PI install or

1265
00:46:47,878 --> 00:46:49,648
maybe I need to yum update something,

1266
00:46:49,929 --> 00:46:52,168
right? So I need to have network

1267
00:46:52,168 --> 00:46:53,128
access outbound.

1268
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:55,878
But again, I have requirements

1269
00:46:55,878 --> 00:46:57,500
from my security team that say

1270
00:46:57,829 --> 00:46:59,958
no egress traffic unless it's

1271
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:00,639
inspected.

1272
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,628
How am I gonna inspect it?

1273
00:47:02,978 --> 00:47:05,340
Well, by connecting my outpost

1274
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:06,958
back to my network

1275
00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:09,139
in the cloud, back to my VPC

1276
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:11,659
through Kuiper or through sorry, Amazon

1277
00:47:11,659 --> 00:47:13,659
Leo. I

1278
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:14,398
can actually

1279
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:16,918
force all of my traffic coming from

1280
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:19,139
EC2 running in my outpost on

1281
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:19,860
premises

1282
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:22,320
to go through my firewall endpoints that live

1283
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,309
in the region

1284
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:24,500
in my VPC.

1285
00:47:25,378 --> 00:47:26,360
Out through my

1286
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:28,438
network firewall to check for

1287
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,320
allowability, whether it's allowed to get out or not,

1288
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,780
and only if it is, will it then egress

1289
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,559
to the internet,

1290
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:36,349
right? So I've got security.

1291
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:37,438
This will make sure

1292
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,938
that none of my gold mining information.

1293
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,719
Gets leaked outside of my network.

1294
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:46,168
Only my PI installs and Yum updates

1295
00:47:46,168 --> 00:47:48,168
do, but my gold mining does

1296
00:47:48,168 --> 00:47:52,188
not. One

1297
00:47:52,188 --> 00:47:52,949
more example

1298
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:57,500
Amazon has a uh a

1299
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,679
video division, right, we make movies.

1300
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:02,619
Sometimes we make those movies in very remote

1301
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:04,668
locations. And when we make those

1302
00:48:04,668 --> 00:48:06,750
movies, we come out on set with a bunch of

1303
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,989
equipment, a bunch of very expensive equipment.

1304
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:11,659
And we need to monitor that site.

1305
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:13,438
is secure

1306
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,938
and so we need to put up security cameras in

1307
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:16,760
that remote location.

1308
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,570
But it's remote. Again, remote means

1309
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,688
hard to get network access, hard to get

1310
00:48:22,688 --> 00:48:23,289
fiber,

1311
00:48:23,688 --> 00:48:24,728
yet we need to do this.

1312
00:48:25,878 --> 00:48:28,079
And I've got administrators in system opps

1313
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,099
that need to watch those cameras to make sure

1314
00:48:30,438 --> 00:48:32,559
that nothing gets stolen, nothing gets interfered

1315
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,619
with. Well, a

1316
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:36,438
common way we would do this in the cloud

1317
00:48:36,938 --> 00:48:39,059
is we would use something like IoT Core,

1318
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:41,619
Kinesis video streams to stream those

1319
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:42,719
videos from the,

1320
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:44,059
from the cameras.

1321
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,449
We would create some

1322
00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:49,349
review process using something like lambda

1323
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:51,389
and open search. Maybe we even create some

1324
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:53,590
dashboard that can be accessed by our remote

1325
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:55,668
by our administrators so that they can see the

1326
00:48:55,668 --> 00:48:56,188
cameras.

1327
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:57,648
Right, again,

1328
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:00,739
common pattern to deal with cameras

1329
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:01,789
in the cloud.

1330
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:05,010
Problem is our cameras are far remote.

1331
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:07,668
There are no connecting, no connectivity.

1332
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:10,728
Well here once again, even in this pattern, Leo

1333
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:11,530
can help us out.

1334
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:13,909
Using a Leo antenna

1335
00:49:14,269 --> 00:49:15,579
connection with a D2A.

1336
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:18,289
D2A connection,

1337
00:49:18,909 --> 00:49:20,050
we go through a VPC,

1338
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,128
we go through a private link.

1339
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:24,168
We're now able to connect this entire

1340
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,909
infrastructure running in the cloud with

1341
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:27,789
cameras that are

1342
00:49:28,228 --> 00:49:29,969
in a remote location on site

1343
00:49:30,228 --> 00:49:32,789
watching our trucks, our cameras,

1344
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,208
our our our film cameras, our crew

1345
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:37,619
to make sure everyone is safe in this remote

1346
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:39,849
location while they're filming the next episode of

1347
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,070
your favorite show.

1348
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,438
And So

1349
00:49:45,438 --> 00:49:47,969
again This is your AWS

1350
00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:50,659
accounts. These are your VPCs.

1351
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:53,418
You are just getting connected to your remote

1352
00:49:53,418 --> 00:49:55,659
access or getting remote accessed via

1353
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,539
Leo. All

1354
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:00,570
right, quick recap, so we're

1355
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:01,418
coming up on time.

1356
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:05,030
We talked about how Amazon Leo

1357
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:07,840
utilized the same AWS resources

1358
00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:10,208
to build out their Leo service that you have

1359
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:12,978
access to. No

1360
00:50:12,978 --> 00:50:15,260
special treatment just because we're all Amazonians.

1361
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:17,389
Or maybe a little special treatment, but.

1362
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:20,699
Um, no special treatment when it comes from an AWS

1363
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:22,780
resource perspective. They have access to the same

1364
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,878
resources that you do.

1365
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,378
So for the gentleman over there who is building a low Earth

1366
00:50:26,378 --> 00:50:28,409
orbit system, you've got

1367
00:50:28,409 --> 00:50:30,418
all the, you've got all the tools that your hand in your

1368
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:31,039
hands that you need.

1369
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:35,010
The next thing we talked about, we looked at some examples,

1370
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:36,128
is how in your

1371
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:38,829
AWS accounts, in your VPCs,

1372
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,369
you can utilize Leo to extend

1373
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:43,458
the extend your networks to the edge,

1374
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:45,369
basically anywhere around the globe.

1375
00:50:47,438 --> 00:50:48,590
What we're really curious

1376
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:49,869
to know,

1377
00:50:50,449 --> 00:50:52,550
and we had a couple of examples of how we think

1378
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:54,289
people can use Leo,

1379
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,849
but we're really curious to know how you're gonna use

1380
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:59,110
Leo. How you, when

1381
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:01,300
taking Leo into your AWS account,

1382
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,469
what are you going to do with it?

1383
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:04,628
Maybe you'll tell us.

1384
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:06,228
Hopefully you will.

1385
00:51:06,849 --> 00:51:09,010
Hopefully you'll get a chance to, cos I'm really curious

1386
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:10,510
how Leo is gonna help you out.

1387
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,570
If you'd like to learn more about Leo as

1388
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,458
a as a service, Amazon Leo,

1389
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:19,119
that link will take you to a page with

1390
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,139
more information.

1391
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:22,840
We'll give you the opportunity to sign up

1392
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,958
for beta or to track availability,

1393
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:27,000
general availability of the service.

1394
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:31,639
And with that, I'd like to thank everyone for their

1395
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:32,389
time today.

1396
00:51:32,929 --> 00:51:35,070
Um, I promise you we were more interesting than

1397
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:35,909
than Werner.

1398
00:51:36,409 --> 00:51:38,429
I can't promise you that. I hope we were more

1399
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,309
interesting than Werner.

1400
00:51:39,648 --> 00:51:42,010
Um, thank you all very much. Uh, enjoy

1401
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,090
the rest of your reinvent.
