1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,190
- All right, how we doing, re:Invent?

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,290
Everyone having a good time? Yes?

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,820
Very good. Very good.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,830
I've flown a long way to be
here, a little bit hoarse,

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,320
so apologies for that.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,783
Who here is a Nutanix customer today?

7
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:17,040
Got the smart ones over
here. That's good to see.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,633
Anyone running VMware today?

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,820
No, boo. Okay.

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,200
That's okay, we can help you.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,300
We can help you there.

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,520
We're gonna talk about,

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,280
I like to think about Nutanix

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,680
because of a lot of you that
have investigated Nutanix

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,390
or you're running VMware today,

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,310
your eye is probably somewhere else,

17
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,260
and that's why you're here at re:Invent.

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,730
You're here to talk about AI.

19
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,280
You're here to talk about
modernizing your workloads

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,360
and your applications.

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,190
How am I gonna do that faster?

22
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,040
How do I divert costs of maintaining

23
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,100
and running critical infrastructure today?

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,140
How am I gonna go and take
that to the next step?

25
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,180
That's really what the business is about,

26
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,700
and that's where AWS
and our partners here,

27
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,820
we are all geared towards
helping that journey.

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,240
But Nutanix can play a key part of that,

29
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,630
and I think we're very
unknown in that space.

30
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,030
We can help you modernize
your infrastructure.

31
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,770
I like to say that we're moving you

32
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,870
to a modern hybrid cloud.

33
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,250
We can help you to build apps
once under our NKP platform.

34
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,900
And if you need to run them at the edge,

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,550
if you need to run them
in the data center,

36
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,100
or you wanna shift them up
to cloud anywhere globally,

37
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,230
we can come and help you do that as well.

38
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,970
And then enable AI.

39
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,330
This is an another part of
our portfolio, Nutanix AI.

40
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,360
How do we help you start
small with your AI models?

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,690
We can help you test them in
the cloud at a much lower cost.

42
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,340
You can get started quickly.

43
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,310
And then if the end state is
I need to run them over here,

44
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,800
I need to secure them, I need
to do something different,

45
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,390
maybe there's a compliance region,

46
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,980
we can help you bring those back.

47
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,760
So, our story is not just
around virtual machines

48
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,890
and how to give you a
better experience running

49
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,270
your core infrastructure,

50
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,370
it's about how we're accelerating that

51
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,823
so that you can focus on what's
next for your organization.

52
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,570
All right, our global availability.

53
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,603
Anyone here actually running
Nutanix on AWS today?

54
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,260
Good man, I like this guy. All right.

55
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,260
Nutanix has 11 different
instance types in AWS today

56
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,040
that's gonna give you flexibility.

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,720
Do I wanna run a GPU model?

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,497
Do I need to run storage dense hardware?

59
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:22,620
Do I need to run something
that's very compute

60
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,120
or memory-intensive?

61
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,017
We can help you do that.

62
00:02:25,017 --> 00:02:26,790
So, the flexibility that we've been able

63
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,560
to provide you on-premises,

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,420
we can now bring that into the cloud.

65
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,310
So, very similar to how you would look at

66
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,310
an EC2 virtual machine or
something today, we bring that,

67
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,933
but just at a much larger scale.

68
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,950
Intel AMX, I touched on Nutanix AI.

69
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,220
This is how we're gonna
help you get started faster,

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,180
a lot more cost effectively
with AI inference in the cloud.

71
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,900
You don't need to go and
spend a lot an an NVIDIA model

72
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,390
that's gonna run a large,
you might wanna start small.

73
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,370
You might wanna start testing an LLM.

74
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,440
What's my security
model need to look like?

75
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,540
How am I gonna train a dataset

76
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,400
from production up in the cloud?

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,930
I don't need to bring it all.

78
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,180
How am I gonna secure it?

79
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,073
And then Sovereign,

80
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:10,470
this is probably one of the
things I'm really excited about

81
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,320
that we're launching this year,
which is Nutanix Sovereign.

82
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,780
One of the common bits of feedback I get

83
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,000
from public sector, finance customers,

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,960
healthcare customers, is I
want to run in the cloud,

85
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,540
but how do I ensure that
my data is sovereign?

86
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,800
How is it gonna stay here?

87
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,220
So, our solution runs inside
your availability zone.

88
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,200
It runs inside your VPC,

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,880
but we ensure that nothing can,

90
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,730
no metadata, nothing is
gonna go outside of that.

91
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,950
So, for customers that
are really concerned

92
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,750
about where's my data living?

93
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,650
What services in US East is it talking to?

94
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,330
We can prove to you that that's not there.

95
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,030
So, that's available in Fed
Gov, it's going into EU,

96
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,610
it's coming in Australia
and Singapore at the moment.

97
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,010
So, Sovereign is really
exciting for those that want

98
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,813
that additional layer of protection.

99
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,390
And then hibernation,

100
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:01,050
another key feature of our
capabilities inside the cloud

101
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,510
is the ability to hibernate a cluster.

102
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,740
So, for a DR scenario, we
can build Nutanix on AWS,

103
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,000
make sure everything's working,

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,860
we do all our layer two stretch.

105
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,080
We test all our automation
and our blueprints,

106
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,240
then we hibernate it and we put it in S3,

107
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,240
so you're no longer paying
for the compute costs in AWS,

108
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,730
you're just simply paying
for the S3 storage,

109
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,930
which is really low.

110
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,930
Now, in the case that you need
to spin up that environment,

111
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,520
you are talking under an hour

112
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,370
and you've got the full cluster,
the connectivity is there,

113
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,720
and you workloads are restored.

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,810
So, we're using this a lot around BCDR.

115
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,690
We have an always-on model
or we have a hibernate model.

116
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,370
This is a really good
way to improve your RTO

117
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,023
and RPO posture, and still
keeping the costs really low.

118
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,140
And this is where we are.

119
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,570
So, if you've seen some
of the competitors around

120
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,563
and what they do,

121
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,560
I don't think they've
got coverage like this.

122
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,230
So, we're in every AWS region,

123
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,630
every AWS availability zone

124
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,540
with multiple different instance types

125
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,783
to help you get what I say
is hybrid cloud done right.

126
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,030
What does it look like
in a bit more detail?

127
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,560
So, you will have seen,

128
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,290
if you've spoken to some of
the other SaaS providers here,

129
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,790
there's some different models.

130
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,010
Do I need to get in that one?

131
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,600
There's some different models

132
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,090
around how their services interact

133
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,000
with the native AWS services
that you are using today.

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,760
So, at Nutanix, we do that
a little bit differently.

135
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,130
So, we start with your Nutanix environment

136
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,170
that's running here on-premises today,

137
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,670
and then we'll stretch it up

138
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,480
into your AWS VPC that's configured.

139
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,550
Now, if you're not running in AWS,

140
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,170
we can help you go and set that up.

141
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,170
But automatically, we're running on top of

142
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,840
the Amazon EC2 Metal Instances.

143
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,640
Our cluster size is three.

144
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,370
So, whether you are starting
really small on an M instance,

145
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,680
or we're up at a bigger I7 instance,

146
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,810
we're running three nodes
to start the cluster in AWS

147
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,690
and inside your tenancy.

148
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,490
So, all the security policies,

149
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,820
all the models that you've
defined at the top of that VPC

150
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,790
are automatically gonna be
applied downstream straight away.

151
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,230
We don't need to worry then

152
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,240
about things like transit gateway

153
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,430
or how we're gonna connect
to the native services

154
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,620
that you've already got
configured, secured,

155
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,210
and you're already using.

156
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,450
It's already in the same
VPC, so we're up and running.

157
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,470
And then from there,

158
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,470
we can provide it in three
of the primary layers,

159
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,470
which is the compute, so
virtual machines and containers.

160
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,840
So whether that's with NC2 or NCI,

161
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,020
our cloud infrastructure
providing virtual machines,

162
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,110
or whether it's with
our latest product, NKP,

163
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,480
which is doing Nutanix
Kubernetes Platform,

164
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,980
we'll make that available.

165
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,120
And then storage.

166
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,580
So, the efficiency that we bring

167
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,640
with storage on-premises,
we're not making any changes.

168
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,320
So, the code base for Nutanix,

169
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,010
the licenses for Nutanix that
you know today on-premises

170
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,690
are exactly the same up here.

171
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,030
There's no difference
between what we're running.

172
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,550
So, when we look at the storage profile,

173
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,930
efficiencies on prem,

174
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,570
efficiencies up in cloud
is really important.

175
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,990
Now, we're running this
on top of the NVME storage

176
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,990
that's provided inside
the bare metal instances.

177
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,990
So, in terms of if you've done
an EC2 VM configuration today

178
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,980
and you are selecting your IOPS,

179
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,900
or you're selecting how
much throughput you want,

180
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,970
you don't need to worry
about that configuration.

181
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,670
I like to call it unknown knowns.

182
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,410
You know you're probably gonna get slugged

183
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,740
with an IOPS charged
somewhere or a call somewhere.

184
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,750
That doesn't really occur with Nutanix

185
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,240
because everything is
running on the NVME drives

186
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,860
on the bare metal itself.

187
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,770
That said, we can expand those with EBS

188
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,990
and we do have some
integration points coming

189
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,420
with our third party
storage providers over there

190
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,680
later in the year.

191
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,150
And then networking and security.

192
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,000
So, whether it's micro-segmentation,

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,940
or whether it's just layer
two stretching over here,

194
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,500
we can stretch that across.

195
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,120
So, we're not just bringing
what you have today on-premises

196
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,080
to the cloud.

197
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,180
We want to modernize as you're doing it.

198
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,260
So, that may be layer two and
then micro seg on day one.

199
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,430
And then we look at integration

200
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,220
with all the other native AWS networking.

201
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,440
But that's how we're really gonna help you

202
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,603
to modernize on that step journey.

203
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,040
All right, well, that doesn't
come across really nice.

204
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,110
So, we've all seen like an 80-20 rule.

205
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,753
I like to call it the 80-2026 rule.

206
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,980
80% of enterprises are using AI today.

207
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,110
Everyone here is probably dabbling in it

208
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,523
in some form or another.

209
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,700
Adopting Kubernetes.

210
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,230
Everyone's modernizing their apps,

211
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,360
they're going serverless,
they're using containers.

212
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,320
How are we doing that?

213
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,450
That's what's differentiating
your business.

214
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,520
As you look forward in five or 10 years,

215
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,817
you're not sitting there going,

216
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,610
"Oh, virtual machines
are the greatest thing

217
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,320
and they're gonna help
my business forward."

218
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,153
They're not.

219
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,980
It's all focused on how we're
modernizing our applications,

220
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,940
how we're using AI against the
datasets that we already run.

221
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,280
And all that's being done in the cloud.

222
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,020
But virtual machines are
still powering 80 to 90%

223
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,430
of the workloads that are
running your organization today.

224
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,800
They're all still running
on virtual machines.

225
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,890
So, while you are here focused
on how am I gonna modernize,

226
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,933
how am I gonna integrate with AI?

227
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,530
I've still got this huge run component

228
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,300
that I need to ensure is smooth,

229
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,460
I need to ensure it's cost efficient,

230
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,410
and I need to make sure
that it's compliant

231
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,060
with whatever we're doing.

232
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,570
And this holds all of the
data that you wanna get

233
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,730
and train with your LLM

234
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,770
that you need to do inference against.

235
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,170
This is where all the applications live

236
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,173
that you wanna modernize
and you wanna move.

237
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,110
Now, before I joined Nutanix,

238
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,663
I worked at AWS for quite a while.

239
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,240
And I say start right,

240
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,600
and I say start with a
modern hybrid cloud platform,

241
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,760
because what we see is that 50%,

242
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,740
and this is Gartner's information,

243
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,020
not just my made up figures.

244
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,140
So, 50% are not gonna achieve their cloud

245
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,420
and AI vision by 2029.

246
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,530
This is just where it's at.

247
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,410
And those of you that have
been involved with AWS

248
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,070
or cloud for a while, you'll
see that it really does happen.

249
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,040
Everybody gets stuck
somewhere on the journey.

250
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,120
And 60% of organizations that
went down a cloud first path

251
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,063
with Kubernetes adoption
have just stopped completely.

252
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,670
And why is that?

253
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,710
So, interoperability first,

254
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,530
how do I ensure that what I'm
building up here in the cloud

255
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,660
is gonna talk to what
I've got on-premises?

256
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,100
How do I know that the latency

257
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,830
that I'm running at an
edge site is not going

258
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,570
to negatively impact the

259
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,550
workloads that I'm building in the cloud?

260
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,620
Interoperability between multiple systems.

261
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,260
If I'm using Windows workloads

262
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,150
or SQL workloads that are really old,

263
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,740
I can't modernize them out of it.

264
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,570
How is that gonna talk
to the new workloads

265
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,640
that are coming up in the cloud?

266
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,180
Security, we all had shadow IT that was,

267
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,440
I don't know, seven, eight years ago.

268
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,170
That was the term security around it.

269
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,300
How often have we seen something like, oh,

270
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,673
my S3 bucket wasn't secured.

271
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,080
In a new environment or in
an enterprise environment,

272
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,280
we're seeing a very, very
brownfield, greenfield approach.

273
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,320
There's a team that manage the cloud,

274
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
and then there's a team that
manage your infrastructure

275
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,200
on-premises, so bimodal
operations severely impacts

276
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,060
how you run your organization.

277
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,198
And the security flow on from this is,

278
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:23,700
is really negative in terms of the team

279
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,280
that have secured on-premises
have probably been doing it

280
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,630
for 10 plus years.

281
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,350
They know the security
compliance that they need to hit,

282
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,170
they know the data retention
policies that they have.

283
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,820
But when you've gone
and built a landing zone

284
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,640
up in the cloud, has
that translated across?

285
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,580
Probably not, because this
team is all brand new.

286
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,440
They haven't been working
in this environment

287
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,000
that's been servicing your business,

288
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,760
that 90% of the workloads
for the last 10 years.

289
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,700
So, they haven't evolved, so
they're starting off fresh.

290
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,040
So, security plays a huge factor

291
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,020
and we see a lot of cloud migrations pause

292
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,963
because the security models
up there are just incorrect.

293
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,320
My favorite one, especially
when I start talking about

294
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,250
the value of Nutanix in
AWS, is around costs.

295
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,077
I wish I had just got paid on
the times that people said,

296
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:10,410
"I was told it was gonna cost me this much

297
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,690
to get into cloud, I've already spent that

298
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,000
and I'm only six months into my journey."

299
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,630
That is my most common piece
of feedback I get from anyone

300
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,150
that's going on that
infrastructure transformation.

301
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,460
If you think about
taking a virtual machine

302
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,310
and modernizing that into cloud itself,

303
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,470
it's not a single task.

304
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,730
Going into Kubernetes, it's
not a single hypervisor change,

305
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,160
like moving a a VMware VM to Nutanix,

306
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,660
that's just a simple reboot.

307
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,580
Taking that VM and figuring out

308
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,320
all the dependencies around it

309
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,840
and then putting that into
a cloud native construct,

310
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,430
that's weeks if not months.

311
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,960
And that's the easy apps.

312
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,690
If we start taking
three-tier monolithic apps

313
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,220
that have been running for 10 years,

314
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,900
we're talking 12 months plus

315
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,240
for just an individual workload
that's gonna go up there.

316
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,430
So, it's not just the infrastructure costs

317
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,853
that come into play, it's the
modernization costs around it.

318
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,810
And then my favorite one
in here is that you'll get,

319
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,450
you'll say in five years,
I'm gonna be cloud first.

320
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,610
I'm gonna have everything cloud native.

321
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,190
And you'll get three or four
years into that journey,

322
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,480
and then what's gonna happen?

323
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,170
You haven't migrated enough
workloads up into the cloud.

324
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,650
And so all of a sudden I
have to repurchase hardware,

325
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,230
I have to repurchase licenses on-premises.

326
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,190
None of this was factored
into my TCO or my ROI

327
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,690
as to why I said the cloud was gonna work

328
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,400
for my organization.

329
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,373
This is a key reason,
again, why these fail.

330
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,240
And complexity, like I touched
on a bit on the applications,

331
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,240
but the complexity around
workload modernization

332
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,710
is really there.

333
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,330
The simple ones are really simple

334
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,740
and they're the low hanging fruit.

335
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,860
If you're already testing,
they're probably already done.

336
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,500
But the partners that
are doing the longer tail

337
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,330
of the three-tier architecture apps,

338
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,830
it's taking a lot longer time.

339
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,810
So, we're here to help and
we help by starting off

340
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,040
with Nutanix Cloud Clusters.

341
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,830
So this is NC2. We've
got a lot of acronyms,

342
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,300
just ask me if you need,

343
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,920
so, we've got Nutanix cloud clusters,

344
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,910
so this is where we start.

345
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,950
This is hybrid cloud done right.

346
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,720
So, the same license, same code base,

347
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,090
same everything from Nutanix on-prem.

348
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,250
We stretch it up into AWS

349
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,080
and you can just move
your workloads at will.

350
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,550
No problems there at all.

351
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,950
And then from there we've
got cloud management,

352
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,950
a single tool that can look at
AWS native, EC2, S3 storage,

353
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,040
as well as all the policies
that run on-prem today.

354
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,600
So, you can pick up the blueprints

355
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,540
that you've spent a long
time designing, automating,

356
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,700
architecting, and now I can apply that

357
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,750
to a native S3 bucket, or I can
apply it to a native EC2 VM,

358
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,820
or I can apply it to a virtual machine

359
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,700
that's running on top of NC2 in AWS.

360
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,410
Really important that this is here,

361
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,570
and it integrates with all
the tools you run today.

362
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,550
So, whether it's Terraform,
whether it's Ansible,

363
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,440
doesn't really matter,
we're just gonna call that,

364
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,273
but we're gonna give it to you

365
00:14:53,273 --> 00:14:56,100
from a single pane of
glass right at the top.

366
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,900
And then we've got, and that one's NCM

367
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,280
if you want another acronym.

368
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,190
And we've got NKP, so
our Kubernetes platform.

369
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,550
We understand that as you start
moving individual workloads

370
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,380
over to Kubernetes, it's okay,

371
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,820
and you can run the distribution

372
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,230
and it's pretty easy to manage.

373
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,660
But when you start looking
at it at an enterprise scale,

374
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,220
what data needs to be persistent

375
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,600
with the Kubernetes workloads?

376
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,270
What data is non persistent
with the Kubernetes workloads?

377
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,970
How am I managing this
distribution across the edge,

378
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,250
across the core, across the cloud?

379
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,990
Maybe I need to put it in another cloud,

380
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,300
because I can't find the service I need.

381
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,350
How are you going to manage that?

382
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,210
So NKP is gonna help you do that.

383
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,630
Again, all through that
single seamless pane of glass

384
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,480
to enable you to get faster,
manage the distribution

385
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,370
and the workloads that are going in.

386
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,840
And then our Enterprise AI.

387
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,300
So, NAI, another one for us.

388
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,110
So, NAI is here so that
you can scale the security,

389
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,470
the policies, the data from the core,

390
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,480
which is gonna run in the data center.

391
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,490
You're gonna pick up
that data from the edge,

392
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,310
ingest it into the core,
run your models against it,

393
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,930
and then bring it up into the cloud.

394
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,090
Then you're gonna run
different metrics against that,

395
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,410
whether it's analytics,

396
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,850
whether it's training a different model

397
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,320
that then you can push back down.

398
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,520
So, we see that the AI
requirements around organizations

399
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,520
are changing on a day-by-day basis.

400
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,490
You can't go through and
buy an entire farm of NVIDIA

401
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,570
and put it on-premises.

402
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,780
It's not gonna work. It's
gonna be too expensive.

403
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,190
And then what if that fails,

404
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,110
and you've now shifted a core workload

405
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,240
or a core application onto that?

406
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,830
You need to be able to stretch it up.

407
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,120
You must be able to do it.

408
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,780
And that's where our AI
security model within AI

409
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,490
is gonna enable you to do that.

410
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,240
So, we start nice and easy
with Nutanix Cloud Clusters,

411
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,400
manage it all through NCM,

412
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,190
NKP will get your applications and AI.

413
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,110
So, on the right, you've got your future

414
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,813
and this is what is gonna
make your now a lot easier.

415
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,090
All right, some customer highlights here.

416
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,589
So, another acronym I haven't
talked about today, NDB.

417
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:57,183
So, Nutanix Database service on NC2.

418
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,320
For those, anyone running
RDS today or using RDS?

419
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,320
So, RDS, Nutanix NDB is a
similar construct to that.

420
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,850
So, what we try and do at the moment

421
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,340
is really look at the database workloads

422
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,530
that you've got either
on-prem or in cloud,

423
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,630
and how we then bring
that orchestration layer

424
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,463
over the top of it.

425
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:17,940
So, we take the change management

426
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,010
out of all the database side of things.

427
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,030
So now we can manage,
whether it's Microsoft, SQL

428
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,820
or whether it's no SQL, any
of those flavors underneath,

429
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,710
we can put that under NDB.

430
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,600
We can streamline your operations there.

431
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,460
And because it's running
on top of Nutanix,

432
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,020
we can make it a lot more efficient

433
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,090
in terms of things like snapshot, backup,

434
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,310
DR, et cetera, et cetera.

435
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,230
This has been a real big win for us,

436
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,120
so if you haven't seen NDB,

437
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,770
definitely come and ask us later.

438
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,140
Speed, hand-back migrated
workloads in 24 hours.

439
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,580
So, three to four hours,
that's not even close.

440
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,320
So, 52 minutes it takes once
you have your AWS account ID

441
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,030
and you go into the Nutanix portal

442
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,133
and you say, go build me a cluster in AWS,

443
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,443
50 minutes and you're up and running.

444
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:07,500
Then another hour after that,
you configure layer two.

445
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,850
That way your IP preservation

446
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,560
when you need to go up
in the cloud is there

447
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,730
and ready for you to go.

448
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,230
So, in under two hours,

449
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,360
you've stretched on-prem into the cloud.

450
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,300
You can enable mass workload
migration at that point.

451
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,610
You're not as worried about dependencies,

452
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,330
because you can start moving
VLAN by VLAN, rack by rack.

453
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,220
You don't need to really piecemeal

454
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,890
each individual workload or each server.

455
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,720
We can pick up a whole lot more

456
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,060
and move them up at
the same point in time.

457
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,580
If you're running Nutanix
today, that's really easy.

458
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,580
If you're coming from another
hypervisor on-premises

459
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,810
or in another cloud, maybe an
Azure VM, something like that.

460
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,790
It's just a single reboot, okay?

461
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,830
And we can stretch it from
Azure back over to AWS

462
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,663
and do that.

463
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,470
And the simplicity, our DR
solution has been something

464
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,420
that's really, really evolved

465
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,280
over the last six to 12 months,

466
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,200
and we've got some new
product announcements

467
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,220
coming with that one in January,
but two flavors for that.

468
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,050
So, the first one is our MST product.

469
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,180
That's the hibernation
that I spoke about before.

470
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,560
And the second one is pilot light.

471
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,450
So, we run that three-node cluster.

472
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,030
It's really light, it's really small,

473
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,860
and that protects your tier zero workload.

474
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,650
So something that I can't
have any downtime for,

475
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,760
we're really low.

476
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,630
If that's inter AWS, so
AZ to AZ, it's metro,

477
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,990
so there's no downtime in
terms of that hibernated,

478
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,540
in terms of that pilot light cluster.

479
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,990
And then we've got integration then

480
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,970
with the third party backup providers.

481
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,890
So, for a seamless perspective,

482
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,830
you could have Cohesity
backing up your workloads.

483
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,100
tZero is snapshot by Nutanix into AWS,

484
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,980
and then everything will go
and restore into that cluster.

485
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,460
So, the DR solution from us
is really highly evolved.

486
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,380
If you're running Nutanix
today, I would say

487
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,660
come and see us over
there, get it started.

488
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,330
That's a really easy one to go and turn on

489
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,030
with big benefits to the business.

490
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,370
I'll finish off with our incentives.

491
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,460
For those of you that know
AWS, there's a ton there.

492
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,490
You can procure all Nutanix
licenses, whether it's on-prem

493
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,280
or in the cloud through AWS marketplace.

494
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,590
Everything is done through
either the Nutanix console

495
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,390
or the AWS one.

496
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,360
We've made it really
easy, 30-day free trial,

497
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,100
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

498
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,080
Please come and see the team over that

499
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,690
and I'll leave you with some QR codes

500
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,730
if you would like some more information.

501
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,740
But come and get hybrid cloud done right

502
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,420
with Nutanix on AWS.

503
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,253
Thank you.
