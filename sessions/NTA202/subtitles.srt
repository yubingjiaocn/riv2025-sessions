1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,583
- Good morning.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,660
For many of you, this might
be your first re:Invent,

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,923
or maybe first day at re:Invent,
or maybe the first session.

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,340
I'm not sure whether this is
first silent session or not.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,390
Everybody's comfortable with the headset?

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,323
You know how to control volume?

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,320
Great, thank you and welcome again.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,560
Thank you for joining us
today for next 60 minutes

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,380
as we unpack the agentic AI story.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,950
And here is a thing, you are
hearing the story from humans

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,720
and not from the agent.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,470
Maybe at least for now, we
don't know what will change.

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,620
Imagine a world where AI doesn't need

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,290
to wait for instruction.

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,290
It can take initiative,
it anticipates your need,

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,853
make decisions, and act on your behalf.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,350
Agentic AI is bringing in that shift.

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,900
Agentic AI is transforming
organization like yours

19
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,215
from automation to autonomic.

20
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,820
Today, we will show you
how agentic AI vision,

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,570
is delivering meaningful
business outcomes,

22
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,710
and real business results
that matters the most.

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,880
My name is Sujal Shah.

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,120
I am senior customer
solution manager with AWS,

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,250
along with me, Hamed Shahir,

26
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,000
is director of AI and data
science at Siteimprove,

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,323
and Pradeep Sridharan, senior
solution architect at AWS.

28
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:39,121
In this session,

29
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:42,940
we will focus on three
most critical elements

30
00:01:43,776 --> 00:01:48,093
that actually unlocks
power of generative AI.

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,300
First and most important
is move beyond the hype.

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,620
Today, AI landscape is
filled with noise and hype.

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,010
We will explore how to
cut through that noise

34
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,680
and identify the AI initiatives

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,800
that aligns with your
unique business goals

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,110
and strategic differentiation.

37
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,070
This is important,

38
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,800
rather than chasing every
new technology trend

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,130
or focus on trying new use cases.

40
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,010
Once you identify the most
important AI initiative,

41
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,890
the next important thing is journey.

42
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,990
How you will take those initiatives

43
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,570
from idea to production at scale.

44
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,630
Hamed will walk us through
Siteimprove journey,

45
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,400
and he will show us how Siteimprove,

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,060
has convert their bold ideas
into production-ready solution

47
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,400
that is already delivering result

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,020
to their customer working
alongside with AWS.

49
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,640
And third, Pradeep will walk us through

50
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,310
how AWS GenAI services is
providing everything you need

51
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,680
to be successful with agentic AI.

52
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,490
From foundational capabilities
to production-ready workload,

53
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,810
it enables you to build

54
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,323
and manage enterprise-grade
agentic solutions at scale.

55
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,440
Let's start with something fundamental.

56
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,863
What is the most important
thing for your business today?

57
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,130
Most likely, your answer will point,

58
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,130
towards the core business principles.

59
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,230
For example, customer focus,

60
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,230
operation efficiency, product innovation,

61
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,560
strategic differentiation,
personalized experience,

62
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,670
and so on, right?

63
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,420
None of this fundamental
business principle change,

64
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,210
but what is changing
and changing rapidly is

65
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,793
how you are delivering
on those principles.

66
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,460
Generative AI and agentic AI
is fundamentally transforming

67
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,800
how value is created and delivered.

68
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,330
It is shifting from reactive workflows

69
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,460
to proactive outcome-driven system.

70
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:58,460
Agentic AI systems empower
businesses to innovate faster,

71
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,480
respond in real-time,

72
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,290
and stay ahead of changing
market requirements,

73
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,390
market dynamics and customer needs,

74
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,663
and that put you towards
a profitable growth.

75
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,470
The level of empowerment
and enablement it creates

76
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,473
for businesses definitely sounds powerful,

77
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,310
but the main question is
what do we really mean

78
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,180
by agentic AI, and how it is different

79
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,390
from traditional automation system

80
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,020
that many of us have been
using for decades too

81
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,423
to deliver on our core
business principles?

82
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,963
Traditional automation
relies on predefined rules.

83
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,383
Generative AI responds to prompts.

84
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,860
Agentic AI goes further.

85
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,860
It plans, reason, take
initiatives independently

86
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,733
to drive outcomes.

87
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,783
Agentic AI systems are
designed with intent.

88
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,440
They think and focus
in terms of objectives

89
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,590
and not just executing instructions.

90
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,380
Agentic AI acts autonomously.

91
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,290
It sets goals, dynamically
adapt strategies

92
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,583
for the given context.

93
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,520
It has been interesting to watch

94
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,823
how GenAI is evolving into agentic AI.

95
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,140
GenAI generate contents.

96
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,100
You provide a prompt,
it produce an output,

97
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,490
either a paragraph,
image, or line of code.

98
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,170
Definitely, it is very powerful,

99
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,470
but it is wait for your next instruction.

100
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,470
GenAI agent took this
further by breaking down task

101
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,113
into smaller steps.

102
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,590
Agentic AI system has evolved

103
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,373
into fully autonomous multi-agent system.

104
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,940
Agentic AI systems are capable

105
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,110
of executing complex multi-step workflow

106
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,530
by dynamically adapting strategy
to changing environment.

107
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,020
Most importantly, it can do all this thing

108
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,023
without any human or
external intervention.

109
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,123
Definitely, agentic AI
sounds transformative,

110
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:25,503
and it definitely offers real potential.

111
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,440
Understanding what is agentic AI,

112
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,873
is maybe a relatively easy task,

113
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,910
but the real challenge and the
most important thing is how?

114
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,430
How organizations are adopting it,

115
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,430
how do they operationalize
agentic AI with scale,

116
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,481
and with a clear path to measure value,

117
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:47,580
with a clear path to outcomes,

118
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,663
with a clear path ultimately
towards monetization?

119
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,593
Agentic AI adoption is
definitely accelerating fast.

120
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,420
Gartner predicts that,
"Within just one year,

121
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,940
40% of enterprise applications,

122
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,690
will embed task-specific agentic AI."

123
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,690
Fast forward in three years,
autonomous AI will handle up

124
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,453
to 15% of daily work decision,

125
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,753
and in next 10 years, by 2035,

126
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:26,460
agentic AI-driven software is expected

127
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,760
to capture approximately 35%

128
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,280
of enterprise application revenue,

129
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,280
and that is roughly surpassing
$450 billion dollar.

130
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,303
Now, think about this.

131
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,930
When we say 40% of
enterprise applications,

132
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,830
will have agent AI-specific embedment,

133
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,180
that is not a pilot metrics

134
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,370
that talks about the real adoption.

135
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,360
And when we say 30% of
enterprise revenue will be driven

136
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,690
by agentic AI solution,
that is not just an add-on.

137
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,890
That is product itself,

138
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,283
and that's how the industry
is adopting agentic AI.

139
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,060
There are two powerful ways

140
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,800
where businesses are leveraging
agentic AI and GenAI.

141
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,250
These two powerful ways
are operational improvement

142
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,053
and product innovation.

143
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,380
Operational improvement.

144
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,470
This is basically
streamlining how you build,

145
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,980
market, sell and scale
your products, right?

146
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,980
Agentic AI reduce friction and
it enables efficiency gain,

147
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,613
that free up capacity.

148
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,160
Product innovation.

149
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,940
Product innovation is
transforming what you do

150
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,570
or what you do to offer
your better differentiation,

151
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,993
enhance customer experience
and greater adaptability.

152
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,560
Agentic AI unlocks new capabilities

153
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,950
and competitive advantage
and that brings in new

154
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,633
or net new revenue stream.

155
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,473
Together, this create a very
powerful business dynamics,

156
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,530
cost-saving from efficiency,

157
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,680
plus new revenue stream from innovation.

158
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,370
This is how you sustain
growth in AI first era.

159
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,950
In the early adopter,
and most of the thing,

160
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,270
what we are seeing today,

161
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,390
businesses are focusing on
operational improvement,

162
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,240
but the real power comes
from product innovation,

163
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,540
and we need to balance both
operational improvements

164
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,553
and product innovation.

165
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,500
The balance between
this renewed efficiency

166
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,520
and new growth creates
investment opportunities,

167
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,070
and you know that there is no shortage

168
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,350
of AI investment ideas, right?

169
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,540
You do any hackathon, you
any brainstorming session,

170
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,780
you will get laundry list of ideas.

171
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,010
So the real challenge is not

172
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,050
to identify the ideas and opportunity.

173
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,390
The real challenge is identifying

174
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:53,130
which opportunity truly moves
the needle for your business

175
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,810
with the high impact use cases

176
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,880
that advance your unique business goal,

177
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,510
that advance your business outcomes,

178
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,670
and not just spreading investment thin

179
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,160
on low-value experiments.

180
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,810
So the question becomes,

181
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,243
how do you prioritize your AI investment?

182
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,950
We know that fundamentals don't change,

183
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,890
and one of those fundamentals
is working backwards.

184
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,080
Working backwards is Amazon mechanism

185
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,180
for prioritizing investments

186
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,000
by starting with customer outcomes,

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,813
and then decide which one truly
worth building and funding.

188
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,883
Not all opportunities are equal,

189
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,070
start with business outcomes and metrics,

190
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,483
and then you work backward.

191
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,270
Evaluate each opportunity's
value potential,

192
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,630
against effort required to deliver those.

193
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,080
Let's break this down into a framework.

194
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,920
You start with quick win,

195
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,440
a high-impact opportunities
with low effort,

196
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,750
and this will help you build momentum,

197
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,250
and achieve early result.

198
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,280
In parallel, you focus on
your most strategic bets

199
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,220
and initiative that holds
the highest potential.

200
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,270
Avoid investing resource-heavy
effort intensive project

201
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,850
that can only deliver moderate results.

202
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,610
As your AI and data maturity grows,

203
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,980
keep an eye on emerging opportunities,

204
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,633
and only prioritize those
that can help you build scale,

205
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,120
and after all, measure
all these opportunities,

206
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,610
against three important metrics,

207
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,910
trust, speed, and adoption.

208
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,500
Trust.

209
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,280
Ask this question, do these
opportunities help you build

210
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,753
and sustain customer trust?

211
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,630
Speed.

212
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,130
Can you move fast at scale

213
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,397
and not just solving today's status quo?

214
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:51,690
We are not just solving short-term goals,

215
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,150
but whatever you decide to do,

216
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,670
can you do it at scale?

217
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,110
And adoption.

218
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,330
As you know, adoption is
the most important metrics.

219
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,463
Without adoption, trust and speed,

220
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,980
they don't matter, right?

221
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,980
Adoption means whatever product
innovations you are doing,

222
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,670
are your customers using it?

223
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,540
Not only just using it, but
are they delivering any value?

224
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,850
And once they start using
and start delivering value,

225
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,073
do you see a path towards monetization?

226
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,337
So the structured approach
keeps AI initiative focused

227
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,350
on what truly moves the needle.

228
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,243
You can maximize your
business with managing risk.

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,420
Naturally, there are concerns

230
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,503
about converting effort
investment into growth potential.

231
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,630
Here, agentic AI act
as a force multiplier.

232
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,280
It enables organization

233
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,970
to unlock powerful growth trajectories

234
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,250
with meaningful investment.

235
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,643
Think of agentic AI as
your strategic fulcrum,

236
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,833
with the right foundation,

237
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,850
investment in infrastructure and talent,

238
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,830
you gain leverage.

239
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,850
With a clear growth
vision, new revenue stream,

240
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,360
differentiated product,
sustainable competitive edge,

241
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,980
you set the direction, but the
real impact comes from speed,

242
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,100
how quickly you can
convert this opportunity

243
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,043
and stay ahead of market
dynamics and customer needs.

244
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,440
Yes, it is practical reality

245
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,760
that agentic AI requires
upfront investment

246
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,470
and maybe some short-term trade-offs,

247
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,450
but with clear strategy
and discipline execution,

248
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,480
agentic AI becomes force multiplier,

249
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,940
takes you beyond incremental gain,

250
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,323
unlocking transformative growth
from every major investment.

251
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,320
So invest in the right foundation,

252
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,400
set the clear transfer with your vision,

253
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,950
prioritize quick win that
can help you build momentum,

254
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,810
and achieve early result.

255
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,510
That will put you on a path
towards turning investment

256
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,710
into realized value.

257
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,163
And then slowly, you can
accelerate on your go-to market.

258
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,780
This leads towards lean
investment and exceptional result,

259
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,893
and this is how winning enterprises
are adopting agentic AI.

260
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,720
Now, we know how to stay focused,

261
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,720
avoid distractions from
every new technology trend,

262
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,050
avoid distractions from new announcements,

263
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,910
happens every day, right?

264
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,920
Framing the opportunity that aligns

265
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,733
with your unique business goal
and force multiplier effect.

266
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,610
And that's not the end.

267
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,940
The real game is how to
take these opportunities

268
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,820
through the implementation
funnel and land solutions

269
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,710
on your customer hands.

270
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,310
Let me invite Hamed to walk us
through Siteimprove journey,

271
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,420
transforming the bold ideas
into production-grade solutions,

272
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,070
leveraging AWS capability.

273
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,213
Hamed.
- Thank you.

274
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,150
Hello everyone.

275
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,880
This is Hamed, and I'm very excited

276
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,310
that I'm representing Siteimprove today,

277
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:31,310
and share our AI journey from
generative AI to agentic AI.

278
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,150
A short introduction.

279
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,850
Siteimprove is a software
as a service platform

280
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,580
and a company that helps organization,

281
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,570
ensure their digital
presence is accessible,

282
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,270
compliant and highly performing.

283
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:48,976
They combine digital
accessibility, analytics,

284
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:51,630
SEO, AEO, and content strategy

285
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,860
into one integrated platform
called Siteimprove AI.

286
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,820
And we typically serve
medium-to-large enterprises,

287
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,090
government agencies,
educational institutions,

288
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,370
financial services, healthcare,

289
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,760
and any organization with
substantial digital footprint

290
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,220
who cares about the
quality and performance

291
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,843
of their digital content.

292
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,640
But what do we really
mean by a unified platform

293
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,460
for agentic content intelligence?

294
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:25,230
So we have AI agents and
solutions in four different areas

295
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,250
as I mentioned; accessibility,
analytics, SEO, and contents.

296
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,130
Our accessibility platform and agents,

297
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,130
big continuous compliance
into your workflows

298
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,310
and ensure accessibility
across web, mobile,

299
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,390
social, documents, applications by design

300
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,220
and not by accident.

301
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,270
Siteimprove agent assist every
designer, developer, editor

302
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,890
to make sure content is
accessible by default.

303
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,100
We help identify and fix
accessibility issues,

304
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,213
maintain site quality and
meet critical standards,

305
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,713
ensuring a seamless digital
experience for all users.

306
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,820
When it comes to analytics agents,

307
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,570
we want to stop sifting
through raw dashboards

308
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,390
and focus on what matters most.

309
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:19,560
These agents translate
traffic and page insight

310
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,690
into clear next step,

311
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,440
prioritize a tie to your business goals.

312
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,990
In other words, advanced analytics

313
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,990
as well as the user behavior
turns into actionable insights.

314
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,440
And our purpose here is

315
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,170
by continuously improving the performance

316
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,480
with our AI-driven intelligence,

317
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,840
your business stays
ahead of the competition

318
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,433
and maximizes ROI.

319
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,380
So we have SEO agents,

320
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,540
the purpose is to outshine the competition

321
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,020
in search engines, LLMs and AI search.

322
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,090
Each agent support SEO
leads and content owner

323
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,280
to basically by offering real-time
guidance and optimization

324
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,290
through the content creation process

325
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,440
to boost visibility and discoverability.

326
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,490
This is very important.

327
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,950
We harness power AI-driven tools

328
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,850
to ensure that your
content not only aligns

329
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,380
with your business goals,

330
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,133
but also, is discoverable
across different search engines.

331
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,180
And last, content agents helps planners,

332
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,860
writers and strategists

333
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,400
through their every phase
of content ideation,

334
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,890
planning, briefing and optimization,

335
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,300
and basically, tries to close
the gaps between your content.

336
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,980
But this is not the end.

337
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,780
We also need orchestration agents

338
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,360
to work across the
Siteimprove AI platform,

339
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,593
and agnostically, integrate
with your ecosystem such as CMS.

340
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:56,270
So agentic AI adoption, and
why this is very important

341
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,940
to have a successful agentic AI adoption.

342
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,940
We all know that AI is super
easy when it comes to POC.

343
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,950
You see high school kids are
playing with these tools,

344
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,340
plugging them, but it's
very hard when it comes

345
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,980
to production and at scale.

346
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,653
There are two key
challenges here, we believe.

347
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,120
One is driving non-deterministic AI models

348
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,113
to deliver more deterministic
and consistent output.

349
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,050
And the second challenge is
when people start avoiding,

350
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,150
basically, the error rates.

351
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,853
We should not underestimate
the error rates,

352
00:19:36,753 --> 00:19:39,000
when we are thinking about scaling.

353
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,927
As an example, you may think,

354
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,820
"Oh, my system is working
99% correct and perfect,"

355
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,130
but then we are scaling to 100 million

356
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,190
or more requests per month,

357
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,250
that translates into 1
million requests submitted

358
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,613
to AI getting error, and
that is the big challenge.

359
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,790
So now, I should say,

360
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,770
the way that we see this AI adoption,

361
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,820
is not a big bang moment,
it's more like a trust curve.

362
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,210
And at Siteimprove, we
do this in three steps.

363
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,850
In the first step, human is in the loop,

364
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,780
and that means AI and
human work side by side.

365
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,503
AI suggests, explains and validates,

366
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,690
but the human is the final
decision-maker, and it approves.

367
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,410
This is where we prove the
value of our agentic solutions

368
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,530
with higher quality, faster delivery,

369
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,680
fewer errors, and measurable impact.

370
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,370
The next step is to go
from human in the loop

371
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,723
to human on the loop.

372
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Here, we still have the
human in the picture,

373
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,840
but not as an operator.

374
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,373
It's more like as a governor.

375
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:56,690
So it overlooks or the AI
basically does most of the job,

376
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,657
and the human only governs
the overall process.

377
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,450
The next step is human out of the loop.

378
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:14,163
And this is when we are
fully automating our process,

379
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,560
and when the trust is there.

380
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,330
But generally speaking,

381
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:29,330
we should not move
forward to each next step,

382
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,523
before answering two main questions.

383
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,170
Do users trust the system,

384
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,590
and has the system proven its value?

385
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,760
Because if you skip the
trust, adoption stalls,

386
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,840
and if you skip the
value, trust never forms.

387
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,780
And this is the biggest
challenge that we have.

388
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,110
So this is the three-layer
agentic AI adoption

389
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:58,143
that we are trying to do at Siteimprove.

390
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,120
But what agent AI really
means at Siteimprove.

391
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,530
Let's get into this.

392
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,700
It's very interesting

393
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,240
if you all search for
agentic AI definition,

394
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,230
you probably realize there
is no single definition

395
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,450
for agentic AI, and that's okay.

396
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,480
But everybody agrees that
intelligent agents are built

397
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,380
on core abilities like
plan, retrieve, act,

398
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,360
remember, understand, create,

399
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,420
specialize, recall, and customize.

400
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,970
And these are the core building blocks

401
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,730
that turn an agent from a chat interface

402
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,063
into a reliable digital teammate.

403
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,770
An agent is more like a
special assistant designed

404
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:45,120
for a specific task,
operate on those ability

405
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,283
to deliver consistent results.

406
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,210
But there is a key point here.

407
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,990
Having an agent, or even
having multiple agents,

408
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,730
doesn't automatically mean

409
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,043
that you have an agentic AI system.

410
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,130
Agentic AI truly begins
one system orchestrates,

411
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:10,130
multiple agents and technology
towards the same unified goal

412
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,210
and they work together,

413
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,720
and in an autonomous loops like a plan,

414
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,640
act, observe, adjust,

415
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,220
plan, act, observe, adjust.

416
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,720
It chooses the right sequence
of tasks, tools, models,

417
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,260
and make decisions
without human interaction

418
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:37,680
with the constant
communication with the agent.

419
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,443
So in the past 12 months,

420
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,440
we started from bringing generative AI,

421
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,770
and now we are at the agentic AI stage.

422
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,920
And now I want to share
part of our journey

423
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,663
and some use cases with you.

424
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,880
At first, with generative AI,

425
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,310
it's like having a brilliant assistant

426
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:06,450
who can create things for
you but only when you ask.

427
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,000
This is very similar to
a product that we have,

428
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,010
which is called brand consistency.

429
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,820
When the user comes and
ask, "Match, for example,

430
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,810
this content on this page
with the tone of voice

431
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,070
of my brand."

432
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,713
The prompt is fixed, the ask is fixed,

433
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,820
the generative AI model
generates the output.

434
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,040
Or when we have some accessibility,

435
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,640
rule checker goes and
check based on some prompts

436
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,353
and generates some fix.

437
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,920
Next is the AI agents.

438
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,630
In addition to generation,

439
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,610
now your assistant can make suggestion

440
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,830
and even take actions.

441
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,730
Agents are capable of taking
initiative, using tools,

442
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,250
integrating with other
part of your system,

443
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,380
and get the work done.

444
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,630
This is what we are currently doing,

445
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,960
and we have different systems,

446
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,110
such as conversational
accessibility or remediation,

447
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,840
or conversational analytics.

448
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,100
And the last phase is
basically the agentic AI phase

449
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,960
where your assistant becomes
more like a collaborative team

450
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,960
that can plan, coordinate
and adopt autonomously.

451
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,660
Here, multiple agents
communicate and work together

452
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,393
to solve problems dynamically.

453
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,243
You don't have to micromanage them,

454
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,270
they understand the goal,

455
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,130
they figure things out along the way,

456
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,200
and that is the agentic AI.

457
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,620
And this is our mission
to get these agents,

458
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,190
across all of our platform that
they can talk to each other,

459
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,563
communicate each other,
and get things done.

460
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,200
Before continuing this, I want
to take a moment to mention

461
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,190
that Siteimprove was
recognized as a leader

462
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,210
in the Forrester Wave for
digital accessibility platforms.

463
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,340
And this was a big achievement.

464
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,370
The Forrester Wave measures
digital accessibility vendors,

465
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,400
across the strengths of
their product offering

466
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,800
as well as the strength of their strategy,

467
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,800
and we advanced into leader
category in both axis.

468
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:16,800
And basically, we could achieve,

469
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,920
highest possible scoring 13 criteria,

470
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,010
including our innovation and vision.

471
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,405
This is the code from Forrester.

472
00:26:24,405 --> 00:26:27,420
Siteimprove is unique from
other leaders in this market

473
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,280
because it provides accessibility

474
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,440
as part of a broader unified platform

475
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,819
that includes SEO, analytics,
and content strategy.

476
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:36,300
(audience applauding)

477
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:41,300
So our journey started from
content intelligence platform,

478
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:45,300
and now, we are going to
agentic unified platform.

479
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,180
But before I jump into
the actual use cases

480
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,680
and technical architecture,

481
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,950
I want to say why accessibility
engine is very important

482
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,053
for us if you don't know.

483
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,580
So accessibility is about
ensuring digital content works

484
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:07,190
for everyone, including 1.3 billion people

485
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,990
with disabilities, visually
impaired users navigating

486
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,210
with screen readers as well as users

487
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,693
with motor impairments
relying on voice commands.

488
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,020
Let's assume a page title is welcome

489
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,210
or a link says, "Click here,"

490
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,310
the experience is broken here.

491
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,690
And fixing these in production
is not as easy as you think,

492
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,690
because some of our customers
have 50,000 webpages

493
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,110
that needs to be crowded,
needs to be checked,

494
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,870
and there are some timeline.

495
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,950
So this is not necessarily
an AI challenge per se,

496
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,320
it's more about an orchestration

497
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,453
and infrastructure challenge.

498
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,780
Today, I'm gonna present three
of our interesting use cases,

499
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,540
and the reason I selected
these three use cases,

500
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,730
is each of them has its own pattern,

501
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:07,530
and we show how these pattern
is implemented in production.

502
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,800
The first use case is async
batch processing use case,

503
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,080
asynchronous batch processing.

504
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,260
When we try to automate
potential issue reviews

505
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,600
for accessibility, here,

506
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,240
we need to process millions of pages,

507
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,390
up to 100 million pages per month

508
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,700
for accessibility rule check.

509
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,700
And obviously, if you can do
this with an acceptable cost

510
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:37,670
and meaningful scale, this
saves a lot of time and effort

511
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,663
from your manual work.

512
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,180
Let's assume then you can
submit everything in a batch,

513
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,820
and you get the response in 24 hours,

514
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,220
you can submit up to 100 batches,

515
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,500
each batch 100,000 requests,

516
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,500
and in one day, you can achieve
10 million requests done.

517
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,940
And I show you the architecture

518
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,820
that we implemented for this use case.

519
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,180
The second use case is
conversational AI remediation

520
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,860
for accessibility issue.

521
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,160
This use case is a synchronous
conversational use case,

522
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,940
when the user comes and try
to fix any specific issue.

523
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,580
And if the user is not
satisfied with the response,

524
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,070
then it starts the
conversation with the agent

525
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,173
and get the work done.

526
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:28,250
The third use case is async
again, but now it's not batch,

527
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:31,560
because not necessarily
everything can work in batch.

528
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,960
Some of our task has higher priority,

529
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,680
and we need to deal with
high priority async requests

530
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,130
to be able to get the
response as soon as possible.

531
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,550
This use case focuses on
contextual image analysis,

532
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,310
which means we want to
understand the context

533
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:51,360
of that image is relevant to
the image, like an alt text,

534
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,303
or the heading on the top,
the caption on the bottom.

535
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,870
So before I continue to talk,

536
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,940
I wanna show you a one-minute video,

537
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,470
and then you get a better understanding

538
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,060
of what I'm talking about, for example,

539
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,610
for this conversational AI remediate.

540
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,640
So this is an interactive experience,

541
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,630
the user can go to the portal
and see the potential issues,

542
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:16,380
click on one of them to
understand what's going on.

543
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,800
The AI tries to understand the context,

544
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,680
and here, it says, "No
title for this page."

545
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,700
It reads the page,
makes sense of the page,

546
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,490
and try to come up with
suggestions alongside

547
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,830
with some explanation and best practices,

548
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,600
that you need to do something.

549
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,060
And then if you're not
happy with the result,

550
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,860
and if you have any further question,

551
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,367
you can ask the agent,

552
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:43,380
"Okay, can you tell me a bit
more about this situation?"

553
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,560
And the agent starts again
going to the history,

554
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,140
the context, and get the response back,

555
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,063
and send it back to the user.

556
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,680
Now, things are getting more interesting.

557
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,610
Before we start developing
and implementing any system,

558
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:09,090
it's very important to understand
the business requirements,

559
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:12,060
and this is even more
important for AI agent

560
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,340
and agentic AI systems.

561
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,210
Sometimes some
non-functional requirements,

562
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,433
can change things significantly.

563
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,470
I will review some of these
business requirements with you

564
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,375
so you have an idea of what's going on

565
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,840
and why we decided to go
with AWS and Nova model

566
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,090
and I will show the architecture next.

567
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:39,840
So we are operating in both US and EU.

568
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,300
So we need enterprise-grade security,

569
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,520
governance, and compliance.

570
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,340
We need multi-region
support for compliance,

571
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,680
scalability, and resilience.

572
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,350
We need multi-model API.

573
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,960
So we should be able to
have agentic solutions

574
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,720
as well as generative AI solutions.

575
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,940
It's very important for us to have access

576
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,150
to variety of leading models
including Claude, Llama,

577
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,490
Nova, and so on,

578
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,510
support for both batch
and interactive workloads,

579
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,440
and a good support for deep
and seamless integration.

580
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,470
But the most important
thing is flexible pricing.

581
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,140
We need to make sure we
can optimize the cost when

582
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,240
we are running at a scale.

583
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,730
When we looked into
the possible solutions,

584
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,140
Bedrock was a great pick

585
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,720
because Bedrock runs
in the same environment

586
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,330
and same VPC as the rest
of your architecture.

587
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,850
You have multi-region
support automatically.

588
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,090
Bedrock supports both
agent and generative.

589
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,540
You have a variety of
support for both batch

590
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,140
and interactive, deep
and seamless integration.

591
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,560
And when we were looking
into Bedrock solutions

592
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,110
and Nova models, at some point,

593
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,260
we realized, "Oh, some of the models,

594
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,740
for example, Nova Micro at
that time when we checked,

595
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,340
we had 75 cost reduction
compared to the leading models

596
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,427
at that time, for some of
the use cases that we have."

597
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,360
So it's very important
to select the right model

598
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,920
for the right problem,

599
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,200
and not take the best model possible

600
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,823
for a very tiny problem.

601
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,663
This is Siteimprove AI accelerator.

602
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,500
We designed this in a way to satisfy all

603
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,330
of our business requirements

604
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,860
as well as all the possible
use cases that we are aware of.

605
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,710
The top layer is Siteimprove applications,

606
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,290
and the bottom layer outside
of the box is the AI services

607
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:37,470
that we use like an Amazon
SageMaker, Amazon Bedrock,

608
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,570
like in Foundation Models, Bedrock Agents,

609
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,160
and even AgentCore.

610
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,750
What is inside, it's very high level,

611
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,620
and I go to the next slide
which shows you the details,

612
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,400
but then here we have
three main big components.

613
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,610
One is our batch manager, one
is our business logic manager,

614
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,379
which includes all the
prompts and parameters,

615
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:58,470
and all the details
about the actual problem.

616
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,230
And the last layer, which is
shared between almost everyone,

617
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,150
is AI service adapters.

618
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,630
So based on the case,

619
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,920
we want to talk, for example,

620
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,230
to a specific third-party model.

621
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,930
So we will have an adapter
there to talk to that model,

622
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:16,800
or have an adapter for
Converse API and Bedrock.

623
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,780
So this is the high level one,

624
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,010
but this is, I want to have a closer look,

625
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,590
and what do I really mean
by async batch processing?

626
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:29,040
And I'm not gonna talk
about too many details here,

627
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,260
but it gives you an
idea of what's going on.

628
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,030
Like, and we have an
async batch processing,

629
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,520
I already told you, and examples are,

630
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,660
for example, we want to know

631
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:41,660
if the HTML page title is
descriptive of the page or not,

632
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,730
or the heading of a section
is descriptive or not.

633
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,070
By batch processing, I'm
talking about millions

634
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,610
of pages per day, up to
100 batches of 100Ks,

635
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,620
turns to 10 million pages per day,

636
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,530
and we will have input and output queues.

637
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,000
Starting from the top left,

638
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
that purple circle ALB, the
request is coming to the system.

639
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,340
We have a lambda grabbing the request,

640
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,630
putting in a queue right away

641
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,030
without any further processing.

642
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,780
There is another lambda
after we have enough requests

643
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,550
in the queue, grabs them,

644
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,860
put them and group them in an S3 bucket,

645
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,610
make them ready for
batch processing Bedrock.

646
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:24,660
Every few hours or few minutes
depending on your load,

647
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,740
we have another lambda submitting
these batches to Bedrock.

648
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,410
We know the turnaround time is 24 hours,

649
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,170
so we watch for an event to get triggered,

650
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:38,760
and then we have two lambda
to grab the results each,

651
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,030
the one lambda grabs
the whole batch response

652
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,150
and the other lambda process
each of them, clean them,

653
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,210
do the post-processing,
and submit the results back

654
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,320
to another queue.

655
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,090
With this architecture,

656
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,310
we could achieve what I just explained,

657
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,200
like, in millions of requests.

658
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,860
And then think about what I
mentioned at the beginning.

659
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,180
I said I picked three use cases for you

660
00:36:02,415 --> 00:36:04,080
to show you some patterns.

661
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,700
And this is what I mean,

662
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,710
this is our AI accelerator architecture

663
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,270
that's getting extended.

664
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,890
On the very right side,

665
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,430
that section is exactly
the what I just showed you,

666
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,550
and that's a batch processor unit.

667
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,630
In the middle part,

668
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,260
whenever we have some sort of
an interactive conversation

669
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,520
with some agents,

670
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,820
we have some lambdas to
talk to the Bedrock Agents,

671
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,460
around the conversation,
having conversation,

672
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,150
having revision for the
conversation, having remediation.

673
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,460
And on the very left,

674
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,363
you see the third use case
for contextual image analysis.

675
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,240
I take some time here again.

676
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,063
So the request is coming to this lambda,

677
00:36:48,003 --> 00:36:50,460
the URL of the image gets
pushed to that queue when

678
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,350
we have enough requests,

679
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:56,730
a Bedrock requester grabs the
request, submit to Bedrock,

680
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,430
it's async but it's not batch.

681
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,130
So it submits back or
sends back the result

682
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,770
to the output queue and
the user is using it.

683
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,360
And now, think about this,

684
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,540
I have three pattern established
in my infrastructure.

685
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,570
So if I have like five more
use cases in the batch,

686
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,400
I follow the same pattern,

687
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,920
and if I have two more
use cases high priority,

688
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,940
I follow this pattern.

689
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,790
So we are trying to
build this architecture

690
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,370
to support all possible use cases

691
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,083
that we have in our business.

692
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,630
I want to double-click

693
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,330
on a very recent
development and a highlight

694
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,090
that we are now extending
our agentic framework

695
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,990
with AgentCore for
conversational analytics,

696
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,603
and why this is important.

697
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,310
I already mentioned,

698
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,920
we are thinking about
having a unified platform,

699
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,750
and the user comes to our platform,

700
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,993
and can ask questions from
different aspects of the system.

701
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,627
Think about this, user comes and say,

702
00:37:52,627 --> 00:37:56,367
"What are the issues with
my top visited pages?"

703
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,050
We need to go to the
analytics of the website,

704
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,930
understand, or when I say we, the agent,

705
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,430
needs to go and understand,

706
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,590
what are the top visited pages

707
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,110
and what are those pages basically?

708
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,667
Then the agent calls
multiple agents to say,

709
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:15,030
"Okay, what's wrong with
the accessibility part?

710
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,830
What's wrong with the SEO part?

711
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,790
What's wrong here?

712
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,350
How the user can improve?"

713
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,900
So with this AgentCore architecture,

714
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,900
we try to connect the existing agents

715
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,440
into more scalable solution.

716
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,810
We have real agentic AI.

717
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,260
You'll see our AgentCore
Runtime is running

718
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,770
on a Strand Agent.

719
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,850
It some internal local tools
for query interpretation,

720
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,260
for formatting, for another
formatting for JSON and UX.

721
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,773
We can call other agents
through AgentCore Gateway.

722
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,400
As an example, we call our own MCP server

723
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,750
through the Gateway.

724
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,030
Each of these tools
can have Bedrock models

725
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,620
for their internal tasks,

726
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,520
and they all have access
to short-term memory

727
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,840
and long-term memory.

728
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,690
Short-term memory is usually
for session management.

729
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,960
Long-term memory is usually
for actor management.

730
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,573
You want to keep the
preference of the actor.

731
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,590
And in the next part of this presentation,

732
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,973
a party will go and explain
the architecture in depth.

733
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,090
Now, I want to start concluding my part,

734
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:26,460
and I want to share our
strategic milestone.

735
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,810
And the reason I'm sharing this,

736
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:32,810
I believe this is common
for many of other companies.

737
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,150
It's very important and
when you want to walk

738
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:40,650
into this journey, you first
prove values of your AI agents.

739
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,750
Lay the foundation with core use cases

740
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,060
in each pillar that you have.

741
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,060
Try to have reactive agents
which are the simpler agents.

742
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,600
The next step is then
to automate and amplify,

743
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,470
expand agents to take on
more repetitive complex

744
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,660
and high-volume tasks.

745
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,230
This is the time that you
enter proactive agents

746
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,000
and multi-agent collaboration.

747
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,890
And usually, the long-term goals

748
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,650
for many companies at this point is

749
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,880
to have more or less an autonomous
orchestrated intelligence

750
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,460
to be able to create agents data

751
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,793
and workflows across the entire platform.

752
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,360
During this journey, we
learned a lot of lessons

753
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,170
in collaboration with AWS,

754
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,020
and I want to share some of
these you make a benefit,

755
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,460
some of them are pretty technical,

756
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,480
some of them are more
kind of an administrative,

757
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,930
but it's very important

758
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,930
that you use cross-region
inference if you can.

759
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,300
It helps you to reduce latency,

760
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:53,280
improves resiliency, scales
throughput, optimize cost.

761
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,442
And basically, you are
serving your workload

762
00:40:56,442 --> 00:40:58,413
from multiple regions.

763
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,910
The other challenge that many people have,

764
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,360
is effective prompt
engineering and optimization.

765
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,550
Bedrock has an optimization tool

766
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,500
that you can give your prompt

767
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,900
and the model that you
want to optimize for,

768
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,030
and it optimize the prompt for you,

769
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,160
and you should not underestimate this.

770
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,670
For example, when you are
working with one specific model,

771
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,490
maybe the best is to have XML tags

772
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,890
to structure your prompts.

773
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,510
But when you are using for Nova,

774
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,690
Nova, for example,
prefers markdown language

775
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,370
to structure your prompt.

776
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,880
If you do not optimize your
prompt for this specific model,

777
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,080
then things gets messy when
it comes to this scale.

778
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,930
The next is understanding
regional throughput

779
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,480
and quota variations.

780
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,800
This is super important that
you have an understanding

781
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,940
of your quota ahead of time,
especially if you are scaling.

782
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,290
Don't assume if you submit 200
million requests in a month,

783
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,760
it gets processed.

784
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,220
So you need to understand, for example,

785
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,860
what is your quota for
model inference per minute?

786
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,660
What is your quota per region?

787
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,510
What is your quota for the number of jobs

788
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,680
that you can submit?

789
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,800
And then estimate and
get help from AWS team

790
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,093
to get what you need,

791
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:21,270
not when you are going to
production, way ahead of time.

792
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,920
The next lesson learned for us was

793
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,350
how we can mitigate failed responses

794
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,940
by using different models.

795
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,320
You can have your architecture

796
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,020
to dynamically select the models,

797
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,560
especially, if you're using
one family of model like Nova.

798
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,990
If the response gets failed from Micro,

799
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,825
you can bump to Light,

800
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:40,170
from Light, you can go to Pro.

801
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:43,140
This can be done in real-time
if you have multiple models

802
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,810
or can be done when you
do your prompt engineering

803
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,610
and your analysis.

804
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,370
So you can have multiple
models running at the same time

805
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,660
for different use cases,

806
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,443
or have a real-time
escalation to the next model.

807
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,150
Mitigating model hallucinations

808
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:04,290
and enforcing restrict output formatting.

809
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,370
This is very important.

810
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,420
At the end of the day,

811
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,900
you want to show the
AI output to the user.

812
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,945
So you really need to have
probably adjacent output

813
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:16,800
or some structured format
that your UI, at some point,

814
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,110
can process and show it to the user.

815
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:23,190
There are several techniques
that you can force your agent

816
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:26,190
to come up with a very specific format.

817
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,140
And this is an ongoing
challenge, I believe,

818
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,510
for everyone when I'm
talking to different leaders.

819
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,190
Like, you can find guidelines,

820
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,560
like, in pre-filling, is one technique,

821
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,900
when in the assistant part of the prompt,

822
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,050
you start the beginning of
the output that you expect

823
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,290
and that force the agent
or the generative AI model

824
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,540
to continue on that, right?

825
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,640
There are multiple techniques
that you can learn,

826
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,860
but you should not underestimate this one.

827
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,590
And the last part,

828
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,713
is handling contextual
information in batch processing.

829
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,640
When we have batch processing,

830
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,850
we are dealing with millions
and millions of requests.

831
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,640
By contextual information,
I mean, metadata,

832
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,210
for example, the digest ID
for each of the requests.

833
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:13,440
So if you want to stay
stateless and keep everything

834
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,160
within the call to the agent or LLM

835
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,720
and get the response back,

836
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,930
you need to somehow pass part
of this contextual information

837
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,550
to the agent and get it back,

838
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,740
unless the architecture
that you're using supports

839
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,860
for these kinds of metadata,
which is usually not the case,

840
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,593
at least to this point, to
the best of my knowledge.

841
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,970
What is the challenging part
here is the hallucination.

842
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,130
I give you a very concrete example.

843
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,800
We realized we were using
a very specific hashing

844
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,800
or encoding algorithm
to hash my digest ID.

845
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:50,250
And whenever the agent
gets to the semicolon,

846
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,080
he was thinking, "Oh,
it's end of the line,"

847
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,790
and dropping the rest of the ID.

848
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:56,100
And then we had a lot of hash mismatch.

849
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,530
So you really need to
understand when you are working

850
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,100
at the scale, how you deal with
your contextual information

851
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,800
that you expect the agent
send it back to you.

852
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,160
Now, I want to pass it to
Pradeep for the next part,

853
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,860
and his presentation on AgentCore.

854
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,393
- Hello all.

855
00:45:17,393 --> 00:45:18,226
My name is Pradeep Sridharan.

856
00:45:18,226 --> 00:45:20,380
I'm a senior solutions architect at AWS.

857
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:24,660
At AWS, we have a simple
but ambitious vision,

858
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,250
to provide the best place to build

859
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,103
and scale the most useful AI agents.

860
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,420
Not just a prototype, but
actual production agent,

861
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,880
and not just any agent,
the most useful agent

862
00:45:38,242 --> 00:45:40,110
that delivers actual business value.

863
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:45,110
This is what drove our work
that we did with Siteimprove,

864
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,950
and this is what is driving everything

865
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,960
that I'm about to show you today.

866
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,310
But before we go there,

867
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,773
let level set on what an agent is.

868
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,291
In a nutshell, an AI agent is a system

869
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:03,030
where an LLM receives goals,

870
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,300
maintains context, creates and uses tools,

871
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,680
learn from observations, right?

872
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,773
It's what you call as a continuous loop,

873
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:16,020
observe recent learn, and act.

874
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,242
It's very simple in concept,

875
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:21,150
but when executed well,
can be very, very powerful.

876
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,480
But executing this well is
not without its challenges,

877
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,443
and here is why.

878
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:29,940
Because agentic AI systems
are autonomous in nature,

879
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,050
even implementing a
simple agentic AI system,

880
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,630
takes a lot of moving parts, right?

881
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,670
You need to have a way
to do orchestration,

882
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,830
you need to have a way
to do tool execution,

883
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,310
and you need to have a way
to manage state, right?

884
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:47,280
Luckily, we do have frameworks today

885
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,400
that helps with a lot of
this uplifting, right?

886
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,910
We have Strands Agents
from Amazon, LangChain,

887
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,290
LangGraph, CrewAI, and so on and so forth.

888
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:58,110
But this open source
framework makes it easy

889
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,620
because they provide developed abstraction

890
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,420
for some of the pre-built codes.

891
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,720
But still, many organizations struggle

892
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,720
with getting from this state
to actual production system.

893
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,160
In fact, we have name for this.

894
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,803
We call this the
prototype-to-production chasm.

895
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:19,830
You can see on the left,

896
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,620
you have a POC that is working, right?

897
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,020
You have excitement and potential,

898
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,510
but you want eventually get to where

899
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,150
that very POC is running in production,

900
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,923
delivering actual business value.

901
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,090
But still, this is not
without complexities, right?

902
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,040
You have to manage memory systems,

903
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,270
because LLMs are stateless.

904
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:41,070
You have to manage security,

905
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:42,360
you have to manage governance,

906
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,360
and all of this needs to scale
as your enterprise scales.

907
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,227
Gartner predicts that,

908
00:47:50,227 --> 00:47:54,600
"40% of enterprise agentic
AI projects will be canceled

909
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,600
by 2027 due to soaring cost,
unclear business value,

910
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,400
and security concerns."

911
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,327
This is the reason why we
built Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

912
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,950
Bedrock AgentCore is our answer

913
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:13,293
to the production chasm problem, right?

914
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,390
It's a fully managed service

915
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:16,680
that handles everything you need

916
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,140
for running production agents.

917
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,970
You get all the leading models

918
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,070
that's available on Amazon Bedrock.

919
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:26,010
You also get access to orchestrators,

920
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:29,083
open source orchestrator,
just talk about LangGraph,

921
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:30,930
LangChain, so on and so forth.

922
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,787
But what makes AgentCore,

923
00:48:33,655 --> 00:48:35,430
a real production-grade application is

924
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:39,450
what you really see under
the way we line, right?

925
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,940
You have secure runtime management,

926
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,910
memory systems that manages
both short-term memory

927
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,320
and long-term memory.

928
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,153
As Hamed mentioned,

929
00:48:47,153 --> 00:48:49,793
short-term memory is primarily
for session management,

930
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,060
long-term is for active management.

931
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,670
Secure authentication and token storage,

932
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,890
secure tool communication,

933
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,390
and out-of-the-box observability,

934
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:00,030
so that you can understand
what your agents are doing.

935
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,730
So this is not just about
running one single agent,

936
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:06,240
but this is about running
a production-grade agent

937
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,580
that can scale to millions of users,

938
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,500
recover gracefully from failures,

939
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,300
and adopt to your needs as you grow.

940
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,930
I'm gonna pull back a little bit

941
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:18,750
and show how this services work together,

942
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,930
and this particular slide can
be a little bit technical,

943
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,100
be in the reads.

944
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,960
And I know this is a silent session,

945
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,400
so if you guys have any questions,

946
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,260
I'm happy to answer some
of the questions outside,

947
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,510
once the session is done.

948
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,330
But I wanna highlight
a few major components

949
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:34,920
of the AgentCore, right?

950
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,533
You have the Agent Runtime, Agent Gateway,

951
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:43,620
Agent Memory, Agent Identity,
and Agent Observability.

952
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:47,706
Agent Runtime is a secure
server-like runtime,

953
00:49:47,706 --> 00:49:50,430
purpose-built for
deploying dynamic agents.

954
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,350
It's a remarkable runtime.

955
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:54,390
It supports multi-model agents,

956
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:58,170
scales from zero to thousands

957
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,723
of concurrent users in seconds.

958
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,630
And it also provides
complete dev isolation,

959
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:07,080
meaning, it has isolated
compute environments.

960
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,973
So data leaks are not a problem.

961
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,640
AgentCore Gateway converts
your existing APIs,

962
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,310
lambda functions and MCP servers

963
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,080
into tools that agents can use.

964
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,270
It provides a unified interface,

965
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:24,303
and has pre-built IAA authentication.

966
00:50:27,987 --> 00:50:30,213
AgentCore Memory provides you a namespace,

967
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,800
encrypted namespace-based storage

968
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,890
that supports both long-term
and short-term memory,

969
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:39,450
and it's also quite powerful.

970
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:42,060
It supports multiple
extraction methodologies,

971
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,393
like semantic search and
namespace-based extraction.

972
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,930
AgentCore Identity solves enterprise

973
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:50,820
authentication challenges, right?

974
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,190
It provides a secure delegated
access control mechanism

975
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:57,600
for your agents, for third-party
applications like GitHub,

976
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,600
Salesforce, so on and so forth.

977
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,820
It also reduces development time,

978
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,110
because you can reuse
existing identity providers,

979
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:10,440
like Microsoft Entra ID, Okta Kognito.

980
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,460
It also uses a secure vault storage

981
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,620
that reduces content
authentication fatigue,

982
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:21,620
and provides a frictionless
user experience, right?

983
00:51:22,811 --> 00:51:25,228
Now, AgentCore Observability,

984
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,620
is a comprehensive end-to-end
solution for observability.

985
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:32,730
You can use it to understand
your agent action,

986
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:36,780
look at reasoning and
input or output locks.

987
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,512
You can also build pre-built dashboard.

988
00:51:39,512 --> 00:51:40,740
You can use pre-built dashboards.

989
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:45,360
And because AgentCore
Observability is hotel compatible,

990
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,076
it integrates with the number

991
00:51:47,076 --> 00:51:50,223
of hotel compatible
application monitoring tools.

992
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,820
But AgentCore is just part of
our larger portfolio, right?

993
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,070
Amazon provides everything you need

994
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:02,670
to build and scale your agents.

995
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:04,170
I'm gonna start from the top.

996
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:06,450
At the top, we have applications,

997
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,190
you have Amazon Quick Suite.

998
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:11,190
This is our purpose-built
business application

999
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:12,900
for enterprises.

1000
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,343
Kiro, our newly launched ID
for software development.

1001
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,750
AWS Transform is again an agent tool

1002
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:24,633
that is used for modernizing
legacy workloads.

1003
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,790
Amazon Connect with the
agents for customer support,

1004
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:34,790
and we also provide through
our AWS marketplace,

1005
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,140
a number of agents and
agent applications provided

1006
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,463
by your trusted partners.

1007
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,450
In the middle, you see
our development platform,

1008
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,610
you have Amazon Bedrock.

1009
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:48,600
Now, Bedrock provides access
to a number of leading models

1010
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,080
from providers like
Anthropic, Meta, Mistral,

1011
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,540
and we have our own models, Amazon Nova,

1012
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,210
which are essentially models designed

1013
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,180
with agentic AI architecture in mind.

1014
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,108
We also offer Nova Act,
which is essentially a model

1015
00:53:03,108 --> 00:53:05,033
that can take action
within a browser context.

1016
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,670
We also provide AgentCore,
just talked about it.

1017
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:09,720
It's essentially the best way

1018
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,260
to run and scale your
agents in production.

1019
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,540
We offer Strands Agents,

1020
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,880
which is the open source Python-based STK

1021
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,630
for developing your agents as well.

1022
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,473
From an infrastructure front,

1023
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,660
Amazon provide
infrastructure that can scale

1024
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,313
from prototype to production.

1025
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,490
The primary infrastructure is offered

1026
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,903
to Amazon SageMaker AI,

1027
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,816
and we have our own chips as
well, Trainium and Inferentia.

1028
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:39,649
And now apart from this,

1029
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:43,410
we also support open standards
like Model Context Protocol

1030
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:47,523
by Anthropic and A2A,
Agent2Agent by Google.

1031
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,510
Now, all of those could
be a little bit complex,

1032
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:58,140
so I'm gonna leave you with
a simplified version of it.

1033
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,423
There are really five
key takeaways, right?

1034
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,670
We have pre-built agents,

1035
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:04,980
so that you don't have
to start from scratch.

1036
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,240
We have tools like code
interpreter and browser.

1037
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:14,240
We have models like Anthropic
and Meta models that we offer.

1038
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,290
We have infrastructure,

1039
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,343
to scale from prototype to production.

1040
00:54:21,668 --> 00:54:23,100
And we also provide expertise,

1041
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,070
which is essentially AWS
folks like me working

1042
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:29,220
in context with your team to
achieve your business goals,

1043
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,513
which brings me to the next slide,

1044
00:54:31,513 --> 00:54:33,083
which is essentially how we
are gonna engage with you.

1045
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,140
Now, at AWS,

1046
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,870
we don't just provide technology,

1047
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,963
we also provide you a
complete support ecosystem.

1048
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:46,470
Our one team model puts customer, you,

1049
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:47,470
at the center of it.

1050
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,060
We have full distinct teams.

1051
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,190
We typically start with AWS account team.

1052
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,570
So this is a team that actually works

1053
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:55,740
with you day in and day out,

1054
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,170
understanding your
business goals and vision.

1055
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:02,323
I am actually the account
team expert for Siteimprove.

1056
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,000
And account team typically
advocates for you

1057
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,197
within the larger AWS ecosystem
to get you more access.

1058
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,010
Then we have the GenAI Innovation Center.

1059
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:18,780
So this is a team that provides
deep ML and AI expertise.

1060
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,450
This is a team that actually
worked with Siteimprove

1061
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:25,140
to help with some of the
batch processing challenges

1062
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,493
and prompt optimization.

1063
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:30,360
Then we have product teams
where we give customers access

1064
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:34,680
to engineers working on Bedrock, Nova,

1065
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,570
and AgentCore platforms.

1066
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:38,970
This is so that you'll have
early access to features

1067
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:42,390
as well as provide
roadmap influence, right?

1068
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:45,390
And build and support your endeavors

1069
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,700
and provide technical
account management as well.

1070
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,403
And we engage with customers
in a variety of ways.

1071
00:55:51,403 --> 00:55:53,040
I have highlighted four here;

1072
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,040
office hours, which typically
means recurrent calls

1073
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,200
that we handle,

1074
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,050
quick technical discussion,
deep engagements.

1075
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:04,920
These are engagements like what
GenAIs did with Siteimprove

1076
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,020
to kind of accelerate.

1077
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,120
Experience-based acceleration,

1078
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,830
this is another interesting mechanism

1079
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:13,950
by which we work with the customer

1080
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,350
on over-the-shoulder basis,

1081
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,210
particularly, when they're
beginning something

1082
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,520
to accelerate outcome for them.

1083
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,600
And technical enablement
is when we provide training

1084
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,320
and certification for you
and your teams, right?

1085
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,620
So if you're ready to
start with your journey,

1086
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:35,133
I'll leave you with a
framework to begin with.

1087
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:43,040
So for any agentic AI innovation,

1088
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:45,420
you have to start with business
outcomes in mind, right?

1089
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,550
Like, define first your use cases,

1090
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:48,750
and start from there.

1091
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,490
The reason why Siteimprove
was so successful,

1092
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,260
because they picked up accessibility,

1093
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,950
which was essentially making
the most sense for them, right?

1094
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,320
Once you have your use case defined,

1095
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,430
then you can pick your models
and agentic AI framework.

1096
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,590
And remember, with Bedrock,

1097
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:05,910
you are not locked in.

1098
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:08,280
You can change your mind anytime.

1099
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,290
And once you have that information,

1100
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:13,020
you can then have to
consider security compliance

1101
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,363
and responsible AI upfront.

1102
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:17,960
It's not an afterthought.

1103
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,110
So once you have this,
create a proof of value,

1104
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,510
not just a proof of concept.

1105
00:57:24,986 --> 00:57:28,530
And from there, you can
go in to development,

1106
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:29,760
deploy and scale.

1107
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,810
And remember, this is my agentic process,

1108
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,270
you can learn and accelerate.

1109
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,430
I'll leave you with four key takeaways.

1110
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,110
Prioritize AI investment by
starting with business outcome.

1111
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,330
We don't have to change every trend.

1112
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,163
Like I said,

1113
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:49,350
starting to focus on
accessibility and compliance.

1114
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:52,203
Agentic AI transform
business beyond technology.

1115
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,020
Yes, there are early challenges,

1116
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,123
but the growth potential is enormous.

1117
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:00,300
Third, bridge the
prototype-to-production chasm

1118
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,310
through systematic value delivery.

1119
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:06,960
Use tools like AgentCore when
possible to achieve this.

1120
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,300
And fourth, build for enterprise success

1121
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,700
with AWS #OneTeam collaboration.

1122
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,653
You don't have to do this alone.

1123
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,590
With that, thank you very much.

1124
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,037
We are excited to help you build,

1125
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:20,280
and scale the most useful AI agents.

1126
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,657
Thank you.

1127
00:58:21,657 --> 00:58:24,824
(audience applauding)
