1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,233
- [Matt] Thank you, everyone,
and welcome to STG419.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,293
Quick show of hands,

3
00:00:06,293 --> 00:00:09,120
who here has been to a code talk before?

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,650
Anyone?

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,700
All right.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,520
Who came to this session specifically

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,370
because you saw that we
were going to show code

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,930
instead of just PowerPoint slides?

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,860
Anyone?

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,030
All right, that's good.

11
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,650
Who came because it's after lunch

12
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,893
and they're looking for
a place to take a nap?

13
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,873
All right.

14
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:28,830
Yeah, we'll try to keep
it down for you, sir.

15
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,890
My name's Matt Boyd and
with me is my colleague,

16
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,757
Prabir Sekhri.

17
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,490
And we are Solutions Architects with AWS.

18
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,950
And today, we're going to be exploring

19
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,970
how to modernize your
managed file transfers,

20
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,350
and automate your file
transfer and file processing.

21
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,480
And so with that,

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,220
let me quickly walk
you through the journey

23
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,110
that we're gonna be taking you on today.

24
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,730
We're going to start by talking

25
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,980
about managed file
transfers, what they are,

26
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,980
why they matter, and some
of the building blocks

27
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,770
that we'll be using for our
modern file transfer service

28
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,600
that we'll be building today.

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,510
Then we're gonna do a quick
overview of Transfer Family

30
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,430
and its features.

31
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,380
And then we're gonna
dive into our use case

32
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,630
and a target architecture,

33
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,540
followed by a quick
sprinkling of Agentic AI

34
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,450
since we'll be using that
as part of our solution.

35
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,950
And then we're gonna get into the code.

36
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,230
So, we will be doing hands-on coding

37
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,660
and deployment in real time.

38
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,160
And we'll hope that nothing
breaks while we do it.

39
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,140
All right, so let's get started.

40
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,080
What is managed file transfer?

41
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,060
Simply put, it is the exchange

42
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,210
and processing of files securely often

43
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,330
between two known business
partners or business entities,

44
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,100
but it can also be between internal

45
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,230
or external systems in general.

46
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,580
And believe it or not, managed
file transfer is critical

47
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,500
to almost every industry
and vertical in finance.

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,850
It is used for clearing house
settlements, for example.

49
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,910
In logistics, it's used
for supply chain tracking.

50
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,770
And in any analytics use case,

51
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,020
you usually have to
ingest files and content

52
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,830
and that is also typically done
using managed file transfer

53
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,270
at some capacity.

54
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,610
And so, for most organizations,

55
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,980
managed file transfer is not just

56
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,840
the process of transferring files

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,460
but it's core to their business functions

58
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,963
and their business processes.

59
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,467
And so with that,

60
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:30,840
what many organizations
need to do is they need

61
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,990
to modernize their managed
file transfer systems

62
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,940
and move away from legacy tooling

63
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,590
and operational overhead.

64
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,090
And so, today we're gonna be showing you

65
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,330
how to build a modern MFT system.

66
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,860
And these are just some
of the building blocks

67
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,840
that we're going to be using today.

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,360
First, we're gonna be
using AWS Transfer Family,

69
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,180
fully managed service for file transfers,

70
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,430
and I'll talk about that in a moment here.

71
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,200
We're also gonna implement
some malware scanning

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,880
because most organizations need to do that

73
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,080
when they receive malware
from an organization outside.

74
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,120
And so, we'll use
GuardDuty malware scanning

75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,293
for S3 for that.

76
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,130
Now, for the Agentic
workflow or for our workflow,

77
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,320
after we receive that file to process it,

78
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,870
we're gonna remove human manual labor

79
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,786
and we're going to use an Agentic workflow

80
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:18,030
for that processing of
the files that we receive.

81
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,140
And then pulling it all together,

82
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,450
we're going to use infrastructure as code

83
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,940
and Terraform for our deployment,

84
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,070
and automated deployment processes,

85
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,290
and we'll use an event-driven architecture

86
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,643
with Amazon EventBridge.

87
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,430
So, briefly, I wanna cover
the key components of

88
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,680
the AWS Transfer Family.

89
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,390
There's actually three main services

90
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,300
or features within the
Transfer Family portfolio.

91
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,430
The first one is file transfer servers.

92
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,310
And these are fully managed
file transfer servers

93
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,070
that you can deploy very quickly

94
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,290
and they scale automatically.

95
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,210
They're backed by S3 storage

96
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,290
and they support the most
industry standard protocols.

97
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,807
SFTP, FTPS and AS2.

98
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,390
Now if you need to send
files to a remote SFTP server

99
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,280
or maybe you need to download
from a remote SFTP server,

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,030
Transfer Family offers SFTP connectors.

101
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,770
And SFTP connectors are
essentially a fully managed

102
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:24,480
SFTP client that you can use via an API.

103
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,390
So, no infrastructure to
maintain, to download,

104
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,053
or send files via SFTP to remote servers.

105
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,920
And then finally, if you
have use cases where you need

106
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,340
to provide web-based
access to file stored in S3

107
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,590
and you need to do it
securely with authentication

108
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,620
for human users and in a
user-friendly interface,

109
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,810
we have Transfer Family web apps.

110
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,380
This is a fully managed web
app that integrates with S3

111
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,280
and we'll be showing that

112
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,440
as part of the solution today as well.

113
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,240
One other call out here is that

114
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,680
with modern file transfers,

115
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,780
you often wanna adopt an
event driven architecture

116
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,780
and Transfer Family integrates
with Amazon EventBridge.

117
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,040
So, for example,

118
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,760
you can automatically trigger
downstream file processing

119
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,960
when you receive a file.

120
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,250
All right, so with that, I'm
gonna pass it over to Prabir

121
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,260
and he's gonna talk about the use case

122
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,210
that we're going to be building for today.

123
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,550
And he'll show you the current state

124
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,340
and then what we're going
to be building toward.

125
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,690
- [Prabir] Thank you, Matt.

126
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,060
All right, so for today's use case,

127
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,710
we'll be looking at modernizing

128
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,623
a traditional insurance
claims processing system.

129
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,190
I just wanna know like
with a quick show of hands,

130
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,300
how many of you are in like

131
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,823
the insurance financial services domain?

132
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,850
Okay, quite a few.

133
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,683
Nice.

134
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:40,650
And what about some other domains?

135
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,670
Maybe you can shout it out like

136
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,165
what industries are you from?

137
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:44,462
- [Audience Member] Healthcare.

138
00:05:44,462 --> 00:05:45,750
- [Prabir] Healthcares.

139
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,583
- [Audience Member] Hospitality.

140
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,416
- [Prabir] Hospitality.

141
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,330
Perfect.

142
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,400
So the use case I'm showing you today

143
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,050
actually can be applied

144
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,930
or can be seen also in
other industries as well.

145
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,763
It's very straight in

146
00:05:55,763 --> 00:05:58,530
and the way traditional
claims processing works is,

147
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,380
typically, it has three
different phases, right?

148
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,174
So, typically, we start
with the ingest phase,

149
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:06,637
which this is where you will have

150
00:06:06,637 --> 00:06:09,870
most companies ingest files using SFTP.

151
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,720
In our insurance use case,
these could be files such

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,683
as policy documents, could be
images, and repair estimates.

153
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,070
We often have an extraction phase.

154
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,840
So this is where most
organizations do have

155
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,390
some kind of an OCR or basic OCR.

156
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,160
And for those who don't know OCR,

157
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,170
it's basically a technique that's used

158
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,213
to extract text from images.

159
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,380
And the challenge of basic OCR
is that it is somewhat rigid,

160
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,413
and it only expects files,
and formats in a certain way.

161
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,860
And finally in our analysis phase,

162
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,050
this is where you may have
some kind of manual processing,

163
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,870
you may have some intelligence
with rules-based engines,

164
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,680
but most of the times,
it is manually processed.

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,210
And the challenge with
all this approach is

166
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,580
that not only this is error prone,

167
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,930
it is time consuming and
it just doesn't scale.

168
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,280
Now we're gonna show you
how we'll transform this,

169
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,083
using cloud native architecture.

170
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,710
Now here's a modern
approach for this use case

171
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,110
which demonstrates all the
principles that Matt spoke about.

172
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,650
We'll be using secure file
transfer with Transfer Family,

173
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,140
we'll be setting up malware
scanning using GuardDuty,

174
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,020
and we will be leveraging
agents, AI agents,

175
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,523
to do the manual processing.

176
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,510
Now, all of this architecture
is gonna be orchestrated,

177
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,206
using EventBridge.

178
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:25,290
And yeah, without further ado,

179
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,670
I'm gonna dive deep into each layer.

180
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,463
I'm gonna talk about it a little bit more.

181
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:31,740
Now our stage one is

182
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,200
where we are building a secure foundation.

183
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,130
We're gonna be starting

184
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,910
with replacing our legacy SFTP
servers with Transfer Family,

185
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,560
which means that there's no
infrastructure to manage.

186
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,723
It offers automatic scaling
and high durability.

187
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,830
Now we want to authenticate
external users, right?

188
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,570
These could be, especially
for our use case,

189
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,170
external partners, repair shops,

190
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,520
and we wanna do it in a secure way

191
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,780
without managing identity.

192
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,520
So this is where we're gonna be leveraging

193
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,060
our Transfer Family's custom
identity provider toolkit.

194
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,070
And Matt's gonna do a demo
on that in a little bit

195
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,420
and just in a while.

196
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,560
But by using that,

197
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,240
you don't have to manage
separate credentials,

198
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,790
you can integrate with your
partners and then key provider.

199
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,823
It could be anywhere from
Okta, from Ping, from Entra.

200
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,940
And you wanna store
everything in Amazon S3

201
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,883
for its unlimited scalability
and high durability.

202
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,620
Now moving on to our next stage,

203
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,263
we want to add automatic
malware protection.

204
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,673
GuardDuty will scan
every file as it arrives.

205
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,970
It offers immediate threat detection

206
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,203
and intelligent routing.

207
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,180
What I mean by that is

208
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,740
that you'll have all your clean files

209
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,200
that are gonna be automatically
moved to a clean bucket,

210
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,060
and any malicious file

211
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,590
or a suspicious file will move

212
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,480
to a quarantine bucket automatically.

213
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,303
All done through event-driven approach.

214
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,480
And moving on,

215
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,700
this is where we're seeing
a major transformation

216
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,010
in how organizations are processing files

217
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,290
or modernizing, I would
say, file transfers.

218
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,150
This is where we're
gonna be using AI agents

219
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,583
to replace somewhat of
the manual processing.

220
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,190
We're gonna be using
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore,

221
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,553
that's gonna be our
orchestrator for all our agents.

222
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,470
And the agents themselves,

223
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,690
they can use the most sophisticated models

224
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,040
that are available not only in Bedrock

225
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,040
but also from other cloud
providers or other partners.

226
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,530
So, you know, providers such as Anthropic,

227
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,483
even our own Amazon Nova models.

228
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,110
And these, in general,
provide a lot more flexibility

229
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,023
and higher accuracy than traditional OCR.

230
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,090
Now with just this approach
alone, we've now automated

231
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,140
what used to takes maybe a
team of people hours to days,

232
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,490
and that's something can be done

233
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,833
in just a couple of seconds or minutes.

234
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,723
Now let's make all of this
accessible to our human users.

235
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,510
Now this is where we're
gonna be leveraging

236
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,633
Transfer Family's web
UI or web apps service.

237
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,450
This is especially for your end users

238
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,200
because you don't have to
know SFTP commands, right?

239
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
It's offered a simple
browser-based access.

240
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,010
It is completely self-served
and has security built-ins,

241
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,680
which means that you can have
rules based access, right?

242
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,170
People have access to the right files

243
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,820
and at the right time.

244
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,720
Built on the principles of zero trust.

245
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,433
Now we're gonna be deploying
all of this using Terraform,

246
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,360
the Transfer Family service team.

247
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,280
And, in fact, it's endorsed
by our solution architects

248
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,830
'cause we build this, we
support an official module

249
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,110
that is available in
the Terraform registry.

250
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,270
By the way, anybody using
these Terraform modules

251
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,293
from Transit Family?

252
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,263
You are?

253
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,920
Oh, great, awesome.

254
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,950
Anybody using Terraform
in general to automate?

255
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,630
Perfect, beautiful, great, awesome.

256
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,720
So, you're gonna really enjoy
what we have for you today.

257
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,780
And for those who are not
using our modules, this is,

258
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,680
you know, I strongly encourage
you to use our modules.

259
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,950
That's perfect.

260
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,410
Using modules basically allows you

261
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,780
to improve standardization.

262
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,580
You can deploy all of your infrastructure

263
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,930
across your environments
in a standardized way.

264
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,880
And you widely wanna track
everything in Git, right?

265
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,633
For tracking of changes
for rollbacks and auditing.

266
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,910
And lastly, we recommend

267
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,510
that you deploy everything
using the CI/CD pipeline.

268
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,040
All right, now it's time to build.

269
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,640
Now we're gonna go start
getting into the code

270
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,260
and if you wanna see the
actual code yourself,

271
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,236
please grab the QR code.

272
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:29,220
It will take you to the GitHub repository

273
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,050
that we have for you and also the branch,

274
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,603
specific branch that we're
gonna be working off of.

275
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,750
We'll share the QR code again in the end.

276
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,080
So for those who have missed
it, that's perfectly okay.

277
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,120
We're gonna be showing this
a couple of times actually.

278
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,680
Yep, all right.

279
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,300
I'll just give everybody maybe 10 seconds.

280
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,550
I see some people are
still trying to record.

281
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,380
All right.

282
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,230
So I think, Matt, you have
some stuff to show them, right?

283
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,063
- [Matt] I do.

284
00:11:59,063 --> 00:11:59,896
Yeah.
- Yeah.

285
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:02,010
Why don't you take it away?
- So, before we get into

286
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,723
the first part of the code here,

287
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,180
I'm gonna show you what
we're gonna be building

288
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,010
and you may have caught it.

289
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,160
Prabir was showing the various stages of

290
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,470
our architecture stage one through four.

291
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,940
And that's actually how
we're gonna be building

292
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,820
out our architecture
today into various stages.

293
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,430
So, the first stage is

294
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,550
to create our AWS Transfer Family server.

295
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,340
And so, we'll be using the
Terraform modules for that,

296
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,250
but we also need to
incorporate authentication.

297
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,860
And so, that is where
we're going to be deploying

298
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,550
the Transfer Family custom
identity provider solution.

299
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,830
And I'll talk a little bit more on that

300
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,720
when we get into the code itself.

301
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,810
But it's essentially a
solution that is endorsed

302
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,370
by the Transfer Family service team

303
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,910
for integrating the most
popular identity providers.

304
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,100
And we have a prebuilt
Terraform module for this

305
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,870
as well that I will show you.

306
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,110
So, with that, I'm gonna go
ahead and get into the code

307
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,160
and, Prabir, if you could switch me over.

308
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,393
- [Prabir] There you go.

309
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:02,490
- [Matt] And we are now
in the terminal here.

310
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,530
And so, very briefly and again,

311
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,780
you'll be able to see
this if you go to the code

312
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,170
in GitHub after the the session.

313
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,280
We've structured our Terraform
into various stages here

314
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,320
and we have a couple of additional modules

315
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,770
that we put into this solution.

316
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,603
And so, first,

317
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:23,430
the first stage is our Transfer
Family server stage here.

318
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,160
We did also deploy a
couple of prerequisites.

319
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,710
IAM Identity Center, Cognito User Pool,

320
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,670
that's in stage zero,

321
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,830
but we've already deployed that.

322
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,230
So, before I go into the code,

323
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,880
I'm gonna go ahead and
start the deployment

324
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,730
and we have several
scripts that just help us

325
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,683
with getting the deployment going.

326
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,653
And we will do stage1-deploy.sh.

327
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,640
And this is just quickly showing

328
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,930
what we're actually deploying here.

329
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,370
So we have Terraform apply

330
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,650
and then we're using a variables file

331
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,410
and I'll show you that
variables file briefly here.

332
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,220
We've actually broken up the
solution into different stages

333
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,740
with feature flags in our Terraform.

334
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,335
And that's really how we're
controlling what we deploy

335
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:08,520
and when throughout this.

336
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,410
Obviously, in most environments,

337
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,760
you would not need to stage like this,

338
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,730
but we're doing it for the
purpose of the code talk.

339
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,450
Let's kick off the deployment
and while that builds,

340
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:23,450
I will jump over to stage
one, our transfer server.

341
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,190
So, a couple key call outs here.

342
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,260
The first thing that we
are actually building,

343
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,293
and I'm gonna bring this
down to give us some space,

344
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,160
is our custom identity provider solution.

345
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,853
And so, for that, we're
using the Terraform

346
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:42,030
for AWS Transfer Family Custom IDP module,

347
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,960
that is already available
in the GitHub repository.

348
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,490
So, this really simplifies

349
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,060
the deployment of the
custom IDP solution itself,

350
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,280
which consists of a Lambda function

351
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,720
with authentication logic

352
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,120
and modules for various
identity providers.

353
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,033
And then DynamoDB tables that
are used for configuration.

354
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,948
And then, for some identity providers,

355
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:06,360
they can't be reached
over public internet,

356
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,570
and you may need to attach them to a VPC.

357
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,970
And so, in order to do that,

358
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,138
you can modify this used VPC parameter,

359
00:15:15,138 --> 00:15:19,173
set that to true, and you
can specify the subnets,

360
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,810
and the security groups that you need

361
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,510
to attach the Lambda function to,

362
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,330
so that it can communicate
with your identity provider.

363
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,070
There's several other optional features.

364
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,230
For example, you can put an API gateway,

365
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,600
API in front of the Lambda function.

366
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,400
If, for example, you want to attach

367
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,850
a web application firewall
for additional security,

368
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,880
but this is really all
you need out of the box

369
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,723
for this custom IDP solution
to be deployed with Terraform.

370
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,420
Now the second thing we need to do

371
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,150
once we've deployed the
custom IDP solution is we need

372
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,220
to create our Transfer Family server.

373
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,053
And again,

374
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:57,750
we're going to use the Transfer
Family Terraform module

375
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,010
for that.

376
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:03,180
And in order to configure
the Transfer Family server,

377
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,250
we have a couple of parameters here.

378
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,110
The first one is our domain.

379
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,830
So we'll configure either
S3 or EFS for the storage.

380
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,830
In this case, we're going to be using S3

381
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,700
and then we have options
for the endpoint type

382
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,870
and the protocol.

383
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,390
So we're going to set
this to a public endpoint,

384
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,120
but you could also attach this to a VPC.

385
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,780
For example, if you wanted
to run a private SFTP server.

386
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,010
And then for a protocol,

387
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,143
we're going to be using SFTP protocol.

388
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,833
Now for configuring authentication itself,

389
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,980
we need to change the
identity provider parameter

390
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,280
to AWS Lambda instead of service managed.

391
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,740
And then we need to specify the ARN

392
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,699
of our custom IDP Lambda,

393
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:48,930
which is one of the
outputs from the module.

394
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,000
And so, that's what we've done here.

395
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,210
And you can see now, this
will wire up authentication

396
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,490
to forward all authentication requests

397
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,930
to our Lambda function.

398
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,610
- [Prabir] Hey, Matt,
before you go further,

399
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,600
so this is cool,

400
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,540
but I wanna understand like
how do you manage users

401
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,540
and how do you map them to
these identity providers?

402
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,460
- [Matt] Yeah, that's a
great question, Prabir.

403
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,440
And actually, all of this is done

404
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,380
via configuration in DynamoDB tables.

405
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,480
And so, there's a couple of ways for you

406
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,720
to configure those DynamoDB records.

407
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,920
Terraform is one option,

408
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,800
but you could do that,
do it externally as well.

409
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,630
And the solution has really two tables.

410
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,020
One is for the identity
provider configuration

411
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,140
and that's what this
DynamoDB table item record

412
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,330
in Terraform represents.

413
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,250
We give our provider a name.

414
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,480
In this case, it's Cognito Pool

415
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,070
because our repair shops are going

416
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,120
to authenticate via an
existing Cognito User Pool.

417
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,280
And then we specify the configuration.

418
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,530
And in the Cognito configuration,

419
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:50,430
we need to specify an app
client ID for our user pool

420
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,930
and then the region that
the user pool resides in.

421
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,440
Then when it comes to the user,

422
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,770
we can create records
for each individual user.

423
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,830
And in this record, we have our user,

424
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,760
in this case, it's actually
the any company repairs user,

425
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,470
but we're using a variable
to specify the username.

426
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,280
And then you link your users
to the identity provider

427
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,860
that you've created in your
identity provider's table.

428
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,353
So, in this case, the
Cognito Pool Provider.

429
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,550
From there, you specify what access

430
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,080
and entitlements are going to give

431
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,640
for that Transfer Family session.

432
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,710
So, Transfer Family supports

433
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,630
this concept of logical directories

434
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,100
or virtual directories

435
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,250
where you can map any
path on the SFTP server

436
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,700
to an S3 bucket or an EFS volume.

437
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,240
In this case, I'm mapping
the root folder to a bucket

438
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,660
that we have provisioned where our claims

439
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,243
that we're uploading are
going to land initially.

440
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,170
So, our deployment looks
like it is complete

441
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,480
and I've got some output here.

442
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,420
We can see our Transfer
Family server endpoint

443
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,160
and I have a test script just to make sure

444
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,900
that everything is
functioning as expected.

445
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,970
So we're gonna go ahead and
test out this code quick

446
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,023
that we've deployed.

447
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,883
And we'll do stage1-test.sh.

448
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,230
So what we're gonna do quickly
is retrieve credentials

449
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,940
that we stored in Secrets Manager

450
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,650
and we're gonna use those to authenticate

451
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,600
to the Transfer Family session.

452
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,850
And you can see, our SFTP session is going

453
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,340
to use any company dash
repairs as the user.

454
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,413
So let's go ahead and kick that off.

455
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,443
Say yes to the fingerprint.

456
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,030
And I'll enter my password.

457
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,880
Now when I enter my
password, if it's successful,

458
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,100
we'll immediately upload
one of our claims files,

459
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,990
just as a test.

460
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,270
And it looks like we were able to upload

461
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,380
that file successfully.

462
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,730
So that's a good sign.

463
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,563
The last thing we're gonna do,

464
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,760
just to make sure everything
is working as expected,

465
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,850
is verify that that file
is indeed in the S3 bucket

466
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,100
where we expect it to be.

467
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:02,150
And simple S3 LS, we can
see claim-1.zip was uploaded

468
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,900
and we are all set.

469
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,430
So, in this stage,

470
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,860
we just quickly built a
Transfer Family server,

471
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,320
we integrated the custom IDP solution,

472
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,320
and we integrated our Cognito
users for authentication.

473
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,560
And so with that, Prabir,
I think our next step is

474
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,230
to implement some malware scanning.

475
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,063
Is that right?

476
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:24,187
- [Prabir] Yeah, that's right.

477
00:20:24,187 --> 00:20:25,050
Quiz time.

478
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,700
Do you remember which service we intended

479
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,980
to use for malware protection?

480
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,813
GuardDuty.

481
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,110
There you go, somebody's paying attention.

482
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,130
Perfect.

483
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,600
So, for anybody using GuardDuty

484
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,950
for malware scanning today?

485
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,400
All right, I see a few people over there.

486
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,830
So if you're using GuardDuty
for malware scanning,

487
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,720
so the way the GuardDuty works is that,

488
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,560
it scans every object that
lands into a protected S3 bucket

489
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,250
and the way it does it
that it adds an object tag

490
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,960
based on the scan results.

491
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,300
So, if it's a clean object,
it'll add a clean tag.

492
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,500
If it's a malicious object,

493
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,343
it will add, no threats found tag.

494
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,410
And what we've done with this is that,

495
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,970
we've expanded this architecture

496
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,130
to leverage event-driven approach.

497
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,600
So, we have EventBridge

498
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,640
that is listening to GuardDuty events.

499
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,460
And the scan results are
being passed on EventBridge

500
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,963
to an SQS Queue.

501
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,620
Now we've added SQS Queue
just as a matter of decoupling

502
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,070
in best practice so that we
can scale and offer resiliency,

503
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,440
but also like if our downstream
processing is unavailable,

504
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,740
we can always replay
these messages using SQS.

505
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,177
Now, SQS further triggers
our Lambda function.

506
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:32,250
So our Lambda function is
basically reading off all

507
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,913
the events in our SQS
Queue and processing them.

508
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,250
Lambda over here is kind of the brain

509
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,130
or the logic that decides
based on the scan results,

510
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,263
which files to be routed to which bucket.

511
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,070
So, once again, clean files
will go to a clean bucket,

512
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,040
malicious file will go
to a quarantine bucket,

513
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,920
and any object that is not
treated or is not processed,

514
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,783
will go to our error bucket.

515
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,410
Optionally, in this module,

516
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,050
we've also added a
dead-letter queue in SQS.

517
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,660
So, any messages in the
queue that are not processed,

518
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,160
we want to actually store them too

519
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,900
because we wanna investigate what happened

520
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,643
and process them at a later stage.

521
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,080
And we've also had the
ability to send notifications

522
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,310
through SNS.

523
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,780
We believe this is actually very important

524
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,690
'cause if you have a malware
in one of your accounts

525
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,180
or your buckets, you wanna
get notified immediately.

526
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,710
So this is an optional feature

527
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,473
and we'll be showing that
in the code right away.

528
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,100
Matt, do you mind switching
to the demo screen?

529
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,000
- [Matt] Happy to.

530
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,143
- [Prabir] Awesome.

531
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:37,680
So, before I show you the code,

532
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,600
I'm just gonna kick off the deployment.

533
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,270
So, again, I'm using
these beautiful scripts

534
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,420
that Matt put together.

535
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,260
And once again, very simply,

536
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,360
it's just doing a Terraform apply.

537
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,730
It's not the screen from the matrix,

538
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,870
it's definitely doing a Terraform apply

539
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,243
if you've already seen that.

540
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,770
All right, so, the Terraform module

541
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,010
for malware protection is
actually pretty simple.

542
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,420
So you can see it is available

543
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,050
as a sub-module in our Transfer
Family malware protection,

544
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,643
Transfer Family server module.

545
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,540
And it requires primarily
three different things.

546
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,200
Number one, you have to
specify a source bucket

547
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,580
or a bucket that needs protection, right?

548
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,413
So, in this case,

549
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:21,603
it's defined using our
S3 ingest bucket block.

550
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,630
I am actually referencing a bucket

551
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,460
that was created in one
of our previous stages

552
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,770
and it is the same bucket that Matt sent

553
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,543
and created an SFTP file to.

554
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,563
The second part of

555
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:35,150
the configuration is our optional feature.

556
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,370
So this is where we can
specify an SNS topic

557
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,880
for malware detection and,
optionally, a dead-letter queue.

558
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,080
So, all those configurations,

559
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,810
we've kept them as true
as best practices default,

560
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,910
is to show that this works out of the box.

561
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,370
The main thing you wanna know is

562
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,077
that we have a routing config.

563
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:56,070
So, the routing config
maps GuardDuty events.

564
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,420
So these are the exact same events.

565
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,790
So, some of you said
that you use GuardDuty,

566
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,520
these are the exact same
events that GuardDuty emits.

567
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,800
So, for example, if the file was clean,

568
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,590
GuardDuty will put in
a no threats found tag

569
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,853
to one of our buckets.

570
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,400
And you see that this is being
mapped to a clean bucket.

571
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,420
This could be any of the buckets

572
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,060
that you've created from maybe
if you have another module

573
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,190
that you use to create S3 buckets.

574
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,360
So you can refer them as well.

575
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,240
For any object that was
considered malicious,

576
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,830
we'll have a threats found tag,

577
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,020
which will move to our quarantine bucket.

578
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,600
And any objects that were
not processed by GuardDuty,

579
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,040
maybe there was a permission issue,

580
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,050
maybe the object type was not supported,

581
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,000
was an access denied or failed,

582
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,290
they will automatically move

583
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,490
to our errors bucket
for further processing.

584
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,080
- [Matt] And, Prabir,
I just wanna make sure

585
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,730
that I understand this correctly.

586
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,700
This isn't ties specifically
to the Transfer Family service.

587
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,060
Like you could use this
for really any solution

588
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,130
where you need malware
scanning and S3, right?

589
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,030
- [Prabir] Yeah, that's right.

590
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,560
So, the way we build these modules,

591
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,190
they're really independent
building blocks or Lego pieces.

592
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,450
You can take this module, let's say,

593
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,130
you already have a pipeline

594
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,990
that deploys all of the above, right?

595
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,560
VPCs, Transfer Family servers,
maybe identity provider,

596
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,240
maybe you're managing it
separately using confirmation,

597
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,440
that's absolutely fine,

598
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,230
but you want to add malware protection.

599
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,740
You can just take this module

600
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,900
and deploy it in any of
your Terraform pipelines.

601
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,340
So this will work out of the box.

602
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,560
And that's, in fact, how we
build all the other modules too.

603
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,510
So you don't have to use everything

604
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,906
or everything we exampled from

605
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:24,480
to have a full feature deployment.

606
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,220
You can really plug and play.

607
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,660
Yep.
- That's awesome.

608
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,650
- [Prabir] Great, thank you.

609
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,270
So let's test our malware protection.

610
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,250
Oh, I don't want to add
anything on the code.

611
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,690
So let me go backtrack.

612
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,300
All right, stage two test.

613
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,950
So once again, we are
using some helper scripts

614
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,220
that are just simulating
the same kind of flow.

615
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,020
The first thing we're gonna
do is that we are going

616
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,850
to connect to our SFTP server.

617
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,650
So I'm gonna start the SFTP session.

618
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,913
I'm gonna enter my password
for the SFTP server.

619
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,353
Now I see that my
claim-1 file was updated.

620
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,270
At the same time, I also
added an EICAR file.

621
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,270
Does anybody know what an EICAR file is?

622
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,163
Perfect.

623
00:26:07,163 --> 00:26:09,800
So, an EICAR file is a way for you

624
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,660
to test malware protection
without compromising a system.

625
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,280
You actually don't wanna
inject an actual malware

626
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,690
to test if your malware
protection's working.

627
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,040
You know, that's not a good idea.

628
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,270
What if your system gets infected?

629
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,000
So, EICAR files are a great way to like,

630
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,530
test malware protection.

631
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,990
So in this case, we are
parsing CloudWatch logs

632
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,150
and we see that GuardDuty
did pick these up

633
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,740
as appropriately.

634
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,800
So, our claim file was
tagged as no threats found.

635
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,690
And our malicious file,
which is what I call file,

636
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,820
was detected as threats found.

637
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,790
Now I'm just gonna do an
S3 LS on our clean bucket

638
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,460
to see if the files did land
in the right place or not.

639
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,893
So, firstly, if I see in my claims bucket.

640
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,600
Yeah, actually, that was over here.

641
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,880
So I did see that my file
was processed properly,

642
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,030
my clean file landed
in my S3 clean bucket.

643
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,730
If I look at my quarantine bucket,

644
00:26:56,624 --> 00:27:00,900
I do see that my EICAR
file was successfully moved

645
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,550
to our quarantine bucket.

646
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,260
And again, all done through
different architecture.

647
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,233
I didn't have to make any
manual changes on my side.

648
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:10,883
All right.

649
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,203
Now I think it's a good moment
for us to talk about agents

650
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:18,633
or Agentic AI.

651
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,300
How many of you are using agents

652
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,550
or AI aviation agents, are exploring

653
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,760
with AI agents today,
whether it's in test?

654
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,245
Okay, a few of you.

655
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:30,630
So, for those who are not using AI agents,

656
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,090
this architecture actually
might look very familiar.

657
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,920
You know, let's say if you have a,

658
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,660
some kind of file processing pipeline

659
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,160
that uses intelligence.

660
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,510
Intelligence, what I mean by intelligence,

661
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:42,240
is it uses some of our AI services.

662
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,730
There were just a lot more
steps involved in building

663
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,330
something that does like, I
would say, file processing.

664
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,420
And these steps were
basically Lambda functions

665
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,600
or step functions that
basically we'll call different.

666
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,163
It'll be a services.

667
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,673
The thing I'm gonna call out

668
00:27:58,673 --> 00:28:00,180
that this architecture
is still very relevant.

669
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,515
So if you have a very, I would say,

670
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,723
a pipeline that's very, I would say,

671
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,280
very strict in terms of
like you know exactly

672
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,930
what needs to be
processed and what orders,

673
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,390
this is perfect, this scale really well.

674
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,800
But for organizations that are looking

675
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,330
at a little more flexibility,

676
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,480
this is where agents are
really, really powerful.

677
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,040
Now, for this use case,

678
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,590
we're gonna be using
an Agentic AI workflow

679
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,420
and we're gonna be
orchestrating all our agents,

680
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,523
using Amazon Bedrock Agent Core.

681
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,780
We built all these agents
using the strands SDK,

682
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,760
which is an open source framework

683
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,000
that AWS has developed for
you to like build agents

684
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,560
and offers a lot more flexibility.

685
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,320
And I'm gonna talk about
it just in a second.

686
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,730
We have a couple of different agents.

687
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,650
I'm gonna talk about the
agents that are in the middle.

688
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,900
So, I have an entity detection agent.

689
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,800
What it's doing is that,

690
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,700
its job is to extract
text from a PDF file.

691
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,900
I have a validation agent

692
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,357
that actually is built on the
principles of multimodality.

693
00:28:57,357 --> 00:29:00,660
So, it will take text and
will also read the image

694
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,610
and then compare if the text
matches with the image or not.

695
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,270
I have built a summarization agent

696
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,920
that summarizes all the findings
from the previous agents

697
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,510
and I have a database agent

698
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,110
that basically takes all the
entities that are detected

699
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,973
and pushes them to a DynamoDB table.

700
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,810
The brain behind all of this
is our supervisor agent,

701
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,790
which is coordinating all the tasks

702
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,200
between the other sub-agents.

703
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,410
So the supervisor agent
kind of decides where,

704
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,453
which agent to invoke at what time.

705
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,210
Now the thing I wanna mention is

706
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,690
that this patent is
actually not only relevant

707
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,523
for insurance customer,

708
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:39,660
but it can be applied to
any industries, right?

709
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,830
Somebody mentioned healthcare,

710
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:45,720
like maybe if you're in
like maybe in finance,

711
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,553
this kind of flow

712
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:48,180
and this kind of architecture
works really, really well.

713
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,280
It's just that you have to
change the prompt a little bit.

714
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,620
And speaking of prompts,
let me actually show you

715
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,240
how I build these agents very quickly

716
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,770
in terms of the prompts.

717
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,170
So, we have our claim files.

718
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,330
The first thing I'm doing
is that I've actually tasked

719
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,620
the entity detection agent

720
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,290
and I'm using simple natural
language to build my prompt.

721
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,001
I'm asking it to extract this information

722
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:09,573
from this card damage claim
and ingest it in a JSON format.

723
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,420
I'm asking my validation agent

724
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,178
to analyze this card damage image

725
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:16,233
against a reported claim details.

726
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,780
I'm asking my summarization agent

727
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,530
to summarize all of the findings
into this specific format

728
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,570
that I'm showing you over here.

729
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,520
And lastly, I have my database agent

730
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,500
and I've instructed it in natural language

731
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,600
to extract all these entities

732
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,673
and push them into a DynamoDB table.

733
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,740
All right, so let's talk about
how I build this in code.

734
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,060
Matt, do you mind switching
to the demo, please?

735
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,893
- [Matt] Sure.

736
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:41,820
There we go.

737
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,653
- [Prabir] Awesome.

738
00:30:42,653 --> 00:30:45,273
So the first thing I'm gonna
do is kick off the deployment.

739
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,440
Now I wanna quickly walk
you through the architecture

740
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,990
and how we've built these modules.

741
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,850
So the first thing I wanna mention is that

742
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,650
we are using one of our
modules for Agent Core.

743
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,500
This is a module that it supports
out of the box, you know,

744
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,880
of supported officially.

745
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,170
So we're using one of them,

746
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,730
but the thing I wanna show you is actually

747
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,730
how we build these agents using strands.

748
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,240
Anybody using strands by the way today

749
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,740
or played around with strands?

750
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,690
Okay.

751
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:22,523
- We got one.
- We got one?

752
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:24,080
Okay, perfect, I can see.

753
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,830
Great, awesome.

754
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,510
So for those who have used strands,

755
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,430
or this might look very familiar,

756
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,260
but for those who haven't used strands,

757
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,750
strands actually works on
three different concepts

758
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,730
or three different
things that it requires.

759
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,350
So the first thing that strands require is

760
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,170
that the agent needs
to have a model, right?

761
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,650
So the model is basically
the brain for the AI.

762
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:47,310
The second thing that the
agent needs is a tool.

763
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:50,010
Now a tool, in very
simple terms, is an action

764
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,020
that you provide to the agent

765
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,300
and an action that the
AI agent can perform.

766
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,940
This action could be a function, right?

767
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,300
Something that you specify
or that you do a task

768
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,360
or it could be another sub-agent, right?

769
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,240
That this agent, this
orchestrated agent, can use.

770
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,090
So it's, basically, you're
giving the AI hands to,

771
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,793
you know, track with the outside world.

772
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,490
Now I've built a couple of
tools for my orchestrator agent.

773
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,160
I'm gonna show you an
example of one of them.

774
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,226
The tool that I've built
over here is actually

775
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:23,370
a very simple function that
calls one of our sub-agents,

776
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,413
which is the entity extraction agent.

777
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,640
And, you know, for those who
are familiar with programming,

778
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,810
what I'm doing is pretty simple.

779
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,400
The first thing I'm actually asking is

780
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,993
to extract the ARN off my
entity detection agent.

781
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,670
In my step two, I'm actually
ingesting a payload,

782
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:45,450
which is my bucket name and my object name

783
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,710
or the PDF key, right?

784
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,500
Which is gonna be our claims
forms that we'll be testing.

785
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,970
I'm creating a unique session ID,

786
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,160
and again, I've done this
just for best practices.

787
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,340
I wanna troubleshoot every
session in CloudWatch.

788
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,050
And in step four, I'm in actually,

789
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,580
this is the place where I'm invoking

790
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,803
the entity extraction agent Bedrock.

791
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,970
And lastly, my final step, I'm
just parsing all the outputs

792
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,883
that have been generated from this agent.

793
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,910
And then this orchestrated
agent can read them

794
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,360
and proceed to the next step.

795
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,800
Now I've built the other
agents in a similar way.

796
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,000
So you see that I have like

797
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
the fraud detection agent specification,

798
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,950
I have the database insertion agents.

799
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,330
It's basically just calling these agents.

800
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,143
But the thing I wanna show
you over here is this.

801
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,593
Now,

802
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,020
for those who have interacted

803
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,586
with some kind of text-based or ALM based,

804
00:33:36,586 --> 00:33:38,940
you know, surveys, even ChatGPT,

805
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,590
this might actually look very familiar.

806
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,230
So instead of using complex logic, right?

807
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,680
Statements written in
SQL or whatnot, right?

808
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,500
I am instructing this
agent in natural language

809
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,120
to do the following, right?

810
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,230
So I've given it a task.

811
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,140
I've said that you are a claims
processing workflow agent,

812
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,580
leveraging strands.

813
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,460
I'm saying that your job
is to extract entities,

814
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,710
validate the damage consistency,

815
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,350
insert all this data into a database,

816
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,090
and generate a summary.

817
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,260
Now the agent decides, based
on this task I've given,

818
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,820
which tools to use.

819
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,653
And you saw, like,

820
00:34:12,653 --> 00:34:14,490
I showed one of the tools
the way I've configured it.

821
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,260
So the agent decided,
"You know what, okay.

822
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,490
I need to extract entities.

823
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,560
I know that I have a tool for that,

824
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,720
which is my subagent, so I can call that."

825
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,810
So that's how we've built this in strands.

826
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,370
And again, a fun fact is

827
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,840
that I've built this
in a couple of minutes.

828
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,480
So, you know, we were using QL CLI.

829
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,750
So for those who are using QL

830
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,420
or any other AI powered coding assistant,

831
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,890
this can be done very, very quickly.

832
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:37,290
So all you have to do is
just put your business logic,

833
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,850
ask you to build something in strands,

834
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,430
and you'll have your
agent take AI workflow.

835
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,930
All right.

836
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,178
Now before I test the agents,

837
00:34:45,178 --> 00:34:47,678
I'm gonna show you what
the claim files look like.

838
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:52,350
So I have two sample claim files.

839
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:56,460
On my left, I have a claims
record that shows....

840
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,760
Let me come here actually.

841
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,540
A car that was damaged in a parking lot.

842
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,820
We have a rear bumper damage

843
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,050
that happened in a parking lot

844
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,695
and the estimated cost
to repair it is $995,

845
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:08,640
if I'm not mistaken.

846
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,780
And if you look at the image,

847
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,978
this is very consistent to what we see,

848
00:35:11,978 --> 00:35:14,310
but on my right hand
side, I have a claim form

849
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,480
that states that this was actually

850
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,130
a minor front bumper scratch

851
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,590
that happened in a
grocery store parking lot.

852
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,423
And I don't know, like,

853
00:35:20,423 --> 00:35:21,630
do you think that this is a minor scratch?

854
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,010
- [Matt] Doesn't look like
a minor scratch to me.

855
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,090
- [Prabir] I know.

856
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:24,923
- [Matt] Yeah, I would say

857
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:26,250
that's a little more than a minor scratch

858
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,083
in a parking lot.

859
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:27,916
- [Prabir] Yeah, yeah.

860
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,220
And by the way, no cars were harmed

861
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,360
in making this demo, right?

862
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,500
So, just wanna call that out.

863
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,870
Sort in a very, very
expensive demo otherwise.

864
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:34,703
Awesome.

865
00:35:34,703 --> 00:35:36,210
So, let's test this,
Matt, what do you think?

866
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,140
- [Matt] Yeah, let's try it out.

867
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,790
I'm gonna switch back to the demo.

868
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,840
- [Prabir] All right.

869
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,290
So, once again, we're using a test script.

870
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,060
Same flow, our event driven
architecture's gonna kick in.

871
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,283
We're gonna log in to the RSTFP server.

872
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,290
We're gonna enter a password.

873
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,623
And we've uploaded one of our claim files.

874
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,170
And one thing we've did with the script is

875
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,450
that we've asked it to
parse CloudWatch logs.

876
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,740
So we have like five different agents.

877
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,140
We thought that the best use of our time

878
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,090
wouldn't have been to go in the console,

879
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,010
find CloudWatch logs.

880
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,215
Who likes, you know, going
to the console, by the way?

881
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:18,273
Anybody?

882
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,240
- [Matt] No one likes, I like the console.

883
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,073
- [Prabir] The console's cool.

884
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:22,906
Yeah, yeah.
- Let's not be too mean.

885
00:36:22,906 --> 00:36:26,010
- [Prabir] So, everybody likes
to go code being like the ID?

886
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,720
Yeah, that's why I see the team over here.

887
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,553
Yeah, cool.

888
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,700
- [Matt] I guess that's the right answer.

889
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,570
- [Prabir] Perfect, cool.

890
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,430
Maybe, I don't know.

891
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,000
All right, so we see that
our CloudWatch logs picked up

892
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,500
different things that are
happening in our workflow.

893
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,840
So we see, the first thing we found that,

894
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,040
I'm just gonna scroll up just in a bit.

895
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,960
We see our entity
detection agent picked up

896
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,540
all these entities, right?

897
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,283
Our fraud validation agent,

898
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,985
again, took this data and
it's now reading the image

899
00:36:50,985 --> 00:36:52,683
that I've supplied with it.

900
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,200
Our workflow agent is our orchestrator.

901
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,050
So, again, it's kind of showing
a different orchestration

902
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,490
that's going on.

903
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,770
And our database agent again
took all these entities

904
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,390
and now it's meaningfully parsing it

905
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,493
and ingesting into DynamoDB record.

906
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,760
All right.

907
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,480
So, I see that our claims
processing was finished

908
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,853
and I'm gonna show you
the claim in a minute.

909
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,600
All right, so I see that my
claim was successfully processed

910
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,730
and I'm gonna move on to
the second claim as well.

911
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,563
I'm gonna test both of them

912
00:37:27,563 --> 00:37:29,853
and I'm gonna see them at the same time.

913
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,310
Okay, so I have uploaded this file.

914
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,630
I know for those who like the console,

915
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,263
let's actually go to the console
and see what's happening.

916
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,190
Okay, if we've created a
couple of different buckets.

917
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,050
I will be in my clean bucket

918
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,820
because all these files were clean

919
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,950
and I can see that my claim
was successfully uploaded.

920
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,650
I just uploaded my claim two,
so it's still being processed,

921
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,870
but at the same time, I
have these two prefixes.

922
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,760
So I have my submitted claims,

923
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,100
I see the claim one that was submitted.

924
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,170
So this is very consistent with the image

925
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,153
and the PDF that I showed to you.

926
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,970
And our process claim was the one

927
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,700
that was just processed by the AI agent.

928
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,500
Sorry, I'm in the same prefix again.

929
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,495
So, if I open this summary,

930
00:38:24,495 --> 00:38:26,703
let just make it slightly bigger.

931
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,050
So this claim is claim one.

932
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,922
We saw that this was a
claim that had, you know,

933
00:38:33,922 --> 00:38:37,470
that said that it was had
a minor rear bumper damage.

934
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,920
The estimated cost to
repair this claim was $995.

935
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,170
And this is what my summarization
agent, by the way, did.

936
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,950
So it states that, our fraud agent said,

937
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,750
the fraud agent is 90% confident

938
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,910
that the description matches the image.

939
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,490
The analysis, again, all
done in natural language,

940
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,230
which says that this is a car

941
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,460
that had a minor bumper damage.

942
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,560
It's very consistent with
the claim description.

943
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,170
There's a visible denting
on the rear bumper

944
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,480
and there's no apparent
damage on the vehicle.

945
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,110
And the recommendation by this
agent to our human agents is

946
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,060
that this claim can be approved.

947
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,550
So, again, this is super, super powerful.

948
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,110
Just eliminate a whole
bunch of manual steps

949
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,733
that human users have to do.

950
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,030
Now at the same time, let me-

951
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,170
- [Matt] Let's see the second one.

952
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,450
- [Prabir] Yeah, let's see,
I'm curious about that.

953
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,640
Let's see if it processed.

954
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,290
Okay, so my second
claim is also processed.

955
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,540
I think it should be
the first one over here.

956
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,230
All right.

957
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,200
Yes, legible, okay, perfect.

958
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,750
- Yeah.
- So my second claim,

959
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:38,138
again, our claim forms stated

960
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:39,807
that this was a minor front bumper scratch

961
00:39:39,807 --> 00:39:43,200
and the estimated cost
to repair, that was $350.

962
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,480
But our AI agent said
that this is actually,

963
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,280
the image does not match the description

964
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,140
and the agent is 95% confident.

965
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,510
So even more confident in that
this is not a scratch, right?

966
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,280
So that's exactly what it states.

967
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,185
It says that, although the claim suggests

968
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,030
that this is a front bumper scratch,

969
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,880
but the image shows
severe front-end damage.

970
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,210
And it suggests that this
claim should be reviewed for

971
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,860
by a human just to be sure.

972
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,110
So, you know, the thing
I wanna call out as

973
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,200
that is this shows how
powerful this workflow can be

974
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,480
and how you can apply
this in your use cases.

975
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,020
And I build this using simple
natural language prompts.

976
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,210
The power of this is that you
can literally take our demo,

977
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,560
maybe play around with the prompts,

978
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,610
and have something up and running

979
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,473
for your own use cases too.

980
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,050
The one thing I do wanna call out is

981
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,748
that I don't think that, you know,

982
00:40:26,748 --> 00:40:29,310
our business users will
like going to the ID.

983
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,143
I know all of us,

984
00:40:30,143 --> 00:40:30,976
we do like the ID, right?
- Yeah.

985
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,090
Or the AWS console maybe.

986
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:33,923
- [Prabir] Yeah, not even that.

987
00:40:33,923 --> 00:40:34,860
- [Matt] Be able to advance for someone

988
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,140
that needs to review
insurance claims, right?

989
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:37,973
- [Prabir] So what do you think, Matt,

990
00:40:37,973 --> 00:40:39,000
we should do for that?

991
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,830
- [Matt] Well, I think
this would be a good time

992
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,170
to implement Transfer Family web apps.

993
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,003
- [Prabir] Okay, take it away.

994
00:40:44,003 --> 00:40:45,420
- [Matt] So why don't we do that

995
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,420
and I'm gonna grab this,
switch back to our PowerPoint.

996
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,460
So, the last stage,

997
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,500
now that we've created
this awesome workflow

998
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,120
where we're automating the
file or the claims processing,

999
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,820
and summarizing it, looking
for the potential for fraud,

1000
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,970
is we need to make this
available to the humans

1001
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,680
that are gonna do this final review

1002
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,687
and sign off on these claims, right?

1003
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:11,610
And so, we'll call those
our claims reviewers

1004
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,050
and we're gonna give them access using

1005
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,630
a Transfer Family web app.

1006
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,460
So, show of hands,

1007
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,710
is anybody using Transfer
Family web apps at all

1008
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,640
or explored it?

1009
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,540
Awesome.

1010
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:26,540
And so, anybody here use a
service called S3 Access Grants?

1011
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,010
Yes, obviously, if you use web apps,

1012
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,210
you use S3 Access Grants.

1013
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,118
Good, good answer.

1014
00:41:31,118 --> 00:41:32,779
So, we're gonna be using

1015
00:41:32,779 --> 00:41:34,980
a combination of these services today.

1016
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,660
I'm gonna briefly, for those not familiar,

1017
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,760
walk through how this service works.

1018
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,820
So, when you deploy a web app,

1019
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,190
you integrate it with
another AWS service called,

1020
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,780
IAM Identity Center.

1021
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,300
And Identity Center supports
federated authentication

1022
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,440
from identity providers, Okta,
Entra, just to name a few.

1023
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,410
But really any SAML based
identity provider can integrate

1024
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,640
with Identity Center,

1025
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,620
and that's how your end
users will authenticate.

1026
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,690
They'll authenticate
through Identity Center

1027
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,660
and then be redirected
back to the web app.

1028
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,130
But then we need to
assign them permissions

1029
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,180
and authorizations.

1030
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,850
And that is done through
another service called,

1031
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,410
S3 Access Grants.

1032
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,760
And in order to do this,

1033
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,660
we first define an S3 bucket location

1034
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,493
with our Access Grants.

1035
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:19,530
And so this is where we're
going to specify a location

1036
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:22,260
to assign grants or permissions to.

1037
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,980
And then we're going to
assign individual grants

1038
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,330
for our users or groups.

1039
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,400
And in the table in the lower left,

1040
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,560
that's the grants that we'll be assigning.

1041
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,920
And you can see that our
claims reviewers group will be

1042
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,510
given read only access
to the submitted claims

1043
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,310
and process claims buckets.

1044
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,080
And then we'll have a claims admin group.

1045
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,560
If they need to manage
the files in the bucket,

1046
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,080
we'll give them read and write access.

1047
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,240
So we're gonna set all of this up.

1048
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,970
Now the one thing I want
you to be aware of is

1049
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,830
if you've ever had to
configure all of this

1050
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,530
in the console, especially
the Access Grants

1051
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,930
and setting up and
assigning the permissions,

1052
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,730
you may find that it's a lot of clicks,

1053
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,670
it's a lot of manual processes,

1054
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,520
looking up user IDs based
on their display names.

1055
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,960
So we're gonna automate all of that

1056
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,230
with Terraform here in just a moment.

1057
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,123
So let's switch over, Prabir.

1058
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,860
And again, I'm gonna go ahead

1059
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,760
and kick off our deployment

1060
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,383
before we show the code.

1061
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,503
And we'll go over this.

1062
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:46,770
Okay, so what we're gonna
do today is show you

1063
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:49,410
what we're calling the alpha module of

1064
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,470
the Transfer Family web app for Terraform.

1065
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:55,140
And this is something that
we haven't released yet,

1066
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,730
but it is in the source code

1067
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,980
that we're sharing a link with today.

1068
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,510
And it's something that we are hoping

1069
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:03,000
to release here very shortly.

1070
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,490
But this, what we expect
this will allow you

1071
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:08,460
to do is really simplify
deploying Transfer Family web apps

1072
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,100
and configuring your S3 Access Grants

1073
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,260
for your user entitlements.

1074
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,050
This is made up of one
main module for the web app

1075
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,370
and then two sub-modules,

1076
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:19,740
which I'm gonna walk through here quickly.

1077
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:24,660
So, first, we use our
transfer web app module itself

1078
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,220
and this is what's going

1079
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,420
to actually deploy the
Transfer Family web app.

1080
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,870
And a web app is actually
really easy to deploy.

1081
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,040
It's fully managed.

1082
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,300
With a couple clicks in the console,

1083
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:38,103
you can deploy a web app in
the Transfer Family console.

1084
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,730
And, really, all we need
to do is specify the name

1085
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,800
that we wanna assign our web app,

1086
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,060
and then we need to connect it

1087
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,820
with an IAM Identity Center instance

1088
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,010
and an S3 access grant instance.

1089
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:53,610
And, usually, these are both
in the same AWS account.

1090
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:54,810
However, if you already have

1091
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,090
an organization-wide
identity center instance,

1092
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:01,470
you can use that instead of
an account based instance.

1093
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:05,340
So, in a couple lines of code,
we have our web app deployed.

1094
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,080
Now we need to configure our permissions

1095
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,150
and we have a sub-module first

1096
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,576
that will define the S3 locations

1097
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:16,576
where we're going to be giving
users access for in web apps.

1098
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,090
So, what this module is
doing is configuring this in

1099
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,923
at the S3 Access Grants instance,

1100
00:45:22,923 --> 00:45:25,830
and it's automatically
creating an IAM role

1101
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:28,770
with the associated permissions
and trust policy required.

1102
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,200
And it can optionally
create a bucket for us

1103
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,910
if we wanna specify a clean bucket

1104
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,470
that we're gonna be using.

1105
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,780
Or in this case, we're gonna
be using an existing bucket

1106
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,180
which has those process claims.

1107
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,350
The other thing that it can do,

1108
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,225
and this is a requirement

1109
00:45:41,225 --> 00:45:43,620
when you're configuring
Transfer Family web apps,

1110
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:48,180
is we're gonna set the
course configuration

1111
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,680
on our S3 bucket.

1112
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,660
So you need to do this for any S3 bucket

1113
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,320
that you configure with web apps.

1114
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,460
And so, this will also do
that for you automatically

1115
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,750
as well.

1116
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,740
Now the last piece is to
configure the entitlements

1117
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,340
or the permissions themselves.

1118
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,770
And that's where this web app users

1119
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:06,750
and groups module comes in.

1120
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,010
And again, this is a sub-module

1121
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:10,470
that will be under the
transfer web apps module

1122
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,840
because it's purpose built for web apps.

1123
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,930
And we can define both user

1124
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:19,560
and group entitlements via the
users and groups parameters.

1125
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,350
In this case, we're doing
role-based access controls.

1126
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,390
So we're assigning groups.

1127
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:28,320
And, first, we specify the
display name for our group.

1128
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,970
Now I'll show you in
the console in a moment,

1129
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:34,050
what this actually does is
it looks up the the group ID,

1130
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,940
which is a UUID of that
group in Identity Center.

1131
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,190
And it retrieves that

1132
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:39,750
and we'll use that for the configuration.

1133
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:43,680
So it's simplifying a lot of
that process of doing look ups.

1134
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,380
And then we assign our
actual Access Grants.

1135
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,730
In other words, the permissions

1136
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:50,790
that we are going to give to this group.

1137
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,190
In this case, for our claims admins,

1138
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,673
we're gonna assign read-write access

1139
00:46:55,673 --> 00:46:58,800
to our S3 bucket location

1140
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,110
that we defined in the previous step.

1141
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,240
We're gonna give it access
to the entire bucket.

1142
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,223
So all paths with that wild card.

1143
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,530
Now for our claims reviewers,

1144
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,870
very similar setup except we're going

1145
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,420
to have two Access Grants assigned.

1146
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,660
First, we're going to give
read access to submitted claims

1147
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,030
and any sub-files and folders.

1148
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,733
And then, to process claims as well.

1149
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,670
So, let's check on the
status of our deployment

1150
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,860
and it looks like we
deployed successfully.

1151
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,710
So, there's nothing to test
in the terminal at this time.

1152
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,660
I'm gonna take you to the actual console

1153
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,910
because this is a human interface.

1154
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:39,000
Quickly, what I want to show
you is what we just created.

1155
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,300
So, this is our Transfer Family web app

1156
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,600
that was just provisioned.

1157
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:45,510
If we go into our web app,

1158
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:47,550
we can see the configuration

1159
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:52,080
including our Identity Center
instance being configured.

1160
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,370
And if we go to the groups tab,

1161
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,250
we can see that both of our
groups have been assigned.

1162
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,290
These are the group IDs
that I talked about.

1163
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:00,990
So these are just UUIDs that are unique

1164
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:03,180
that you would otherwise have
to look up manually yourself.

1165
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:07,080
So, we've really simplified
that process with this module.

1166
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,840
And now, I'll jump over
to S3 Access Grants.

1167
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,990
Actually, I'll just
switch over to this tab

1168
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,868
and if we go into the details here,

1169
00:48:16,868 --> 00:48:20,535
we can see we have our location set up.

1170
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:22,710
In this case, our claims bucket

1171
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:25,250
with our clean and process claims.

1172
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,140
And then our grants.

1173
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:32,130
So, you can see our grant
IDs for our claims reviewer

1174
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:33,870
and claims admin groups.

1175
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,520
And the grant scopes

1176
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,960
and permissions that have been applied.

1177
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,010
So, all of that was done

1178
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:41,010
with just a couple of
lines of Terraform code.

1179
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,250
So what does it actually look
like once you authenticate,

1180
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:46,890
let's go back to web apps

1181
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,193
and we will open up our web apps URL.

1182
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,550
We'll sign in as our claims reviewer here.

1183
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,537
And I'm gonna make this, I'm
not gonna turn up the volume,

1184
00:49:01,537 --> 00:49:03,630
I'm gonna make this just
a little bit larger,

1185
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,180
maybe too large, but we'll see.

1186
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,590
I'm gonna remember my password hopefully.

1187
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,880
All right, so,

1188
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,360
now we're in our user friendly
transfer web app interface.

1189
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,620
And if we look here,

1190
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:23,490
we have access to both the
processed and submitted claims,

1191
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:24,810
read permission.

1192
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:26,940
If we go into our process claims,

1193
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,340
we can open one of our claims folders

1194
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,050
and download that same summary

1195
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,093
that Prabir showed us earlier.

1196
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,430
One other thing to call out here is

1197
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:40,080
there is some level of
customization you can do

1198
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:40,913
with these web apps.

1199
00:49:40,913 --> 00:49:42,420
So, if you need a custom logo

1200
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,184
or you wanna use your organization's logo,

1201
00:49:44,184 --> 00:49:47,070
you can specify that in the configuration,

1202
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,300
and that will show up here

1203
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,050
instead of the transfer web
app icon that's right here.

1204
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,720
And this also is a little small,

1205
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,950
so I'll make that slightly larger

1206
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:58,260
now that's we've already gone through it.

1207
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:03,260
All right, so that, I think,
is the end of our architecture.

1208
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,720
And just to quickly recap
what we've done today.

1209
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,150
So, we configured a Transfer Family server

1210
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:12,300
with authentication to an
external identity provider.

1211
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,430
In this case, it was Cognito.

1212
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:15,930
We did malware scanning automatically.

1213
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,980
Once we received files,
we then used Agentic AI

1214
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,590
to process our submitted claims,

1215
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:25,950
look and see if there
was an inaccuracy issue.

1216
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:29,040
And then we made those claims
once processed available

1217
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,140
to our claims reviewers.

1218
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,120
So, with that, Prabir,
where do we go from here?

1219
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,403
What are our next steps?
- Yeah, for sure.

1220
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,950
So I just wanna say before we wrap up,

1221
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:44,040
all the code that you saw today is powered

1222
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,053
by our Transfer Family Terraform module.

1223
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,830
And this is available
to you for it to use,

1224
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,990
you know, whenever you can.

1225
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,160
And the step-by-step example

1226
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,900
that we covered today
is one of many examples

1227
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,070
that exist in our repository.

1228
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:58,890
So it's built typically around use cases.

1229
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:00,780
So if you have a specific use case,

1230
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,850
we showed you different
components that is connectors.

1231
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:05,250
But today, we showed you a
use case with Agentic AI.

1232
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,500
All of these can be deployed
in just a couple of minutes.

1233
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,630
So, again, very, very
quickly for you to set up,

1234
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:12,390
especially if you're using
infrastructure as code.

1235
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:15,030
We launched this module only
just a couple of months ago

1236
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,433
and we've already had
over 10,000 downloads.

1237
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:20,370
And I just wanna thank all
the AWS solution architects

1238
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,140
that are basically contributing to this,

1239
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,430
but also folks like you, you know,

1240
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,190
we've had a lot of
external contributions too.

1241
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:28,390
So if you're one of
them, thank you so much.

1242
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,320
You can grab this QR
code for direct access.

1243
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,710
This will take you to the
the root of the module,

1244
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:36,570
which has all the examples

1245
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:40,053
and has all the modules that
you can use in your folk flows.

1246
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,960
One thing I wanna call
out is that we do maintain

1247
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,180
a public roadmap for all the
things that we're working on.

1248
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,670
So if you like any of the
features that we're working on,

1249
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,590
you can always do a plus one on them.

1250
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:50,550
But if you feel that there's something

1251
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,010
that we do not support, if
you have any suggestions,

1252
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,720
you can always create a GitHub issue.

1253
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,570
My team and I, we review
these almost daily

1254
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:58,830
because we wanna get new features

1255
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,900
for you as soon as possible.

1256
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,860
And I'm super excited to see

1257
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,510
what you'll build next with these tools.

1258
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:04,887
So with that, I just wanna
thank you for your time

1259
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:07,170
and I hope you enjoy
the rest of re:Invent.

1260
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,113
Thank you.
- Have a great week, everyone.
