1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,389
Well, good afternoon.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,068
Thank you all for being here.

3
00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:03,930
Um,

4
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,408
Thursday of reinvent, we're coming up on

5
00:00:06,408 --> 00:00:08,288
the end. Hope everybody has had

6
00:00:08,569 --> 00:00:10,630
a great week as you put your headsets on.

7
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,228
Um, hopefully everybody has had a great week,

8
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:15,849
uh, and done all of the great reinvent things

9
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,670
networking.

10
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:19,609
Learning, uh, having the Vegas

11
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:21,109
experience and, and doing it all,

12
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,609
um, and I, I will put in a plug hopefully

13
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,269
you've saved a little bit of energy

14
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,568
for the replay party tonight. For me it's

15
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:29,789
always a fun way to kind of wrap the business

16
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,989
part of the week and, and have some fun,

17
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,750
uh, celebrating, uh, what's happened. So

18
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,969
I always love to find out

19
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:39,090
people's experience at reinvent. How many are

20
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,209
here for their first ever reinvent?

21
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,590
Wow, lots of first timers. That's fantastic.

22
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:46,868
Love it. Welcome. Hopefully it's been a good

23
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:49,069
week and you're already booking your flight for next year.

24
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:51,590
Uh, how many on the other end, 5

25
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,149
or more?

26
00:00:53,368 --> 00:00:54,009
6

27
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:55,829
7

28
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,679
Alright, awesome. So these are veterans

29
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,179
you new newcomers can see

30
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:03,130
that they've had a good time and they keep coming back. So,

31
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,629
well again thank you so much for being here. Um,

32
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:08,239
by way of introduction, my name is Tim Honeychurch.

33
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,680
I am a, uh, uh, uh, principal

34
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,799
specialist in cloud governance, uh, here

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,760
at AWS.

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,459
I'll be joined, uh, later in the presentation

37
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:17,930
by our valued customer,

38
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,359
uh, Dustin Jeffers of Eli Lilly and

39
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,448
Company. And then my colleague

40
00:01:22,448 --> 00:01:23,870
here at AWS,

41
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:26,370
uh, Alex Morita, but I have the privilege

42
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,370
of getting us started and, uh, we'll do

43
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,448
that by taking a quick look, uh, at

44
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:31,230
our agenda.

45
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:34,469
Um, I'm gonna spend the first part of the presentation

46
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,650
laying down the foundation of

47
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,189
what cloud governance is,

48
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,569
uh, and how it relates to the topics

49
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,959
that Dustin and, and, uh, Alex

50
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,989
will be talking about.

51
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:46,569
Dustin's gonna come up and tell a real

52
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:48,689
life story. This is one of our, our favorite

53
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,870
things to do is tell a real life story

54
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,088
about problems to be solved,

55
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:55,719
solutions that were available, uh,

56
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,760
how that process went, and then what the

57
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,888
outcome was. So we're looking forward to hearing from

58
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:02,129
Dustin about, uh, what it meant for Lily.

59
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,799
And then Alex will come in and do

60
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,159
some more detailed uh

61
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,699
deep dive on some of the technical elements

62
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,000
of that solution that that Lily

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,058
employed. So, uh, 3 parts

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
and hopefully it all connects for you and you

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,099
come away with some things that are useful

66
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,439
that you can take back to your operations.

67
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:21,500
So does that sound good?

68
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:23,679
Alright, ready? Let's, let's get into it.

69
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,710
So you know one of the the things that

70
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,849
we love to talk about at AWS

71
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,750
is the speed of innovation

72
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,349
that is enabled by the cloud, right? So customers

73
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:34,278
come to us,

74
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:37,270
um, because they wanna move faster they have business

75
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,349
projects, objectives, outcomes that they're

76
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,710
looking for, and they wanna take advantage

77
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,008
of some key characteristics of the cloud,

78
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:45,750
uh, to help them get there.

79
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:48,419
You know, one is to move faster, and

80
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,460
what we'll be talking about today is how

81
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,819
we enable these capabilities

82
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:54,819
through our cloud governance services

83
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,399
that are part of Lily's story.

84
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,069
So from a moving faster perspective,

85
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,099
our customers want to

86
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:03,879
utilize capabilities like

87
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,969
auto scaling and dynamic

88
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:08,000
resource provisioning to be

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,159
able to add resources quickly as

90
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,319
part of their development process and not

91
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,189
be slowed down by

92
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,508
legacy IT type of

93
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:18,758
operations. Agility is

94
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:20,758
key. Our customers want to be agile.

95
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:22,758
They want to be able to

96
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,270
move quickly in their development cycles,

97
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,800
spin up resources to be able to

98
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,909
do what they need to do in their projects

99
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,308
without being bogged down by

100
00:03:32,308 --> 00:03:34,679
operational requirements and centralized

101
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:36,750
IT. And they

102
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,788
also want to be able to scale, right? You wanna

103
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:41,258
get big and you wanna get fast and you wanna be efficient.

104
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,819
You wanna be able to deploy, uh,

105
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,990
policies such as uh S3 bucket

106
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,389
encryption across all of your S3 buckets,

107
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,710
maybe thousands of them across hundreds of

108
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,229
accounts,

109
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:53,409
and you wanna be able to do that in one motion

110
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,558
using uh scaled capabilities,

111
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,860
and those are the things we'll be talking about

112
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,270
today in our presentation.

113
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:04,409
Before we get too far into it though, I do wanna lay

114
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,838
a bit of a foundation, uh,

115
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:08,389
uh, uh, a foundational definition

116
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:11,008
of cloud governance. So in my role

117
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:13,389
and in what we do here at AWS,

118
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,000
we look at cloud governance as a way

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,170
to enable you to take advantage

120
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,410
of the things that the cloud offers. You came here

121
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,988
to do something specific,

122
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:24,769
and we like to use the capabilities and governance

123
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:27,149
to help you get there, to align your use

124
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:29,170
of the cloud, uh, with

125
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,369
those business objectives.

126
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,009
And while we talk about cloud governance kind

127
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,009
of as a topic, we know it's made

128
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,100
up of some interconnected components

129
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,459
so there's a security element, there's an

130
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:41,488
operations element, there's a compliance element and

131
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:42,528
a cost element,

132
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:45,170
and we like to orchestrate these things with cloud

133
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,250
governance capabilities to help

134
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,588
you move faster

135
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:51,559
while also adhering to the requirements,

136
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:53,569
uh, and, and the standards that you

137
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:55,350
have across those domains.

138
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,079
So as we get into the more technical

139
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,559
content. Just be thinking about that definition,

140
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,970
right, a set of tools capabilities

141
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,269
that helps you align your use

142
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:06,170
of the cloud

143
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:08,009
with what you're trying to achieve.

144
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,649
But you know we know that implementing

145
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,790
these things is not necessarily easy

146
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:17,259
or automatic and you'll hear from Dustin

147
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:20,069
that there's work involved, uh, in, in accomplishing,

148
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,119
uh, what they were able to accomplish,

149
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,588
um, you know, and, and one of my

150
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,889
favorite things about the role that I have

151
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:27,939
now at AWS

152
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:30,028
is that I talk to customers a lot,

153
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:32,608
right, and I hear from customers about what they're

154
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:33,470
trying to achieve.

155
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,250
Um, what the challenges

156
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,329
are in, in their world, the

157
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,410
unique requirements and, and, and what they're

158
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,470
trying to, uh, customize

159
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,730
to help them solve problems for their business.

160
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,709
And then I have the ability to go back to our service

161
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:49,949
teams and say, hey, I talked to these customers,

162
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:50,928
this is what they need

163
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:53,608
and be able to advocate for customers and

164
00:05:53,778 --> 00:05:55,790
future road maps and capabilities in

165
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,548
our services.

166
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,389
So you know these challenges are what we're

167
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:00,759
hearing from customers,

168
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,428
and I also had the opportunity to experience

169
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,509
that when I was a customer. I was a customer for about

170
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:06,298
8 years,

171
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:09,250
part of a team that built a, um,

172
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,528
security platform, a SAS security platform,

173
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:14,149
uh, in AWS, and like many

174
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:16,459
of you may have experienced, we started with,

175
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:18,829
you know, 3 developers and one account and

176
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,869
scaled that out to hundreds of accounts

177
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:22,869
and very complex services that served

178
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:23,709
our customers.

179
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:26,250
And so we experienced some of these challenges

180
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,639
as part of that as well,

181
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:30,259
and I'll note that the challenges that I'm going to

182
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,298
share here and talk through, um,

183
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,420
are just the tip of the iceberg we know there's

184
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,500
many more, but these are very common from what

185
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,798
we've heard. The first is

186
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,250
resources. Um, does anybody here

187
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:41,899
have

188
00:06:42,238 --> 00:06:44,278
more, uh, human resource

189
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,459
capacity

190
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:47,399
than they know what to do with, uh,

191
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:49,778
more budget for tools

192
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,420
than you know what to do with?

193
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,199
I don't see any hands raised, right?

194
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,858
In fact, it's quite the opposite. Everybody's struggling

195
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:57,980
to be able to get, uh, more done

196
00:06:58,278 --> 00:06:59,278
with less and less,

197
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:01,579
particularly as we enter the AI age.

198
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,500
And the expectation is that you can utilize

199
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,699
technologies like that to help you do even

200
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:07,939
more with even less

201
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,959
so we know that implementing

202
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:12,379
the principles that we're talking about today, the

203
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:14,738
solutions, uh, is, is a challenge

204
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,778
because we need resources to be able to

205
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:18,259
do that. So that's acknowledged.

206
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,459
The second is being able to,

207
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:23,850
you know, as we get into more detail about, uh,

208
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:26,850
cloud governance, when you think about implementing

209
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,019
controls across those four

210
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:30,220
domains we mentioned

211
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:32,778
across an entire environment, being able

212
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:33,819
to define those,

213
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,259
deploy those, and maintain those

214
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:39,019
is not an easy thing to do, right, and we acknowledge

215
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,579
that. Um,

216
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,449
3rd, and when we think about that agile

217
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:45,869
development cycle and, and supporting a culture

218
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:46,850
of agility.

219
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,798
We recognize there's a there's a balance point.

220
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,238
There's a balance between giving a lot of

221
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,829
control and independence to developers,

222
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,379
but also on the other end trying to maintain

223
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,000
standards and controls from a security

224
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,420
and cost and compliance perspective,

225
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,838
so maintaining that balance is always tricky.

226
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:08,088
And then lastly and certainly not least

227
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:11,009
is maintaining uh compliance

228
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:13,869
with ever evolving standards

229
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:14,970
um and I'm sure

230
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:16,889
you all here are subject to

231
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:19,250
multiple compliance frameworks. Anybody

232
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,389
uh specifically subject to

233
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,410
PCI DSS in your world,

234
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,809
OK? So you all probably know

235
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:28,790
that when PCIDSS 4.0

236
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,928
was, was launched or released in

237
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,210
2022.

238
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:33,609
There were

239
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,029
60 new controls added

240
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:36,869
to the framework,

241
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:39,259
right? So when you have that dropped in your lap and

242
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:41,428
now we need to deploy that across a complex

243
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:43,570
environment, that's a very challenging thing to do,

244
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,788
and that's, these are things that we acknowledge

245
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:47,349
and we hear from our customers,

246
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,750
uh, and we look to bring solutions for.

247
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:53,129
So you know, the good news is

248
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:55,580
that we look at again back to our definition,

249
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,969
we look at cloud governance

250
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:59,349
as a set of capabilities that helps you

251
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:01,389
achieve things and overcome some of these

252
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:01,989
challenges.

253
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,859
And what I'll be doing is walking through,

254
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,558
uh, calling out four characteristics

255
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:09,580
of Cloud Governance Foundation

256
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,580
and AWS

257
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,960
that will reflect some of what Dustin and

258
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,918
Lily went through, uh, in their transformation.

259
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,859
Um, so let's take a look at those.

260
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,190
The first characteristic

261
00:09:20,678 --> 00:09:21,960
that we want to emphasize

262
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:25,099
is AWS cloud services provide

263
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:27,139
managed capabilities. So if you're

264
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,058
familiar with Control Tower,

265
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:31,979
you know that it can deploy,

266
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,269
configure,

267
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,700
and maintain for you up to 14

268
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,500
different underlying services,

269
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:39,820
and that relieves the pressure from you of having

270
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,759
to do that deployment configuration.

271
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:44,500
An ongoing management yourself. So

272
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:47,599
examples would be, uh, AWS

273
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,239
organizations,

274
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,979
IAM Identity Center,

275
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:52,139
uh, and AWS config,

276
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:54,460
which if you think about config just by

277
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,500
itself, there's a lot of complexity

278
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
in being able to deploy that and

279
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,099
manage it to your standards.

280
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:02,538
Control tower can do a lot of that heavy lifting for

281
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:04,320
you as a managed service

282
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,889
as it continues to be updated, uh,

283
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,940
behind the scenes by our teams. So manage

284
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,700
is number one.

285
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:12,250
Number 2, controlled.

286
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,750
So we talked about controls deploying that

287
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,349
across a complex environment.

288
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:18,928
Also, part of control tower is a set

289
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:21,178
of built-in controls

290
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:23,908
ready for you off the shelf to be able to deploy

291
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:24,950
across your environment.

292
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:27,668
So proactive controls, detective

293
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,210
controls, preventive controls

294
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:31,830
are there for you to, to implement

295
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,969
according to your needs

296
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:35,330
without having the need to build them

297
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,469
and deploy them

298
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,710
by yourself.

299
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:40,658
Back to agility,

300
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:43,158
so we think about again that tricky balance

301
00:10:43,158 --> 00:10:45,399
and we'll use the count provisioning

302
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,798
and resource provisioning

303
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,359
as our example, being able to use

304
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:51,649
automation. And infrastructure as

305
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,869
code to allow your developers

306
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,469
to deploy the

307
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:57,570
resources that they need,

308
00:10:57,849 --> 00:11:00,288
but doing so in a controlled way

309
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:02,408
according to your requirements is, is

310
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,529
really a critical element, and that's a lot of what we'll

311
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:05,788
be talking about today

312
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:08,048
using Account factory for terraform to

313
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:10,369
do deployments for you according to

314
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,029
preset

315
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:12,558
conditions that you want,

316
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,769
uh, enabling that agility.

317
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:18,678
And then last is scalability,

318
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:20,509
being able to deploy

319
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,000
uh uh uh uh uh a requirement

320
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,058
at scale across an entire scope

321
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:27,178
of accounts and resources in

322
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:28,000
one motion,

323
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:30,418
um, you know, we, we'll talk again

324
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:32,500
about Account factory for terraform and how it

325
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,808
enables you to, to, to

326
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:37,210
manage a large and complex, uh,

327
00:11:37,219 --> 00:11:39,658
environment, multiple accounts and resources.

328
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,529
In one motion, so

329
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,178
based on those four characteristics, uh,

330
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:46,298
we're gonna have Dustin come up and

331
00:11:46,298 --> 00:11:48,418
walk through a transformation that,

332
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:50,940
uh, Lilly and Company, uh, went

333
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,558
through to, uh, modernize their,

334
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:55,259
uh, cloud governance environment, Dustin.

335
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,798
Thank you Tim. Good afternoon everyone.

336
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,418
My name is Dustin Jefford. I am the

337
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:07,700
cloud platform or cloud foundation lead

338
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,099
at Eli Lilly and Company for our AWS

339
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,690
platform. Today I'm gonna

340
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,219
talk to you, as Tim mentioned,

341
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,750
about our journey into

342
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,129
modern cloud governance, specifically

343
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,590
our transition

344
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:23,210
from the legacy AWS landing

345
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,788
zone or ALZ solution into

346
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:27,529
control tower,

347
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:29,330
an account factory with Terraform.

348
00:12:30,798 --> 00:12:32,668
But first, a little bit about who we are.

349
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,719
Um, Lilly unites caring

350
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,899
with Discovery to create medicines that make

351
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,960
life better for people around the world.

352
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:42,279
Founded in 1876

353
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,029
and headquartered in Indianapolis,

354
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:47,239
we employ more than 44,000

355
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:48,340
people worldwide.

356
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,158
Uh, we do clinical research in more than 55

357
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:51,820
countries

358
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,519
and we market our products globally.

359
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,649
With the global scale of our business.

360
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:00,418
We require governance technologies that

361
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:01,979
are robust,

362
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:03,158
scalable,

363
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,019
and ready to adapt to the constant changing

364
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,200
demands of working around the world.

365
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:12,379
Our journey in central cloud governance

366
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:14,570
and organization management really

367
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,940
began in 2018

368
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:19,298
when we adopted the ALZ or

369
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,719
the AWS landing zone.

370
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:22,109
At the time,

371
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,460
Lily was expanding rapidly into the cloud, as

372
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,658
I'm sure a lot of businesses were,

373
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,389
and we needed a way for our central

374
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:30,119
teams

375
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,619
to manage that expansion so that developers

376
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:34,739
and application teams could use those

377
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:35,580
services safely.

378
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:38,960
Uh, however, the very next year,

379
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:41,408
AWS released Control Tower,

380
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,149
and while we were very excited to see

381
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:46,349
a managed solution become available,

382
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,750
we had already invested very heavily

383
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,769
in Landing Zone.

384
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,229
At the time we were managing

385
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:53,250
somewhere between

386
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:55,739
40 and 500 AWS

387
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:57,090
accounts in our organization,

388
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:58,548
um,

389
00:13:58,908 --> 00:13:59,729
and offering

390
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:02,029
3 to 4 standard account patterns.

391
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,739
We had also tied some critical

392
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:06,320
foundational automation

393
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:07,918
to where,

394
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:08,879
um,

395
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:11,418
to the landing zone, so network configurations

396
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:12,320
and identity,

397
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,239
um,

398
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:15,099
identity management permissions.

399
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:17,940
Uh, and so we decided at that time

400
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,279
to continue to invest

401
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:21,899
in landing zone until control tower

402
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,979
could mature to meet some of our needs.

403
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:28,428
Uh, and that continued all the way up through 2023

404
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,899
with the final release of the AWS landing

405
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,139
zone. By that point we were,

406
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:35,798
uh, up to I think 6 standard account

407
00:14:35,798 --> 00:14:38,038
patterns, uh, numerous ad hoc

408
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:39,940
custom custom account patterns,

409
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,359
uh, and somewhere between 140 and

410
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,239
1500.

411
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:45,450
AWS accounts

412
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:47,950
as we continued to grow in

413
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,629
scale.

414
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,288
The initial advantages we found with

415
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:53,489
the ALZ service, the ability

416
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:54,369
to deploy

417
00:14:54,808 --> 00:14:56,849
configuration changes across all of

418
00:14:56,849 --> 00:14:58,090
our accounts at scale.

419
00:14:58,779 --> 00:14:59,808
Became a hindrance

420
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,500
The monolithic pipeline approach of ALZ

421
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,379
as we

422
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,219
continue to create and grow.

423
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:08,168
Uh, into the environment

424
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,298
started taking longer and longer to push changes.

425
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,739
By the time we hit 2023,

426
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:16,168
a single execution of the pipeline

427
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,168
would take us eight hours to complete,

428
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,928
and that's assuming that it finished,

429
00:15:21,408 --> 00:15:23,428
right? More often than not it started to

430
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:25,349
fail. Um,

431
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,379
and so

432
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,889
we found and watched the

433
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:31,729
central teams become a bottleneck

434
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,619
for innovation for the business.

435
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:37,479
That led us then to 2024

436
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,558
when we made a decision to

437
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,320
invest in and modernize

438
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:44,570
our governance solution.

439
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,009
So as we looked at our landscape.

440
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:53,129
Uh, and looked through and, um,

441
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:55,558
what we

442
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,320
wanted out of a new solution. We identified

443
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:00,200
a couple of critical requirements,

444
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:02,769
um. First, the

445
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:03,649
new solution.

446
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,379
Needed to be a managed solution,

447
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,320
uh, as much fun as it was managing

448
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,139
a bespoke custom

449
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
monolithic giant landing

450
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,479
zone, uh, we really didn't

451
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,359
want to deal with that operational overhead.

452
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:19,090
Uh, moving forward.

453
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,090
We needed to enhance and enhance and

454
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,109
increase agility

455
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:25,889
for both our central teams and for

456
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:26,849
our business teams.

457
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,960
And service areas

458
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:30,899
too often, as I mentioned,

459
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,899
we found ourselves being the bottleneck

460
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:35,000
to innovation.

461
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:38,229
We also needed to increase scalability.

462
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:40,200
We needed um

463
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:44,099
The business was not going to continue,

464
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,519
um. The business was

465
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,519
not going to stop expanding into

466
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,460
the cloud, and we needed to be able to handle

467
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:52,139
the increase.

468
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:56,940
As we need to be able to handle the business increasing

469
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,759
in that direction.

470
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,308
And we needed to simplify our governance.

471
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,729
I alluded earlier to some

472
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:05,729
critical foundational automation pieces

473
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,430
er that were tied to some of our early

474
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,789
landing zone architecture.

475
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,848
Uh, and that resulted in overly

476
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:14,269
complex SCPs,

477
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,328
um, and

478
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:19,239
really intricate conditional statements,

479
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,289
and I'll talk a little bit more, uh, about that, but

480
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,848
we needed to simplify that so that we could adopt

481
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:24,568
new features.

482
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,779
And that led us to control tower

483
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,598
with the Count factory for terraform.

484
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,019
And so in 2024 we worked with

485
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,019
AWS Professional Services to kick

486
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,078
off a project

487
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:38,910
to transition all

488
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:41,400
1500 accounts and the tens,

489
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,180
um, hundreds of thousands of resources

490
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,479
being managed by our foundational code

491
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:47,739
from

492
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:48,640
ALZ.

493
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,989
Into control tower and AFT.

494
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,309
Uh, we kicked off a six month

495
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:57,670
project. Um,

496
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,858
beginning at the end of 2024.

497
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,529
And going through the beginning of 2025,

498
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,250
we picked this time frame because there's lower

499
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,289
developer activity at Lily uh over the

500
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,529
end of the year time frame and we felt like

501
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:12,630
it would reduce the potential impact

502
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,769
to ongoing

503
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,368
initiatives and potential product releases.

504
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:19,689
But what that did mean

505
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:22,809
is that we needed to be able to do this

506
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,930
quickly so that we didn't impact anything

507
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,068
coming in the new year

508
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,789
and we needed to do this transparently.

509
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,250
We could not

510
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:33,150
have any downtime or potential for downtime,

511
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:36,209
uh, for any of our foundational and centralized services.

512
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,358
So what does this look like?

513
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:43,098
Um, the first thing we did isn't actually

514
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:45,299
on this slide, but we enrolled, uh,

515
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,459
we stood up control tower and then we enrolled

516
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,029
all of our accounts and OUs

517
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,789
into control tower.

518
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:53,420
Once we got that finished, or I guess rather

519
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,299
in parallel.

520
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:57,309
We went and decoupled our resources

521
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,828
from the old cloud formation stacks

522
00:18:59,828 --> 00:19:01,868
that landing zone uses to manage the

523
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:04,219
resources. We did this

524
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,680
by updating all

525
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,959
of our resource definitions

526
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:11,539
to use the deletion policy retain

527
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:14,140
statement. And what that

528
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,400
simply means for anyone who doesn't know is that

529
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,439
If you then or when you delete

530
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:21,779
the cloud formation stacks, the resources

531
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:23,509
remain behind, they don't get deleted,

532
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:26,078
so we went back through and there was a lot of

533
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:26,900
um.

534
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:30,469
Repeated executions of that monolithic pipeline,

535
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,449
so it took us a while, but we got

536
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:34,989
all of those resource definitions updated.

537
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:38,459
Then we went and developed terraform modules

538
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,838
to replace those resource definitions,

539
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,309
and this is where we did take some

540
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:43,900
opportunity

541
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:46,680
to simplify some of our automation and decouple

542
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,279
some things.

543
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:48,890
Um

544
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,098
Once we completed that,

545
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,640
Uh, and those two steps very much manual,

546
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:59,180
and once we completed that, we implemented

547
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,380
an automation. We've implemented, uh, we

548
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,459
designed and implemented some step functions

549
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:04,219
and lambdas

550
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,618
that did a couple of things for us and helped

551
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:08,680
accelerate this transition.

552
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:10,779
Uh, the first thing that it did,

553
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:13,209
uh, is it went, uh, across the entire

554
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:13,759
environment

555
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:16,299
and scraped all of

556
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,420
our deployed stack sets, our foundational

557
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,289
deploys deployed stack sets.

558
00:20:20,868 --> 00:20:23,348
Uh, pulled in all of the input

559
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,019
parameters and output values,

560
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:27,930
sent that over to Amazon Bedrock.

561
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:30,509
I think it was the Cloud 3 model at the time.

562
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:33,880
And used AI to generate

563
00:20:34,578 --> 00:20:36,108
terraform import commands.

564
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,400
Those commands were then manually validated

565
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,769
as they came back to make sure there weren't any unexpected

566
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:45,199
create or delete

567
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:46,420
statements in there.

568
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:49,689
And once we validated that, we, we

569
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:52,750
approved the continuation of the script execution,

570
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,189
uh, and the script executed those imports

571
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,309
for us and generated, uh,

572
00:20:57,368 --> 00:20:58,989
a series of state files.

573
00:21:01,578 --> 00:21:03,400
We then took those state files

574
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,680
and uploaded those to the account

575
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,880
factory for terraform code base

576
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:10,559
and registered each account

577
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:11,469
with AFT,

578
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,680
uh, and then the script executed those AFT

579
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,519
pipelines

580
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,949
and Alex will talk a little bit more about what

581
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:20,009
what that looks like in detail.

582
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:22,799
But once those pipelines were executed,

583
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:24,000
we got

584
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,719
a second or a 3rd piece of validation

585
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,219
that no resources were being destroyed

586
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,979
or changed or retained or um.

587
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:32,750
Or rebuilt

588
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:33,868
and

589
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,588
effectively it would it synchronized

590
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,289
AFT

591
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:39,989
with the resources deployed so at this

592
00:21:39,989 --> 00:21:41,989
point all resources are

593
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:44,348
now being managed through control tower

594
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:46,868
and through Account factory for terraform.

595
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:50,848
And then we went back and we deleted

596
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:53,250
those cloud formation stacks and decommissioned

597
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,650
the ALZ environment.

598
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:58,750
And by using this process you see

599
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,858
3 of the steps, the big chunk

600
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,568
of the of the process is

601
00:22:03,568 --> 00:22:05,049
automated by doing this.

602
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:06,608
We were able

603
00:22:06,949 --> 00:22:08,250
to move all

604
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:10,670
1500 AWS accounts, the tens

605
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,828
of thousands of resources associated

606
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:13,709
with those stacks.

607
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:16,019
From ALZ

608
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:18,479
and into control tower, uh,

609
00:22:18,489 --> 00:22:20,880
within 6 months, uh, 3 months

610
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,259
upfront development time

611
00:22:22,598 --> 00:22:25,039
and then the automated piece, uh, took

612
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:25,578
about

613
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,318
3 months to complete.

614
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:33,739
One other advantage I wanted to highlight

615
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:35,299
that we were able to um.

616
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:37,969
To do as part of this, which

617
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:40,189
has resulted in significant benefit for us.

618
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,689
When we initially built out

619
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:44,509
the ALZ.

620
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,959
As I mentioned, we tied a number of pieces of.

621
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:51,509
Core foundational

622
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:53,029
functionality to

623
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:55,818
specifically where an account sat

624
00:22:56,229 --> 00:22:57,789
within the org hierarchy.

625
00:22:58,229 --> 00:23:00,309
So if you were in a dev account you got

626
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:01,410
dev permissions

627
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,848
and a dev.

628
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:05,219
Networking set, uh a

629
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,578
dev set of networking configurations that

630
00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:08,180
you could use.

631
00:23:09,818 --> 00:23:11,118
And this resulted

632
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,459
in a very flat OU structure.

633
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:18,039
Made things very complicated, very difficult

634
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:20,640
to manage from a central perspective. We had redundant

635
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,559
SCPs.

636
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:24,719
Um, and very complex

637
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:25,959
SCP conditionals.

638
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:28,939
Uh, so not just complex

639
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:31,078
to manage, but complex to expand on.

640
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,059
When new features were released like RCP.

641
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,959
Or resource control policies, we

642
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,078
struggled to get those features implemented.

643
00:23:43,328 --> 00:23:45,420
By decoupling that automation from the

644
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,809
OU when we refactored our

645
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:49,890
resource definitions into terraform.

646
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,328
It allowed us to adopt a more

647
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:54,318
hierarchical

648
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,098
organization and OU structure.

649
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,750
We went with a workloads-based

650
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,509
architecture for a number of reasons.

651
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:02,828
Um,

652
00:24:03,189 --> 00:24:05,769
but what this did allow for is

653
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,630
significant reduction in the

654
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,449
number of redundant guard rails,

655
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:14,049
uh, oh, way, way simplified,

656
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,789
um, SCP configurations,

657
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,250
uh, conditionals became.

658
00:24:19,818 --> 00:24:22,039
Very straightforward in the few times in the few

659
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,539
instances where we still needed them.

660
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,108
Um,

661
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,818
and easier onboarding of new patterns.

662
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:30,430
Um

663
00:24:31,358 --> 00:24:32,759
Prior to this adoption.

664
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,009
We had uh central teams who maybe

665
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:36,910
wanted to

666
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,348
host an EKS cluster

667
00:24:39,348 --> 00:24:41,390
for the, for the global organization,

668
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,108
right? Prior

669
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:44,750
to this.

670
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,598
The

671
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:49,828
The upfront foundational changes

672
00:24:49,828 --> 00:24:52,108
that would be needed to allow EKS

673
00:24:52,108 --> 00:24:54,410
to run in the way that they need it to run

674
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,469
would take a minimum of 1 to

675
00:24:56,469 --> 00:24:58,189
2 months of development time.

676
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:00,769
And implementation,

677
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:03,289
executing that 8 hour long pipeline,

678
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,338
adjusting,

679
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,269
executing again, promoting the production.

680
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,759
Executing again, testing,

681
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,750
um. With

682
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,848
this change we are now able

683
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,348
to set up a new OU

684
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:19,289
for a workload that is non-standard

685
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,029
and execute the and apply

686
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:23,818
any required SCP changes

687
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:27,009
within the space of a sprint, so 2 weeks,

688
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,348
so a significant reduction.

689
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:32,559
In implementation time from the central

690
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,910
teams. And

691
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,910
so what does this, what does this look like from an

692
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,189
outcomes perspective?

693
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:41,750
75% reduction in manual

694
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,868
effort, 300%

695
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:45,469
increase in code push frequency.

696
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,680
Faster creation of OUs

697
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:52,239
and feature delivery, like I said, from 2 months

698
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,739
down to 2 weeks.

699
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,959
Security and configuration updates can

700
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:59,009
now be deployed across all accounts in under

701
00:25:59,009 --> 00:25:59,930
5 hours.

702
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:03,170
And it's nice to see the percentages up here, but what

703
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,209
this looks like

704
00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:06,309
in reality for Lily

705
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,969
is we were able, so we finished this

706
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:10,108
project in

707
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,660
Q1 of 2025,

708
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,130
that next quarter before we had

709
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,209
really been able to continue

710
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,029
to invest and build out

711
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:21,920
our control tower and AFT presence,

712
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:23,328
we saw.

713
00:26:23,969 --> 00:26:25,789
And we're able to push more.

714
00:26:26,578 --> 00:26:28,279
Configuration changes

715
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:30,818
in that quarter in Q2 than we were

716
00:26:30,818 --> 00:26:32,838
able to push in the entirety of the previous

717
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:33,439
year,

718
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:34,779
2024.

719
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:37,799
And so we no longer

720
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:40,479
are a blocker to innovation for our business

721
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:43,009
teams. Because

722
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:46,299
As much as I can point to these numbers

723
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:51,088
up here. Lily's

724
00:26:51,088 --> 00:26:53,289
journey to modern cloud governance is

725
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:53,828
more.

726
00:26:54,598 --> 00:26:56,939
Is about more than just technology.

727
00:26:57,328 --> 00:26:59,890
It's about empowering our teams and accelerating

728
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:00,709
innovation,

729
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:03,209
and ensuring that our infrastructure can

730
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:05,250
keep pace with our mission to improve

731
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,729
lives around the world.

732
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:09,598
And now I'll welcome Alex to the stage

733
00:27:09,598 --> 00:27:11,739
to talk a little bit more about control tower.

734
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:13,900
Thank you.

735
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:17,559
Good afternoon everybody.

736
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,509
A quick question for everyone.

737
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:22,348
How many of you heard about our controls only

738
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:23,689
experience that launched last week?

739
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,390
See this is like the common thing I've heard

740
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,588
all week. uh, I did a little bit of booth duty

741
00:27:29,588 --> 00:27:31,170
on the expo floor the other day

742
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:33,509
and everyone kept coming up to me like, hey, I wanna be able to

743
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:35,549
use landing zones and I wanna be or I wanna be able

744
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:36,969
to just use managed controls, but.

745
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:39,939
I don't wanna just set up landing zones. We'll, we're gonna

746
00:27:39,939 --> 00:27:41,150
get into that a little bit today.

747
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,618
So bringing it all together first

748
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:45,660
with AWS control tower for those that are a little

749
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,699
unfamiliar, uh, we orchestrate

750
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,279
a lot of services on your behalf.

751
00:27:49,578 --> 00:27:51,779
Uh, this allows you to really focus on

752
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:52,348
the,

753
00:27:52,618 --> 00:27:53,199
uh,

754
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:56,118
security and compliance needs of your organization.

755
00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:58,578
You can get started in under 30 minutes or, or

756
00:27:58,578 --> 00:28:00,578
less, uh, with AWS control

757
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,578
tower. Well, let's walk through a little bit

758
00:28:02,578 --> 00:28:03,719
of what we set up for you.

759
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:06,338
So first, when you set up control tower, you're gonna

760
00:28:06,338 --> 00:28:07,279
get two accounts.

761
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,809
Uh, you're going to get a log archive account and you're going

762
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:10,969
to get an auditing account.

763
00:28:11,368 --> 00:28:13,529
Both of these accounts help meet your logging

764
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:15,410
in requirement needs within your organization.

765
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
And then next we're gonna set up two OUs for you.

766
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,519
Now you have the ability to make the sandbox

767
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,818
OU optional, but,

768
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,338
uh, what is not optional is the security

769
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:26,348
OU, which comes preconfigured with two

770
00:28:26,348 --> 00:28:27,199
additional accounts.

771
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:29,519
One has your AWS backup vaults in it,

772
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,759
and the other one's a delegated administrator account where

773
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,618
you can manage your AWS backup service.

774
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:37,160
And then last Account factory lives within

775
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,880
control tower.

776
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:40,338
Now Account factory allows you to provision

777
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:42,729
specific types of um uh AWS

778
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:43,358
accounts

779
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,759
uh to your organization

780
00:28:45,328 --> 00:28:47,920
using account baseline resources that you've

781
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,219
perused from the managed controls catalog and uh

782
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:51,358
and applied to your organization.

783
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
There's 3 additional value adds that

784
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,519
I wanna call out really quickly for

785
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,180
control tower.

786
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,469
So number 1,

787
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:01,068
you do get AWS identity, uh,

788
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:03,239
identity Center federated

789
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:04,500
access to your applications.

790
00:29:05,868 --> 00:29:07,989
Number 2, we're gonna enable AWS

791
00:29:07,989 --> 00:29:08,750
config

792
00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:11,108
and AWS cloud shell, and we're gonna write

793
00:29:11,108 --> 00:29:11,719
those

794
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:14,430
both to a centralized S3

795
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,549
bucket that's located in your log archive

796
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:18,650
account. And then last, any

797
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,689
of those managed controls that you've

798
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:22,709
uh turned on for your landing zone,

799
00:29:23,088 --> 00:29:25,098
uh will be backed by security hub,

800
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,309
cloud trail, and cloud formation,

801
00:29:27,568 --> 00:29:29,930
and that ensures that any newly provisioned

802
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,969
accounts do meet those compliance standards that you've

803
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:32,868
set in place already.

804
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,469
So we talked a little bit about

805
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:37,088
Account factory

806
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,680
in the previous slide, and I do want to talk a

807
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,729
little bit more in depth about that, so.

808
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:44,799
Uh, Account Factory exists to help

809
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,838
provision those AWS accounts for you with

810
00:29:46,838 --> 00:29:49,239
those preconfigured either security baseline

811
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:51,318
resources or maybe it's some of those managed controls that

812
00:29:51,318 --> 00:29:52,299
you put in place,

813
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
uh, but we also just released a new feature when

814
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,979
it comes to, um,

815
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,318
Account factory

816
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,750
that allows you to, uh, Account

817
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,039
Factory to live with completely within AWS

818
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,180
control tower using the AWS

819
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,670
organization's account primitives,

820
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:08,420
and it no longer requires the previous required,

821
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,180
uh, service catalog integration.

822
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:11,719
So how does this look today?

823
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:14,348
You're gonna go ahead and just navigate directly

824
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:17,390
to your AWS management console for

825
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,430
organizations and create your account

826
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,789
there, or you can use the programmatic call

827
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:23,848
create account API from AWS

828
00:30:23,848 --> 00:30:26,150
organizations. Once the account has been provisioned,

829
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:28,390
all you're gonna do is go ahead and move that OU

830
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:31,150
or move that account to the control tower OU

831
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:33,430
and then once it's placed in that OU.

832
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:36,219
Uh, we'll apply any of those managed

833
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:38,618
controls that you selected from the control catalog. We'll

834
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:40,979
also put any of those preconfigured services

835
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:43,180
there, uh, so cloud trail, config,

836
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,858
backup, anything along those lines.

837
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:49,209
So now we're gonna walk a little bit through Account

838
00:30:49,209 --> 00:30:51,259
factory for terraform and what that kind

839
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:53,328
of looks like. So uh right hand of the

840
00:30:53,328 --> 00:30:54,799
screen, of course, one of the

841
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,660
very specific things that you're gonna need is you're gonna need

842
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,539
control tower deployed.

843
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:01,400
Uh, next, after that you're gonna set up an

844
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,000
account factory administration account.

845
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:05,199
This is specifically just for account factory.

846
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:07,348
Uh,

847
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,009
going back to the right hand side, I just want to point out

848
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:12,088
here that we did just mention that

849
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:14,410
service catalog is no longer required, but for the purposes

850
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,199
of this discussion,

851
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:16,009
we're here.

852
00:31:17,078 --> 00:31:19,078
And the big call out here is like any

853
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:21,118
of your account vending or account orchestration

854
00:31:21,118 --> 00:31:22,699
needs are gonna occur in that block.

855
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:26,098
So this is a GitOps driven model, so

856
00:31:26,098 --> 00:31:28,469
um. Essentially a user

857
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,519
will create an account request file

858
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:33,489
within the account factory configuration repository

859
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:36,209
and commit it via get Push into the repo.

860
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,848
In this scenario we are using AWS Code

861
00:31:38,848 --> 00:31:40,868
commit, but we do support any uh

862
00:31:40,868 --> 00:31:42,170
code star connection request.

863
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:46,969
Next, once you've, uh, pushed the

864
00:31:46,969 --> 00:31:49,078
pushed that change, uh, it'll activate your code

865
00:31:49,078 --> 00:31:51,170
pipeline and write those changes to

866
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,519
Amazon Dynamo DB.

867
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:55,118
This gives you a traceability plan for any of those

868
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:55,660
changes.

869
00:31:56,739 --> 00:31:58,779
Next, Account Factory is gonna go ahead and

870
00:31:58,779 --> 00:31:59,400
communicate

871
00:31:59,979 --> 00:32:02,088
with AWB's control tower to figure out

872
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:04,140
does this account need to be updated or

873
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,739
do I need to provision a new account?

874
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,098
If yes, it'll go directly to control tower to

875
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:10,259
make those vending requests and vend

876
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:12,578
your account as specific. If it doesn't

877
00:32:12,578 --> 00:32:14,660
need to do that, it's gonna go straight to applying

878
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,199
some of those customizations

879
00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:18,858
that you've already defined. So

880
00:32:18,858 --> 00:32:20,858
maybe some of those networking configurations that you want

881
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:22,180
specific to your organization.

882
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:24,818
Maybe it's some security guard rails that you set up in the very

883
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,670
beginning. All of that occurs there

884
00:32:27,348 --> 00:32:29,348
And then last, Account factory

885
00:32:29,348 --> 00:32:31,769
applies defined account level specific

886
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:33,868
or global customizations using

887
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:34,390
terraform.

888
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,799
Uh, when we deploy these configurations

889
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,910
within the account, whether it's newly provisioned

890
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,959
or updated, the account then meets all of

891
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,118
your specific compliance needs or security

892
00:32:44,118 --> 00:32:45,939
needs that you're setting forth as an organization.

893
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,959
So now that you've heard about Account

894
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:51,519
Factory,

895
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,739
uh, you've heard a little bit about Terraform,

896
00:32:54,078 --> 00:32:54,858
how it's technically

897
00:32:55,199 --> 00:32:56,029
executed,

898
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:58,439
how Eli Lilly is using it. Why should

899
00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,118
you guys use it?

900
00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:00,670
So first,

901
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,029
Account Factory customizes new and

902
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:03,608
existing

903
00:33:04,118 --> 00:33:05,920
accounts through a pipeline-based workflow.

904
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,979
This meets the requirements of your

905
00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:11,439
organization to meet scalability or agility needs,

906
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,680
uh, as it automates the entire workflow on

907
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,500
your behalf.

908
00:33:14,838 --> 00:33:17,239
And for customers using Terraform, it fulfills

909
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:19,479
the gap of your uh infrastructure

910
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:21,000
as code as a gap.

911
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,910
Number 2,

912
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:25,479
deployment and configuration artifacts are

913
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:27,439
stored in version control repositories.

914
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:29,769
This this is important because it ensures that

915
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:31,789
you're working up the most up to-date code

916
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,029
and it gives you traceability of that code.

917
00:33:34,449 --> 00:33:36,568
I have to do a rollback. Well, good thing I already have

918
00:33:36,568 --> 00:33:38,390
this stored in, in a stored repository.

919
00:33:39,568 --> 00:33:41,439
Third, we support published modules

920
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:43,858
from the terraform registry and custom

921
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:44,549
modules.

922
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,549
This gives customers a starting point,

923
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,180
but it also enables you to fully customize the

924
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,539
environment to what you need. You need to tailor it specific

925
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:53,578
to what your requirements are, whether

926
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:55,618
you're PCI needs, whether

927
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:57,858
you're HIPAA compliant, or any of these other specific

928
00:33:57,858 --> 00:33:59,459
compliance frameworks that you're looking for.

929
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,140
And then last, for our really security minded folks,

930
00:34:02,219 --> 00:34:03,818
we support delegated administration.

931
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,670
A lot of customers come to us and say, hey, I

932
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,789
don't wanna log into the management account every day to

933
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:10,789
do specific actions. What can you do to help

934
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:11,688
me here? Well,

935
00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:14,309
we have still we have delegated admin for that.

936
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,018
Next I wanna talk a little about

937
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,298
controls

938
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:21,039
and what that means.

939
00:34:21,387 --> 00:34:23,677
So recently we've heard a lot

940
00:34:23,677 --> 00:34:25,518
about shifting to the left.

941
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:27,998
Has anyone ever heard the term shifting to your left

942
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:29,018
in any of your

943
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:31,239
all hands meetings, any security meetings?

944
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:33,137
See a couple of hands in the crowd? Awesome.

945
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:35,989
So we're shifting left from just detective

946
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:38,018
controls, right? Contractive controls were

947
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:40,958
designed to alert you after an event has

948
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:41,858
already occurred.

949
00:34:42,318 --> 00:34:43,579
We're shifting to the left.

950
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,369
With proactive controls,

951
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,398
controls that are designed to prevent

952
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,179
resource mutation from occurring.

953
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:52,028
And going even further, we're shifting farther to

954
00:34:52,028 --> 00:34:54,088
the left with preventative controls.

955
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,579
Controls that are there to ensure that

956
00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:58,789
no bad code is ever shipped to your production

957
00:34:58,789 --> 00:34:59,509
environments.

958
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,059
So what does this look like in the controls catalog?

959
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:05,510
So. The controls catalog is

960
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,539
a single source of truth for AWS

961
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,550
managed controls, and soon we're gonna

962
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,789
have all of the AWS managed controls

963
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:13,878
here. With our recent launch with

964
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,909
the controls only experience, now you can

965
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:17,688
go directly to the controls catalog

966
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,369
without having to set up that landing zone requisite.

967
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,688
So I can go here,

968
00:35:21,978 --> 00:35:24,429
peruse whatever controls I need, any metadata,

969
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,668
any of those corresponding compliance frameworks,

970
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:28,849
and apply those controls really easily.

971
00:35:29,188 --> 00:35:31,228
If you need detective controls, you're gonna go

972
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:33,739
ahead. And activate AWS config

973
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,668
at an account level, at an OU level,

974
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:36,728
organization wide.

975
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,958
You want proactive or preventative controls,

976
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:41,280
all you're gonna do is enable trusted

977
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,320
access and choose what regions you wanna operate in as

978
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,458
well. It's never been easier

979
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,519
to activate some of these managed controls for your

980
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:49,599
environments than today, and I can't harp on

981
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,639
that enough just because I've heard so

982
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:53,639
much from customers this week saying like we definitely just

983
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:55,800
wanna like use controls for our environments.

984
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,340
We have such a hard time

985
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,878
getting through some of our auditing pieces or like

986
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:00,769
looking at the.

987
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,219
These compliance pieces, well, I

988
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:05,878
very much urge everyone after this call, go

989
00:36:05,878 --> 00:36:08,179
and tell your teams, go check out the manage controls.

990
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,610
So now that we've talked about a little bit

991
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,010
about Account factory, uh, how it customizes

992
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,128
your accounts, uh, the value of

993
00:36:16,128 --> 00:36:18,208
managed controls as well, how do we bring

994
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,070
them together?

995
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,648
You heard Dustin talk about how they migrated

996
00:36:21,648 --> 00:36:23,648
to Control Tower and established their

997
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,409
account factory pipeline infrastructure.

998
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,340
Figuring out how to protect your workloads with

999
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,708
managed controls is next,

1000
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:32,228
so you can deploy those managed controls using

1001
00:36:32,228 --> 00:36:34,378
terraform within your uh account factory

1002
00:36:34,378 --> 00:36:35,309
pipelines

1003
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:37,260
to keep resource deployments

1004
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:38,760
within a single approach.

1005
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:40,478
How is this beneficial to us?

1006
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:41,918
It's simple to manage.

1007
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:45,409
You're essentially baking everything into a single pipeline,

1008
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,590
and that reduces your costs, your operational

1009
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,300
costs,

1010
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,289
but it does come back with some

1011
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:51,389
drawbacks.

1012
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:54,340
So you're going to have your account factory

1013
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,340
administrator is going to have permanent

1014
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,418
elevated permissions.

1015
00:36:58,478 --> 00:37:00,688
And secondly, you are taking dependency risk

1016
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:02,829
by relying on a single account factory

1017
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:04,090
pipeline in that scenario.

1018
00:37:05,378 --> 00:37:06,728
So how does it look again?

1019
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:09,309
I'm gonna take us back to the architecture slide that I showed

1020
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:10,289
in the very beginning.

1021
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,840
So any of those, um,

1022
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,510
deployed controls within your account factory pipeline

1023
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,250
will essentially be baked in the uh

1024
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:20,349
AWS code build and ADWS step functions piece

1025
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:22,639
where you're applying the customizations directly.

1026
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,159
But if you wanna use terraform,

1027
00:37:25,668 --> 00:37:27,349
everything is gonna occur in that green box there.

1028
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:30,510
It ensures that deployments are

1029
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,628
done through a single approach and that you can keep track

1030
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:33,809
of where anything is.

1031
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:38,369
And I'm gonna bring Tim back up to

1032
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:40,769
talk about our key takeaways. Thanks everyone.

1033
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:46,349
Thank you, uh, Alex, and thank you Dustin.

1034
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:48,829
Um, one of my favorite things about a

1035
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:50,849
customer led, uh,

1036
00:37:51,148 --> 00:37:52,409
session like this

1037
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:54,989
is the impact on the business so we talked

1038
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:57,199
about enabling organizations

1039
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,349
through improving governance and becoming

1040
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:01,469
more modern and in, in the case of

1041
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:04,030
Lilly it's a really meaningful outcome

1042
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,429
because that is enabling them really.

1043
00:38:06,898 --> 00:38:08,898
Uh, indirectly to help create

1044
00:38:08,898 --> 00:38:10,938
better products for their customers, which is a very

1045
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:12,978
meaningful output. So we like to connect these

1046
00:38:12,978 --> 00:38:15,458
technical things that we're talking about to real world,

1047
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,840
uh, and that's a real meaningful one. So

1048
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:20,260
we do wanna hit on three kind of technical

1049
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,300
takeaways again. Our goal here is always that

1050
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,378
somebody, you'll come away with something,

1051
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:26,898
uh, that either reinforces what you've done

1052
00:38:26,898 --> 00:38:28,938
or inspires you to look into something else that

1053
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:29,800
can help you

1054
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,418
advance, uh, your operations and

1055
00:38:32,418 --> 00:38:33,398
advance your organization.

1056
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:35,699
So we'll touch on 3 takeaways. The

1057
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:36,280
first one.

1058
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:37,458
Is

1059
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,139
being able to leverage this governance

1060
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:41,079
foundation

1061
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:43,458
to enable these organizational

1062
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,739
objectives we didn't touch much on resilience

1063
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:47,039
today, but it ties in as well,

1064
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,039
but enabling agility,

1065
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,418
uh, and scale and moving

1066
00:38:51,418 --> 00:38:53,739
faster is one of the the core

1067
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:55,780
objectives here and we hope you pick something up

1068
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,938
from from this session that could drive

1069
00:38:57,938 --> 00:38:59,378
that for your organization.

1070
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,050
Uh, the next one is.

1071
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:04,429
Being being able to simplify

1072
00:39:04,648 --> 00:39:07,250
uh the the the the governance

1073
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:07,909
operation through

1074
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,369
uh services like uh Count factory

1075
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:11,090
for Terraform,

1076
00:39:11,409 --> 00:39:13,590
uh, being able to leverage something that was built

1077
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,019
to drive automation and standardization

1078
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:18,329
is a way for you to simplify

1079
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:20,949
your operation and, and provide consistency,

1080
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:23,208
uh, and, and, and compliance.

1081
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,938
The 3rd

1082
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:26,099
Is

1083
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,878
managed right being able to leverage

1084
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:31,619
managed services and in and in particular

1085
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,699
what Alex mentioned about managed

1086
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:35,860
controls is super super

1087
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,079
important. And I, and I'll add to that

1088
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,619
that you know, as I mentioned earlier, I'm constantly

1089
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,719
talking to customers and working with our service

1090
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,849
teams. We're always looking

1091
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,409
to add more to our controls library,

1092
00:39:47,648 --> 00:39:49,349
right? The things that you need

1093
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:52,199
to drive consistency, compliance,

1094
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,500
meeting your costs,

1095
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:56,188
security, uh, operational

1096
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,610
and compliance standards, we, we

1097
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,389
continue to add to our repo

1098
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:02,849
of rules that again are managed

1099
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:05,010
for you, uh, behind the scenes, so.

1100
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,898
Uh, hopefully those

1101
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:09,559
some of that resonated and you could take some things

1102
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:11,679
away, uh, and, and work on that

1103
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:13,139
following up with your account teams.

1104
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,639
We of course would love to talk to you

1105
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:18,000
afterward. We'll, we, we'll be kind of lingering

1106
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,978
around and happy to, to take some questions,

1107
00:40:20,478 --> 00:40:22,530
uh, and. And connect with us, uh,

1108
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:23,159
afterward

1109
00:40:23,418 --> 00:40:25,860
and then last but not least, um, please

1110
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,898
make sure to go into the

1111
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:30,260
uh app and complete the survey

1112
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,860
uh that's our request of you.

1113
