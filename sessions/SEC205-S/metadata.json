  "abstract": "Under the shared responsibility model, you are responsible for security and protection of your cloud data – and that requires developing and maintaining a mature cyber resilience capability for your workloads. In this session, Pearl River Community College will share their experiences. We'll also cover how Cohesity’s AI-powered platform extends AWS-native protections to protect critical workloads, automate policy enforcement, and reduce recovery times. You’ll learn how to isolate backups from production accounts, detect attacks, and orchestrate near‑instant recovery across regions and clouds. Walk away with a blueprint for achieving resilience at a lower TCO than “backup‑only” approaches. This presentation is brought to you by Cohesity, an AWS Partner.",
