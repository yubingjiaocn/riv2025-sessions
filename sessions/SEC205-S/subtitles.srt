1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,270
- Well, welcome to AWS re:Invent, day one.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,863
Very excited to be here with all of you.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,960
Today, our topic revolves around

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,073
cloud resiliency with
shared responsibility.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,140
All of you have data that you care for

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,510
within your enterprises.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,140
And ensuring that that data is resilient

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,030
is critical to being
prepared for disasters,

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,753
cyber attacks, and even accidental,

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,320
non-intentional malicious attacks

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,000
that might even happen
from your end users.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,900
My name is Teresa Miller.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,720
I'm the Senior Director of
Technical Marketing at Cohesity.

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,770
And I'm joined by my
very special guest here,

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,960
Kevin, who is one of our customers.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,490
Can you introduce yourself?

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,360
- Yes, ma'am.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,040
Hey, everyone, I'm Kevin Lomax.

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,070
I'm the IT Director at Pearl
River Community College.

20
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,900
I've been there for six years.

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,570
Prior to that, I was in the
United States Army for 20 years

22
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,480
where I retired and took on a job

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,610
at the University of Southern Mississippi.

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,140
And then my path has led me to
Pearl River Community College

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,520
and I've enjoyed every second
there over the last six years.

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,870
And welcome to the session.

27
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,300
- So excited to have you here.

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,920
Let's go ahead and break
down the agenda though.

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,690
We'll get a lot of time with Kevin though,

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,490
thankfully, appreciate your time.

31
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,450
- Absolutely.

32
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,750
- So our session today, we'll be together

33
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,320
for probably the next
45 minutes to an hour

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,650
and it's broken into four sections.

35
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,150
So we're gonna start out

36
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,090
by talking about some of the challenges

37
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,500
that come from using just
native backup options

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,500
that come like with AWS, for example.

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,340
But also we're gonna look
at the industry perspective

40
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,220
on this and what our
customers are telling us

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,480
they're being faced with that require them

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,340
to dive a little bit further

43
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,820
into shared responsibility
amongst other things.

44
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,170
From there, we're gonna sit down

45
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,210
for probably a good 20 to 30 minutes

46
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,320
and we're gonna hear firsthand

47
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,670
what's keeping you up at night

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,410
and how you're solving
some of those problems

49
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,183
so that you can all learn from
Kevin and his experiences.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,250
And then we'll spend the
last 12 minutes or so today

51
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,690
on these last two points.

52
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,000
We'll talk about how you
can improve your resilience

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,400
with Cohesity and I'm
gonna show you a demo

54
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,240
of a solution that we call Cloud Vaulting

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,770
that can really help with ensuring

56
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,683
you have the right protection in place.

57
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,150
So with that, there's a
couple different things.

58
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,610
Let's start with those challenges.

59
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,480
So many of you are likely using AWS

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,880
or you're here doing some discovery

61
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,880
around which next
workload you might deploy

62
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,640
or even just getting started.

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,640
So when it comes to backing
up your AWS workloads,

64
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,830
you get native protection capabilities

65
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,860
that oftentimes are
coming with your tenant.

66
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,950
But, and I want you to
use those by the way,

67
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,530
but they're only gonna get you so far.

68
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,440
So as we talk about things today,

69
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,140
I want you to try to
find those limitations

70
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,520
and how much more you
could be doing beyond that

71
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,100
with a third party solution.

72
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,700
The other thing that I
think is really important

73
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,700
revolves around security
considerations, data sovereignty.

74
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,600
So if you're using those
native options from AWS,

75
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
they're also gonna be protected on AWS.

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,620
And so you may have
requirements that lead you

77
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,360
to using different media, different clouds

78
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,830
to ensure that you're
following your guidance

79
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,270
that your enterprise needs

80
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,833
and you're also like
GDPR or SOX, et cetera.

81
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,270
From an industry perspective,

82
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:20,270
when it comes to the enterprise
and industry challenges,

83
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,130
shared responsibility is key.

84
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,380
I recently had the opportunity

85
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,560
to interview somebody from AWS.

86
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,770
And I think one of the things
that stuck with me the most

87
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,100
during that conversation is so simple,

88
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,450
but I think it's so important

89
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,450
is that even if your
data's in their cloud,

90
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,540
you are responsible for
protecting your data.

91
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,000
So you're responsible
for the credentialing

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,040
and securing and preventing folks

93
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,550
or malicious attackers
from getting at your data.

94
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,670
And you are also responsible
for recovering it.

95
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,163
So we'll unpack that more today.

96
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,140
Many of you in terms of
outgrowing your solutions,

97
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,853
you may have something else.

98
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,020
You're gonna find that
because for example,

99
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,790
let's take a cyber attack.

100
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,790
Cyber attacks have so many
different unknowns to them.

101
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,790
You have no way of knowing
how that's going to unfold.

102
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,850
Something extremely basic
is not gonna get you to,

103
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,710
for example, clean room recovery

104
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,580
or being able to do forensic analysis

105
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,020
or allowing for the right
levels of replication.

106
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,350
So you may outgrow it for
a wide variety of reasons.

107
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,990
Some of those could be the case.

108
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,640
Cloud costs, we all wanna
keep that pocketbook at bay.

109
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,670
We don't wanna over budget or over commit.

110
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,663
So having a strategy
for this will also help.

111
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,020
And then the last piece I wanna call out

112
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,440
is the compliance and data sovereignty.

113
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,680
I know I personally previously had worked

114
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,720
at a company that was global.

115
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,990
So a lot of the cloud
housing was happening

116
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,780
between the United States and Europe.

117
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,760
And we really had to be careful

118
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,190
about how we were managing that data,

119
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,460
preventing the wrong eyes from seeing it.

120
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,040
Even if it was within the company,

121
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,813
we had to keep it segregated.

122
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,870
All right, so now that we've talked about

123
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,670
some of the industry challenges,

124
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,350
again, these are things our customers

125
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,240
are telling us as well.

126
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,240
We're gonna sit down with
Kevin and hear firsthand

127
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,680
what's top of mind for you.

128
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,150
- [Kevin] Absolutely.

129
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,030
- So to get things started,

130
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,140
let's just talk a little bit
more about your background

131
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,140
a little bit deeper and tell
us what your company is doing.

132
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,260
- So in the state of Mississippi,

133
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,990
where I work at Pearl
River Community College,

134
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,050
I'm on the cybersecurity
initiative for the state.

135
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,500
And the trends that we see
are obviously every day,

136
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,060
these ransomware guys are getting smarter,

137
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,770
they're getting bigger,
they're getting better.

138
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,410
And they're just utilizing
the weaknesses that we have.

139
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,700
So my background is
obviously cybersecurity

140
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,180
and working through the
security parameters,

141
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,800
just kind of understanding more of that

142
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,800
and how we can push to, like
you said, harden our postures.

143
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,270
And even though the data is in the cloud,

144
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,060
we have to make sure that
we continue to secure that.

145
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,020
- Yeah.

146
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,430
I think it's interesting you said

147
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,670
how they're trying to leverage
the weaknesses you have.

148
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,910
So I think it's a good
thing to have that knowing

149
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,530
like you're trying to harden,

150
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,040
but we can't always stay on
the other side of that, right?

151
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,540
So it's an ongoing thing
as what that implied to me.

152
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,373
- Oh, it is.

153
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:42,090
And they're using better,

154
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,530
we've talked about this before as well,

155
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,970
they've used different parameters now,

156
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,220
they're leveraging social media.

157
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,960
They know how to headline
emails, QR coding,

158
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,330
things like that to get to
reach out to the customer

159
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,580
or to the end users to
know how to grab you

160
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,170
and make you wanna click that link.

161
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,170
And once you click that
link, they've got you.

162
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,180
And then they get in your network

163
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,400
and they just continue to
propagate their way around there.

164
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,233
- Yeah.

165
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:08,190
And that's not just
desktops, that's servers,

166
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,900
that's cloud infrastructure.

167
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,070
It doesn't matter.
- Every bit of it.

168
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,903
- Yeah.

169
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,703
All right.

170
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:16,170
So stepping back just a moment,

171
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,900
we'll get into some of
that cyber resilience stuff

172
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,830
a little bit further,

173
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,830
but how long have you
been a Cohesity customer?

174
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,080
And then why did you
choose Cohesity and AWS?

175
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,380
- So Pearl River's been
a Cohesity customer

176
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,753
since July of 2022.

177
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,860
We unfortunately had a cyber event

178
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,750
and we had to step back and figure out

179
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,500
how do we progress from this?

180
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,280
And we did proof of concepts
for many different vendors.

181
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,660
And I think probably about day one,

182
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,700
five hours into our proof of concept,

183
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,270
we realized Cohesity was the
path that we wanted to go.

184
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,100
Just because we had to, after
a cyber event, they just wait.

185
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,190
They wait, see if you're gonna
patch your vulnerabilities

186
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,930
and they'll try to hit you again.

187
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,810
So we had to make sure
the college understood

188
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,160
and knew that we were gonna provide them

189
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,470
some type of solution that we knew

190
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,570
we could get our data
back and it was safe.

191
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,050
Cohesity provides that
immutability, the air gap,

192
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,120
and most importantly,
one of the big things

193
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,330
touching back on your
security, the quorum.

194
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,940
The quorum is such a
huge piece with Cohesity

195
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,360
knowing you have to have
multiple people that sign off

196
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,360
that allow you to be
able to get to your data

197
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,133
and knowing it's safe.

198
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,160
- What about the AWS side of that?

199
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,840
What made you go with AWS?

200
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,800
- So AWS, knowing that their
data centers are worldwide,

201
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,930
knowing Cohesity's leveraging that data,

202
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,940
spreading it across
there, having the backups.

203
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,810
And AWS is one of the leaders
in the market, obviously.

204
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,770
So putting our stuff in AWS
and making sure, once again,

205
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,200
we know we can retrieve it
and back it up and it's secure

206
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,100
was one of the leading forces in that.

207
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,520
- Nice.

208
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,280
I'm gonna just let people
internalize that a little bit

209
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,050
'cause I think there's
more that's gonna come out

210
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,260
when we get into some
of the actual strategy

211
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,033
and some of the infrastructure
as we keep talking.

212
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,800
So let's transition
then to your experience

213
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,690
around some of the challenges
that companies are facing

214
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,160
as it relates to cyber resilience.

215
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,450
I know you touched on it a little bit,

216
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,940
but I think we can go deeper, right?

217
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,003
- So I'm sure like many
other companies, colleges,

218
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,930
businesses, IT departments are small.

219
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,450
So we don't have the
personnel at Pearl River.

220
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,980
We're a one-stop shop.

221
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,150
We cover everything from
networking, wireless, software,

222
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,540
student information, student
information and data.

223
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,490
We have to make sure
that's safe, it's secure,

224
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,930
it's recoverable.

225
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,860
And that's some of the big
pieces to it, end users.

226
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,250
Like I said before, end
users, unfortunately,

227
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,080
are your biggest vulnerability.

228
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,750
And these bad actors, they don't sleep.

229
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,180
They know how to get
into your environment.

230
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,080
They know how to use them end users.

231
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,300
They know how to figure out
ways to leverage certain pieces.

232
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,970
Once they get in, they move back and forth

233
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,580
and they wanna get as much as they can,

234
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,100
as quick as they can, get out of there

235
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,363
and then try and hold you for that ransom.

236
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,280
- You said you went
through a ransomware event,

237
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,860
expanding on the cyber resilience

238
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,420
and being prepared for that.

239
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,540
I'm just curious, how did you know

240
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,230
that your backups were
clean to recover from?

241
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,063
- We didn't.

242
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,510
We didn't know, they
actually got into our backups

243
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,343
and wiped them.

244
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,720
Fortunately, being in
security, we had a known good,

245
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,120
three days, we'd lost three days of data.

246
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,970
We had one on a server
that we just happened

247
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,260
to do snapshots and backups

248
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,180
and we unplugged it from the network.

249
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,420
And it was luck, it was pure luck.

250
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,100
And that's why at that point in time,

251
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,500
we did not have cloud backups.

252
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,690
So we knew that was a huge key

253
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,020
and we do all of our backups now into,

254
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,160
we have on-prem using Data Protect

255
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,870
and then we also back
it up into Fort Knox.

256
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,200
So, and that's the key
is making sure on-prem

257
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,230
is great for rapid recovery,

258
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,290
if there's no anomalies in your
data and you can get to it.

259
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,450
But having that Fort Knox piece,

260
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,580
that's what'll help you sleep at night

261
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,040
because everybody knows you got,

262
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,260
it's not a, I've said
this a million times,

263
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,510
it's not a matter of if
you're gonna get hit,

264
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,950
it's a matter of when.

265
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,520
And the truth behind that is,
can you recover from that?

266
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,563
And that's the key to all of this.

267
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,420
- So what are some ways
you further increased

268
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,010
cyber resilience with
your critical workloads?

269
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,930
- So one of the main takeaways,

270
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,420
we initially did it through Cisco DNA,

271
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,460
Cisco and Cohesity, thank goodness,

272
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,040
are partners, we're a huge Cisco shop.

273
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Cisco has now advanced into Cisco XDR.

274
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,730
And one of the things
that we made sure to do

275
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,690
was integrate that into
our Cohesity platform.

276
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,750
And like I said before,
we're a small IT shop.

277
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,360
So I don't have the personnel to sit there

278
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,950
and monitor all these systems

279
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,510
and all the things that go on every day.

280
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,260
Well, with Cisco XDR, we
integrated with Cohesity.

281
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,300
If it sees any of those anomalies,

282
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,300
any of your data that has
changed any type of patterns,

283
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,110
Cisco XDR instantly hits,
they take a snapshot.

284
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,890
Take a snapshot of your
data, they notify you,

285
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,110
and it gives you a chance
for your forensics teams,

286
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,930
for your cybersecurity
teams to go in there

287
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,450
at that point in time and see what server,

288
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,940
what event may have triggered that,

289
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,620
and give you a much easier chance

290
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,750
to be able to back up from that.

291
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,090
Other things, end user training.

292
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,430
And we'll hit on that a
little bit later as well.

293
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,700
But making sure you
educate your end users.

294
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,250
Be careful when you click those emails

295
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,080
that look like they come
from CEO, CFO, President.

296
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,260
A lot of times we believe
we're a little more important

297
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,093
than we are.

298
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:15,270
If they really wanted to get ahold of you,

299
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,590
they're gonna come find you.

300
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,470
An email saying you won $100
for a Starbucks gift card,

301
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,690
that's usually not an
email you wanna click on

302
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:26,137
to try to say, "Hey, my
CIO really remembered

303
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:27,420
"the things that I did."

304
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,710
- Yeah.

305
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,290
Yeah, I think, do you have a program

306
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,360
that does actual testing as well?

307
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,830
Have you gone that far?

308
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,877
- So we do.

309
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:38,640
And one thing that, another thing is,

310
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,160
with Cohesity is the rapid recovery.

311
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,160
And we back up 17 terabytes
of data into Fort Knox

312
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,120
through our testing procedures.

313
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,143
We quarterly test.

314
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,660
We have some servers that
are sitting at a warm site.

315
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,640
Fire 'em up, pull all of our data back.

316
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,300
And it has baffled me every single time.

317
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,300
17 terabytes of data completely
recovered in 17 hours.

318
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,410
An hour a terabyte.

319
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,800
I mean, you think, some of
these ransomware attacks,

320
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,800
people are down for
three, six, nine months.

321
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,860
And you're thinking fully
recovered in 17 hours.

322
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,560
So.
- That's impressive.

323
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,393
- It is.

324
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:21,460
It's very impressive.

325
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,860
- Yeah.

326
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,020
How often do you do testing?

327
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,220
- So we do it quarterly.

328
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,770
And one of the things that
I always stress to my team

329
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,220
is making sure that we're
doing the tabletop exercises.

330
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,860
We're doing the testing.

331
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,040
Making sure that, just like an NFL game,

332
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,740
reading the playbook, we have to know

333
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,930
everyone's on the same page.

334
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,790
Everyone is doing the
same thing every time.

335
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,100
So if that event happens,
we're a well-oiled machine.

336
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,100
And we can go into that DR plan
and start activating things

337
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,660
and making sure the college
understands and knows.

338
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,940
I mean, we as an IT team have a job

339
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,780
to make sure that college
and those students

340
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,540
believe in us, rely on our data,
rely on our recoverability.

341
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,070
And that's why we have to make sure

342
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,920
we have solutions in
place that can do that.

343
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,753
- Yeah.

344
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:12,300
Knowing what goes into
having that set up quarterly

345
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,133
sounds aggressive.

346
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:17,610
So I like hearing that it's possible

347
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,480
that our audience can go back and say,

348
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,000
think about what it's gonna
take to get to that point,

349
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,960
regardless of the size
of the organization.

350
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,490
It is, it's so important.

351
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,380
'Cause for whatever reason,

352
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,640
these things always happen
at 3 a.m. on a weekend.

353
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,340
And so if we don't have that tested

354
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,770
and we don't know how long
the business is gonna be down

355
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,530
and how quick we can get it back up,

356
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,540
that could be a big problem.

357
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,620
- It's funny you say that.

358
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,830
I remember our attack like yesterday.

359
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,360
My boss was at a Garth
Brooks concert in Baton Rouge

360
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,040
when it happened on a Saturday night.

361
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,493
So that was definitely a
night I'll always remember,

362
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,050
but hope I never have to encounter again.

363
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,640
- I hope not either.

364
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,850
- But it's also great that you say that.

365
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,800
One thing that we try to preach to others,

366
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
in Mississippi, we have
15 community colleges.

367
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,080
Nobody wants to go through this alone.

368
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,480
We try through our testing procedures

369
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,970
and just people knowing
that we went through it

370
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,473
and seeing them go through
these same type of cyber events.

371
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,370
We've brought them in,
showed them our testing,

372
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,040
showed them the Cohesity platform.

373
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,510
And it's been amazing.

374
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,220
We have, out of the 15,

375
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,220
we have six of the
Mississippi community colleges

376
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,870
now operating and using Cohesity
as their backup platform.

377
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,120
- That's awesome.

378
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,420
- So as I've said, it speaks for itself.

379
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,913
- Yeah, very, very awesome.

380
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:56,790
So what are some of the
outcomes you've achieved

381
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,130
by using our solution?

382
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,750
- So obviously the biggest outcome

383
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,580
is having a very fluid
disaster recovery plan,

384
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,823
knowing that it works,
being able to test it,

385
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,790
utilize it, having the warm
site, just having the end users,

386
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,040
the training that we provide for them.

387
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Also the team, my team being
able to respond much faster.

388
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,750
Like I said before, Cisco XDR is kind of,

389
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,450
as Cisco likes to say, a sock in a box.

390
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,010
Well, we also have our own
third-party SimSoc solution.

391
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,280
And that goes back to
the small IT departments

392
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,280
and not having the number of personnel

393
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,990
to be able to respond to these events

394
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,370
and take care of these events.

395
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,760
Having that SimSoc and
having that SimSolution

396
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,550
identify and recognize and notify,

397
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,800
and then having those
SLAs for that sock team

398
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,630
to call you and let you know

399
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,090
of anything that's critical or high

400
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,490
helps you be able to first identify

401
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,760
and then be able to respond.

402
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,760
And with Cohesity and continuing
to just add different,

403
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,510
purchase different
third-party applications

404
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,550
and different things to
integrate just helps that.

405
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:12,300
And AI, everybody knows, I'm
sure y'all are gonna hear that

406
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,650
the entire week here with AI,

407
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,400
but AI is becoming a part of
each and every piece of this.

408
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,350
And it's helping to push not only backups,

409
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,360
but everything else, make things smarter

410
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,460
and utilize some of that AI functionality

411
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,200
to help us be able to
push further into it.

412
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,320
- Yeah, I think that's
extremely interesting.

413
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,320
I think the AI piece is,
it's got both sides to it.

414
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,170
I think the attackers are using AI,

415
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:47,433
but AI also can help us
on the flip side of it

416
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:51,300
from a research and recovery perspective.

417
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,730
So I think it's interesting
you mentioned that,

418
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,583
and I agree, they're gonna
hear about AI all week.

419
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,300
So what are your cyber
resilience priorities

420
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,693
for the next 12 months?

421
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,230
- The next 12 months is to
obviously not get hit again

422
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,170
or ever, but continue
to harden our backups,

423
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,840
obviously, continue to test them,

424
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,340
end-user training, all the
time doing end-user training,

425
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,700
phishing, simulated phishing attacks,

426
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,650
warm site, going and making sure

427
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,140
our warm site is fully functional.

428
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,660
Obviously, at some point in time,

429
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,180
making it almost a hot site to be able

430
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,960
just to roll everything
quick, fast if we need to.

431
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,960
But that's hard, and you
hit on that earlier too,

432
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,380
is the financial piece of it.

433
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,130
Not a lot of businesses,
especially small colleges,

434
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,900
struggle from the budget piece of that.

435
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,890
So finding that balance,
what your company can afford,

436
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,340
what you're able to be
able to do with this,

437
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,880
and that's why we went with the on-prem

438
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,980
to be able to backup our stuff on-premise,

439
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,160
and snapshots, recover,
anytime you do any updates,

440
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,260
stuff like that, something goes haywire,

441
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,790
you gotta be able to recover quick.

442
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,480
But then also being able to
have that Fort Knox piece

443
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,770
for that peace of mind knowing

444
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,550
if that on-premise backup
solution gets compromised,

445
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,040
that you have that in-the-cloud,

446
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,560
like I said, immutable air gap solution

447
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,880
that you know you can get,

448
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,930
and you know this is a
good, clean, safe backup.

449
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,830
- Yeah.

450
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,530
So that tells me you kind of follow

451
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,150
the three, two, one backup rule.

452
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,890
Does that sound right?
- Absolutely.

453
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,080
- So can we explain that to the audience?

454
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,050
Or I can jump in and explain what it means

455
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,043
if that's helpful.

456
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,640
So meaning that you're always gonna have

457
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,520
three copies of your data, right?

458
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,870
Two different media types,

459
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,483
which I think is what I'm
hearing you doing, right?

460
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,160
One offline, I heard you say air gap.

461
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,993
- That's right.

462
00:21:58,993 --> 00:22:03,270
- And then immutable, that's
the cyber vaulting Fort Knox.

463
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,870
So even with your company size,

464
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,120
you are finding a way to make sure

465
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,120
that you have all of those
different copies available,

466
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,140
for any situation.

467
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,760
And it's not just cyber events.

468
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,453
Like data disasters happen all the time.

469
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,560
It could be a fire, it could
be a snowstorm, a flood,

470
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,090
it doesn't matter.

471
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,050
You would just have to be
ready for those complexities.

472
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,550
Any additional thoughts on that?

473
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,720
- No, you're exactly right.

474
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,340
And at Pearl River Community College,

475
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,230
I mean, it would be great
for us to say that we,

476
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,800
our DR site was four or 500,

477
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,630
maybe a different time zone away.

478
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,590
It's not the budget, small college,

479
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,670
it's not the sad part in
Mississippi, tornadoes.

480
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,050
We're literally 60 miles,

481
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,960
our DR site 60 miles from our main site.

482
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,120
One tornado could wipe
out both facilities.

483
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,120
So that's where the three, two, one,

484
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,670
the biggest piece is the two for us,

485
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,250
knowing we have the on-prem copy

486
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,583
and most importantly, that
copy of our data in the cloud.

487
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,460
- All right, so thank you
for sharing all of that.

488
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,490
- Absolutely.

489
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,400
- I'm gonna go ahead and transition over

490
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,940
to my next section here.

491
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,580
I wanted to talk a little
bit about resilience.

492
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,580
You shared so many powerful
examples, but I have one.

493
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,620
When we go back to shared responsibility,

494
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,010
Kevin, you hit on our employees,

495
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:45,513
sometimes are an unintentional threat.

496
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,770
I worked in an enterprise, guess what?

497
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,970
3 a.m. call, but before Valentine's day.

498
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,300
So it actually impacted
everyone's Valentine's day

499
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,880
with this event that I'm
gonna tell you about.

500
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,850
Our desktop team had an automation tool.

501
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,890
We think, yeah, automation's great,

502
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,050
but somewhere along the way,

503
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:11,080
the permissions were a
little bit more free-flowing

504
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,110
than they should have been.

505
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,230
And what happened was that 3 a.m. call

506
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:21,060
was me responding to logging
into some of my systems.

507
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,040
This in particular was an exchange server,

508
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,200
some Citrix servers, database servers.

509
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,300
I'm on call, I gotta check it all.

510
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,853
And I see a desktop OS being deployed.

511
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,730
And I'm not kidding.

512
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,350
I'm like, wait, am I awake?

513
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,930
Am I really seeing this, what's going on?

514
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,290
So I think sometimes
we'd right away think,

515
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,150
well, that could be a cyber attack.

516
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,100
Someone got our credentials and did it,

517
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,670
but root cause showed
that there was a misstep

518
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,200
in the hardening.

519
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,200
And so we always have to
be looking and watching

520
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,860
to further harden.

521
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,550
Always learn and grow
from your experiences.

522
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:06,780
Always being willing to
look a little bit deeper

523
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,960
to see what else could be lingering.

524
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,590
So I thought that was a great example

525
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,420
of why hardening matters and
why it's not a one and done.

526
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,253
- That's right.

527
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:23,253
- So it ruined my Valentine's
Day and many others.

528
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,830
- It goes to show you, they sit
and wait for those holidays.

529
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,620
Those holidays are someone
sitting at a concert.

530
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,310
They know when to strike for sure.

531
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,753
- They do, they do.

532
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,293
All right, so now I wanna talk,

533
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,240
we'll spend probably the
next 12 to 15 minutes

534
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,503
on this last part.

535
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:53,090
So this is an example of
the flexibility of choice

536
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,950
that Kevin really talked
about a lot today.

537
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,470
So regardless of where your AWS data

538
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,920
or any of your enterprise
data for that matter sits,

539
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,780
so if you look at the location,

540
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,860
you got Edge, Data Center,
Cloud, Sovereign Cloud,

541
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,483
we can help you protect it.

542
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,700
The consumption models are
completely flexible as well,

543
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,760
self-managed, SaaS, partner-managed.

544
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,060
So regardless of the size
of your organization,

545
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,360
small or large, you can
put more of that on us

546
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,883
or you can own that more yourself.

547
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,800
The most important three
takeaways on this slide

548
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,850
are at the bottom.

549
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,013
You get to manage this from a single UI.

550
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,250
You don't have to have a separate product.

551
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:43,250
Go ahead and still use
your AWS protection,

552
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,300
but we're gonna help you
get a little bit further

553
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,010
and I have some architecture slides

554
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,220
where I can show you how this might apply

555
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,740
to your environment in just a moment,

556
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,680
but also allows you to
kind of mix and match.

557
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,150
You can use any of these things.

558
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,860
You can protect any of these workloads

559
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,390
and I'll also give you the opportunity

560
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,893
to see that in just a second.

561
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,930
If you are an AWS customer
or you will be soon,

562
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:11,733
these are some of the primary
workloads, EC2, RDS, S3.

563
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,600
We also have Aurora and for some reason,

564
00:27:18,645 --> 00:27:20,280
I'm not remembering the last one,

565
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,190
but in any case, breadth and
depth, it's always growing

566
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:28,190
and as of last week, we actually
have a CEO to CEO agreement

567
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:34,050
to ensure that not only
will Cohesity customers

568
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,600
always get commitment to cyber resilience

569
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,620
and cloud resilience,
so will AWS customers.

570
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,380
So there will always be more when it comes

571
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,813
to how we can help you.

572
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,800
This is that architecture drawing

573
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,410
that I wanted to talk you through.

574
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,780
So on your left, there is a square

575
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,210
and so the left side of your screen there

576
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,690
really is kind of showing
how your on-prem data center

577
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,630
might look, maybe you're
using AWS Outpost,

578
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,850
which would be sitting on the edge,

579
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,700
might have an AWS storage gateway,

580
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,130
but you'll notice the
little data protect there

581
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,800
down the shield, down in
the bottom right of there.

582
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,880
We can help protect
all of those workloads.

583
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,040
Then if you go to the
right side of your screen,

584
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,710
I have a giant rectangle over there.

585
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,190
Those are your cloud workloads
that you might be looking

586
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,250
to protect if you're an Azure, excuse me,

587
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,250
if you're an AWS customer.

588
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,970
And so, and again, data protect.

589
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,570
Now, if you go to the middle,
you'll see a bunch of arrows.

590
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,540
You can protect your on-prem
workloads to the cloud,

591
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,330
cloud to on-prem, you can do replication.

592
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,240
That's that customer
choice that we talked about

593
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,130
a couple slides ago.

594
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,210
So we'll help you scale and protect

595
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,243
according to whatever
your enterprise needs.

596
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,650
Kevin talked a lot about cloud vaulting

597
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,130
as one of the methods that he is using

598
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:12,210
to ensure that he's following
that 3-2-1 backup rule,

599
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,560
for example.

600
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,560
Now, our cloud vaulting solution
offers quorum capabilities.

601
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,020
I'll show you this in
just a minute in my demo.

602
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,790
So you have the quorum capabilities.

603
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,210
So when you're looking
at segregation of duties

604
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,910
and ensuring that someone is in there

605
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,510
approving both sides of an
action, and it could be anything.

606
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,250
It could be recoveries.

607
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,860
It could be policy changes.

608
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,930
It could be as simple as not being able

609
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,363
to remove a backup or delete anything.

610
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,410
We also have the data
lock, which is the worm.

611
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,900
So you can't tamper with the information.

612
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,400
And we also use RBAC.

613
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,670
So it's very based on your role.

614
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:56,670
You may or may not be
able to make a change

615
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,303
or even see it for that matter,
just depending on your role.

616
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:06,470
When I think about that scenario
where I shared with you,

617
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,370
we had the automation tool,
the desktops imaging servers.

618
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,560
When I think about the recovery pathway

619
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,250
that we had to go to, I
hadn't shared this with you.

620
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,640
So we were able to get most
of our critical systems,

621
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,390
most back online within about 24 hours.

622
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:27,093
And unfortunately it did
affect critical systems.

623
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,030
And then beyond that though,

624
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,570
I mean, this recovery
process went on for weeks.

625
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:37,530
And so if we had a solution like this,

626
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:40,470
I think we would have been
able to get things back faster

627
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,900
because we know it's not tampered with.

628
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,410
We know there's no malicious malware

629
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,543
sitting in there, et cetera.

630
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,730
All right, so let me go ahead.

631
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,690
And I don't do live demos at the events.

632
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,400
I prerecorded one for you.

633
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,870
We don't play with the powers
that be that control demos,

634
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,510
but I'm gonna give you a
live voiceover of this demo.

635
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,540
I'll walk you through it.

636
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,053
So let's go ahead.

637
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:18,030
So this is our dashboard for
our cyber vaulting solution.

638
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,850
In terms of what I'm gonna look

639
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,440
at first are the cloud vaults.

640
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,120
So think data sovereignty,

641
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,540
think about all the regions
Kevin shared global.

642
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,410
You have the ability to
vault copies of your data

643
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,220
anywhere in the world

644
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,163
in terms of whatever
your requirements are.

645
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,820
Now we talked about quorum as well.

646
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,580
So separation of duties.

647
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,400
Separation of duties is a critical,

648
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,640
like your CISO cares
about separation of duties

649
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,680
for critical workloads.

650
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,600
And this isn't any different.

651
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,200
You don't want a malicious actor to get in

652
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,560
and be able to recover a
system or delete a backup.

653
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,750
And we get really granular

654
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,903
with what you can put
separation of duties on.

655
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,553
And it's done relatively simply.

656
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,800
So you just click in the upper
corner to get that started

657
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,050
because I already have one set up.

658
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,183
We're just gonna give it a quick edit.

659
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,380
So very simple UI to navigate.

660
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,660
And what I'm gonna show you next

661
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,080
is that you have the operations.

662
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,690
This is where you would choose

663
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,030
what you're creating
separation of duty on.

664
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,460
And then here's where you
set up your approvers.

665
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,460
So these could be, it could
be geographically dispersed.

666
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,710
It could be to help if
someone's on vacation,

667
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,910
you have a backup.

668
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,213
I have two approvers
of the three required.

669
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,220
Things will cancel out within four hours

670
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,440
if nobody's responded.

671
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,990
And this is the centralized location

672
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,910
that you can keep track of that.

673
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,490
So you can see I have a
wide variety of approvals

674
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,533
and even some declines.

675
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,860
Now, in terms of this,

676
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,350
this is a summary screen
that is showing you

677
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:15,810
that I have vaults
successfully occurring or not.

678
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,080
If I had a problem, it
would show up here as well.

679
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:24,080
This protection dashboard would
also show us our recoveries.

680
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,370
So in just a moment, I'll go
ahead and just start talking

681
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,620
a little bit more forward looking.

682
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,923
So how does a data
protection policy occur?

683
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,270
Protection job, you need a policy.

684
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,140
So I have a couple policies,
more than a couple,

685
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,100
and I have pre-set them up
and I could create a new one.

686
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,850
In just a second, you'll see
me point out in the upper right

687
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,273
how you could go ahead
and create a new one.

688
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,510
Now, in terms of what we're seeing here,

689
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,630
you're just seeing me click through

690
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,230
what it takes to add a vault.

691
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,310
So when you think back to
the beginning of the demo,

692
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,250
I showed you where all those
vaults were set up in advance.

693
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,230
That's where this is coming from.

694
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,023
I've chosen Oregon West.

695
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,513
Give this a second.

696
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,230
What we're gonna show you,

697
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,510
or what I'm gonna show
you in just a second here,

698
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,980
we're gonna edit.

699
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,770
If you look, I have another job.

700
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,120
When I think about 3-2-1 backup rule,

701
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,140
I can have multiple
vaults of the same data

702
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,630
across the globe.

703
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,690
I could even use different clouds.

704
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,850
So you have the ability, again,

705
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,370
it depends on the requirements
you need to follow.

706
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,940
If you did need to go with
a different cloud vendor,

707
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,773
you could.

708
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,920
All right, so now we're
initiating a recovery.

709
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,010
You've seen everything in just
a matter of a few minutes,

710
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,770
what goes into building this
and setting this up, right?

711
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,073
Pretty straightforward.
- Yes.

712
00:35:03,073 --> 00:35:05,670
- I think that aligns
with your experience.

713
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,310
Now I'm gonna initiate a recovery.

714
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:12,600
So I'm going in, I'm choosing
actually a group of servers,

715
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,600
and I'm now selecting the vault copy.

716
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,160
So I'm gonna go ahead and initiate.

717
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,010
Now we've also talked
about some things today,

718
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,630
such as like air gapping

719
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,940
and going back to isolated environments.

720
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,050
This is an isolated environment
I'm gonna restore back to.

721
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,770
It's gonna give me the
ability to further analyze

722
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:38,160
the machine before I put
it back into production.

723
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,600
In theory, it's gonna be clean,

724
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,090
but it's always good to
have that peace of mind

725
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,730
where you can do the forensics.

726
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,890
Now, on the bottom, you'll notice

727
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,890
I add the prompt for quorum approval.

728
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,570
So what you're gonna see next

729
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,670
is I'm gonna go ahead and click.

730
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,730
So when you're logged in
as one of the approvers,

731
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,480
which was what the case was
here, it'll auto approve.

732
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,000
But then you also saw me go in

733
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,910
and do the other side of the approval.

734
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,273
And now we have a recovery
that has been initiated.

735
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,110
So pretty straightforward.

736
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,470
You need the cloud vault, you
need a data protection job

737
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,010
with a policy that's vaulting,

738
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,130
and you need to be backing
things up on whatever.

739
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:28,130
By the way, you can do
whichever recovery time

740
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,483
or recovery point that you need.

741
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,193
All right.

742
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,850
So I'm gonna just take a few
minutes to wrap things up.

743
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:43,200
So we talked about why shared
responsibility matters.

744
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,420
The biggest key takeaway for you today

745
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,050
is that your data,
regardless of where it lives,

746
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,373
is up to you to care for
and be able to recover.

747
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,450
We gave you a lot of really great tips

748
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,700
that you can bring
forward to your enterprise

749
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,893
for cyber resilience planning.

750
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,850
And look, Cohesity can help.

751
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:09,750
And in fact, we'd love for
you to stop by our booth.

752
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,640
We're at 1425.

753
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,010
I have some other resources for you

754
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,450
that you could also pull up and leverage.

755
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,010
But we'd love to see you.

756
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,513
We have some games.

757
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,980
Kevin, thank you for joining me today.

758
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,330
- Absolutely, thank you.

759
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:32,193
- And thanks to all of you for
joining us for this session.
