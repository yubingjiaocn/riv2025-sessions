  "abstract": "The age of AI has changed the rules of the game. According to the CrowdStrike 2025 Threat Hunting Report, enterprising adversaries are using generative AI (GenAI) to enhance their operations, underscoring the critical need for innovative defensive strategies. This session explores modern cloud attack tactics and how agentic AI empowers defenders to prioritize risk and respond to attacks with speed and precision. We’ll examine the limits of traditional approaches, share insights into emerging cloud security trends, and show how AWS and CrowdStrike are bridging the gap with AI-powered defenses to level the playing field for security teams. This presentation is brought to you by CrowdStrike, an AWS Partner.",
