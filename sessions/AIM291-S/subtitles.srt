1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,943
- Hello everybody.

2
00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:04,200
You guys can all hear me okay?

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,600
Quick thumbs up 'cause
this is the first time

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,640
I'm actually doing this
on stage with a blank.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,020
All right, awesome.

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,490
Great to have everybody on board.

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,860
I would like to do a quick introduction.

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,210
My name is Vinayak Shastri,

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,040
and I'm one of the product line managers

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,640
or of principal product
managers doing cloud detection

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,620
and response for CrowdStrike.

12
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,670
So today we'll primarily be be talking

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,333
about reimagining cloud security.

14
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:34,950
Just a quick check on the visual,

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,680
just wanna make sure that
everybody can see it.

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,820
- [Participant] I just waiting.

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,710
- Okay, there we go.

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,970
We are going to talk about
reimagining cloud detection

19
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,680
and response and with
agentic experience as well.

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,450
So we'll talk about a little bit of both.

21
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,800
The agenda at a high level

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,250
is to actually talk
about the latest trends

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,759
in the security space.

24
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,880
We'll talk a little bit
about the adversaries,

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,740
what they're actually up to,

26
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,480
challenges faced by the SOC team

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,690
in order to defend
against these adversaries,

28
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,510
gaps in today's cloud detection
and response solutions

29
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,315
that already exist and why
we're enhancing ours as well,

30
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:16,020
and how has CrowdStrike gone ahead

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,950
and re-architected the CDR space.

32
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,450
And we'll go through a quick demo

33
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,150
and talk a little bit about the
agentic experience around it

34
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,100
as well as a part of today's session.

35
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,480
So let's actually jump
into today's latest trends.

36
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,500
So everybody's heard
about Scattered Spider

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,650
or Crazy Panda at the end of
the day, come to our booth,

38
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,540
we'll introduce you to
some of these adversaries

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,640
at the end of the day.

40
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,690
So Scattered Spider in 2023 accounted

41
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,720
for one third of all the cloud threats

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,780
that our OverWatch team and MDR team

43
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,360
actually detected across.

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,340
That's actually a huge number.

45
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,340
But in 2024 that number
dropped down to 13%.

46
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,640
Does that mean they actually slowed down?

47
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,790
Not really.

48
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,330
What happened is there were
other adversaries contributing

49
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,920
and increasing that particular space.

50
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,730
So we're now seeing a over
rise of mature adversaries

51
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,120
coming into that landscape
and then talking about

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,410
how do we actually build
cloud threats in place.

53
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,075
So the challenging aspect around this

54
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:28,290
is they're not just
talking about the ecosystem

55
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,363
like the traditional way,

56
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:33,330
they're actually coming
in to build an entire

57
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,780
threat ecosystem within
the cloud infrastructure.

58
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,613
They're building,

59
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:40,230
they're using the building blocks of cloud

60
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,020
against us at the end of the day

61
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,143
and we have to figure out the
right way to defend ourselves.

62
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:52,170
Let's take an example of what
we actually looked around

63
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,240
for Genesis Panda.

64
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,183
We started looking at
their trends in 2024.

65
00:02:58,051 --> 00:02:59,430
At a high level,

66
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,690
they started looking at
exfiltrating credentials,

67
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,600
either through a instance metadata service

68
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,910
or through other means,

69
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,060
and collecting credentials
from the cloud at the end.

70
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,180
And in April they transitioned
that into breaking

71
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,590
into customer's cloud accounts

72
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,403
and then accessing their
cloud infrastructure and VMs.

73
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,250
They did not stop over there.

74
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,746
What they did was they laterally
moved across the systems,

75
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:28,830
built their own infrastructure

76
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,700
within the customer's ecosystem,

77
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,580
and connected them to the C2 domains,

78
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,763
or the control domains
at the end of the day.

79
00:03:38,816 --> 00:03:41,370
How did this change and enhance?

80
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,510
By March, 2025, we saw a
complete change in persistence,

81
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,800
which means we've started
seeing threat actors

82
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,860
establish SSH keys within
the infrastructure.

83
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,840
Persistence log into that infrastructure

84
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,450
without having to touch
an endpoint at all.

85
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,190
And that was the crazier part.

86
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,190
They're using your own
infrastructure against attacks

87
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,090
that they want to actually perform.

88
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,390
So how do we defend against
this more specifically?

89
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,150
Well, let's actually talk about,

90
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,240
now that we've seen the ecosystem play in,

91
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,910
how does AI enhance this?

92
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,343
Everybody has seen the
evolution of gen AI,

93
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:24,060
large language model
help with various things

94
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,500
at the end of the day,

95
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,990
is being used for good and bad at the end.

96
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,980
And adversaries are also leveraging AI,

97
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,540
improving their speed, efficiency,

98
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,360
starting from reconnaissance,
enhanced reconnaissance,

99
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,630
something that used to take hours or days

100
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,940
now actually take minutes or even seconds

101
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,790
for that matter at the end.

102
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,894
Vulnerability exploitation.

103
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:51,600
Think about somebody in the past

104
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,190
that had to do vulnerability exploit

105
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,590
in order to reverse
engineer a vulnerability

106
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,020
at the end of the day, create a script.

107
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,970
Today I can just feed it into an LLM

108
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,160
and then have a script ready for me.

109
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,110
Does that actually mean the
script's actually perfect?

110
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,943
No.

111
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:08,214
But what it's actually doing
is actually closing the gap

112
00:05:08,214 --> 00:05:12,630
between an exposure or
a vulnerability exposed

113
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,390
and an attack that could
actually potentially happen.

114
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,270
What does this mean for us as defenders?

115
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,607
It means the time to closing
the gap is reduced, right?

116
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,250
Malware and advancements.

117
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,960
We've seen this day in and day out

118
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,575
where they've been able to build tools

119
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:32,790
that actually helps them translate

120
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,900
across various
infrastructure within seconds

121
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,400
at the end of the day.

122
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,110
Technical support.

123
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,986
Everybody uses gen AI and LLM

124
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:46,170
in order to enhance their skills.

125
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,470
What has happened is the
entry has gotten much lower

126
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,490
at the end of the day.

127
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,480
There is a lower barrier to
entry into breaching the cloud.

128
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,500
All of this has changed
the game both for attackers

129
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,040
or the adversaries and
for us as defenders.

130
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,250
So let's take a look at what has changed

131
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,730
in the landscape of defenders.

132
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,180
What do you have to deal
with, very specifically?

133
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,330
According to our CrowdStrike threat report

134
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,280
and 2025 threat report,

135
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,660
we've actually observed
that a median break-in time

136
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,240
has actually been lowered to 48 minutes.

137
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,370
I'll let that sink in, even for what.

138
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,220
The fastest break in time that we've seen

139
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,413
is somewhere around 51 seconds.

140
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,980
Take some time to realign

141
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,515
that with security operations expectations

142
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:39,120
in terms of SLAs.

143
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,330
How quickly can you respond
to a particular detection,

144
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,370
let alone detect it, right?

145
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,920
And how quickly can you
actually respond in real time

146
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,570
in order to remediate it?

147
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,013
So 51 second was one of the
fastest observed breach time.

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,700
The cloud makes it even more challenging.

149
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,930
Why?

150
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,500
Number one, no inline sensors.

151
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,860
If it was just sensors in
the virtual machine compute

152
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,210
at the end of the day,

153
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,030
you could potentially
get some real time data.

154
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,830
But in the cloud we are actually relying

155
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,200
on events from CloudTrail.

156
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,895
How do you get inline
sensors from the cloud?

157
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:19,525
Two, complex and siloed investigation.

158
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:21,645
Everybody knows how many products

159
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:23,280
are consuming your CloudTrail,

160
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,660
flow logs at the end of the day,

161
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,290
identity that is being sourced
from another product, right?

162
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,660
Where does this all come together?

163
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,766
Worse, it's actually piecemeal,

164
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,940
which means you have these
puzzles coming from each places

165
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,770
and you have to put them together.

166
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,690
Instead of having to respond to an attack,

167
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,550
you're now trying to
figure out what an attack

168
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,766
actually looks like.

169
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:44,850
And then finally,

170
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,220
once you've actually
put the pieces together,

171
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,630
responding to it.

172
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,120
Unlike traditional
workload protection sensors

173
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,220
where you can actually go
ahead and kill a process,

174
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,590
quarantine a particular host or a file

175
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,360
within that particular workload,

176
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,980
how do you address
responding to cloud APIs?

177
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,870
How do you quarantine an identity role?

178
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,960
How do you go ahead and
quarantine an S3 bucket, right?

179
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,330
All of these are challenges
that are actually faced

180
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,943
by defenders on a day-to-day basis.

181
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,030
How do we change it?

182
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,970
How are we re-imagining
cloud detection and response?

183
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,890
If we go out to the first problem,

184
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,290
what if we could see the
control plane activity

185
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,163
in real time?

186
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,090
There are ways to actually
pull in CloudTrail logs

187
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,100
in real time as well.

188
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,560
Complex and siloed investigation.

189
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,450
This is the biggest challenge.

190
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,250
People put an AI around everything,

191
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,620
but AI needs to have context of everything

192
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,410
before it actually gives
you a proper response.

193
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,940
Otherwise it'll only give you a response

194
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,070
of how much it actually
understands and knows.

195
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,410
So this includes
understanding the data plane,

196
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,330
the control plane, flow logs,

197
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,030
audit logs at the end of
the day, Kubernetes logs,

198
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,204
understanding how they all come together

199
00:08:53,204 --> 00:08:55,291
with proper timestamp.

200
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,480
Imagining having a centralized location

201
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,880
where you could actually correlate that?

202
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,870
And then finally having
the same automated response

203
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,450
that enables you to accelerate
response time in the cloud

204
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,170
where you could actually
go ahead and quarantine

205
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,720
a particular bucket or go ahead and revoke

206
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,363
a rogue access token in place.

207
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:20,644
So what we've actually done is reimagined

208
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:24,000
CrowdStrike's Falcon Cloud security.

209
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,080
We always think from an
adversary point of view.

210
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,010
What does it mean to hunt for attacks

211
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,273
from an adversary point?

212
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,020
What is Scattered Spider
actually thinking about in place?

213
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,423
What is Crazy Panda
actually thinking through?

214
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,460
Detect early activity
through indicators of attack

215
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,840
in the cloud.

216
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,860
Reconnaissance attacks.

217
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,080
These can actually come
through early in the process

218
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,180
before a breach actually happens.

219
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,376
Understand the timeline.

220
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:56,430
And then stop the breaches
right in the workload

221
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,860
using some of the
workload sensor protection

222
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,130
or the ability to use fusion, right?

223
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,180
Finally, enable your SOC
team to help investigate

224
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,130
that with timeline.

225
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,750
Understand the sequence of events

226
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,879
of what exactly happened in scale,

227
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,350
and then at scale built in automation.

228
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,320
We'll talk about each
one of these in place,

229
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,780
but overall we think about two things:

230
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,840
one is adversary focused;

231
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,990
two, prevention first in
order for you to go ahead

232
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,460
and prevent a particular attack

233
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,170
or block a particular attack,

234
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,880
we don't want you to wait.

235
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,410
Prevent first and then figure out

236
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,940
where that breach actually went through.

237
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,733
How do you remediate it
during a long term process?

238
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,170
To meet the needs and speed
of modern adversaries,

239
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,330
we've gone ahead and
re-envisioned what it means

240
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,820
to actually have cloud
detection and response.

241
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,360
Number one, real time
visibility and detection,

242
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,490
both from an ingestion standpoint

243
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,293
and from a detection standpoint.

244
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,920
We'll talk about this in
terms of what is a new engine

245
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,720
that we are actually using.

246
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,977
Two, correlation and contextualization.

247
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:07,170
It is very important to
correlate a particular threat

248
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,140
by bringing down all the
risk associated with it

249
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,210
starting from assets,

250
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,880
understanding what is
the layout of the asset.

251
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,530
Is it a container? What is it running?

252
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,573
What's the namespace around it?

253
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,156
Understanding the risk associated
with those assets as well.

254
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:26,400
Bringing in all sorts
of logs from CloudTrail

255
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,720
to flow logs and
aggregating them together.

256
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,460
Then using machine learning,

257
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,153
then using agentic AI to actually
make sense of those logs.

258
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,960
And then finally, the
last piece of the puzzle,

259
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,030
starting from detection and response,

260
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,800
the response part of it,

261
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,810
which means now I have
to be able to go ahead

262
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,840
and automatedly respond
to some of these attacks

263
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,610
as they actually come in.

264
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,010
You could potentially build
some with manual intervention

265
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,270
as required,

266
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,881
but execute an API response
as a part of the strategy

267
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:01,230
where you're putting down
the flames right there

268
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,310
and then trying to figure out

269
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,510
what is the wrong term
remediation strategy.

270
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,703
So to do that,

271
00:12:07,703 --> 00:12:11,790
we are introducing a new
engine within cloud detection

272
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,693
and response.

273
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,700
Starting from ingestion,
as I mentioned earlier,

274
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,810
the logs are actually streamed
and the detection is applied

275
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,060
while it's actually in stream.

276
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,570
Two, this reduces the detection
from minutes to seconds

277
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,403
at the end of the day.

278
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:30,900
This is very important in
order to go ahead and respond

279
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,027
back to a threat that's
completing in 51 seconds.

280
00:12:35,027 --> 00:12:38,130
And this is tested and
used by OverWatch team

281
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,383
and MDR team over the last decade.

282
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,125
And they almost ingest 5
trillion events per day

283
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,170
and ran this at scale.

284
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,230
So we have this built in
within the product today

285
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,200
and we're actually launching
the real time detection

286
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,820
as a part of the new launch.

287
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,580
Two is unified detection part.

288
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,860
We can't have silos anymore.

289
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,210
Identity in one place,

290
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,920
cloud detections in another place

291
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,620
where sensor-based
detections in another place.

292
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,240
Most of you use different vendors

293
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,150
in order to collectively put
those detections together.

294
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,320
The challenge then becomes

295
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,960
how are you gonna aggregate
these detections together?

296
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,150
Make sense of it, right?

297
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,940
A SOC cannot view a detection
from a single point of view.

298
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,370
They have to look at it
from a holistic angle.

299
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,880
Same thing with agentic
or if you're using AI,

300
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,670
you can't provide it a siloed approach.

301
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,440
You have to provide it
the complete feedback.

302
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,870
So how do you enrich that investigation

303
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,073
with unified detection?

304
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:39,303
So correlation becomes more important.

305
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,170
Finally, accelerating that response.

306
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,900
Now that you have actually
provided more context around it,

307
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,224
it's then we apply Charlotte AI to go in

308
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:52,923
and provide summarized
details with context.

309
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:56,940
Runtime actually provides
all kinds of context,

310
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,610
so Charlotte will actually go
ahead and triage a detection

311
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,990
as soon as it actually pops up

312
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,620
with complete summarization in
terms of what happened, why,

313
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,470
and what is the response to be taken.

314
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,420
Expert-led decisions at the end of the day

315
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,510
where you actually have
agentic AI coming in.

316
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,790
And I'll talk a little bit later
during the session in terms

317
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,181
of the different agentic
experience built into the product.

318
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:24,030
In essence, what we are
doing is bringing in agentic

319
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,480
experience to go ahead and
correlate, tell me what happened.

320
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,700
You run manually at the end of the day,

321
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,740
experience it from a SOC perspective,

322
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,430
reduce the SOC time from maybe 60 minutes

323
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,380
to 60 seconds at the end.

324
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,240
And finally leveraging Falcon Fusion SOAR

325
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,820
in order to respond to
some of these attacks

326
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,500
in real time, right?

327
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,850
We're not gonna be able to sit down

328
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,100
and then detect a particular detection,

329
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,460
triage it over time, and then
respond back to it manually.

330
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,010
So how do I actually build
that into my change in order

331
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,050
to actually do real time detection

332
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,810
and response and then
triage it to figure out

333
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,213
what is the long term strategy for it?

334
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,050
So that is where we actually go

335
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,640
and integrate it with Falcon Fusion

336
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,380
with out of the box response flow

337
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,900
that has been built into the product.

338
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,760
There is always concerns about automation

339
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,390
at the end of the day where
automation on end-to-end

340
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,340
could actually disrupt my business.

341
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,500
Yes, you can actually
have human in the loop

342
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,570
at the end of the day to
validate some of these systems

343
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,770
as they go through.

344
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,260
This also accelerates the whole system

345
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,843
as things actually progress.

346
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,880
So finally, I'd like to
take you through a demo.

347
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,283
So let's actually get into a quick demo.

348
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,213
Wow!

349
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,480
- [Narrator] This demo
reflects common trade craft

350
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,170
used by cloud conscious
adversaries like Scattered Spider.

351
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,110
After compromising a
developer's AWS credentials

352
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,760
through social engineering,

353
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,310
a threat actor uses the
cloud shell command line

354
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,920
to create a new SSH key pair.

355
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,990
Establish an IAM role with
administrative privileges

356
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,350
and launch an EC2 instance

357
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,420
with the privilege role attached,

358
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,940
achieving persistent administrative access

359
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,560
in under one minute.

360
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,790
In the Falcon console,

361
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,561
we can see detections from
the suspicious activities.

362
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,680
However, what's more interesting

363
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,690
is we can see the graph view of the attack

364
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,670
unfolding in real time,

365
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,230
providing complete visibility

366
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,150
into the threat actors movements.

367
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,910
Our detection engine
enriches cloud telemetry data

368
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,100
with asset inventory context

369
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,520
to accurately identify
malicious behavior patterns.

370
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,340
Falcon had never seen this
developer using clouds shell

371
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,930
for deployments before,

372
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,720
immediately flagging this as anomalous.

373
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,820
Additionally, the specific sequence

374
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,560
of the threat actor's actions,

375
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,987
creating an administrative IAM profile,

376
00:17:06,987 --> 00:17:10,200
attaching it to launch
an unmanaged EC2 instance

377
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,270
with a new SSH key pair,

378
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,240
clearly indicated highly unusual activity

379
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,450
that deviated from
normal baseline behavior.

380
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,890
Based on this activity,

381
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,510
Falcon platform immediately

382
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,900
invoked automated fusion
workflows to contain the threat.

383
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,540
A workflow was invoked
to deny further access

384
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,880
for the developer's compromise credential,

385
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,700
effectively cutting off
the attacker's entry point.

386
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,790
To take a step further and
prevent additional damage,

387
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,770
another Fusion workflow was invoked

388
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,620
to stop the EC2 instance
from being launched

389
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,390
while preserving the instance disc

390
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,283
for forensic investigation.

391
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,780
The Falcon console provides
a detailed timeline view

392
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,397
of the attack.

393
00:17:50,397 --> 00:17:52,800
The threat actor attempted to log in again

394
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,000
via the cloud console,

395
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,880
but their access was denied
with an error message.

396
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,460
This is how Falcon cloud
security is empowering you

397
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,500
to stop the adversary at the speed

398
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,243
that modern attacks demand.

399
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,570
- Okay, let's actually switch
back to the PowerPoint mode

400
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,970
and then talk a little bit about the demo.

401
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,510
As you actually saw, all
the way from detection,

402
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:29,510
enhancement in terms of
triage using both Charlotte AI

403
00:18:29,895 --> 00:18:32,520
and agentic AI,

404
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,190
we've been able to
respond back to a threat

405
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,760
and then triage it much easily
at the end of the day, right?

406
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,130
A lot of these response are optional,

407
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,010
but we always let
customers make a decision.

408
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,240
Do you want manual intervention?

409
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,610
How comfortable are you
with revoking rogue tokens

410
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,710
at the end of the day, right?

411
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:54,710
So it's very important to go
from detection to response

412
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,370
in seconds without having to wait.

413
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,830
And you have Charlotte
AI that comes in later

414
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,960
to actually help you with triaging

415
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,410
the whole content altogether.

416
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,880
Okay, now...

417
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,573
Okay.

418
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,980
Trying to go back to the PowerPoint.

419
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,813
Okay.

420
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,840
So now let's talk about
ag agentic experience

421
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,280
in the whole system, right?

422
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,990
Now that we've seen the whole experience

423
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,170
going from detection all the
way to response in seconds

424
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,460
at the end of the day,

425
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,530
agentic comes in multiple ways

426
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:39,212
and CrowdStrike has actually
launched agentic AI bots.

427
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,790
Number one, it's actually
helping you increase

428
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,950
the productivity of your SOC team.

429
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,050
Let it be doing manual triage

430
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,390
and then responding or doing
a triage after the response,

431
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,203
there is a triage time that
actually comes into play.

432
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:56,220
When we bring all the data together,

433
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,610
an expert AI agent saves weeks of time

434
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,333
from a SOC perspective.

435
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,600
And number two,

436
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,640
this means to say your
mean time to respond

437
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,090
if you're trying to do things
manually is actually reduced.

438
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,770
Our whole goal at the end of the day

439
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,460
is to help you reduce your
MTTR for every detection

440
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,360
and help you automate the
triage as much as possible.

441
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,980
And finally, the most important piece

442
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,370
that actually comes in is
combating skill shortage.

443
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,390
You have SOC admins

444
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,550
that are actually looking
at SOC across the board,

445
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,940
they're looking at platforms,
identity, on-prem, cloud,

446
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,116
SaaS, and they can't be
an expert on every level.

447
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:39,420
While we have actually
observed some customers

448
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,450
actually carve out cloud
security operations

449
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,460
to actually go look at cloud specific,

450
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,503
contextualizing it with the cloud data,

451
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,290
it's even more important at this point

452
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,170
because you have a shortage of SOC admins

453
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,820
that actually understand
the cloud world really well.

454
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:58,470
And then finally,

455
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,920
all of these pre-trained
agents come out of the box

456
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,750
from a security data perspective.

457
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,860
So where you can actually go ahead

458
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,690
and have a triage specific agent

459
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,030
that will help you
triage across the board.

460
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,040
You're not only looking
at a silo detection,

461
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,673
but you're looking at a detection
from a complete context:

462
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:16,320
threat hunting agent, vulnerability agent,

463
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,940
response agent at the end of the day,

464
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,410
how do you want to bring in?

465
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,170
The way that these
agents have been trained

466
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,270
and scale has been through our MDR

467
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,070
and incident response team.

468
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,500
So OverWatch team and Falcon Complete team

469
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,590
at the end of the day does this in and out

470
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,890
and years of research has actually gone in

471
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,357
and we've built our own intel books

472
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:38,857
and advisory best practices
at the end of the day.

473
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,310
So this helps.

474
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,080
These agents are just getting started.

475
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,030
We plan on building more and more agents

476
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,960
as they actually come in.

477
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,510
They may have overlapping capabilities,

478
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,480
but their whole goal is to
help you reduce your meantime

479
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,250
to respond to a particular threat

480
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,250
regardless of where it actually happens.

481
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,850
And finally, I'd like to bring you back

482
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,240
to the whole agentic AI security platform

483
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,070
that we are actually building together.

484
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,883
We start off with a single
unified sensor in place

485
00:22:08,883 --> 00:22:13,410
that actually sits on Linux,
windows, Mac, Kubernetes,

486
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,784
and containers at the end of the day.

487
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:18,000
Helps you associate and layout

488
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,220
with an enterprise level
graph that tells you

489
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,720
what is the risk associated,

490
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,378
what is the asset details
associated with it.

491
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:28,230
And you then have
detection across the board

492
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,240
that actually overlays endpoint detection,

493
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,240
cloud detections, SaaS
detection, identity detection.

494
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,800
You saw cloud threat detection

495
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,680
and response is just a
single component of it.

496
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,376
All of this kind of merges
into become either MDR

497
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:41,820
and CDR together

498
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,890
where our managed detection
team is looking at it

499
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,830
or cloud detection team
will be looking at it.

500
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:51,450
And over encompassing the
entire thing is our agentic AI

501
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:55,991
and AI agents which is now
getting the complete context

502
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:59,190
without having to lose context on identity

503
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,021
versus cloud versus SaaS.

504
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:04,980
The breach might have happened
at a SaaS application level

505
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,110
where the identity breach
has actually happened,

506
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,690
across the board now it
has spawned into cloud,

507
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,710
cloud to workloads,

508
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,960
workloads now they're actually breached,

509
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,700
laterally moved into the cloud.

510
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,050
When you're looking at silos,

511
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,410
you're only figuring out what
those silos actually mean.

512
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,960
But when you're looking at it
from a holistic point of view,

513
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,210
you go down to remediation instantly.

514
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,880
Second thing you figure out is,

515
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,850
how do I make sure this
doesn't happen again?

516
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,530
What is the remediation part of it?

517
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,090
And it's very important for us

518
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,050
to have a holistic view

519
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,123
in order to get to that level of details.

520
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,233
So that's the session.

521
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,750
Thank you for your time today,

522
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,410
and would love to spend
some more time in the demo.

523
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,730
Please stop by our booth.

524
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,730
And if you'd like to take
a look at our adversaries

525
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,440
and then take a look
at some of the details

526
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,273
around adversaries,

527
00:23:56,273 --> 00:23:58,830
we're more than happy to
talk to you around in there.

528
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,830
Thank you very much.
