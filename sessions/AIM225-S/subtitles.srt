1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,650
- Thank you.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,610
Welcome everybody.

3
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,450
So you know I'm wearing
my agentic shirt today.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,300
Are you all wearing your agentic outfits?

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,800
Everybody's agentic.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,733
But I'm gonna actually
present today an actual agent

7
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:16,560
and actually two agents working together,

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,555
which I'm super excited about.

9
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:22,859
So the AI SRE is all about

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,860
solving problems in production, right?

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,960
Everybody has observability.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,144
You have all this data,

13
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:32,250
but you need to solve
problems under pressure

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,980
and you have to go through
a lot of data to do that,

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,240
so that's the topic today.

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,140
We're gonna see how
agents can help analyze

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,880
the root cause of issues

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,770
and really reduce your mean
time to resolution, right,

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,330
by automating the process of
investigating the root cause.

20
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,229
And then I'll show you how you can work

21
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:59,220
with your coding agent, cloud code cursor,

22
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,173
GitHub, CoPilot, et cetera,

23
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,140
to actually implement the resolution

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,950
recommended by our agent
that does the analysis.

25
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,370
This is delivering massive

26
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,010
productivity gains to our customers,

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,710
but also reduction of outages,

28
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,150
better system availability
and uptime, right,

29
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,690
and so the impact of
incidents can be very costly

30
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,370
and that's what an agent can do

31
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,090
and that's really driving massive savings.

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,180
And one note is that, you know,

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,820
our customers are deploying this

34
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
without changing any of
their existing tools.

35
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,710
So you keep your observability,

36
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,870
your incident management,

37
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,150
people work with the
tools they're used to,

38
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,780
and here we're having an
agent that's gonna help them.

39
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,390
Okay, so that's just a few examples.

40
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,420
We have a insurance company
that's really, for them,

41
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,090
it's all about reducing
the cost of incidents.

42
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,860
They have a complex
on-prem and AWS footprint

43
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,750
and issues that span those can
be all analyzed by Hawkeye.

44
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,110
Hawkeye is the name of our agent.

45
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,093
The company is called NeuBird.

46
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,580
And Hawkeye can deploy as a
SaaS product or in your VPC.

47
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,310
So if you're a security conscious company

48
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,590
and you want control over your AI,

49
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,623
we can actually deploy
Hawkeye in your VPC.

50
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,710
That's what this insurance
company is doing,

51
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,680
and it's connected to
their on-prem telemetry.

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,320
We have a, you know,

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,650
shipping and logistics
company where for them

54
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,040
it's all about managing data pipelines,

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,920
massive numbers of night jobs

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,617
that are running on Databricks

57
00:02:45,617 --> 00:02:50,617
with Flink jobs running on EKS

58
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,820
and they have to make sure
all these end in time, right?

59
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,340
And so for them it's all about, you know,

60
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,380
handling all these alerts that come

61
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,410
off of these data pipelines, nightly jobs.

62
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,860
And the last example
is a bank in Australia

63
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,230
that uses us the first use case,

64
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,780
now they use us across a lot of use cases.

65
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,290
The first use case was as
simple as backup management.

66
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,870
So if you're a bank and
you have a lot of backups,

67
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,360
you need to explain why they're failing

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,750
and how you're gonna avoid the
backups from failing again,

69
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,156
because there's regulations around that.

70
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:31,271
Okay, so those are some quick
examples and really again,

71
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:34,710
it's about helping this guy, right?

72
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,750
And it's, we call it an AI SRE,

73
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,124
but it's serving the whole company

74
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:42,240
and usually there's like
an on-call team, right,

75
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,340
that are not maybe the SREs,

76
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,668
but they pull in the
SREs when they don't know

77
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:48,870
how to solve the problem

78
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,135
and you end up with all these people

79
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:53,850
sifting through all the information

80
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,227
because you have this
dynamic cloud environment

81
00:03:56,227 --> 00:04:00,210
with lots of layers, lots of
telemetry, lots of alerts,

82
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,520
and then inevitably you have

83
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,370
lots of people jumping on a call.

84
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,471
Have you been on one of
these calls where you know,

85
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:09,600
like there's 30 people there

86
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,690
and it's interrupting,
your day is stressful,

87
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,580
nobody knows why they're there.

88
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,370
There's finger pointing,
potentially, hopefully not.

89
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,051
So what if you could just have a very

90
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,070
clean explanation of what's going on?

91
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,240
And that's really what we're doing.

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,251
We're taking you from a manual workflow

93
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:32,251
where you have people
logging into Datadog, Splunk,

94
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,000
you know, Grafana, CloudWatch, et cetera,

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,260
and doing kind of the mental
work of looking at dashboards

96
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,343
and trying to explain what's going on

97
00:04:42,343 --> 00:04:45,270
to then be able to resolve it.

98
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,061
So we're taking this manual
workflow and automating it

99
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:52,611
with an agent that can
trigger automatically

100
00:04:52,611 --> 00:04:57,270
connect to your telemetry,
explain exactly what's going on,

101
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,270
and provide a very easy to
read summary for the user.

102
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,113
So anybody wanna see that?

103
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,523
Okay, so this is Hawkeye.

104
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,120
We're looking at a dashboard

105
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,850
and on the left we have
incidents and alerts

106
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,890
that have not been investigated

107
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,280
and on the right we're
seeing incidents and alerts

108
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,960
that have been investigated.

109
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,849
So what I'm gonna do is show you

110
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:28,530
the information that we're
providing in an alert context.

111
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,830
So you see there's some user initiated

112
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,240
and automated sessions.

113
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,980
So let's just look at this one.

114
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,870
I'm gonna pick one at random.

115
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,396
This one happens to be a Datadog monitor.

116
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:43,890
I have a tremendous amount of context here

117
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,311
for the agent to work with

118
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:49,950
because I'm triggering
automatically off of an alert.

119
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,433
Alerts have rich context for
the agent to do the work.

120
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,050
The work happens in the background

121
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,310
and what you're seeing here

122
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,550
can be delivered wherever
the team is working.

123
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,190
It could be on Slack,
it could be on Teams,

124
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,520
it could be in your coding agent,

125
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,130
it could be on ServiceNow.

126
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,220
Basically I think the future is headless.

127
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,680
We have a UI here where you can

128
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,660
kind of consult the information,

129
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,610
but you should be able to
consume this information

130
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,460
no matter where you
work without necessarily

131
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,220
coming to our user interface.

132
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,190
But in here I can kind of see the summary,

133
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,810
the incident description,
the application artifacts,

134
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,210
timeline of events, the evidence,

135
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,420
the root cause and the corrective actions.

136
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,100
Okay, so contrast that
with just the alert,

137
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,080
you know that JSON I showed you, you know,

138
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,740
the in ServiceNow you
might see it represented,

139
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,280
there's some, you know, AI SRE tools

140
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,191
that are just basically
regurgitating that, you know,

141
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:01,080
summarizing it and
presenting the alert to you,

142
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,870
but what we're doing here
is we're digging deep

143
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,340
into the actual data in
your observability tools,

144
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,550
the traces, the telemetry, the metrics,

145
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,940
the logs, also your config, right,

146
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,450
we can log into your AWS console

147
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,420
and see all the same
data that you see there,

148
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,820
how your security groups are configured,

149
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,160
how your EKS cluster is configured.

150
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,290
We could use Coop CUDL to go

151
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,960
and interrogate the Kubernetes cluster.

152
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,840
So we're doing what an SRE would do to

153
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,400
kind of find a root cause,

154
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,425
not just kind of summarizing

155
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:39,494
what we're seeing in the alert.

156
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:42,930
And all this work is available here.

157
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,147
So typically the workflow is
you just get the conclusion,

158
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:48,330
the corrective actions,

159
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,870
you take those actions
and you close the ticket,

160
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,790
but sometimes you have to dig deeper.

161
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,960
Of course you have kind of
a budget for investigations.

162
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,824
You know, by default we just
go and do what we call one,

163
00:08:01,824 --> 00:08:03,480
you know, prompt cycle.

164
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,050
So here is a chain of
thought and we have like

165
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,908
five or six questions that
we're gonna go through

166
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:12,030
and to answer each of them

167
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,630
we're gonna consult a
series of data sources.

168
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,840
And you can see here the
full list of data sources

169
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,374
available for this
particular investigation.

170
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:25,230
There were a lot of them, config, traces,

171
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,394
logs, metrics,

172
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:31,500
all consulted in order to provide

173
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,070
this very deep and rich analysis.

174
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,190
And so at every step I
have all this analysis

175
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,760
and that is what gets then summarized

176
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,580
in the RCA itself that gets shipped off

177
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,030
to your Slack channel, et cetera.

178
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,634
And something that I'm very excited about

179
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:55,530
is this new capability
that I'm gonna show you

180
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,710
that we just released which allows you

181
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,890
to work in your coding assistant.

182
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,570
So here I'm showing you
Claude code and you know

183
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,500
I think real SREs they don't like UIs.

184
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,051
That's my kind of theory.

185
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,310
And they work in a shell

186
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,634
and they're really good with scripting

187
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,240
and working in shells.

188
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,430
And if you're that kind of person

189
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,080
and you're looking to
leverage AI to do your work,

190
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,000
I would say go to cloud code.

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,402
That should be your first step, right?

192
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,560
I'm sure most of you have
already taken that step.

193
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,820
It's extremely powerful

194
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,466
because it can use all your available

195
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:39,450
CLI tools that you have on your system.

196
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,210
And then it has this
concept of an MCP server

197
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,830
that you can add to it.

198
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,490
An MCP server stands for
model context protocol.

199
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,360
Think of it as kind of an API that the

200
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,780
L and M can automatically
understand and interrogate,

201
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,090
and it's basically self-documenting

202
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,504
so you can kind of plug in these tools

203
00:09:59,504 --> 00:10:03,390
and you can start plugging
in a bunch of MCP servers,

204
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,464
but at some point the more you plug in

205
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:09,450
you get diminishing return.

206
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,100
So what we're doing is we're
taking your Datadog connection,

207
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,430
your AWS information, your CICD pipeline,

208
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,270
your GitHub connection, all
that is managed by Hawkeye

209
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,459
and Hawkeye is providing one MCP server

210
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:29,459
to the coding assistant here
that can basically orchestrate

211
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,140
the whole thing that I showed you earlier,

212
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,170
the whole investigation
can learn over time,

213
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,670
can do all these things,

214
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,120
but now I can kind of talk to
that one MCP server as an SRE

215
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,720
and be like, okay, I want to do things

216
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,250
with this MCP server.

217
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,140
So it's self-documenting.

218
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,240
You can actually ask it,
you know, what do you do?

219
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,264
How can I use this MCP server?

220
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:56,340
It can help you with
the onboarding process.

221
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,340
You can have, you know, all
these typical workflows,

222
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,412
listing alerts, starting an investigation,

223
00:11:05,412 --> 00:11:08,210
monitor the progress of an investigation,

224
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,980
get results of an investigation.

225
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,930
So I use this extensively
like we do evaluations in POC,

226
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,560
so I can download all root cause analysis

227
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,310
and then run queries
in my coding assistant

228
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,250
across all the RCAs for the last week.

229
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,380
Maybe I'm looking for patterns,

230
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,170
I'm looking for things
that keep happening.

231
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,970
I want to analyze all my alerts

232
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,500
and find, you know,

233
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,200
the thing that I should be actually fixing

234
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,120
as a site reliability engineer.

235
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,520
Our job is not to just fight fires,

236
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,050
it's to prevent them, right?

237
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,470
And with my coding agent
and this deep kind of

238
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,853
analytic capability of Hawkeye that can go

239
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:52,093
and look at all my telemetry

240
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:56,211
I can prompt Hawkeye to
do all this deep research,

241
00:11:56,211 --> 00:11:58,050
extract all this information,

242
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,500
and then process this
information in my coding agent.

243
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,119
I can also automate the remediation steps

244
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:06,747
recommended by Hawkeye.

245
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:08,970
And so this is what you're seeing here,

246
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,910
a set of things that I go
through normally, right?

247
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,310
How do I create an AWS connection?

248
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,910
It's helping me onboard Hawkeye, right?

249
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,575
It's showing me exactly what I need to do.

250
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:22,410
I can ask, you know,
because it's connected

251
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,500
to my AWSCLI, I can ask
it to create this role

252
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,210
that Hawkeye needs, right?

253
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,140
So I can do the whole
workflow right here, onboard,

254
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,110
set up my project that
basically takes the connections

255
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,160
and combines them where you
can also add instructions

256
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,131
because, you know, our
systems are very complex

257
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:46,230
but Hawkeye can do a tremendous job of

258
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,180
kind of understanding the dependencies,

259
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,700
discovering the
configuration and all that,

260
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,930
but sometimes just like you
onboard a very smart SRE,

261
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,930
you know, that person needs a bit of help,

262
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,430
right, instructions.

263
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,604
So the same thing can
be done with Hawkeye,

264
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:04,920
where even I use cloud
code to actually create

265
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,168
those instructions sometimes
because I can basically,

266
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:11,250
you know, use it to create
really great context

267
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,250
for Hawkeye to use in
its investigations, okay?

268
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,008
So, you know, I do all types of work here.

269
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:25,008
I can summarize all my
past investigations.

270
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,365
I can eventually look at the RCAs

271
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:32,811
and usually at some point
I need to get back into

272
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,790
the user interface

273
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:40,500
and I can ask for a
link right here, right?

274
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,500
So I can just jump back into the UI to,

275
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,054
you know, if I prefer a UI, right?

276
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:51,563
And as I mentioned earlier,

277
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:55,400
you can always ask follow up
questions on an investigation,

278
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,320
and Hawkeye actually
recommends some questions

279
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,960
and you can set it up so that

280
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,560
it automatically answers that question.

281
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,000
So you think of it as you have

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,040
like a budget for investigations

283
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,590
and some alerts you're gonna say

284
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,010
just keep going until
you think you're done.

285
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,100
By default we go, as I
mentioned, one round, right?

286
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,160
Like we go five questions,
one chain of thought,

287
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,921
then we stop, we summarize,

288
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:25,080
but we can automate the follow up question

289
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,163
or you can have your team
ask that follow up question

290
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:32,730
in cloud code, in cursor,
in Slack, on Teams,

291
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,440
wherever they want to work.

292
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,599
So that's kind of the vision
for working with an agent

293
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:42,537
is you have agents working
with other agents through MCV,

294
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:45,810
you have people working with agents

295
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,020
without necessarily using a tool, right?

296
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,140
I'm on Slack, I'm just
talking to this agent,

297
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,540
it's providing me useful information,

298
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,670
I'm asking for follow up questions.

299
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,254
I'm not really using a new tool,

300
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:02,610
there's something in the
background that's helping me

301
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,410
and that's kind of the vision

302
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,340
that we have for agentic SREs.

303
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,040
You know, there's a lot of
things that SREs need to do

304
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,530
and we're connected to
so many other teams,

305
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,174
DBAs, et cetera.

306
00:15:15,174 --> 00:15:18,240
We're gonna have a lot of different agents

307
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,670
doing all these pieces of the work

308
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,850
and I think, you know,
a great model is to use

309
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,520
a coding agent as your main interface

310
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,160
where you're basically
interacting with all

311
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,700
these different agents
that help you do your job.

312
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,515
We have a lot of traction in this space

313
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:40,410
and a lot of excitement around this.

314
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,410
And we are also just launched yesterday,

315
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,280
I don't know if you saw the news,

316
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,280
but we have now launched
self-service onboarding.

317
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,232
So you can go to your AWS
account in the Marketplace

318
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:59,287
and say I want to start using Hawkeye

319
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:01,650
and we will automatically provision

320
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,147
a SaaS instance of Hawkeye for you

321
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:06,767
and you will get a two week trial

322
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,630
and you're up and running
within five minutes,

323
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,239
you can start using Hawkeye
and you pay as you go.

324
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:18,239
So no commitment, just
go to the AWS console,

325
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,334
go to your Marketplace,
find NeuBird there,

326
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:25,200
and start using it right away.

327
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,720
And so within 15, 20 minutes

328
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,044
you'll be actually running

329
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:31,734
deep analysis on your alerts

330
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:36,734
and you can configure your AWS CloudWatch,

331
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,140
you can configure Datadog, Dynatrace,

332
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,220
we have Grafana as well available there.

333
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,940
For enterprise customers we
go and do private offers.

334
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,440
We deploy in your VPC, we use your LLMs,

335
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,430
we can connect to any
observability tool of your choice,

336
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,548
any incident management
tools of your choice,

337
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:02,916
but for those that just want
to get started self-service,

338
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,520
they can just simply connect

339
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,150
and get started right away
with our SaaS offering.

340
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,090
So again, we're basically connecting

341
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,430
to everything under the sun.

342
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,310
You'll see a lot of different
solutions out there.

343
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,482
People claiming they have AISRE,

344
00:17:19,482 --> 00:17:22,382
Amazon just launched theirs yesterday.

345
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:25,530
We're excited to have Amazon also join

346
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,202
the efforts to help SREs.

347
00:17:28,202 --> 00:17:31,890
What you'll find is a lot
of them are kind of siloed.

348
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,890
So you've got one for AWS
CloudWatch, one for Datadog,

349
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,690
they have their Bits AI,

350
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,682
you have one, Dynatrace have their agent.

351
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:44,250
We believe that, you know,

352
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,880
most organizations have
more than one source of data

353
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,430
and our agent goes across all that.

354
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,350
So a lot of people have, you know,

355
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,520
maybe they use CloudWatch for
some of the Amazon services,

356
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,960
they use Prometheus to monitor
the metrics for Kubernetes,

357
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,800
they use Datadog for this
other service, right?

358
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,250
It's a patchwork usually,
unless you're super consolidated

359
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,650
and even if you're consolidated, you know,

360
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,180
most of these agents are limited

361
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,010
like we can actually look at configs,

362
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,780
we can use Coop Cuddle,

363
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,240
we can bring in MCP servers

364
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,850
if you have your own data
that you want to provide.

365
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,530
So we believe that you need
a kind of a Swiss Army knife

366
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,410
that's orchestrating
your incident response

367
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,736
across all these tools to help you along

368
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:35,520
and make sure that you look like this guy,

369
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,710
not the guy we saw earlier.

370
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,250
Super happy now you're
just having a great time

371
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,100
working with your coding
agent and Hawkeye.

372
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,020
So let me skip through some of this.

373
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,010
I just want to leave you here.

374
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,600
I have one minute, 18 seconds.

375
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,329
I think I'm gonna finish early,

376
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:57,210
but I really encourage
you to go and onboard,

377
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,210
start here and sign up and just try it

378
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,490
and tell us what you
think we would, you know,

379
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,030
we're the first to be bold enough to

380
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,270
open this up publicly
for everybody to use,

381
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,970
which shows you just the
maturity of our offering

382
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,030
where we're confident this
is gonna work for you.

383
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,210
So please just take advantage of it.

384
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,840
It's free to get started.

385
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,010
You're gonna have two weeks
of free investigations

386
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,640
and you're just gonna pay as you go,

387
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,830
so it's very no commitment.

388
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,510
Just go consume it through
the Amazon Marketplace

389
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,070
and we would love to
just hear your feedback.

390
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,430
So we're at booth 1219 if you want

391
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,200
to learn more we're there,

392
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,300
we've got a cafe,

393
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,713
but behind the Datadog slide where

394
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:46,980
a lot of us are hanging out

395
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,590
and you'll see the NeuBird branding there

396
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,643
and come and see us and would
love to speak to you about

397
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:55,902
what your vision is and how
we can help you get there.

398
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:59,790
Thank you very much.

399
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,623
Enjoy the show.
