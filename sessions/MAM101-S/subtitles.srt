1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:02,970
Oh, hi, everyone. Um, thanks for attending

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,838
my session today.

3
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:06,299
I really appreciate it. I know this is getting at the end

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,419
of a kind of a long and busy week, so I

5
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:10,528
appreciate you taking the time, uh, to come and,

6
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:12,079
and watch this presentation today.

7
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,618
Um, my name is Richard Nichol. I'm a

8
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:16,179
product solutions architect for NetApp.

9
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:18,620
Um, I've been working with NetApp for about 14

10
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,440
years now.

11
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,978
Um, with about half that time, I've been working, um,

12
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:23,440
in our cloud-based products.

13
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,000
And I've been working with FSX for ONTAP

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,039
really since its inception, right? Since it

15
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:28,899
was an idea

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,359
between ADbus and NetApp. So I've been involved with it

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,450
for a very long time.

18
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,759
And I've been working with the EBS, um, as

19
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,679
part of Early Access at the beginning of this year.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,918
And so today, I'm going to talk to you about

21
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:41,240
how you can leverage FSX for ONTAP to

22
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,348
help optimize the storage cost for

23
00:00:43,348 --> 00:00:45,639
your Amazon Elastic VMware deployments.

24
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,158
Um, so from agenda from a very high level,

25
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,590
um, we're gonna start by, I just want a level set

26
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,649
on what, you know, EBS is. It's a relatively

27
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,289
new service. So, you know, what are the main,

28
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:57,609
you know, functions and features of it. Um,

29
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:59,689
and then I'm gonna kind of do a similar thing for

30
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:01,689
FSX for OnTap. I'm gonna talk about, you

31
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,129
know, what it is, you know, everybody's not always super familiar

32
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:04,959
with it, um,

33
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,448
and, you know, what are its main features and how

34
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:09,730
those features work with EBS, right?

35
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:11,808
And what are the advantages of those features, and

36
00:01:11,808 --> 00:01:13,808
then how do those two services actually end

37
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,430
up playing together as well.

38
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,918
Um, I also. So we'll then get into kind of like

39
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:20,000
3 main pillars, you know, how you can lower the

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,159
total cost of ownership, and a lot of that's around

41
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,299
how you can decouple compute from storage.

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,959
Um, I'm gonna talk about how you can improve

43
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,120
your SLAs for trying to protect your VMs

44
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,260
that are running, um, in the EBS environment.

45
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,638
Um, and then I'll get into like, you know, how you can

46
00:01:33,638 --> 00:01:35,719
operate on-prem and in

47
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,439
cloud

48
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,918
using the same ways and, and functions and

49
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:41,000
ways that you've operated there, you're going to take

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,040
that same thing and operate it in the cloud. And I

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,459
will show you how like FSSONTA can help facilitate

52
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:46,359
that. Um.

53
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:48,859
And so then, um, I'm gonna get to really one that

54
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,010
I'm really, uh, excited about, uh, a

55
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,480
disaster recovery scenario

56
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:54,888
that leverages FSX for ONTAP, and there's some

57
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:56,980
new capabilities with FSX for ONTAP that makes

58
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,159
that a very compelling,

59
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,599
uh, use case for, um, kind of helping you

60
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,680
keep a minimum footprint for those types of,

61
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,385
uh, uh. Scenarios.

62
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:06,653
And then finally, I'm gonna get into a tool called

63
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:07,513
Workload Factory.

64
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:10,344
Uh, this is a free tool. I'll probably mentioned that multiple times,

65
00:02:10,534 --> 00:02:12,554
and this is one that's gonna help you plan and migrate,

66
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:15,175
um, your workloads um from VMware

67
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:17,493
and operate them in uh ADOS

68
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:19,774
with EBS and FSXONTAP as, as

69
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:20,314
the storage.

70
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,939
Um, so I'm gonna start, um, with the Elastic,

71
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,058
uh, you know, Amazon Elastic VMware Service,

72
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,179
you know, talk about it at the highest levels. And

73
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:30,300
you can think about it at the highest levels, right? It

74
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,479
is just the fastest and easiest way

75
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,919
to take your VMware environments and

76
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:37,118
operate them efficiently and

77
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:39,338
with the same way in the cloud. So what you're basically doing is you're

78
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:41,379
taking You know, one of the main tenets for

79
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,879
EBS when it was created is that

80
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:45,258
we want to give you full control of

81
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:47,338
the environment in the cloud. So however you're operating,

82
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:49,580
you know, with your VCF stack, right, you're basically taking that

83
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,580
same VCF stack, and you're taking it up

84
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,580
to the cloud and operating it in a similar

85
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,300
way. And so, um,

86
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,618
so that's when, and then once you get up into the cloud, then you

87
00:02:57,618 --> 00:02:58,919
have the access to

88
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,460
Amazon services, which, which is another great advantage

89
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,490
of EBS and a good way of getting, you know,

90
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:05,770
a lot of stuff that's on-prem and getting into the cloud

91
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,360
and get all of the advantages of the cloud.

92
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,419
And then so it's about, you know,

93
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,210
control, and then also choice. How do you want to then

94
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:14,569
handle that once you're up there. And that's the way you

95
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,058
can either manage it all yourself

96
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:19,099
or you can bring in a partner as well. And

97
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,099
so I'll talk a little bit more about that, um, on

98
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:21,740
the next slide.

99
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,319
So you can be customer managed, right? If

100
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,639
you have all the tech technical expertise

101
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,838
in-house, you know how to do migrations,

102
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,000
you know how to maybe set up HCX, you

103
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,088
know how to, um,

104
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:34,919
you know, run your day to day at ESXI

105
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,028
host, right? All those types of things, and you're comfortable with that,

106
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:38,429
and you have the technical know-how,

107
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:40,838
great, you can do it all yourself. You don't need

108
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:43,270
anybody else. But, uh, you know, ADMS

109
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,399
has met with a lot of partners who say, hey,

110
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,159
there's a lot of customers that maybe they need help migrating

111
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,240
up, right? Or maybe they just need some help

112
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,469
with automation. Right? So there's partners

113
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:54,550
that have been involved with EBS since

114
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,909
it was early access as well.

115
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:58,210
So it really is giving you that choice.

116
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,538
Maybe you don't want to get

117
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:02,550
uh a text in the middle of the night that there's a problem

118
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,069
with this ESXi hosts, right?

119
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,389
So partners can help, you know, manage, they can help you

120
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:08,669
migrate, they can meet you wherever you are, whatever

121
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:10,710
your needs are. So really the, the takeaway

122
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,758
here, right, is that Amazon, right, has given

123
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:13,368
you complete

124
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,369
choice, right, in, in how you want to operate

125
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:18,569
this VMware environment once you have it up and running

126
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:19,189
in the cloud.

127
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:21,519
Um,

128
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,259
you know, 11 more step back, right, you know, or,

129
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,088
or, or down, I guess, um, this is showing,

130
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:28,588
hey, what are we talking about here with EBS, right? You've

131
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:30,038
got an on-premises system,

132
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:32,389
and you've got your VCF stack, as I said before, you know,

133
00:04:32,427 --> 00:04:33,699
you have your vSphere clients,

134
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:34,949
you have, um,

135
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:37,329
your, your NSX manager, you've got,

136
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:39,709
uh, your, your VSAN, right? And you've got all that

137
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:41,927
on-prem. And so basically you're taking that and you're

138
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:44,437
moving it into the cloud, you're operating it

139
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:46,829
exactly the same way. All those, you know, VCF

140
00:04:47,148 --> 00:04:49,228
components are also there in the cloud.

141
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:51,519
Um. And there's multiple reasons why

142
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,189
you might be doing this, right? Um,

143
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,088
maybe you're shutting down, an existing data

144
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,088
center, right? For that existing data center, you

145
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:00,170
want to evacuate it, you're just migrating

146
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,250
this all up in the cloud, and you just wanna be there quick and

147
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,290
you have the expertise and you wanna operate it exactly

148
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:04,910
the same way.

149
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:07,689
It could be also that you're just extending

150
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,798
your data center. Maybe you are running out of

151
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:11,809
space. And may, or maybe you're like,

152
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,928
I'm not quite ready to go all the way into

153
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:16,009
the cloud, right? I wanna do dev test so I

154
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:18,088
can just move up some dev test workloads, get

155
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:20,189
comfortable with the cloud, right, and then, and then move from there.

156
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:23,019
Maybe it's a disaster recovery. You got your on-prem

157
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,108
and you don't wanna set up a whole other data center just for

158
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:27,108
disaster recovery, right? That's another option.

159
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,540
Or maybe this is just your first

160
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,660
step in, um, and I'm gonna talk more about

161
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,738
the disaster recovery because I think, uh, FSI for OnTap's

162
00:05:33,738 --> 00:05:35,428
a really neat use case around that.

163
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:37,949
And then, um, maybe you're just, this is your first

164
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:39,988
step of modernization. You bring up some apps and

165
00:05:39,988 --> 00:05:42,108
then you start tying. And so the whole key here, right? The other

166
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,389
whole half of this first picture is that you

167
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:46,350
tie into all those Amazon services.

168
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,540
Maybe you want to

169
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,949
do the first step of modernization, take an app up into

170
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,028
the cloud and, and run, um, Bedrock on

171
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:54,399
it, right? So there's, you know, a plethora

172
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:57,139
of, of Amazon services out there, right? So you're, you're

173
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,230
taking that first step into getting

174
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,480
access to all those services.

175
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:05,069
So just one more step down, right, on

176
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:06,548
what EBS is. Um,

177
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:09,028
the first thing is that it's an automated deployment,

178
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:11,230
right? So it's really, really easy to

179
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,350
use. It's really, really easy to get started with.

180
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,629
Um, so you can do it either through the console

181
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:16,488
or the API

182
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,920
and you really don't have to provide

183
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:21,108
a lot of information. You say, OK,

184
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:23,439
I need, I need to deploy it in a VPC, right? So

185
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,949
you're gonna supply a VPC.

186
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:27,420
You need some ESXi hosts, so you can supply

187
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,428
your EC2 instances. Um, you're gonna

188
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:31,649
supply. Um, your licensing

189
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:33,678
or your, or your subscription, your VCF subscription,

190
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,730
right? You're gonna have to apply that right when you deploy it.

191
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:38,290
Um, and you have to set some sitter ranges. There's

192
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,488
some, essentially, you know, the EBS is taking

193
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:42,569
the NSS's networking, and it's like

194
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,569
kind of emulating it. So there's some private VLANs, you have

195
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:45,869
to set up some sitters for that.

196
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,290
Um, once you've defined all that,

197
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:49,699
then you click go.

198
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,470
And in about 3 hours, you have a

199
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,298
completely functional

200
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,759
VCF stack running in the cloud. It's

201
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,949
pretty amazing, really. And it's using, it's, it's,

202
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,278
you see here, it's using Cloud Builder to do it, right?

203
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,389
Um, and so,

204
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,738
again, you, once you're done, then you have

205
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,928
an NSX manager. You have a, a,

206
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:08,670
a vSphere client, you have an SCDC

207
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,670
manager. And you have,

208
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:13,100
um, and it says here you have full control, right?

209
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:13,850
You get

210
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:16,309
with ADbus Secrets Manager, you get

211
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,949
access to

212
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,459
the username and a password for all those services.

213
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,769
You can even get to the ESXI

214
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:23,790
host, root ESXI host, right? So

215
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,889
when we say full control, it really is full

216
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,730
control when you're coming into the cloud. Um,

217
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,619
for right now, for the first pass right now, um,

218
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:33,069
there's i4I metal instances is what's

219
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:33,850
supported, right?

220
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,000
There are plans to add other metal instances,

221
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:39,170
um, in the future. Um, it will give you different, you

222
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,619
know, price points, different performance, different storage,

223
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,939
you know, footprints. And, so that is coming. But

224
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,970
for right now, you know, um, that's what it is,

225
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:48,238
is I4I, uh, metal. And when you

226
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:50,660
do that deployment right now, again, it's also

227
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,059
VCF 5.2.1. Um, there's

228
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:55,059
obviously plans for VCF 9, so both

229
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:57,100
of those things are going to be coming, but for right now, that's what

230
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,319
you get. And you do have to supply

231
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,488
your own licensing, right? So you have to supply your, your

232
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:03,059
VCF, uh, subscription.

233
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,639
And you got to make sure that the cores, that the VCF

234
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,670
subscription that you have has enough cores

235
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,259
for the

236
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:10,059
four-node minimum

237
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,639
I4I metal deployment. So right now it's a

238
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,480
4-node minimum.

239
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:15,910
So. Again, right, you're bringing all

240
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,949
this up. And we're talking about the consumption, um,

241
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:18,660
that's, you know,

242
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:21,028
the consumption of your EC2 host is really

243
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:23,119
what that's talking about there, right? Do you want to do on-demand?

244
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:25,350
Do you want to do one year? Do you want to do 3-year?

245
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,759
Obviously, you do 3-year, your price will come down,

246
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:29,009
um, significantly,

247
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:31,309
but, you know, you just gotta make sure you make that commitment or

248
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:33,460
not. Um, and then also,

249
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,570
you know, obviously when you do this deployment, at the end of that

250
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,119
deployment,

251
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,678
everything's there, you've got access to everything. You

252
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:40,889
do get VSAN storage, you know, by default,

253
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,250
right? The, the I4I metals come with some

254
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:45,649
instances stores that become the VSAN, and so you have

255
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,428
storage there with you. And that's actually where

256
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:50,099
the VMs are deployed, right? The VMs are deployed, the,

257
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,408
the SEC manager and the vSphere

258
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:54,450
client, all those things are deployed onto the VSAN.

259
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,849
But you also then have the option of

260
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:58,889
adding on FSX for ONTAP as

261
00:08:58,889 --> 00:08:59,869
additional storage.

262
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:02,239
And that's where I'm gonna spend most of my time.

263
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:05,070
And so at the highest level here, right,

264
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,399
um, I think a really critical thing here, right, is that

265
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,639
Amazon FSX for ONTA

266
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:11,558
is the only ADS native storage

267
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:13,918
service, right, that's been certified for Amazon EBS.

268
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,279
So if you wanted to do, go native, right, with

269
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,609
your storage on Amazon EBS, it's gonna be FSX

270
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:19,158
for ONTAP.

271
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:22,219
Um, and so now really,

272
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:24,658
you know, what is FSX for ONTAP? I'm gonna spend a little bit

273
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:26,779
of time here because it can sometimes

274
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:28,739
be a little confusing for people because, you know,

275
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,379
it has ONTAP in the name or, and, um, and, and

276
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:33,379
has NetApp in the name as well, right? But it

277
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,739
is a fully managed AWS storage

278
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:37,779
service. Um, and it sits there next to

279
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,979
S3, EBS EFS, right?

280
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,158
It falls there. It sits underneath the

281
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:44,619
FSX, like the file system umbrella,

282
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,960
right? But it is a fully managed

283
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:48,000
AWS

284
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,639
storage service.

285
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,548
But what's unique about it? What is unique, you know, why, why

286
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:55,750
do they bring it in? It's because it's able

287
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,210
to bring enterprise grade features

288
00:09:58,469 --> 00:10:00,469
to your, to your storage in the

289
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:02,668
cloud. And what do I mean by that? What kind of enterprise

290
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,700
grade features?

291
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:06,548
Accessibility. We support both file,

292
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,269
block, and object storage. And

293
00:10:09,548 --> 00:10:11,658
for, you know, lots of times, I, I kind of always

294
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:12,808
highlight block because

295
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:15,629
we are, we're underneath the file system, right? FSX

296
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:17,668
file system, right? And people think of ONTA. Lots of times

297
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:19,485
people think of NFS. SMB,

298
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:21,884
but we also support Block. And about 30% of

299
00:10:21,884 --> 00:10:24,085
the deployments of FSXONTAP

300
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:26,166
are leveraging Block, lots of times

301
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,245
for things like self-managed databases and those types

302
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:29,865
of things. So we do do Block as well.

303
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:32,975
Beyond B block, we also support multi-protocol

304
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:35,035
access. And that, what we mean by that is

305
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:36,565
one set of data, right?

306
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:39,085
You can access it with NFS and SMB

307
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:41,806
and lots of times customers have those requirements, right, on-prem

308
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:43,985
as well, right? And also

309
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:46,525
S3, and I, I'd be remiss if I didn't really

310
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:47,660
call that. That one out because,

311
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:50,171
um, that is, was just announced,

312
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:52,421
right, this week, um, at the, uh,

313
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,822
at the keynote, right?

314
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,182
That FSX or ONTA

315
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,932
can be an endpoint to all these different

316
00:10:57,932 --> 00:11:00,091
now ADS services that leverage S3,

317
00:11:00,182 --> 00:11:01,261
like Bedrock,

318
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,610
Redshift, right? All of those now. So

319
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,961
now you can have one set of data

320
00:11:05,302 --> 00:11:07,400
and do like, you know, uh, uh,

321
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:09,631
AI type of stuff on that same set of data. Now,

322
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:11,701
that's not what this talk is about, but I did just wanna

323
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:13,701
make sure I highlighted, right, that that new announcement

324
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:14,322
just came out.

325
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:17,700
Um, so then resiliency and protection, um,

326
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,210
high availability. Essentially,

327
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,558
there's two nodes for an FSX OONTAP system,

328
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,580
and they're replicating data back and forth,

329
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,899
and so that your data is always available when you need

330
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,009
it. And really the superpower of

331
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:30,298
ONTAP, right, is snapshots. So

332
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:32,298
that you always have a local copy of your data. And why

333
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:33,479
do I say superpower? Because

334
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:36,379
they are pointer-based, they are instantaneous.

335
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,984
They, um, only do deltas, and

336
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:41,065
they're really the bedrock to use the,

337
00:11:41,144 --> 00:11:43,215
the AI term. They're the bedrock of what

338
00:11:43,215 --> 00:11:45,303
ONTAP has been built on for 30 years, and we're taking

339
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:46,384
that same type of

340
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:49,024
really enterprise grade storage functionality

341
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,104
that a lot of the other functionality that's in ONTAP is

342
00:11:51,104 --> 00:11:53,384
based on snapshots as well. So, um, and

343
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:55,384
I'll show you later on, like, like, why that's

344
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:57,484
important as well for this particular deployment,

345
00:11:57,864 --> 00:12:00,224
uh, for use with EBS and FSXONTAP.

346
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,250
Data security. This one's always, always

347
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,210
super important in the cloud.

348
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,889
Um, it's, you know, FSX FONTA

349
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:08,928
has, is secured from the bottom up, right? If you

350
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,029
start at the bottom of the stack,

351
00:12:10,308 --> 00:12:12,330
data at rest is encrypted with

352
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,269
KMS or a customer KMS key.

353
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:16,729
Um, if you go up a level from that stack.

354
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:19,065
We can do uh data in transit. We

355
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:20,683
can encrypt with SMB encryption,

356
00:12:21,134 --> 00:12:23,144
NFS with Kerberos. We also support

357
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:24,923
IPSec, right? Um,

358
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:27,344
then we also integrate with Active Directory, so

359
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:29,625
you have only the right people can talk to the files,

360
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:32,183
right, um, for, for SMB and NFS.

361
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:35,024
And then beyond that, even, right, then we also

362
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:37,043
have, um, immutable storage options.

363
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:39,423
Um, what I mean by that is that you can say, hey,

364
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:41,864
once this data has been written, it cannot be

365
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:44,065
deleted for a certain number of time. And we support

366
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:45,043
compliance.

367
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:47,719
Immutable storage, which means nobody

368
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:49,840
can change it. Not even, not even AWS. If you

369
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,038
call into a support ticket and you've put a lock

370
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,000
on that data for some certain period of time,

371
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,340
not even AWS, uh, uh,

372
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:57,820
administrators can delete it.

373
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:00,399
So it really is that, that level of protection. And

374
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,580
then one step on top of that even

375
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,918
is the malware protection.

376
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:06,349
There's a feature called autonomous ransomware

377
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:08,500
protection, um, that's built into the storage

378
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,580
layer. There's no external client that does this,

379
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,869
that looks for entropy changes or

380
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:14,989
looks for, uh, file extension changes.

381
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,308
And when it does that, it takes one of those immutable

382
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:19,590
snapshots instantaneously. So you can

383
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,210
make sure you stop it. Track. And not only is it taking that snapshot

384
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:24,469
with the version that's coming out really soon,

385
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,690
it's actually taking us a couple of snapshots right before that

386
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,849
as well, so that you can

387
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:30,288
go back in time before that you even noticed

388
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:32,269
that the um attack was happening.

389
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,668
So again, we're giving you that kind of capability,

390
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,710
um, with this, this enterprise grade.

391
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,288
Here's a big one, right? Always important, price and

392
00:13:39,288 --> 00:13:41,250
performance, um, data footprint reduction,

393
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,889
FSX for RTA supports deduplication.

394
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:46,529
Compaction, compression, right? Those are

395
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:48,928
very important, uh, things to keep that storage

396
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,529
footprint, right, to a minimal amount.

397
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:52,840
It also supports data tiering,

398
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:55,200
where essentially data tiering is, um, we have an

399
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,250
SSD layer or an FSXONTA, but if we

400
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,629
notice that there are blocks that are cold,

401
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,250
then it will tear those blocks off

402
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,710
into the capacity tier. And so that can also

403
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:06,889
help reduce, um, you know, your overall

404
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,849
cost for, for running, uh, that storage.

405
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:11,349
And, and this can also, it'll come up again when we look at,

406
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:13,609
uh, the disaster recovery, uh, scenario.

407
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:15,469
Um, and then finally,

408
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,190
we can easily replicate data

409
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,298
using SnapMirror, which is again a snapshot-based thing to

410
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:22,469
other regions. And we also support a

411
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:24,509
feature called Flex clones. Flex clones are

412
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:25,609
really important because

413
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,389
they are, again, they're leveraging snapshots. They're,

414
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,710
so that you can create an instant

415
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,070
copy of your data.

416
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:34,558
And then, um, and since we're pointer-based,

417
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,840
um, any new rights are

418
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,259
the only thing that are saved, right? So it makes it a very

419
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,840
way inefficient. I'll point to later how that

420
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:44,619
can play in some of the, uh, VMware,

421
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:45,798
uh, flows later.

422
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,928
OK. So that's um that's

423
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:50,090
the uh FSX RONTAP.

424
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:54,450
So like, so now I said, OK, we got

425
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,729
FSX FONTAP and we have EBS. How

426
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,629
do these two

427
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:00,519
services play together? Well, we have two options, right?

428
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:03,000
Um, one is a data store, a supplemental

429
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,250
data store. And for that, as I said before, right,

430
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,690
we support multiple protocols. So we support NFS

431
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,000
data stores, and we support ISCSI data stores,

432
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:12,250
and also for Block now, we support NVME

433
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,349
data stores, right? So it's really whichever

434
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:16,359
one you're more comfortable with, right? If you've been

435
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:18,210
using NFS data stores on-prem.

436
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,000
Use it the same way in the cloud. If you've been using Block

437
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,899
and you're familiar with that,

438
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:24,259
then bring Block into the cloud, right? So both of those,

439
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,580
you have the options of, of, of whatever data

440
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,599
store you want. The other thing, right, that

441
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:30,879
we do, if you're not talking about external data store

442
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:33,080
itself, is that we can be guest attached

443
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,739
storage. So we're just essentially,

444
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
maybe you have some type of shared

445
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:39,879
uh storage requirement, right? And

446
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,899
multiple VEMs need to access that data,

447
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,308
right? And so we can be guest

448
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:46,529
mounts and we support NFS and SMB

449
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,619
as guest mounts to your VMs

450
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,759
that are running inside of EVS.

451
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,639
So, um, a little bit of an architectural picture.

452
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,798
Um, I won't super deep dive, but just at the

453
00:15:57,798 --> 00:15:59,940
highest level, right? If you look at this picture,

454
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,469
what do you see? You see that the EVS deployment,

455
00:16:02,538 --> 00:16:04,719
right, has an overlay network that's kind of, uh, shown

456
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:07,418
there. It's deployed into

457
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:10,239
your VPC, the customer VPC, right?

458
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,399
There's no shadow VPC, it goes right in

459
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,428
there. And what else is deployed

460
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:16,109
into that exact same VPC?

461
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:17,450
FSX RONTAP.

462
00:16:17,908 --> 00:16:19,950
Now, you see there's, um, you see

463
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,989
there's a couple of like uh ENI's there. That's just

464
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:24,139
the way FSX RONTAP plugs into any, it's

465
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:26,389
a, it's a managed service. That's just the way it plugs in anytime

466
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:27,750
you're gonna deploy FSX for ONTAP.

467
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:30,200
So the, the way then to connect

468
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,408
this up as a data store is you set up a

469
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,029
NFS, for example, an NFS file

470
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:35,960
server, right,

471
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:38,529
on your FSX for RONTAP system.

472
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:41,109
You go into the vSphere

473
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:42,599
client that was deployed.

474
00:16:43,048 --> 00:16:45,259
And you go through the steps to say,

475
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:47,969
set up a data store. All you do is choose

476
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:49,009
the IP address

477
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,450
of the of the NFS server that you set up

478
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,440
on FSX for OnTap.

479
00:16:53,048 --> 00:16:55,090
Like I, I wrote the guide for how to, how to set

480
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:55,629
this up.

481
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,440
It was boring, right? I didn't have anything to

482
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,469
write. I was like, do what you've always done, right? It's the

483
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:02,548
exact same steps. The only thing, oh yeah, by the

484
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:04,709
way, we do connect up with

485
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,880
an ENI and you got to update the

486
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,000
security group on that ENI to make sure that the

487
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,259
NFS ports are open.

488
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,000
That's it. That's the only unique thing I had to do. Other than that, it's

489
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,078
the same way you have a data store, right? So the,

490
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:17,479
so then my, my, my takeaway from this is like

491
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:19,578
you set up a, a NFS server

492
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,858
and you connect it the same way that you've, that you've

493
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:22,559
always done it.

494
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:25,159
So very simple to, to hook up. Oh,

495
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,198
and one other thing I forgot to mention is that, so I have it

496
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:29,358
shown here, right, in the same VPC. You obviously

497
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:31,438
don't have to put your FSX RONTAP system in the

498
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:33,698
same VPC, right, as your,

499
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:36,009
as your um EVS. You could put it into a

500
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:38,108
separate VPC and do like VPC

501
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:38,698
pairing.

502
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,479
Technically, you could do Transit Gateway, but

503
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:43,718
I would not recommend Transit Gateway for a, for a data

504
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:44,659
store, uh, in general.

505
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:47,199
So that's one option, right?

506
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,088
The second option was the other one that I mentioned, you know,

507
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,338
guest attached storage, right? And for that,

508
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
it's similar, right? The, you still have the NI,

509
00:17:54,979 --> 00:17:56,660
you still can be deployed in the same VPC,

510
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:59,039
but we're attaching to the VMs themselves

511
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,660
that are running inside your EVS like overlay

512
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,729
network, right? So you have your VMs that are up

513
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,979
and running there, and you're gonna mount those VMs.

514
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:08,174
Now, the other thing that's slightly different. Here

515
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:10,375
right before with the, with the data stores were coming

516
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,844
directly from the NSXi hosts.

517
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:14,015
With, uh, a guest mount,

518
00:18:14,295 --> 00:18:16,384
there is a virtual router, and that's, it's

519
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:18,493
shown in the picture here is like an NSX Edge router,

520
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:20,574
right? Um, and so essentially, the,

521
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:23,174
the data does have to be moved right between the, the

522
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:25,134
kind of overlay network to the underlay network.

523
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:28,134
But the nice thing is, is that when you do that deployment.

524
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,160
Amazon, right, is part of that cloud builder, it does

525
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,539
all of that for you, right? And

526
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:35,900
if you go into your NSX and you want to add a new

527
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,739
network segment,

528
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,578
there's BGP on that virtual router.

529
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:41,868
It's gonna automatically update your ADBS

530
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:43,939
route tables to be able to get to that.

531
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,328
So it makes it super, super easy to do.

532
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:48,618
Not a lot of, hey, here's the special things that I have to

533
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:50,699
do to make this work. Um, and again, the

534
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:53,039
only thing you have to do is make sure that you have your ports open.

535
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:55,709
You want to set up NFS, you log into your VM

536
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:56,848
and you do mount.

537
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,430
Nothing more than mount, right? As long as that, those

538
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,469
ports are open, you got it up and running. Now here's

539
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:03,549
the other important thing I want to say here is, right? Remember we

540
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:05,059
talked about multi-protocol, right?

541
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,430
This is this scenario where lots of customers, if

542
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,848
they have multi-protocol requirements, right?

543
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,529
This is where they might want to set up some shared data store,

544
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:14,789
and you can have that one set of data. Your VM, this

545
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:16,910
NEDS can access that data, and your

546
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,670
SMB, uh, Linux, I mean, sorry,

547
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:21,029
Windows client can also access that same

548
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:23,029
data, right? So it's really giving you complete control

549
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,078
there. So

550
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:27,439
now we're gonna get into like, you know, some of this cost optimization.

551
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,180
Um, you know, we're gonna talk about several ways, right,

552
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:32,219
that, that the, uh, NFS, I'm sorry, the

553
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:34,380
FSSONTAP can help with some

554
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,500
different areas of, of, of operating your

555
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,769
environment. One is cost optimization.

556
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:41,098
And it's basically the ability to decouple, compute

557
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:41,750
and storage,

558
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:44,140
because for the, uh, ESXI host

559
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,209
right they're deployed right now with the I4I metal, you get

560
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:47,519
storage and compute together.

561
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:50,059
And so we're gonna help decouple that to, to

562
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:51,039
reduce your overall cost.

563
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:54,209
Um, next is the, if you're,

564
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,680
you need to do VM backups, right, we can help you

565
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:59,009
improve the performance and reliability of doing those backups,

566
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:00,979
making sure that you're meeting your SLAs.

567
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,828
And then finally,

568
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,358
improve operational excellence, like take everything that

569
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:06,459
you've been doing on-prem

570
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,880
and replicate that the same way and doing

571
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,719
it in the cloud.

572
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,430
So we're gonna start with lowering the total cost of ownership.

573
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:17,519
Um, one of the things about FSXONTAP

574
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,769
is it's very flexible. Um, and

575
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,890
so there's multiple storage types and performance

576
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,969
options. So let's just say that you were setting

577
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:26,088
up your, you know, your data store, and

578
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:27,630
at some point, you know, you had.

579
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:30,390
Um, uh, you know, some VMs are running there, but I also

580
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,509
need to add some more VMs that have a

581
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:34,750
higher performance need. You can simply

582
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,108
change the throughput on your FSX

583
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:38,029
RONTAP system.

584
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:40,640
And as I said before, it's an HA pair, right? So

585
00:20:40,868 --> 00:20:42,910
it's, um, it's, uh, an active passive.

586
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:45,170
And so if you want to change the SKU

587
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,890
and add more performance to your storage.

588
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:50,380
It does it non-destructively because it does automatic

589
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,420
failovers. So you never lose access to

590
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,459
your data while you're doing those. And so you can scale up and

591
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:56,539
scale down your performance needs as you need

592
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:58,578
them, right? You can scale up your IOPs that

593
00:20:58,578 --> 00:21:00,900
are needed for it, right? So it really gives you that, that

594
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,598
full ability to, to handle

595
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:04,858
whatever you need at the time that you need it.

596
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,868
Another one is the built-in storage efficiencies.

597
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,400
This one cannot be overlooked. Obviously, this, you know, I

598
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,838
said before, the deduplication, the compression and compaction.

599
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,479
With VDI workloads and deduplication, we

600
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:17,299
can save up to like 70%

601
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,180
on your, on your, uh, footprint, right? So that's,

602
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:22,150
can be a significant cost savings.

603
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:24,838
So, so definitely, you know, that those built-in storage efficiencies

604
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:25,630
are very important.

605
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,078
And finally, like we can decouple the storage from compute.

606
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:29,279
I've got a few slides that kind of, you know,

607
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:31,519
animate and show this, uh, in action.

608
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,939
So for a storage scaling example, um,

609
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:37,019
this is the 4-node minimum I was talking about before,

610
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,759
right? For,

611
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:40,338
uh, I4I metals, you're getting, you know, 30

612
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:42,578
terabytes of storage. All that's not usable,

613
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:45,019
but 30 tibobytes of storage, um, per,

614
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,410
uh, ESXihost, you know, 64, uh,

615
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:48,118
CPUs.

616
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:51,059
And you're, you're running along just fine, right?

617
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:53,009
You're happy with everything. And then you know what,

618
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,430
I need a little bit more storage, right? I need 40

619
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,739
terabytes more storage.

620
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,269
So what's the solution, right?

621
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:01,420
If you don't, if you're just having that, you know, tightly

622
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,559
coupled, um, you know, hyperconverged

623
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:05,779
CPU and storage coming in together, you have

624
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:07,699
to add 2 more ESXi hosts,

625
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:10,799
2 more ipori metal just to get that 40

626
00:22:11,328 --> 00:22:12,400
tabbytes more of storage.

627
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,299
So that's unnecessary compute cost, right? You're not, you

628
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,818
didn't really need that extra compute.

629
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,838
So what we can do is bring in the 40 terabytes

630
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,140
on a supplemental data store from FSX

631
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,739
for ONTAP.

632
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:25,259
And, and not only are we bringing in the 40 tibobytes,

633
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:27,259
right? We're also doing de-dupe compression,

634
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:30,098
all those types of storage efficiency features. So

635
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,140
maybe you don't even need 40 tibobytes, right? So

636
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,259
it just depends on, on, on your, on your workload

637
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,059
and your use case.

638
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,459
So what I want to show here with this graph, right, is essentially,

639
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:40,750
right, that advantage that we bring in, right? As

640
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,029
your storage and your, your EBS environment

641
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,189
grows, right? That's gonna grow more and more, right?

642
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:47,670
So you're gonna have, you're gonna get more and more value out

643
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,750
of, you know, scaling those things

644
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,910
independently. Now, obviously this is, has some

645
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,989
type, this, you know, this chart is built in with some

646
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:56,049
assumptions about how much compute

647
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:58,068
I need, how much storage I need for how much compute. But

648
00:22:58,068 --> 00:23:00,150
you can see, you know, as you really grow, you're gonna be

649
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,328
saved up in the millions of dollars.

650
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:04,084
The other kind of important thing on this particular

651
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:06,125
slide is that what we're showing for that

652
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,604
cost is just the cost by not

653
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:11,064
adding unnecessary ESXi

654
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:12,424
hosts. But

655
00:23:12,703 --> 00:23:14,983
by not adding unnecessary ESXi

656
00:23:14,983 --> 00:23:17,144
hosts, you're also reducing your core count.

657
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:19,404
The VCF subscriptions are tied to

658
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:21,404
core count. So we don't, we don't know what those numbers

659
00:23:21,404 --> 00:23:23,015
are because they're different for every customer,

660
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:25,775
but you're actually also saving on your subscription

661
00:23:25,775 --> 00:23:27,625
at the same time. So it can be very powerful.

662
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:31,588
All right. So that's, you know, that

663
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:33,769
decoupling is compute story is pretty straightforward

664
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:35,890
story, right? Um, and, and obviously this

665
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,890
is gonna change, right, as they add different, more

666
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,108
types of nodes when, when different things make sense.

667
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:42,680
Um, but beyond that, right, you've got to back

668
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,670
up your VMs. And so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna kind of compare

669
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,289
how you back up VMs and EVS

670
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:47,939
on VSAN,

671
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:50,529
and then how it would work if you're leveraging FSX

672
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:54,848
RTP. So

673
00:23:54,848 --> 00:23:56,828
here's a backup, right? You have a VSAN,

674
00:23:57,338 --> 00:23:59,380
you have uh an a current image, you have

675
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,598
a VM and you wanna do a backup of that VM.

676
00:24:01,979 --> 00:24:04,118
So you need to bring in some type of external backup

677
00:24:04,118 --> 00:24:06,039
service to, to, to do the backup.

678
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:08,500
And so what that's gonna do is it's gonna take that

679
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:10,318
uh VMware snapshot, right?

680
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:13,019
And then that VMware snapshot has to be transferred.

681
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:14,459
Now, when you think about this,

682
00:24:14,858 --> 00:24:16,759
this is putting a load on your

683
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:19,259
ESXI host, right? Having to do this work.

684
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:20,088
So you gotta think about,

685
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,739
are these big VMs? Can I do this in a certain SLA

686
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:24,769
in a certain window, right? When I'm, when I'm

687
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:26,795
off of, of. Production, you know,

688
00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:29,233
key hours, right? So you gotta just keep all those

689
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:29,875
things in mind.

690
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:32,314
And then, so, you know, this can be a, it

691
00:24:32,314 --> 00:24:34,394
can be a slow backup process. It depends on the size, it depends on what all

692
00:24:34,394 --> 00:24:36,545
you have set up there. But to me, the other

693
00:24:36,545 --> 00:24:38,594
important part here is that there's a VMware snapshot that's

694
00:24:38,594 --> 00:24:40,775
taken. That's to have a VM consistent image,

695
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:43,509
right? The existence of that VM

696
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:44,739
consistent image, right,

697
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:47,029
has a performance penalty. And that's because as

698
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:48,299
future rights come in,

699
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:50,789
it has to keep track of the delta

700
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,250
with the current snapshot.

701
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:54,868
That has been shown to have a performance

702
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,949
impact. There's blogs out there about it, right? And a lot of the

703
00:24:56,949 --> 00:24:58,989
things that try to correct it are basically by removing

704
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:00,789
snapshots. So then are you messing with your SLA?

705
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:03,568
Um, so, so you have to keep that in mind. So, you

706
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,769
know, it's more of a management difficulty. You have a, a,

707
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,088
uh, another backup service, you got to make sure that, you know, it's

708
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:10,630
not affecting your, your ESXI workloads.

709
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:12,848
And, um, so you're just adding a, a

710
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:15,049
bit of complexity to your overall backup

711
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,049
process. Now, let's compare that

712
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,150
with doing your backups if you're running,

713
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,519
uh, your data stores on

714
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,608
FSX for ONTAP instead of on,

715
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:24,229
on VSAN.

716
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,259
So we still have this current image, right?

717
00:25:26,618 --> 00:25:28,900
The, the main thing is we're gonna set up a separate FSX

718
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,979
RONTAP system just to, to house

719
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:31,608
the backups.

720
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,930
Now the good thing about this separate system is that we

721
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,098
can scale it down, right? We don't need a large

722
00:25:36,098 --> 00:25:38,098
throughput on it, right? So you'll pay less for throughput. We're

723
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:40,368
gonna put a, put a pretty minimal SSD

724
00:25:40,368 --> 00:25:42,598
tier, like 90, you know, 5%

725
00:25:42,598 --> 00:25:44,689
of the data will be sitting on the object

726
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:46,739
tier. And then you basically are going

727
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:48,900
to be doing where you're gonna still take

728
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,219
that VMware snapshot. Um, and that's

729
00:25:51,219 --> 00:25:53,059
if you need a VM consistent image. Um.

730
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,519
Not, uh, on-prem. I've, I've talked to multiple people

731
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,709
who say, on-prem, lots of times, we

732
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:59,920
just need crash consistent. We don't even need a

733
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,118
VM consistent image. But for

734
00:26:02,118 --> 00:26:04,150
this, this exercise, right, it depends on the

735
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,519
application, right? But for this exercise, we're gonna say,

736
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:07,799
hey, OK, we're doing the same thing, right? We're gonna take

737
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,299
a, a VMware snapshot.

738
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,799
Um, then we leverage that, you know,

739
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,160
that superpower of ONTA was that instantaneous

740
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,920
snapshot.

741
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,529
Um, and that just, you know, happens instantaneously. And

742
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:18,328
once you've done that,

743
00:26:18,608 --> 00:26:21,000
here's the key, is that you can remove that VMware snapshot,

744
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:23,250
right? So now you're no longer gonna be having that

745
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,108
performance penalty. Now we also use,

746
00:26:25,598 --> 00:26:26,588
um, that other

747
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:29,410
technology, SnapMirror, which is snapshot-based.

748
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,848
And it keeps that data d-duped and

749
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:33,368
compressed in transit.

750
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:35,809
So you're, so you're able to move the data and do

751
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:38,289
the backups faster, um, by leveraging

752
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:40,449
that same thing. The other main thing to, to, to

753
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:41,634
look, look at this. Picture?

754
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,414
Is this affecting your ESXi hosts? No. It's

755
00:26:44,414 --> 00:26:46,894
at the storage layer, right? It's doing this, this replication

756
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:48,894
at the storage layer. So you're offloading

757
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,693
that to the storage layer and not affecting your ESXi

758
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,074
hosts. That's another big advantage.

759
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,443
So, you know, so this is giving you that faster backup

760
00:26:55,443 --> 00:26:57,805
process. That snapshot was, the VMware snapshot

761
00:26:57,805 --> 00:26:59,973
was deleted instantaneously. So that's zero

762
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:02,055
performance impact. And then a minimal

763
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:04,213
storage overhead because we have the, the data d-upped

764
00:27:04,213 --> 00:27:06,255
and compressed, and we also move it d-upped and

765
00:27:06,255 --> 00:27:06,854
compressed.

766
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,660
So that's the comparison of those two.

767
00:27:11,318 --> 00:27:13,640
Now let's look at um how we

768
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,390
can operate the same way on-premises

769
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,519
as we do in the cloud. Um, and so for this

770
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:21,059
particular scenario, this is obviously talking about having on-Tap

771
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:23,078
on-prem, right? So we have ONTAP on-prem

772
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:24,078
and we have a data store.

773
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,439
Well, so when we set up our, you

774
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:27,509
know, EBS environment,

775
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,029
we can set up that data store. the same way. And it's just

776
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:32,059
giving you consistency. So having that

777
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:34,150
consistency, right, helps with discovery

778
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,229
and planning, right? And say, hey, however I'm

779
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:38,269
setting this up in here, whatever tools I'm using,

780
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:40,489
whatever automation, whatever, you know, maybe

781
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,789
playbooks I have for setting up my data stores

782
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:44,910
and managing those, I can do that

783
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,588
the exact same way in the cloud.

784
00:27:48,118 --> 00:27:49,640
Avoid rewriting applications,

785
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:52,449
because, you know, this is an EBS, right? You can take an exact

786
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:54,519
image. It could be a very old image, right? And it might

787
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,759
not be one that's supported anymore, right? And

788
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,799
so you don't have to rewrite anything. You bring it up

789
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,838
into the cloud, you operate it in exactly the same

790
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:02,949
way. Um, and then you have

791
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:05,229
a simple and safe migration. Again, that same SnapMirror

792
00:28:05,229 --> 00:28:07,390
I just talked about, right? You're gonna move the data

793
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,430
deep and compress a very easy way.

794
00:28:09,469 --> 00:28:11,509
You take your data store on-prem, you just SnapMirror it up to the

795
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:12,078
cloud.

796
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,799
Um, and so you're really getting the full interoperability,

797
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:17,180
right? All those, you know, NSX managers, vSphere

798
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,380
clients, if you had any plug-ins to your vSphere

799
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,930
client, right, you can bring those up as well.

800
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:23,390
So you really are operating the same way if you had any,

801
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:25,828
you know, automations, those work the same way. Your playbooks

802
00:28:25,828 --> 00:28:26,848
all work the same way.

803
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:30,068
But we're also preserving enterprise grade capabilities.

804
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:32,689
Things like, I mentioned Flex clones

805
00:28:32,689 --> 00:28:34,719
before. So NetApp has a,

806
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:36,930
uh, technology along with VMware

807
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,088
called VAAI which offloads

808
00:28:39,088 --> 00:28:41,328
certain um actions to the storage

809
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:43,328
layer, um, to help you operate faster.

810
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:45,608
And one of those is if you create a VM from

811
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:46,189
a template.

812
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,930
Um, you can leverage NetApp's Flex

813
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,130
clone technology, right, was that instantaneous copy

814
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,189
only storing the delta blocks. And so you can

815
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,209
spin up VMs much faster with

816
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:57,559
much less overhead by leveraging that

817
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,189
technology as well.

818
00:28:58,949 --> 00:29:00,949
Also, maybe you had Snaplock, right? Maybe you

819
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,170
had that on-prem and you wanted to take that same level

820
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,509
of protection into the cloud.

821
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:06,828
So you're getting that consistent operational experience

822
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,549
on both sides.

823
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
All right, so now this gets us to uh

824
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,108
one that I'm really excited about, um, a disaster recovery

825
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:15,150
scenario that we have um with FSX for

826
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,318
OnTA, um, in this type of environment. Now

827
00:29:17,318 --> 00:29:19,318
again, this is talking about on tap to

828
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:21,439
on tap, right? You have something on-prem,

829
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:24,098
uh, a data center running, that's running on vSphere.

830
00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:26,959
Um, and you want to set up a disaster recovery

831
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:29,199
in the cloud. So what you can do is set a minimal

832
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:31,529
EVS cluster, right, that's deployed, um,

833
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,318
with it, and you would also keep a minimal FSXRWNTA

834
00:29:34,318 --> 00:29:34,828
footprint.

835
00:29:35,118 --> 00:29:36,598
So when you're doing this, right, you're gonna

836
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,959
replicate data up and most of that data

837
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:41,039
is going to be going into the capacity tier. You're gonna have a very

838
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,219
thin SSD tier, and you're gonna have just those 4

839
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:45,400
ESXI hosts, you know, kind of like a pilot light, right? This,

840
00:29:45,598 --> 00:29:47,640
but right now, the 4 ESXI hosts is like the

841
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,920
minimum. Um. And that's tied to VCF

842
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,049
5.2.1. So that could change in the future, but right

843
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:54,049
now that's, that's the minimum. So, so we really have

844
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:55,170
a really minimal footprint.

845
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:57,559
Most of the data is going into the object

846
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,598
tier, and we only have 4 ESXi

847
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,900
hosts. So,

848
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:04,709
now what happens is, hey, a disaster

849
00:30:04,709 --> 00:30:05,809
occurs. Um,

850
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:08,269
what you can then do is expand

851
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:10,390
the number, like now I'm gonna go production on this

852
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,890
side, right? I'm gonna need some more,

853
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,509
uh, compute, right? So I'm gonna add 4

854
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:15,949
additional ESXi hosts.

855
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,509
So I'm gonna scale up the SXI and

856
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:20,670
what I'm also gonna do is scale up the storage.

857
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,789
I'm gonna change the throughput on the FSX for

858
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:24,910
ONTAP system from maybe a 512

859
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,989
or 128, and I'm gonna put it to a 1

860
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:28,689
gig or a 2 gig SKU,

861
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:31,108
right? And so you're gonna meet the production workload, but

862
00:30:31,108 --> 00:30:33,189
you weren't paying for that the whole time, right? That's really the beauty

863
00:30:33,189 --> 00:30:35,410
of this is you only bring it up as you need. Now,

864
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,584
obviously, with this type of scenario You have to figure out

865
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:39,134
what are your SLAs, right?

866
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,805
Does this fit within your company's SLAs, right?

867
00:30:42,045 --> 00:30:44,064
To have, because it will take some time, right,

868
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:46,604
to bring up additional ESXI

869
00:30:46,604 --> 00:30:48,184
hosts, right? It will take some time

870
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:50,625
to, um, change the throughput, and

871
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:52,723
it's, you know, only like 30 some minutes, right, of your, of

872
00:30:52,723 --> 00:30:54,844
your FSX VONTAP system. But there is, you know, an

873
00:30:54,844 --> 00:30:56,584
impact there. So you just got to take all of that into account.

874
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:59,509
Um, and here's the other nice thing, right? Is that,

875
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:01,858
OK, we failed over, we're operating in the cloud,

876
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:02,729
and now

877
00:31:03,108 --> 00:31:05,269
we're, you know, we've, we've corrected things and

878
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:07,130
now we want to go back to where we were before.

879
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:10,098
So you start replicating your data back all this

880
00:31:10,098 --> 00:31:12,588
and using that SnapMirror technology, de-dupe and compressed,

881
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:14,769
the data, you know, very minimal footprint coming back,

882
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,380
um, when you do the replication back.

883
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:19,088
I mean, you scale down that EBS cluster, you no longer

884
00:31:19,088 --> 00:31:19,680
need 4,

885
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:22,338
you know, 8 ESXI hosts, right? So you

886
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,118
can scale that, that back down to the minimum.

887
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,578
And here's the really cool thing, is that this

888
00:31:26,578 --> 00:31:29,209
was a feature that's been asked about for a long time for FSXOTA,

889
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,279
and that was the ability to do

890
00:31:30,618 --> 00:31:31,289
SSD,

891
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:34,088
well, shrink, or I think it's called SSD decrease.

892
00:31:34,348 --> 00:31:36,420
But now, once you've done that,

893
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:38,650
you have to like at first evacuate the data up

894
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,818
into the capacity tier. But once that, the

895
00:31:40,818 --> 00:31:43,180
data's been moved to the capacity tier, you can then shrink

896
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,338
down that SSD so this is not being used

897
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:47,059
anymore and really keep that minimum footprint.

898
00:31:47,368 --> 00:31:49,368
Then you re-establish your, your

899
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:51,449
original snap relationship and you're back to this very

900
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:52,410
low level, right?

901
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:54,689
Had just what you need available for you at the

902
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:57,430
time. Um,

903
00:31:57,598 --> 00:31:59,098
so, you know, obviously.

904
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:02,118
Disaster recovery can be more complex than what it was,

905
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:04,328
right, in that slide. There's a lot to do to

906
00:32:04,328 --> 00:32:06,608
actually fail over, right? Complete working

907
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:07,799
environments on, uh,

908
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:10,049
you know, vSphere environment from one to the other.

909
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,368
So NetApp has a tool called NetApp Disaster Recovery

910
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:14,680
that helps you plan and manage and automate

911
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,729
that. And so it's not only doing the storage, it's

912
00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:18,769
doing the storage with SnapMirror. And this is, this is

913
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:20,368
a tool only for OnTap to On-Tap.

914
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:23,009
And so, but it's, it's, you know, it's also,

915
00:32:23,189 --> 00:32:25,634
um, failing over storage. Compute

916
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:27,834
and networking all together, right? And it has

917
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:29,875
plans for doing that. The other really cool feature

918
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,795
that it has, it has the ability to do

919
00:32:32,134 --> 00:32:34,314
DR testing. And when it does the DR

920
00:32:34,314 --> 00:32:36,983
testing, what it does is it leverages that

921
00:32:36,983 --> 00:32:38,453
same Flex clone technology,

922
00:32:38,713 --> 00:32:40,795
where when you fail over, it takes a Flex clone

923
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:42,875
and all the new data is being written on the Flex clone.

924
00:32:43,154 --> 00:32:45,324
And again, it was an instantaneous copy of your data,

925
00:32:45,594 --> 00:32:47,434
and only new deltas are being written.

926
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,654
Once that DR test is over.

927
00:32:50,108 --> 00:32:52,269
You just delete the Flex clone and you're back to exactly

928
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:53,009
where you were before.

929
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,549
Um, so this is a tool that's, that was built for

930
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:57,779
this. Um, and since it's on tap to OnTap

931
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,989
is offered at a very competitive price

932
00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:02,189
point, a lot of these tools will

933
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,338
charge per VM. This charges per storage,

934
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:05,449
and it charges it

935
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:08,459
at a very reasonable rate. Um, and it saves

936
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:10,729
you typically around 80% compared to other,

937
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,209
uh, disaster recovery tools that are out there in the market.

938
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:15,789
Um, if you're interested in it, um, just, you know, look up

939
00:33:15,838 --> 00:33:17,989
NetApp disaster recovery, and there's a 30-day

940
00:33:17,989 --> 00:33:18,848
free trial as well.

941
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:22,759
OK. So now switching gears

942
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,920
just a little bit, I'm gonna hop over to

943
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,009
uh Workload Factory.

944
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:27,739
So Workload Factory is a tool

945
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:30,479
that was developed, um, with kind of, uh, uh,

946
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,959
you know, ADS and NetApp together came up with this

947
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,989
plan for how do we want to set up a tool

948
00:33:34,989 --> 00:33:35,890
that will allow you to

949
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:38,939
Optimize and use storage best practices across

950
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:40,979
multiple workloads where FSX ONTAP is

951
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:42,838
being used, right? And so this tool

952
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,108
works for

953
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,259
SQL workloads, um,

954
00:33:46,578 --> 00:33:47,959
Oracle workloads,

955
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:50,338
uh, AI, right? It does a, a

956
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:52,739
plethora of different things. And it does it from planning

957
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,910
to making sure you stay well architected across

958
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,979
those different workloads, because things drift over time.

959
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:59,459
But in this particular case, right, we're talking about

960
00:33:59,459 --> 00:34:01,459
what it's currently doing for VMware workloads.

961
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:03,900
And, um, for what it's doing right now is it basically

962
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,309
has some planning stuff, and it has this TCO calculator,

963
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:08,438
which I'm gonna show in a minute. And it has a way to make

964
00:34:08,438 --> 00:34:11,119
sure that when you deploy your data stores, they're

965
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,398
gonna be leveraged by EBS that it does it

966
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:15,179
um with the optimal configurations.

967
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,809
So. I'm gonna start with the TCO

968
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:19,998
calculator. And for this TCO calculator,

969
00:34:20,197 --> 00:34:22,278
basically, it's, it's just a really easy

970
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:24,309
tool. It's really convenient and nice to

971
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:26,318
use that will show you, you know,

972
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:28,617
different, uh, estimate the total cost of ownership

973
00:34:28,728 --> 00:34:30,759
with different deployment scenarios that

974
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:32,798
you can put in there and identify cost

975
00:34:32,798 --> 00:34:35,039
optimizations. I mean, obviously all

976
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:35,628
this data could

977
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,197
be figured out by the ADOS tools as well,

978
00:34:38,318 --> 00:34:40,349
right? ADBS has pricing calculators, but it gets

979
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:42,378
a bit complex and this is a really easy

980
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:44,637
UI that can show it to you very quickly.

981
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,030
So I have a little uh demo on this one.

982
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:49,728
So at the very top here we have um console.

983
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,329
uh workloads.net.com. Anybody can go

984
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:54,559
here. It's free, right? Um,

985
00:34:54,688 --> 00:34:56,688
and then you go into Explore savings. And so

986
00:34:56,688 --> 00:34:59,000
at this point, what you're gonna basically be doing is putting into

987
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,590
the tool.

988
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,530
Hey, what am I looking at my EBS deployment

989
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,639
to be, right? What, how many, how much CPUs

990
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,188
do I need?

991
00:35:05,449 --> 00:35:07,530
How many, um, what's my memory footprint?

992
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:10,309
What's my storage? And we give you these really convenient

993
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:12,530
sliders, right, to move that

994
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,250
information back and forth.

995
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,570
And as you're doing that over on the right-hand side,

996
00:35:15,668 --> 00:35:16,469
right, you can see

997
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,889
what's my total cost gonna be? What's my total cost

998
00:35:19,128 --> 00:35:21,510
for just doing EVS with this particular configuration

999
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,688
or, or EVS plus FSX

1000
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,909
for ONTAP, like how can we potentially save you money there?

1001
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,550
Obviously gonna change depending on your, your, your footprints.

1002
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:30,869
And then also we're saying is that this is the um

1003
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:33,019
1 year, 3-year or on-demand

1004
00:35:33,168 --> 00:35:35,168
for the cost of those I4I metal.

1005
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:36,139
Now, obviously,

1006
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:38,449
as more different instance types comes out, we'll be

1007
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:40,530
adjusting this. Then it's gonna show you, hey,

1008
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,849
this is what my FSX4ONTAP deployment is. This

1009
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,378
is what we expect to save

1010
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:45,500
from a,

1011
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,559
you know, a data uh efficiency standpoint.

1012
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:50,809
And then this is the exact cost that you would pay for the

1013
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:52,030
FSX for ONTAP system.

1014
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,820
Um, what's also really nice, right, I was gonna

1015
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,179
show you that cost, is that over on the right, it

1016
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:58,208
shows you, hey,

1017
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:00,579
here are how many I4ite instances

1018
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:02,889
I need to match that, those parameters,

1019
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,659
but how many do I need that were just for storage,

1020
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:07,639
right? And so it's gonna easily show you,

1021
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:10,019
hey, I, I needed some of these ESXi

1022
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:12,059
hosts just for storage. And it's also gonna lay out

1023
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:14,059
all the costs, cause there are multiple cost

1024
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:15,139
components to EDS.

1025
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,418
There's the um.

1026
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,070
The just the, the there's a VPC, um,

1027
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,289
the EBS control plane, right, that you also had

1028
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:23,409
to pay for. You also had to pay for the route server. So there's

1029
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:25,449
a few other, they're not the major components. The I4I

1030
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,449
metal, right, is the main one, but there are

1031
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:29,489
some other components. So it's gonna take all of that stuff

1032
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:31,750
into account and give you that total cost of ownership

1033
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:33,889
and say, does it make sense to add FSXONTAP

1034
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:36,010
or does it not make sense? And that's just purely

1035
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,269
from a pure cost perspective.

1036
00:36:38,648 --> 00:36:41,168
So that's, that's the, the calculator. Again, well,

1037
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:43,648
you can definitely, uh, log into it. I, I'll show a QR

1038
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,449
code in just a minute.

1039
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:47,030
The other, uh, main tool that we have right now

1040
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,039
is, you know, once you determine, hey, I want to

1041
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,269
use FSX for RONTAP,

1042
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,889
here's my, here's what I was kind of planning to do for it.

1043
00:36:53,148 --> 00:36:55,260
Now I want to actually do the deployment of it. So it's gonna

1044
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,619
deploy your FSX for ONTAP

1045
00:36:57,619 --> 00:36:59,628
system. It's gonna deploy the data storage, it's

1046
00:36:59,628 --> 00:37:01,668
gonna set them up with best practices. You can actually

1047
00:37:01,668 --> 00:37:03,570
even tie it into your EBS environment.

1048
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,219
And have it set,

1049
00:37:05,648 --> 00:37:07,719
like if you're doing NFS for example, and that's what this one

1050
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,719
supports currently, it might, it might add others later.

1051
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,188
For right now, it'll set the right timing

1052
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,320
values. It'll set in connect values,

1053
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:16,519
right? So it's gonna do everything for, for best

1054
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:17,119
practices.

1055
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:20,260
And so this is the QR code.

1056
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,820
Feel free to take a picture of this, and this will take you to

1057
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,820
that calculator. It's 100% free, as

1058
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,478
I said before.

1059
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:28,360
Log in there. And actually, at the very top of that calculator

1060
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,239
is a little email

1061
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,539
that me and a couple other people from my team will

1062
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:33,648
get. So if you start using it and you have any

1063
00:37:33,648 --> 00:37:35,070
questions, feel free to reach out to us.

1064
00:37:36,728 --> 00:37:39,079
So the key takeaways today, right, um, is

1065
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:41,079
that this is bringing control and

1066
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:43,398
consistency. Like when you bring your EVS environment

1067
00:37:43,398 --> 00:37:43,909
in here,

1068
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:46,280
you are getting complete control of your

1069
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,860
VCF environment, right? And if you're

1070
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:50,159
leveraging FSX for ONTAP, right, you're having

1071
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:52,099
that same consistency. If you're using,

1072
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:54,599
uh, you know, ONTAP in the, on-prem, you're

1073
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,719
getting that same way in the cloud.

1074
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,478
We're bringing all those enterprise grade capabilities,

1075
00:37:58,519 --> 00:37:59,918
the deduplication, compression.

1076
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,958
The ability to do snapshots,

1077
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,559
the ability to do autonomous ransomware protection, right?

1078
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:07,000
All of those types of capabilities are also being

1079
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,039
brought into the cloud. And then, of course,

1080
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,958
you know, what people really care about,

1081
00:38:11,438 --> 00:38:13,519
cost savings, right? So we're able

1082
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,559
to decouple that compute and storage as

1083
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,760
well as apply all those efficiencies, and

1084
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,918
that's gonna really help you keep uh your,

1085
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:21,510
your cost uh to as low as

1086
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,019
possible for your EBS deployments.

1087
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:24,958
And

1088
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:27,739
with that, I'll say thank you. Please, um, complete

1089
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,708
that session survey in the mobile app.

1090
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:32,300
Um, and I'll stay around here, um, for any

1091
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,579
questions. I'll just be right down here, I'd be happy to, to, to

1092
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,860
talk with anybody about anything around this, this topic.

1093
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:37,898
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
