1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,490
- All right, good evening everyone,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,820
and thank you so much
for joining us today.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,590
I'm joined with my colleague, Steve,

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,520
who'll be presenting later on,
and my name is Alicia Trent.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,520
I'm humbled to say this is
my fifth year at re:Invent,

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,630
and it gets more and
more exciting every year.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,800
With each presentation,

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,810
what we're finding is that we continue

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,680
to accelerate the growth of
agentic AI and generative AI.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,840
In the past years, we've
talked about computer vision,

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,170
we've talked about bringing
IoT into machine learning

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,060
and leveraging it for
predictive maintenance.

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,980
We've talked about natural language.

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,040
This year we're gonna be
really focused on agentic AI,

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,450
and in this session specifically,

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,640
we're gonna be focused
on the fundamentals.

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,650
Many of the enterprises
that we're working with

18
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,400
are really excited about
generative AI and agentic AI.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,530
However, there's also a
lot of concerns, right?

20
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,080
How do we manage these agents, right?

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,300
There's a lot of concern
around like agents running

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,250
around doing things
that you can't control,

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,930
and we'll really take a step back

24
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,150
and really focus on what you need to do

25
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,400
to be able to scale with confidence

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,313
and control within your organizations.

27
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,060
So we have a packed agenda,

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,280
and so we'll just get straight to it.

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,810
So with agentic AI,

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,970
we believe now is the time to get started.

31
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,640
We've been leveraging
agentic AI across Amazon,

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,610
across many different use
cases from the factory floor

33
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,800
to getting packages to your doorstep,

34
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,020
all the way through AWS
sales and marketing,

35
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,320
driving campaigns to help
support our customers.

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,705
We believe that this
evolution happens internally,

37
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:33,480
and we've already started to
do it within our organization.

38
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,580
So within each department,
we're all tasked

39
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,350
with leveraging agentic AI in the way

40
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,200
that we do business on a day-to-day basis.

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,820
So this transformation began

42
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,620
with the evolution of generative AI.

43
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,980
So originally, generative
AI was an intelligent way

44
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,410
to be able to respond to questions, right?

45
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,630
In a natural way, you can respond

46
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,270
to questions across complex issues.

47
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,020
With agentic AI, now you can
plan, reason, and take action.

48
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,610
And so that's the next evolution

49
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,350
that we're starting to move towards.

50
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,090
And it's really an exciting time

51
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,320
as we think about how it can

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,630
transform the way that you're working.

53
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,420
So in the past, agentic
AI or generative AI

54
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,640
would respond in a very simple way.

55
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,110
Now you could take that

56
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,660
and now become a very capable employee

57
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,840
to be able to help perform
tasks on your behalf.

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,940
So with Gartner, we've partnered with them

59
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,200
and what we found is that

60
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,270
customers are very excited about this.

61
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,430
And by 2028, about a third

62
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,550
of applications will be
leveraging agentic AI.

63
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,820
About 15% of work will
also be done autonomously,

64
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,500
leveraging generative AI.

65
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,900
So those may be shocking,
but the real push

66
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,940
and the real trend
behind this is to be able

67
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,100
to move from a reactive

68
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,320
to now a proactive way of working.

69
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,840
We're able to now take applications

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,690
where in the past you had to
just deal with the applications

71
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,950
that were built, in many cases

72
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,780
that are built from the masses, right?

73
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,330
So if you think about
your ERP, CRM system,

74
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,850
you had to massage it into
the way that you're working.

75
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,620
Now with the tools that we have today,

76
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,300
you think about the way that you work,

77
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,190
you create the agent to help support that,

78
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,600
you connect it to the data sources

79
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,890
that you're working within.

80
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,690
Like you connect it to the applications

81
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,940
that you need to do
these specific actions.

82
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,550
So think about your ERP, CRM systems.

83
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,310
These are in the past,
disconnected systems.

84
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,900
Now you can bring them to together

85
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,110
and be able to bring in
insights across these systems

86
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,380
and be able to communicate
via say, email or Slack.

87
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,750
Again, these were previously
disconnected systems,

88
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,200
but now you're able to work
seamlessly across each one

89
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,980
to be able to start to
accelerate the way you work.

90
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,310
And so the reason why now
is such a critical time

91
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,860
as we think about this,
is that with agentic AI,

92
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,460
what we're seeing is that it's
in the last five, six months.

93
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,390
We're seeing it double in
capabilities every six months.

94
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,830
Like in the past, it was a year,

95
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,560
two years where you're really
seeing this acceleration,

96
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,750
but we believe that this
will continue to double

97
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,330
every six to seven months
as we move forward.

98
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,700
The other area is price performance.

99
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,820
So we're seeing 100x
performance in mid-level

100
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,200
tier capabilities.

101
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,090
So in the past, you could perform

102
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,150
intelligent AI for basic capabilities,

103
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,430
now we're seeing more and
more complex activities

104
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,430
where you can start to
apply AI capabilities.

105
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,520
And the last piece is
that we believe that the

106
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,570
maturity of the enterprise
infrastructure is ready as well.

107
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,390
My colleague Steve will talk
more about the car guardrails

108
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,120
and controls that you can put
in place to be able to help

109
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,030
perform these actions
on a day-to-day basis.

110
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,900
So what does this mean?

111
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,880
So now that you have these tools,

112
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,710
what we're seeing is the evolution

113
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,290
where now you can change
your operating modes, right?

114
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,180
So in the past, you really had to be stuck

115
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,860
with the applications you're working in.

116
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,240
Now you can start to really

117
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,490
start to automate your redundant tasks,

118
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,520
you're able to bring in data
across many different systems

119
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,500
and make more targeted responses.

120
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,380
So think about bringing
in SharePoint information,

121
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,670
information on your desktop,

122
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,280
as well as your structured
databases across Snowflake,

123
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,600
Databricks, et cetera,

124
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,150
to bring together more
insightful intelligence

125
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,563
than you ever have before.

126
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,220
Lastly as we think about, you
know, the evolution of this,

127
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,810
it's being able to scale.

128
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,580
Scale as you have seasonality,

129
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,170
scale as you see demand.

130
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,960
We just had Black Friday,
Cyber Monday pass by,

131
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,720
and we can leverage our
agents to be able to help

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,270
scale to that productivity
as opposed to hiring

133
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,540
new talent to help support
this new increased workload.

134
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,550
And the last area is personalization.

135
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,890
So with these new agentic workflows,

136
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,510
we can personalize them at the edge.

137
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,160
So think about your employees.

138
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,230
You can personalize
responses for every employee.

139
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,510
From an IT person to a legal person.

140
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,950
You can personalize the responses

141
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,840
and the tasks that they're able to do,

142
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,330
as opposed to just leveraging, you know,

143
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,140
task and tools that are
built for the masses.

144
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,970
So some real world examples that we're

145
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,160
starting to see across Amazon

146
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,140
as we look across these new capabilities,

147
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,210
is one, around customer service.

148
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,850
So in the past it's really
been about chat assistance.

149
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,120
Now we're seeing us being
able to leverage agentic AI

150
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,610
to fully automate the customer experience.

151
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,400
So, you know, not only
responding to questions,

152
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,470
but being able to route these questions,

153
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,750
being able to resolve and
manage these questions

154
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,450
from end to end without
human intervention.

155
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,790
The other area is around

156
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,650
the way that we think about manufacturing.

157
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,500
You know, in many cases,
these issues would come in,

158
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,180
it would require multiple handoffs

159
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,590
to be able to resolve them.

160
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,930
Now we're handling about a third of these

161
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,900
autonomously leveraging agentic AI.

162
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,580
The other area's around e-commerce.

163
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,560
So now we're being able to bring in

164
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,210
more data across the web,

165
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,940
how our customers are
interacting with our website,

166
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,760
and being able to provide
things like new pricing,

167
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,010
new paid promotions based on the

168
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,140
buying patterns that
the customer is having.

169
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,120
And in many cases, we're able to salvage,

170
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,970
you know, customers who have
left items in their cart

171
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,120
and being able to convert those
to potential opportunities

172
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,740
in the future as well.

173
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,570
So all of these, what
we're showing is that

174
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,600
we're able to scale leveraging agentic AI

175
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,510
safely and confidently
across an organization.

176
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,010
And we have the tools to be able

177
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,560
to help you be able to do that.

178
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,380
So one thing that we, you know,

179
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,280
thought through as we were

180
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,560
thinking about this agentic AI journey

181
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,350
is that, you know, if you
think about your workday,

182
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,350
think about all the applications
that you touch, right?

183
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,270
So for me to get here today

184
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,920
and to create this presentation,

185
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,050
it took me seven different applications

186
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,850
and tools to get here, right?

187
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,130
That include my email, Outlook,

188
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,490
included Asana, where I
have my projects managed,

189
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,100
included Word, included
Quip, which we use,

190
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,110
included Slack, included Teams,

191
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,170
included a Zoom for me
to record our meetings

192
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,000
and record some of these demos here,

193
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,370
but seven different applications.

194
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,750
And so what does that mean, right?

195
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,583
You know, if you think about

196
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,060
your day to day, what does that mean?

197
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,490
It means that the average worker

198
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,090
has to switch between
context and applications

199
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,500
many different times in a day.

200
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,880
And what that means is that the quality

201
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,910
of responses are at a lower level.

202
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,080
The amount of time it takes

203
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,910
to be able to bring together information

204
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,140
or respond to something,

205
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,300
it's not optimized in
the way that it could be.

206
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,820
And so these are all ways that we believe

207
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,100
that you can accelerate
the way that you do work.

208
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,500
And so that's why we've
introduced Amazon Quick Suite.

209
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,650
So Amazon Quick Suite is really
built for the enterprise.

210
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,310
Connecting data sources,
connecting enterprise applications,

211
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,983
as well as different systems
to help you do your job.

212
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,560
So what I'm gonna share next is a video

213
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,660
in terms of this new
application that we've

214
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,450
just launched in October 9th.

215
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,850
And we will then go into some details

216
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,020
in terms of the capabilities

217
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,120
to help scale across your organization.

218
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,520
- [Announcer] Introducing
Amazon Quick Suite,

219
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,600
a revolutionary solution
that transforms how you work.

220
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,160
Let's say you're a marketing manager

221
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,130
conducting a competitive
benchmarking analysis.

222
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,530
Quick Suite can conduct
comprehensive research

223
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,210
across internal data sources

224
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,090
and the public internet in minutes.

225
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,040
It can also help you better understand

226
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,520
your social media campaign
data with an executive summary

227
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,650
that includes performance metrics,

228
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,540
detailed data analysis,

229
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,390
and messaging adjustment recommendations.

230
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,900
Quick Suite can also help with
automating your notifications

231
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,690
and even creating custom chat agents.

232
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,850
Such as a marketing onboarding assistant

233
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,310
to ensure responses are highly relevant

234
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,110
and specific to your team.

235
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,050
Give your employees Agentic AI superpowers

236
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,673
with Amazon Quick Suite.

237
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,470
- So with Amazon Quick Suite,

238
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,390
so just a number of different use cases

239
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,850
that we're leveraging
across our organization is,

240
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,050
you know, when we're leveraging it

241
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,310
across our customer service

242
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,440
to be able to respond to customer queries

243
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,270
and resolve those issues,

244
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,400
we're leveraging it across
our finance department

245
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,510
to help with invoicing.

246
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,700
So imagine in the past, in those days

247
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,040
where you had to submit
your expense report,

248
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,600
you had to submit your tickets,

249
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,610
sorry, your receipts and information

250
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,200
on your travels that you've done.

251
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,360
We can automate all of
those processes today

252
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,550
leveraging Amazon Quick Suite.

253
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,560
In addition, we're leveraging it across,

254
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,330
you know, several of our e-commerce sites

255
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,040
to be able to help automate

256
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,690
the way that they are
doing business as well.

257
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,060
So some exciting times
with Amazon Quick Suite,

258
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,930
I'd now like to introduce
Steve to the floor.

259
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,420
He'll start to talk about
some critical foundations

260
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,300
to be successful in this new world.

261
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,340
Accessing data, security,

262
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,040
governance, integrations, and scalability,

263
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,750
whether connecting to internal systems,

264
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,110
third party applications,
or other agents or actions.

265
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,090
We have the foundations
to help you connect

266
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,560
to enterprise, scale,

267
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,710
and be ready to scale these applications.

268
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,123
- Great, thank you Alicia.

269
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,210
Hey everybody, good afternoon.

270
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,140
So excited to talk with you today.

271
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,840
A little bit about Quick
Suite, how we set it up,

272
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,250
how we configure Quick Suite,

273
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,390
some of the governance that you

274
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,430
can have in place around it,

275
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,730
the security, the identity aspects of it,

276
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,380
how you connect your identities from your

277
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,990
enterprise environment into Quick Suite.

278
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,000
Talk about, again,

279
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,160
you know, guardrails and how you could

280
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,870
implement different guardrails,

281
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,890
and talk about the security

282
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,143
behind the scenes within
Quick Suite itself.

283
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,330
So quick question though,

284
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,880
is people familiar at
all with Quick Suite yet?

285
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,990
Have you tried it out?

286
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,823
A few of you?

287
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:02,656
A lot of you actually.

288
00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:04,440
Awesome, that's great.

289
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,060
So, excellent.

290
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,290
Want to kind of jump into it,

291
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,960
get you a little bit information about

292
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,520
how we think about privacy.

293
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,720
And so with Quick Suite,
your data stays private.

294
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,910
We never use your data

295
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,910
for training our LLMs,

296
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,850
for any kind of service improvement,

297
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,730
for anything, AWS does
not touch your data.

298
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,650
Your data remains your data,

299
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,140
it's private within your account.

300
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,050
You control what you do
with your data at all times.

301
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,240
So we don't sell it to third parties,

302
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,980
we don't give it to other, you know,

303
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,260
parts of Amazon to analyze.

304
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,553
It's all kept private in your
environment, in your account.

305
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,130
And we encrypt it everywhere, right?

306
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,590
So we encrypt data at rest,

307
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,590
we encrypt it, data in motion,

308
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,780
we encrypt the network layer.

309
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,830
We use AWS customer managed keys

310
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,680
or AWS managed keys for encryption.

311
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,690
So you had that option as well.

312
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,240
And you had that flexibility to

313
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,313
decide how you want to encrypt your data.

314
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,343
On the network side,

315
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:23,180
you can deploy Quick Suite
in your account within a VPC,

316
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,770
you can connect to other data sources,

317
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,860
other AWS applications like Redshift

318
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,040
or Athena, or Lake Formation, or S3

319
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,430
within your protected AWS environment,

320
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,280
within your AWS accounts, within the VPC.

321
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,270
We also have the ability

322
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,470
to have IP restrictions.

323
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,310
So part of Quick Suite
is an admin interface,

324
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,740
but then there's also the web interface

325
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,440
where end users interact with Quick Suite.

326
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,540
And in both those
environments you could set up

327
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,360
IP restrictions to restrict access

328
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,850
to only the trusted IP addresses,

329
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,010
the IP address ranges

330
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,890
known as a cider range that you wanna set.

331
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,230
So you have really great controls

332
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,390
about restricting who can actually

333
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,603
access that data from
your trusted networks.

334
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,920
And then we have VPC endpoint
restrictions as well.

335
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,960
And so across Quick Suite,

336
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,550
there's a number of different capabilities

337
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,530
within Quick Suite itself.

338
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,190
It's built on the foundation
of Amazon QuickSight.

339
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,580
And so the namespace for all of the APIs

340
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,770
is the QuickSight namespace.

341
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,020
And currently we have VPC endpoint support

342
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,380
for all those QuickSight namespace APIs

343
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,290
at the control plane level as
well as the data plane level.

344
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,710
We're adding additional
VPC endpoint support

345
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,620
that'll cover the full
surface area of Quick Suite.

346
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,690
And you'll see that coming
out in the coming weeks

347
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,610
in the next couple months.

348
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,650
But certainly within the next few months

349
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,900
we'll have full VPC endpoint support

350
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,253
across all of Quick Suite.

351
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,340
One of the big ways to control access

352
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,590
within Quick Suite today is through

353
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,660
what we call custom permissions.

354
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,170
And this is the ability to,
you can set granular controls

355
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,110
to restrict capabilities
at the capability level.

356
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,943
And I'll get into that.

357
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,203
I'll show you some demo clips around that.

358
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,240
You can control it at
either the user level,

359
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,290
at the role level,

360
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,570
and I'll explain the different
roles that we have available

361
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,730
or at the overall account level.

362
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,190
And it's a hierarchy in the sense that

363
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,580
the user level is the most
restrictive set of permissions.

364
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,140
So if I have a user that's assigned

365
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,140
a permission at the account level

366
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,730
as well as at the user level,

367
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,920
the user level permission
will take precedent

368
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,723
over any account level permissions.

369
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,960
There's also feature level restrictions

370
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,623
that you can set within
Quick Suite as well.

371
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,930
And there's different features.

372
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,950
So for example, for
QuickSight functionality,

373
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,760
like being able to download
Excel files or PDFs,

374
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,520
or being able to create
data sets or data sources,

375
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,460
those are the finer grained permissions

376
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,470
that you can restrict access to,

377
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,133
again, based on that user
role or account level.

378
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,780
And all this is available with our APIs.

379
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,520
And so this is something
that you can automate.

380
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,760
So if you're thinking about
deploying Quick Suite at scale,

381
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,980
many of our enterprise customers deploy

382
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,190
across many, many AWS accounts

383
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,070
and have many instances
of Quick Suite deployed.

384
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,393
So 100s of accounts.

385
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,570
In some cases even 1,000s.

386
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,930
And so they need to be able
to manage that at scale.

387
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,360
And how you do that is through our APIs.

388
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,370
And so all the permissions that

389
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,080
the custom permissions that you set,

390
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,610
really all of our governance controls

391
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,020
that you can set within Quick Suite

392
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,113
are things that can be
set via APIs as well.

393
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,130
Now on the Identity and
Access Management front,

394
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,810
there's multiple identity options for you

395
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,510
to connect into Quick Suite today,

396
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,240
and I'll go over them a little
bit more later in a demo.

397
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,370
But the four main options,

398
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,860
so there's AWS IAM Identity Center

399
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,950
and Identity Center is from
a Quick Suite perspective,

400
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,280
you can think of it as a
service provider interface

401
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,460
into Quick Suite from
an identity perspective.

402
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,230
So you can have your
corporate or enterprise

403
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,500
identity provider like
Okta, Ping, Entra ID.

404
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,550
You connect into AWS Identity Center once,

405
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,400
you can skim sync your users and groups,

406
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,240
and that AWS Identity Center instance

407
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,690
can be used across all AWS applications.

408
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,280
And so that's an option that's available

409
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,730
for you in Quick Suite today.

410
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,780
There's also, if you have an
active directory environment,

411
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,810
you can directly connect Active
Directory into Quick Suite

412
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,660
and synchronize your users
and groups there as well.

413
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,200
We also have AWS IAM account
federation as an option.

414
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,380
So you deploy Quick Suite
into an AWS account,

415
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,470
you can set up IAM Federation
at that account level

416
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,950
and then connect your
users into Quick Suite

417
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,780
via IAM Federation.

418
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,210
Now one of the differences there is that

419
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,620
to manage the group access,

420
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,550
you set up and create groups
within Quick Suite itself.

421
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,870
So you get the users,

422
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,550
you provision them into Quick
Suite through IAM Federation

423
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,370
and then you assign them to
groups within Quick Suite

424
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,740
using the Quick Suite APIs.

425
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,450
And then finally you can have

426
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,670
local users within Quick Suite.

427
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,920
And so this is where you
can just simply set up

428
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,650
a user with a username, email,

429
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,600
they set a password,

430
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,390
and they can access Quick Suite locally

431
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,623
with those credentials.

432
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,960
Now there's different
roles within Quick Suite.

433
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,810
The primary roles are
really the Admin Pro,

434
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,330
the Author Pro, and the Reader Pro.

435
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,880
And this is what you would consider

436
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,470
the different types of entitlements

437
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,050
that you have within Quick Suite.

438
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,850
but it's also how you can assign users

439
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,320
and then assign custom permissions

440
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,973
at that role level as well.

441
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,930
Now, why we have pro
against each of those,

442
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,620
that's where the agentic AI
capabilities come into play.

443
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,780
And so any role that's set

444
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,610
with a pro designation on it

445
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,040
means that that user will
have access to some level

446
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,100
of agentic AI capabilities
within Quick Suite.

447
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,000
We also have some roles from

448
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,800
when it was just Amazon QuickSight.

449
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,240
Which are just the admin role,

450
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,340
the author role, and the reader role.

451
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,530
So without the pro designation on it.

452
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,440
And what that means is you
just have access to the base

453
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,790
QuickSight BI capabilities

454
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,320
that you would've always had if you were

455
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,003
just using QuickSight previously.

456
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,460
And from a data governance perspective,

457
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,780
fine grain access control
with row-level security,

458
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,700
column-level security,

459
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,350
you can audit all this information

460
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,573
collectively within CloudTrail.

461
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,460
What's great here is if
you're creating a data set

462
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,510
and implementing row-level
security in that data set,

463
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,950
then when you create a dashboard

464
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,080
from that data set, for example,

465
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,140
when that user goes to view a dashboard,

466
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,330
they're only seeing the data
that they're allowed to see

467
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,420
because you've set that fine
grain row-level security.

468
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,910
So that dashboard's
only gonna present data

469
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,510
that they're authorized to view.

470
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,800
And then I just wanna
touch on guardrails a bit.

471
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,360
And there's a couple areas where we

472
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,427
implement guardrails across Quick Suite.

473
00:19:35,427 --> 00:19:39,030
And so there's service managed
guardrails that we implement

474
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,850
as part of the service, as
part of offering Quick Suite

475
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,443
to you as a managed capability.

476
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,000
And there we do real time analysis against

477
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,520
security policies that we set.

478
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,470
We automatically enforce it.

479
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,720
So thinking about, you
know, content coming in,

480
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,250
content going out,

481
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,470
analyzing it and making sure that

482
00:20:01,354 --> 00:20:03,093
there's no potential,

483
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,900
you know, injected content into

484
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,640
a prompt that tries to kind of

485
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,450
circumvent the controls that
are within Quick Suite today

486
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,100
or within the underlying LLM

487
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,130
that's available within Quick Suite.

488
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,643
And so we take care of
that at the service level.

489
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,780
Then there's certain
features in Quick Suite

490
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,240
like Flows for example, or Automate,

491
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,937
where you can use your
Bedrock environment as well.

492
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,970
And so you can choose the model
that you want from Bedrock.

493
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,740
And within Bedrock,
that's where you can set

494
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,080
your additional guardrails as well.

495
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,650
So deny topics, sensitive
information, that type of stuff

496
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,990
that you can set as well as, you know,

497
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,563
filtering on certain words or phrases

498
00:20:45,563 --> 00:20:48,180
within the bedrock context

499
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,790
of what you're using in Quick Suite.

500
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:55,080
And then there's additional
customer managed controls.

501
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,580
And these controls,

502
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,070
again, similar in some respects

503
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,810
to the bedrock controls you have.

504
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,900
So you can set like word filters

505
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,470
that'll filter out
certain words or phrases

506
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,660
that you just, that you want to add on top

507
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,633
of what we already do as
providing as a service.

508
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,370
And just to give you a kind of a view

509
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,810
at one of the screens around that,

510
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,610
so this is with a chat agent,

511
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,680
how you can customize

512
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,980
the guardrails and safety
controls around a chat agent.

513
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,810
And so here there's,
you know, three checks.

514
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,480
The prompt link injection, prompt safety,

515
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,850
and block words and phrases.

516
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,710
And so prompt link injection,

517
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,480
that's where it's automatically enabled.

518
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,120
It prevents, you know, prompt injection

519
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,930
and other LLM type of breaking attacks.

520
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,900
So again, you have, if
you have a bad actor

521
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,200
trying to do something that
they shouldn't be doing,

522
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,820
we take care of that
for you automatically.

523
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,220
That's why it's just kind
of checked by default.

524
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,810
Prompt safety as well,

525
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,070
you know, protect against the common

526
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,690
security threats that are out there.

527
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,000
That's something that we set again

528
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,250
and manage on your behalf.

529
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,470
And then blocked words and phrases.

530
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,790
This is where it's kind of,

531
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,400
it's a shared responsibility
model in a sense.

532
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,690
We take care of the vast
majority of bad content

533
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,440
that shouldn't be
represented in the workplace,

534
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,070
but you can add additional
custom words and phrases

535
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,770
you want to restrict that content.

536
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,570
Another feature or control that you have

537
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,790
is on clickable external links.

538
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:31,790
And so, when you chat with
an agent and it responds,

539
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,980
it'll also reference the
documents that it uses.

540
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,710
Whether it's internal
documents that you have

541
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,200
or documents that are
available on the web.

542
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,180
And you can decide if
you want those documents

543
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,630
that are available on the web
to be clickable links or not.

544
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,220
It's just another control
capability that you have

545
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,183
within the chat agent itself.

546
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,180
And so this now is gonna go through

547
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,760
setting up a new Quick Suite account

548
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,100
and just kind of walk you
through a little demo video.

549
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,683
I'll try to keep up with
the video as it's playing.

550
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,550
But I'm gonna go ahead and
sign up for Quick Suite.

551
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,020
And as you see I have to enter
a unique account name here.

552
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,090
So this is the account
name for Quick Suite.

553
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,580
So when you go to the Quick Suite URL,

554
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,940
you enter the account name
that you want to access.

555
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,190
And so that's the account
that you set it to.

556
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,130
Here I'm selecting a region

557
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,680
and so I select Northern Virginia.

558
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,810
And then there's the four
different identity options

559
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,760
that I talked about earlier.

560
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,410
In this example, I'm gonna go ahead

561
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,170
and use IAM Identity Center

562
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,110
as the identity provider
for this environment.

563
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,270
One thing I have to do now is go

564
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,170
and set up an Admin Pro group

565
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,000
in order to configure this correctly.

566
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,550
So I go ahead and search for my groups.

567
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,430
I see a QuickSight admin
group, I'm gonna add that in.

568
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,620
I could add additional

569
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:00,360
users or groups into additional
roles within Quick Suite.

570
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,340
I could do it here or I could do it later.

571
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,110
I chose, I'm gonna do it later.

572
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,900
And then here's also where
you set the encryption, right?

573
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,760
So you can use an AWS managed key

574
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,773
or your own custom managed key.

575
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,220
So I'm gonna go ahead
and create that account,

576
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,773
I'll click on it and it starts creating.

577
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,430
Just takes a couple seconds to do that.

578
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:24,360
And so you have one Quick Suite account

579
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,223
that you create per AWS account.

580
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,870
So account created successfully.

581
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,940
I can either go directly
into Quick Suite now

582
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,670
and start working within Quick Suite

583
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:39,030
or I can go and do additional
management configuration.

584
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,050
I'm gonna go ahead and do some

585
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,780
additional management
configuration of this environment.

586
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,200
And now it takes me to the
main management account page.

587
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,090
And so up top what you'll see is,

588
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,940
it says that I'm signed
in with IAM Permissions.

589
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,920
And this is,

590
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,825
so when you set it up

591
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:57,030
you have to have the right
IAM Permissions, right?

592
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,630
So you have to be able to create

593
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,653
the instance of Quick Suite,

594
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,900
but then there's also certain

595
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,440
administrative functions
within Quick Suite

596
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,260
that require IAM permissions as well.

597
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,330
There's other functions that require

598
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,610
the Admin Pro group that
we referenced earlier

599
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,053
to function.

600
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:20,793
So just to give you a quick
view of what that looks like.

601
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,560
Basically the high level
account type level settings

602
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,640
are things that require
IAM level permissions.

603
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,470
So you really use these level
permissions very rarely.

604
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,750
For the most part you're going to be

605
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,520
using an admin role permission.

606
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,160
So that's a user within Quick Suite itself

607
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,350
to do more of the day-to-day type of

608
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,180
management or administrative functions

609
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,130
that you would within Quick Suite, right?

610
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,070
So you know, managing users,

611
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,470
any type of account customizations,

612
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,620
managing subscriptions,
that type of information

613
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,830
that you want to do, you
would do that through

614
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,013
just a regular Quick Suite admin user.

615
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,340
Now I wanna take you through some more

616
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,810
of the account settings.

617
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,540
So now I'm in the AWS Management console.

618
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,183
I'm gonna go ahead and
click on Quick Suite,

619
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,413
log back into the account
that I just created,

620
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,720
and I'm gonna talk first about

621
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,060
some of the account settings
that are in the top left.

622
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,350
So you'll see account settings,

623
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,810
manage assets, and Amazon Q.

624
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,480
I'm showing this account settings once,

625
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,330
you don't want to go there very often.

626
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,070
We have some protection there in place

627
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,440
so you don't accidentally
delete the account,

628
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,680
but that's where you would
go to delete the account.

629
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,510
The manage assets function,

630
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,400
this is a really powerful tool

631
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,620
because I can search by user

632
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,740
and see what assets are
assigned to that user.

633
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,730
I can then go in and reassign
those assets to someone else.

634
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,560
I could share it with someone else

635
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,500
or I could remove that user's access

636
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,140
to that particular asset.

637
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,320
Another nice feature is that I
can search by the asset type.

638
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,750
So I can go ahead and look at flows

639
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,520
and it'll pull up all the flows

640
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,590
that are active in my account

641
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,440
and I can go there and share those flows

642
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,943
across with different users.

643
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,980
Now, Amazon Q in Quick Suite,

644
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,630
those are account level settings

645
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,340
for the Amazon Q features

646
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,390
that were available in just QuickSight.

647
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,450
And so these are our
agentic AI capabilities

648
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,910
to be able to interact with dashboards,

649
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,950
interact with data sets, ask questions,

650
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,290
ask kind of Q and A type information

651
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:41,160
and use agentic AI to get
responses back based on that data.

652
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,220
So you can ask natural
language query questions

653
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,280
and get back answers based on the data

654
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,483
that it's referencing.

655
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,010
Next one I wanna walk you through

656
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,783
is setting custom permissions.

657
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,106
And so here you'll see,

658
00:28:03,106 --> 00:28:04,680
you know, I clicked on managed positions.

659
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,000
I have two profiles set.

660
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,640
One the default and it says account.

661
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,430
And so I've set that default
profile at the account level,

662
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,860
meaning that any user in that account

663
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,950
is gonna have that default
profile associated with them.

664
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,890
But when you look at it,
when I click in there,

665
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,500
anything that's unchecked
means that it's available.

666
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,660
So the way permissions work

667
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,210
is that you check it to restrict it.

668
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:32,100
So if I wanted to restrict
research or restrict analysis

669
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,870
and QuickSight or restrict flows,

670
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,730
I would check that box,

671
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,330
and then the users that
that profile is assigned to

672
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,703
would not be able to use those features.

673
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,750
So you can see here when
I, the next one down,

674
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,133
I had restrict spaces.

675
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,813
So what I'll do here is I'm
signed in as a different user.

676
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,940
You can see I have all those

677
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,290
different capabilities listed there.

678
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,840
Agents, Spaces, Flows, and Research.

679
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,120
I can interact with spaces,

680
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,823
I can, you know, create a space if I want,

681
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,790
set it up, I can share that space.

682
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,530
I can basically do anything
I want in that space

683
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,500
because I'm not restricted
from using that right now.

684
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,493
So I'm gonna go ahead and
create a new space, save it,

685
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:17,130
and you can see that saved.

686
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,010
And then if I wanted to share
it, I could share it out.

687
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,110
I could add additional data to it.

688
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,493
Whether it's data sets.

689
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:27,210
And now I could go back and
see I have access to that.

690
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,920
So this is the the next user

691
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,020
and they can see that they have access

692
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,060
to the spaces as well.

693
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,950
So what I'm gonna go ahead and do

694
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,500
is go back into my custom permissions,

695
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,830
and now instead of having the
default at the account level,

696
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,050
I'm gonna switch it to Restrict Spaces as

697
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,470
the default profile.

698
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,940
And it's asking me to confirm that

699
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,860
because it's an important request.

700
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,040
I wanna make sure that this
is what you want to do.

701
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,520
The effects happened pretty immediately

702
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,720
and so that's why you ask for it.

703
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,810
But you can easily remove
it and change it back.

704
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,233
It doesn't remove any data
that you have access to.

705
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,120
So now I'm back looking at this user.

706
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,440
I see they still have spaces,

707
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,410
but when they click on it I
get the error in the top right.

708
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,810
So in near real time

709
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,120
I've disabled that functionality

710
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,910
or restricted that
functionality for that user.

711
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,770
And you'll see it still has,

712
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,960
excuse me, spaces listed

713
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,750
on the top left in the nav bar.

714
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,160
So I went ahead and signed out,

715
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,310
I'm gonna go back and
signed back in again.

716
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,020
And when I sign back in,

717
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,370
you'll see that spaces
option in the nav bar

718
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,173
is no longer available either.

719
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,200
So just by simply restricting spaces,

720
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,960
restricting it and applying
it at the account level,

721
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,880
this user's now not able to
access that space anymore.

722
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,583
I can go ahead and switch
it back to the default,

723
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,943
go back to that user again,

724
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,060
this time just gonna refresh.

725
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,960
It takes a couple seconds
to refresh the UI,

726
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,120
but in a couple seconds you'll see,

727
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,910
I think it took three refreshes here,

728
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,080
but in a couple seconds you'll see

729
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,410
that now spaces will be available again.

730
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,720
And so it happens that fast.

731
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,250
Again, they didn't lose any assets

732
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,053
that they previously had access to.

733
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,450
It was just a configuration change

734
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,213
that restricted what they
could do going forward.

735
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,100
You'll also see then there's
feature level restrictions

736
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,870
you can set across Quick
Suite and QuickSight

737
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,530
and it gets fairly granular.

738
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,390
And you'll see as we add additional

739
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,520
capabilities within Quick Suite,

740
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,010
we'll be adding additional
custom permissions.

741
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,440
So you can decide how you best wanna roll

742
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,930
Quick Suite out in your
organization, right?

743
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,690
You may say, "Oh I want research agent

744
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,870
to be available to this group of users."

745
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,630
And you can say, "But they
don't need anything else.

746
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,270
Maybe they need Chat Research Agent

747
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,060
and then Core BI capabilities."

748
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,420
So you can go in and set a policy

749
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,960
that restricts all the other
capabilities except for those,

750
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,690
assign those users to that new policy

751
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,690
and all they see is
the research agent chat

752
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,590
and any of the BI capabilities
that you want to give them.

753
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,150
As granular as well,

754
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,430
so being able to, like
I mentioned earlier,

755
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,080
being able to export data,

756
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,233
you can control if they're
allowed to export data or not.

757
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,510
Again, this is something that can be

758
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,660
applied at the user
level, at the role level,

759
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,163
or at the account level.

760
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,820
So this is one now, how
do we do this at scale?

761
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,090
So let's say we have,
again 100s of accounts,

762
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,850
you're not gonna go into the UI every time

763
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:54,330
and try every account
and manage that at scale.

764
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:58,110
So you can do this via API.

765
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,480
I decided to use Kiro CLI,

766
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,220
I don't know if anyone's used Kiro yet,

767
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,020
but awesome product.

768
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,650
And I'm just gonna ask Kiro
to create a policy for me,

769
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,040
set it up, restrict access,
and then assign it to a user.

770
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,333
So let's see how it does.

771
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,790
So we can see I am logged
in as Daphne this time.

772
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,550
I have access to all the capabilities

773
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,873
within Quick Suite today,

774
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,680
But I wanna restrict some of

775
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,950
of Daphne's permissions.

776
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,250
Right now you see there's the two profiles

777
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,270
that I had previously set.

778
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,790
I don't have any set at
the account level yet.

779
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:37,260
So Daphne has full access
to all of Quick Suite.

780
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,250
So what I wanna do is ask Kiro in the CLI

781
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,083
to create this new policy for me.

782
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,440
So simply ask Kiro in natural language

783
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,390
to create a policy,

784
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,740
restrict certain features

785
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,483
and then assign it to a user.

786
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,203
So Kiro's gonna go in,
figure all that out,

787
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,793
run the APIs in order to make that happen,

788
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,563
and then come back and let
me know that it's complete.

789
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,500
So there it's going through the process.

790
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,470
You can see it's putting deny filters

791
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,933
on things like flows and research,

792
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,490
and it's showing

793
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,660
that it is now successfully

794
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,823
assigned that to the user, Daphne.

795
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,900
And I also created this profile called

796
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,750
CLI_restrictions.

797
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,280
So if I go ahead and refresh this page,

798
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,980
I'll see that new profile set up.

799
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,830
You'll see in the restricts
it shows agents, flows,

800
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,360
research, and spaces.

801
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,000
Those are the things that
I asked it to restrict.

802
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,390
And now I'm gonna go
ahead and sign Daphne out

803
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,683
and back in again.

804
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,660
And when I do that, we'll see what happens

805
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,523
as far as the left Nav goes.

806
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,900
So now all those
capabilities were restricted

807
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,910
so this user no longer has access

808
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,443
to any of those capabilities.

809
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,440
Another great feature,

810
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,840
especially as you're
rolling Quick Suite out,

811
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,250
and how do you manage it at scale

812
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,460
and how do you know are
users actually using it?

813
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,630
You certainly can look in
CloudTrail and figure it out.

814
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,670
It gets a little complex to do when you're

815
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,800
trying to look at all the different events

816
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,780
that'll show up in CloudTrail.

817
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,150
But what we've done is built some

818
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,850
internal usage analytics
for you to get a view on

819
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,987
how well are certain things,

820
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:45,960
you know, being used within
your Quick Suite environment.

821
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,400
So you can look at like daily,

822
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,590
weekly, or monthly active users.

823
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,240
How often are users coming back

824
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,790
and using Quick Suite again and again?

825
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,320
You can look at the different features

826
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,270
that are available in Quick Suite

827
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,530
and you can see how often

828
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,150
are they using them again.

829
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,880
You can also look at certain like,

830
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,240
so users that have the
ability to create agents,

831
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,970
you can have many agents
in your organization,

832
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:12,063
but you wanna see which ones
are actually being used.

833
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,150
This analysis will give
you that information,

834
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,790
it'll let you know very easily

835
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,170
what are the popular agents

836
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,360
that people keep going back to.

837
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,730
And that gives you an
insight into figuring out

838
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,260
how do you, can you replicate those?

839
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,930
Maybe it's really good
prompting around it,

840
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,210
maybe it's just the way
that it's configured

841
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,360
that just meets a specific
business case or use case

842
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,660
and that's what's driving
the adoption for it.

843
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,943
So as we kind of think about
deploying Quick Suite at scale,

844
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,830
yeah, we talked about
streamlining user provisioning

845
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,993
to reduce administrative overhead.

846
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,230
And when I talked about
those four different

847
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,060
identity options earlier,

848
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,280
things like using Identity Center

849
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,550
allows you to use your
corporate identity provider,

850
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,190
sync users in groups into Identity center,

851
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,340
and make those users in groups
available in Quick Suite.

852
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,880
So a change in your
upstream identity provider

853
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,450
like Okta or Ping

854
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:18,780
is immediately synchronized
into Identity Center,

855
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,620
which then immediately
synchronizes back into Quick Suite.

856
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,170
So what that means is that if you revoke

857
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,390
a user from a group membership

858
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,940
or add users to a group,

859
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,980
that user gets propagated
down all the way.

860
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,990
So they do have access to Quick Suite

861
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,990
if that's what that group has access to.

862
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,510
We have really strong
governance capabilities

863
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,080
through custom permissions
that we just saw some demos on.

864
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,510
But also, again, being able to

865
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,060
manage at a really granular level

866
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,220
who has access to the data.

867
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,470
So we talked a little bit
about row-level security,

868
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,510
column-level security on data sets

869
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:00,180
that are created with structured data.

870
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,890
And this is from data that's created,

871
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:06,890
whether it's an AWS application
like Redshift or Athena,

872
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:11,190
or even S3, or if it's a third party

873
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,670
application like Snowflake
for example, or Databricks,

874
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,670
you can still ingest that
information, that data,

875
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,980
as a data set

876
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,350
and you can assign row-level

877
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,760
and column-level security to it.

878
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,580
So you can get that fine
grain access control

879
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,110
on that as well.

880
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,060
And the other part within Quick Suite

881
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,490
is, so that's the, what
we call structured data,

882
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,390
your database data.

883
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,000
That's well, you know, well managed.

884
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,940
Then you have what we
call unstructured data

885
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,250
or knowledge-based type data.

886
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,110
So this is your SharePoint data.

887
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,940
This could be just a bunch of PDF files

888
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,290
or something that are
uploaded to an S3 bucket,

889
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,700
but you want to be able to
manage access to those, right?

890
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,980
So you want to ingest it because
there's useful information

891
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,920
about your organization
that you want to be able

892
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,820
to take and have quick suite reference

893
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,040
and help provide answers against,

894
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,377
but you also want to control
access to that as well.

895
00:39:07,377 --> 00:39:12,090
And so you're able to ingest
the ACLs with that information.

896
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:15,660
So the responses that come back

897
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,730
are only responses that

898
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,280
that user's authorized to see, right?

899
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,840
So it looks and sees who that,

900
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,970
what that user has access to,

901
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:27,870
it crafts a response based
on that user's access

902
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,580
and it only presents the information

903
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,980
that they're allowed to see.

904
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,410
There's a scalable security architecture.

905
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,590
You know, we talked about,

906
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,010
again, the identity aspect of it,

907
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,890
we talked about managing
permissions via API

908
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:44,820
and all this, you know,

909
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,850
all the security controls you
can implement through APIs.

910
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:51,513
So you can scale this
out across many accounts.

911
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,810
And that's how you can do like

912
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,030
the lifecycle management as well, right?

913
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,710
So you can script it,

914
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,380
you can put it into your
operational procedures.

915
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,400
And so as users, as you
give kind of permissions out

916
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,600
for users to create their
own Quick Suite account,

917
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,510
you can immediately put custom permissions

918
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,400
on the creation of that account

919
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,890
so they can only access the features

920
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,420
that you want them to access.

921
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,030
So you have the centralized
governance capability,

922
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:24,390
but you can also
decentralize the ability for

923
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,245
departments or teams to be able

924
00:40:26,245 --> 00:40:29,100
to spin up their own
instance of Quick Suite,

925
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,350
make their own connections,
create their own dashboards,

926
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,150
create their own agents.

927
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,870
But you can still have that
central governance over the top.

928
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,670
So with that, I'm gonna hand it back.

929
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,503
Okay.

930
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,360
Alicia, thank you.

931
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,040
- So we've talked quite a bit about

932
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,640
how within Amazon we've built
and managed this application.

933
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,200
We have a number of customers that are

934
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,180
presenting throughout re:Invent.

935
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,920
This morning we had 3M present

936
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,630
in terms of how they've reimagined

937
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,580
their sales and marketing organization,

938
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,650
leveraging Quick Suite.

939
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,090
Also earlier this morning we heard

940
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,670
from AstraZeneca as well as BMW

941
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,870
in terms of how they've scaled

942
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,390
this across their organizations as well.

943
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,040
Later this week we'll hear from JABIL

944
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,540
in terms of how they're creating

945
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,670
their workflow automation step by step

946
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,770
in terms of how they're reimagining,

947
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,650
how they're doing work from
a manufacturing perspective.

948
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,630
Principal Financial
will also be presenting

949
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,010
in terms of how they're leveraging

950
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,620
the research aspects of Amazon Quick Suite

951
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,210
to be able to help deliver better

952
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:26,370
responses to their customers.

953
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:28,110
And then a number of different use cases

954
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,640
will be on our business intelligence

955
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,990
as well as embedding capabilities

956
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,210
across our financial and
application providers.

957
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,190
So please look out for those.

958
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,410
We have a list of different

959
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,700
sessions throughout the week.

960
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,460
We have one session today at 5:30

961
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,470
if you're still interested to learn more.

962
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,240
It's about our embedding capabilities

963
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,670
within Amazon Quick Suite

964
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,230
where you can really
think about, you know,

965
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,660
how you can leverage it beyond the UI

966
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,340
and really embed into the applications

967
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,230
that you're working within.

968
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,960
In addition, on Tuesday we
have a number of chalk talks.

969
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,330
So this is a breakout
session where you hear about

970
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,520
specific use cases in a chalk talk.

971
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,920
We'll start to go into more
of a whiteboarding session

972
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,230
and go into some details, Q and A,

973
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,640
for you to dive deeper in terms

974
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,040
of the capabilities within Quick Suite.

975
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,840
And then we also have workshops as well.

976
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,310
So if you want hands on keyboard,

977
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:17,580
really be able to create
these different flows,

978
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,710
automations, agents,

979
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,330
we have a number of different sessions

980
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,010
that you can go to as well.

981
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,350
So these are some other sessions
on Wednesday and Thursday,

982
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,880
but throughout this
whole session there are

983
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,160
many different areas for you to be able

984
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,140
to learn more about the session.

985
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,530
In addition, we'll also
be in the AWS Village.

986
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:37,200
So we have a booth, A-9 through A-10.

987
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,390
You can also leverage
Amazon Quick Suite there

988
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,130
if you haven't already gotten access.

989
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:43,410
We have ourselves, Steve, myself,

990
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,990
will be around as well
as a number of our essays

991
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,090
and sales and marketing organization

992
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,580
to help answer any
questions that you may have.

993
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,260
So thank you so much for your time.

994
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,430
We are really excited for you

995
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,280
to spend the the last 45 minutes with us.

996
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,840
I'm happy to answer any questions

997
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,160
or follow-ups after this session,

998
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,200
or please meet us in
the booth to learn more.

999
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,103
Thank you so much.
