1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,940
- Welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,550
I'm Ming Wu, I'm the Head of Engineering

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,860
for Rovo Dev from Atlassian.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,320
Super excited to be here with you all.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,530
Today, I'm going to share
some interesting findings

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,300
from Atlassian's recent

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,970
State of Developer Experience Report 2025.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,610
So, you may think measuring
developer experience,

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,010
it's pretty common, we
have done that, right?

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,450
There's a lot of established
metrics in the industry

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,460
and your companies, I'm sure,

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,770
every company has built certain dashboard

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,770
to bring the visibility to those metrics.

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,050
And most of those metrics are measuring

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,900
developer productivity as approximation

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,403
to developer experience.

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,750
But are we actually
measuring the right thing?

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,973
What if we are measuring the wrong thing?

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,290
The reason we say that is,
we all have seen the cases

20
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,520
where all the metrics are
pointing to a very rosy picture.

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,490
However, we know our teams are suffering,

22
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,513
they're burning out.

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,710
So, if this is not the
right way to measure,

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,910
then what would be the
right way to measure?

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,220
The intuitive thinking is to
ask your developers, right?

26
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,600
They will tell you.

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,820
So, at the beginning

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,690
of the survey we did start
asking the developers,

29
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,500
how do you actually feel
to be a developer today?

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,040
Not how fast, not how productive they are,

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,073
but how do they feel to
be a developer today?

32
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,320
So, the reason being, you know,

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,220
last past 12 months, so
many things have changed.

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,010
We've had rapid development for AI,

35
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,950
platform engineering has taken off.

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,450
All these changes,

37
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,680
we really wanna understand

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,620
how developers are
taking in those changes.

39
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,980
How does those changes actually
change their day to day?

40
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,470
And also how do the developers

41
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,260
and their leaders think
about the productivity?

42
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,380
So, we started asking the simple question,

43
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,903
how do you feel like to
be a developer today?

44
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,563
Just a second.

45
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,440
Obviously, we're dealing
with a developer crowd.

46
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,450
So, when you ask a simple question,

47
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,280
you may get all kinds
of different answers.

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,880
So, I'll show you some examples.

49
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,953
How does it feel to be a developer today?

50
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,267
We got this.

51
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:31,740
"I feel hungry, they cancelled
Friday night pizzas."

52
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,763
Well, not exactly what
we were looking for,

53
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,040
but good to know.

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,967
Second one is my favorite.

55
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:41,730
"I don't know, ask ChatGPT."

56
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,393
Clearly AI has a lot of impact
on our developers today.

57
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:50,460
"It depends, what do
you mean by developer?"

58
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,560
This is valid, philosophical.

59
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,100
You know, with AI tools,
everyone now can develop code.

60
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,083
What do you mean really by developer?

61
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,760
So clearly, with this question

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,310
we're not getting what we want.

63
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,810
We thought about this
and for the second annual

64
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,140
State of the Dev Experience survey,

65
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,140
we sent out the survey to
focus on three questions.

66
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,650
One, how has developer experience evolved

67
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,960
over the past 12 months?

68
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,960
Second one, what's the impact
of AI on developer daily life?

69
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,210
Third one, how does developers

70
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,970
and their leaders think
about productivity?

71
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,040
So, we use three questions to anchor

72
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,940
the developer experience to
get a well-rounded answer.

73
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,630
We actually sent out the
survey to 3,500 developers

74
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,850
and their leaders globally.

75
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,270
So, we have some really
good insights from here.

76
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,900
At the end of the presentation,
I included a QR code.

77
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,120
You can scan and download the full report

78
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,220
if you wanna know more details.

79
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,200
But in this rest of the session,

80
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,550
we're gonna touch on some
highlighted findings.

81
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,370
So, before we jump into the report,

82
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,310
maybe one thing I really want to touch on

83
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,733
is why developer
experience is so important.

84
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,470
Let's be honest, all
the software companies,

85
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,720
they have one common goal.

86
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,410
They wanna deliver
high-quality software, fast.

87
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,600
Simple, simple as that.

88
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,100
But let's break it down a bit.

89
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,443
What do you mean by quality?

90
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,630
Quality can mean different things.

91
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,800
Usually it means your
software has to be resilient,

92
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,160
compliant and maybe performant.

93
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,190
But if we look at the
different angle on this one,

94
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,170
which this angle is not usually mentioned,

95
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,750
but this is what really we want it for,

96
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,870
the quality means you
deliver the right value

97
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,580
to your customer, you deliver

98
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,310
what your customer want to the customer.

99
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,663
So, that is the quality.

100
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,140
Second one, let's look
at what's fast, right?

101
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,790
Fast, it doesn't necessarily
mean you have 10 production

102
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,140
drops per day.

103
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,460
That's not fast.

104
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,000
Fast really means you can actually deliver

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,760
at the right speed without the constraint

106
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,613
of industry processes and frameworks.

107
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,910
Being able to deliver fast
give you competitive advantage.

108
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,840
It means you can deliver
the customer values

109
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,890
at the right speed.

110
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,960
You are ahead of the competition.

111
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,163
It means you can comply with
your regulators ahead of time.

112
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,630
So, they wanna deliver the value fast

113
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,360
and it's a simple statement.

114
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,593
Easier said than done.

115
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,020
So, let's come back now to the question,

116
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,243
why developer experience is important?

117
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,580
It's because developer
experience is a key ingredient

118
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,043
to developer productivity.

119
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,959
Developer experience is about
removing the friction points

120
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,959
developer face when they use
tools, frameworks and processes

121
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,400
and removing friction
points for developers

122
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,650
leading to a happier developer

123
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,000
who will deliver
high-quality software faster.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,500
So, that's why it's important.

125
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,590
Remember that point

126
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,140
'cause removing the friction points

127
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,600
is one thing we found really insightful.

128
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,870
That's how we think there's
huge opportunities in terms

129
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,610
of leveraging the AI tools

130
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,623
for improving developer experience.

131
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,540
Okay, so now let's look at the numbers.

132
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,910
So, let's look at the AI and
the developer experience.

133
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,100
First, we all know

134
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,790
most developers probably
already adopted the AI tools.

135
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,623
You know?

136
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,140
Over past 12 months,

137
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,090
a lot of things have changed.

138
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,100
Vibe coding 12 months ago,

139
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,260
probably means you put
down your favorite song

140
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,240
and doing the writing code

141
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,583
and now it means a
completely different thing.

142
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,750
So, we observed most of the developers

143
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,660
have adopted coding assistance.

144
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,340
Stack Overflow survey
from 2024 has shown 82%

145
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,550
of the developers are
already using Generative AI

146
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,110
for writing code.

147
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,850
It's not surprising.

148
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,460
They get a lot from the coding assistant.

149
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,350
In fact, coding assistant is
probably one of the fastest

150
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,190
adopted tools developer
technology of all time.

151
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,423
Really not surprising.

152
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,490
But remember what we said,

153
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,850
developer experience is about
removing friction points.

154
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,880
Coding is not really a point of friction.

155
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,430
If you ask any developers
do they want a really fully

156
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,800
automate coding, they don't
have to do code anymore?

157
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,840
I doubt anyone will say yes.

158
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,840
So, coding assistant can
enhance developer experience

159
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,190
but without actually improving it.

160
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,260
This is a bit counterintuitive,

161
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,613
but if you think about it,

162
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,600
our survey shows developers only spend 16%

163
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,403
of the time on coding.

164
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,030
It is not surprising, right?

165
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,670
If you're a developer,
you know most of the time

166
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:40,670
during the SDLC you have
to start from ideation,

167
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,070
writing specs, writing docs,
aligning with everyone,

168
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,503
talking to PMs and do planning.

169
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,020
And then you get to coding.

170
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,510
But once you get to coding,
the most interesting part,

171
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,990
you have to do testing,
you have to do the review,

172
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,780
then you have to do deployment
and you have to monitor

173
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,430
and repeat this process.

174
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,430
So, only 16% of the time they
really spend on the coding.

175
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,813
So.

176
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:11,845
(people chattering)

177
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,330
So, if you look at the entire

178
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,470
software development life cycle,

179
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,890
84% time were spent outside of coding.

180
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,493
This is a huge opportunity
here for AI tools to help.

181
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,730
So, with our survey, we
really wanna understand

182
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,790
how developers are using AI

183
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,700
to actually remove the friction points

184
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,653
to address the pain points
in their development life.

185
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,310
Then we got a list.

186
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,230
So, we started from the bottom.

187
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,580
Outside of coding, developers
are using the AI tools

188
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,270
for automating some of the boring tasks.

189
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,490
And this is not surprising, you know,

190
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,800
even before AI tools,
developers are trying

191
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,050
to automate everything by writing scripts.

192
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,933
So, automation is
definitely a first thing,

193
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:14,583
they use the AI tools to help.

194
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,365
So, we look at the...

195
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:20,640
Atlassian has 60K developers.

196
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,960
So, we look at some internal
examples, how we use AI tools

197
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,840
to automate our life.

198
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,150
And this is a good example.

199
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,700
This is how we actually
use AI tools to deal

200
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,430
with the removal of the feature flags.

201
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,880
Feature flags are probably
one of the common tech

202
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,650
that every company has.

203
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,720
You know, they were used

204
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,020
to release certain feature,
they got left behind

205
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,450
because in case something happened

206
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,430
and then nobody goes back to clean them.

207
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,880
So, they start stacking
on top of each other

208
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,350
and become tech debt.

209
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,540
And this is the single boring task

210
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,340
that nobody really wanna do.

211
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,940
So, in Atlassian we create a Rovo agent

212
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,930
to handle removing the
clean up the feature flags

213
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,860
and then we leverage the
automation platform in Atlassian

214
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,740
and really automating
the feature flag clean up

215
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,483
as a workflow.

216
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:20,580
So, this really helps the developers

217
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,100
to remove the kind of tasks,

218
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,040
repetitive tasks they really do not like.

219
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,150
But more importantly,

220
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,660
this is only not just
handling the boring tasks,

221
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,000
it is actually freeing the developers

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,093
to focus on more valuable
and more innovative tasks

223
00:11:36,093 --> 00:11:37,533
that they really like.

224
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,085
Oops.

225
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:45,600
(people chattering)

226
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,320
So, number three on the
list is documentation.

227
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,550
Not surprising.

228
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:55,050
AI has already done a really
great job on documentation.

229
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,020
So, the third case we found on the list

230
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,020
is folks are using the the
AI tools for documentation.

231
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,420
One example

232
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,520
from Atlassian is the pipelines
deployment summarizer.

233
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,090
You know, who here really
wanna write the release note?

234
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,710
Nobody really, right?

235
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,500
This is some tasks that nobody

236
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,783
wish they would need to do.

237
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,270
So, in Atlassian we have a pipeline agent

238
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,500
that summarizes the
deployment once a deployment

239
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,670
is going out.

240
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,580
So, this is not only automate the task,

241
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,790
it also help enforcing the standard.

242
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,280
It helps standardize the process

243
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,590
so that we won't miss
in case manually down

244
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,510
and someone will miss this step,

245
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,650
you have to push them to do.

246
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,240
But this really helps not
only handling the pain points

247
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,431
but also pushing for the standardization.

248
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:58,514
(people chattering and laughing)

249
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,093
Number two on the list is testing.

250
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,700
Not surprising.

251
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,250
Developers and testings
love-hate relationship

252
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,083
all the time.

253
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,030
We all know testing is important,

254
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:16,650
but you know, it's kind of
repetitive sometimes to write,

255
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,200
test and improve the test coverage.

256
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,033
So...

257
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:24,034
(audience clapping)

258
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:26,190
What we do in Atlassian,

259
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,590
we developed a test-writing agent

260
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,387
and it helps to write the unit test

261
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:36,750
and improve your repo unit test coverage.

262
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,460
And combining with the automation
is a very powerful tool.

263
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,650
It goes detect to your test coverage

264
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,440
and automatically generate unit test.

265
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,973
Okay, now let's be honest,

266
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:53,760
this process has to have human review

267
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,340
because some of the tests are easier,

268
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,170
some of the tests are harder.

269
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,003
So,

270
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,200
developers have to look
at the PR sometimes

271
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,800
to decide whether this test is correct

272
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,380
and we have to actually
run to make sure it builds.

273
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,350
However, you know, with
this automated process

274
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,200
for test generation, at
least it's a good start.

275
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,790
It does the heavy lifting.

276
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,120
Now you can focus on maybe
make the minor changes

277
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,043
and it helps a lot to speed up,

278
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:26,343
increasing the unit test coverage.

279
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:30,709
(person coughing)

280
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,709
(people chattering)

281
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,690
Okay, so now, we're onto the first one.

282
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,100
So first one, searching for information.

283
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,860
This shouldn't be any surprise to anyone.

284
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,500
Knowledge discovery is super important,

285
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,440
especially as your project running longer,

286
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,050
more people are involved in the process

287
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,820
and more contexts are generated.

288
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,910
Your code base get bigger,
it will become harder

289
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,570
and harder to search for
the information you want.

290
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,190
And on average, I believe,

291
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,040
everyone's probably spent
a couple of hours a week

292
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,040
at least to search for the
right information you want,

293
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,350
gather the context for your project

294
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,790
before you even write the code.

295
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,680
So, this is really an example to...

296
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,323
Developers are using AI to really help.

297
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,100
So Atlassian, how we do it,

298
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,280
we do have a Rovo searching
house and this is GA product.

299
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,020
So, if you're using Atlassian product,

300
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,720
you should have seen this as well.

301
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,710
Rovo Search helps you
to effectively retrieve

302
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:45,270
the relevant information from
your document content base.

303
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,920
It's not just for Jira

304
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,490
and Confluence, it
provides a 3P connector.

305
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,540
So, you can actually search

306
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,070
through 3P content like SharePoint.

307
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:59,001
(people chattering)

308
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,340
Okay, so, now we're seeing,
it's fantastic to see developers

309
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,510
already using AI tools

310
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,360
to address the pain point outside coding.

311
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,660
You know, there are a bunch
of tasks they have find value

312
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,560
and now we wanna know with all this,

313
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,440
how much time really
does it save them, right?

314
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,743
It's nice to use those tools,
but does it really help?

315
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,770
Okay, so 38% of the developers experience

316
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:39,093
the productivity gains
in last year's report.

317
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,323
If you take a guess this year,
what would be the number?

318
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:48,660
(people chattering)

319
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,670
In 2025,

320
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,750
99% of developers claim they are saving

321
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,640
at least four hours per week

322
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,570
using the AI tools.

323
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,000
You know, this number
when it just came out,

324
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,440
it's a bit controversial.

325
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,530
A lot of people are
skeptical about this number.

326
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:12,120
Really? Does 99% of people
already see the gains?

327
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,710
Because we know like a lot of people

328
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,910
are using coding assistant,
but not 99%, right?

329
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,470
So, 99% people actually claim
AI helped them saving time.

330
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,470
So, let's look at this.

331
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,693
Let's dig into the 99% a bit.

332
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:37,420
Actually 46% of people
claim it's saving them 11

333
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,753
to 20 hours per week.

334
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,410
But this is really raising eyebrows.

335
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,060
Is it really that much?

336
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,670
So, when we actually look at the data,

337
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,320
you know, we found out

338
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,440
if you're actually using
AI tools to address

339
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,520
a lot of friction point

340
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,983
along the software development lifecycle,

341
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,990
you will see actually
efficiency got improved.

342
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,380
You know, like we just said,
developers are using AI

343
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,440
to search for content,
knowledge and discovery.

344
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,590
They use it for automating
to help generate test,

345
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,480
improve the test coverage.

346
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,940
They use it for documentation

347
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,940
and they use it automate their tasks.

348
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,940
You know, all those together,
they're claiming every week,

349
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,260
you know, close to 50% of
developers are saving 11

350
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,200
to 20 hours a week.

351
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,163
This is huge.

352
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,990
This is also really promising
data points to show us that,

353
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,380
you know, if you think
about along the entire

354
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,420
software development lifecycle,

355
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,460
there's a huge opportunity there

356
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,330
for us to improve
efficiency, really use AI

357
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,463
to improve developer experience.

358
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,200
So now, you know, we look at this number,

359
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,150
you should ask your question,

360
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,580
especially the leaders should
ask the question, okay,

361
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,260
now we're saving time,

362
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,230
but what are developers
using this time for?

363
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,570
Are they using the time to watch YouTube

364
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,490
or are they playing game with this time?

365
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,740
This is a valid question.

366
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,223
So, (titters) we also ask the developers,

367
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,000
they are putting the
time to the good uses.

368
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,513
So, they are using the extra
time to improve code quality.

369
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,320
They're using that to
developing new features,

370
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,250
pleasing the PMs and they're
using it to improve culture.

371
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,190
That's great, you know,
good for team bonding

372
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,003
and they also use it for
generating more documentation.

373
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,620
It is great, you know,
it's fantastic to see

374
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,320
and we have the robots are doing things

375
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,153
and

376
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,893
it is a very good future
when we look at that.

377
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,740
And it's, more importantly, you know,

378
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,650
developers are using the time responsibly.

379
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,270
It's not like they're using the time

380
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,980
just for doing something else.

381
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,020
So you know, we can save time,

382
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,513
but productivity may not improve.

383
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,380
Okay, so now, next question is,

384
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,563
we now proved developers
are using AI to save time,

385
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,583
but are they more productive?

386
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,270
It seems like a counterintuitive
question, right?

387
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,350
They're just using the...

388
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,610
They already use the AI tools to improve

389
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,883
their productivity and to save time.

390
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,733
But are they really more productive?

391
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,880
To get some insight we
actually asked them,

392
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,560
each week, how much time

393
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,010
do they actually waste in inefficiency?

394
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,230
The answer is pretty shocking.

395
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,250
In 2025, 50% of the developers

396
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:07,250
claim they lost 10 hours of
their week due to inefficiency.

397
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,380
And 90% of developers saying
they're losing six plus hours

398
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,303
of the week due to inefficiency.

399
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,303
This is big, this is huge.

400
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,763
We have a huge gap here.

401
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,490
It's almost like one full day

402
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,823
of the week they're
wasted in inefficiency.

403
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,720
So, okay, so I'm not gonna say
too much about the picture,

404
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,893
but you know,

405
00:21:39,046 --> 00:21:40,470
it's an analogy,

406
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,910
you save time on one side

407
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,623
but you losing time on the other.

408
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,920
And why is that?

409
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,993
You know, when you think about this,

410
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,400
why there is this disconnection?

411
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,510
We're using AI tools,

412
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,113
but on the other side,
inefficiency actually increased.

413
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,000
So, our theory hasn't
changed from the beginning.

414
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,593
Ours, remember when we were,
earlier, we were talking about

415
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:11,593
developer experience is about
removing friction points.

416
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,910
We have to understand the
friction points in order

417
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,743
to removing them properly.

418
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,133
So, without a good understanding
of the friction points,

419
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,630
we won't be able to address
the right pain points

420
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,930
or we won't be able to address
them in the proper way.

421
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,700
How do we address them?

422
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,720
We follow the same methodology
for any experimentation.

423
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,290
First, we have to understand
the friction points.

424
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,990
We send a survey, we talk to developers,

425
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,903
we gather their opinions,
then we identify.

426
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,620
Second, we need to create the measures,

427
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,140
putting the right measure in place.

428
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,060
Then you can find out, you know,

429
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,340
whether you can actually improve or not.

430
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,690
Then you take into the action,
really do the improvement.

431
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,500
Next, you gather the feedback again

432
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,870
and ask the developers and really measure

433
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,800
and looking at the metrics,
then iterate the whole process.

434
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,490
So, it's the same as any
scientific experiment process.

435
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,120
You from discover the
problem, you build the metrics

436
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,630
and you execute and then you go back,

437
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,820
iterate the whole process.

438
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,653
So.

439
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,460
So, now, we are starting
from the first point, right?

440
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,280
The whole process start
from the first point,

441
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,693
understanding the friction.

442
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,430
Then we actually thought,
we're asking the developers,

443
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,760
do they think their leaders

444
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,220
actually understand the friction point?

445
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,040
Surprisingly or maybe not surprisingly,

446
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,210
63% of developers saying their leaders

447
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,253
don't understand their challenges.

448
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,240
There's a big disconnection here.

449
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,580
If we don't understand
the friction points,

450
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,830
how do we know what to address?

451
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,600
How do we make sure we are addressing

452
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,043
the right friction points?

453
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,220
Leaders really need to understand

454
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,910
and talk to developers to
understand their challenge

455
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,160
and really the friction points

456
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,870
and developers should also raise

457
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,553
their concerns to the leaders.

458
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,490
So, I'll give you an example
for why this framework works

459
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:33,150
and we have validated with
an example internally.

460
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,450
So, in Atlassian with 60,000, oh sorry,

461
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,163
with 6,000 developers,

462
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,180
the code review cycle
is really a big problem.

463
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,390
You know, we noticed people are
complaining about, you know,

464
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,250
review cycle is too long

465
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,800
and it's blocking the deployment on that.

466
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,820
So, one way to push for
that would be ask everyone,

467
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,850
ask the developers, you
should do code reviews faster.

468
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,330
You should pick up the code
reviews as long as it comes up.

469
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,680
You know, however, when
we analyzed the problem,

470
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,660
it's actually not really about

471
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,690
they're slow on picking
up the code reviewers,

472
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:12,720
it's really about the
developers have to spend time

473
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,420
to understand the PR,
understand the code base

474
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,940
to point out some of the basic errors

475
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,643
and the basic round of
the review comments.

476
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,920
So, our approach here, we used
the Rovo Dev Code Reviewer,

477
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,010
we enabled that for entire Atlassian.

478
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,360
So, every PR, when it's submitted,

479
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,730
the code reviewer will be triggered

480
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,760
and it will do the
first round of reviewing

481
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,760
and we'll generate the PR summary

482
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,390
and also it will generate
first round of the comments

483
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,360
and the comments will have
explanation why it's wrong

484
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,940
and then categorize the two different type

485
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,570
of comment categories.

486
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,473
So, with all that, you know, we found out,

487
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,840
let me show you the number.

488
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,810
So, actually this is a little
bit of live motion here.

489
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,970
So, for a little bit more details

490
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,780
on the Rovo Dev Code Reviewer.

491
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,930
So, it does the automatic code reviewing.

492
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,970
It also suggests a fix for some

493
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,830
of the simple minor comments.

494
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,260
You can directly apply the suggestion.

495
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,490
And there's also a nice thing

496
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:28,200
is like it looks at the
overall, if you're using Jira.

497
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,350
So, it looks at the
overall acceptance criteria

498
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:35,498
for this requirement and checks your PR

499
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:38,340
and give you comments if
it actually doesn't fit

500
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,963
the acceptance criteria.

501
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,773
So, with all this enabled,

502
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,630
what do we see?

503
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,740
With this enabled after
six months we see a 45%

504
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,590
of the PR cycle time reduction.

505
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,760
This is real data.

506
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,020
We did a lot of validation,

507
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,240
just making sure the data was correct.

508
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,180
But we did see really the improvement.

509
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,439
The reason, it's not hard to understand,

510
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:10,320
the code reviewer agent
does the heavy lifting.

511
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,160
It helps you to summarize the
PR, it gives the first round

512
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,990
of the code review and
point out the common error.

513
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,220
So, common fix.

514
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,960
And then that saves a lot of trouble

515
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,300
for a human reviewer when they come in,

516
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,160
they can look at that, just validate

517
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,730
and they can quickly grasp
what the PR is about.

518
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,450
So, we see an impressive

519
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,113
improvement on the PR cycle time, 45%.

520
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,450
So, this is actually a
good example to validate.

521
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,810
The key here is to understand
the friction point.

522
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,730
Not just to see the symptom

523
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,970
but really understand it, analyze it

524
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,670
and find the right approach to it.

525
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,430
Okay, so

526
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,570
the...

527
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,253
Now, I'm actually recapped.

528
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,500
So, here's the QR code if you wanna scan

529
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,100
and to download the
full report, you can do.

530
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,090
And just to recap, you know
from the report, what we see.

531
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,870
We're seeing AI is
having a positive impact.

532
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:22,590
It saves four to 20 hours
per week. It's amazing.

533
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,560
It's not surprising with
the rapid AI development,

534
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,043
I'm sure we'll save more,
probably, in the upcoming years,

535
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,550
but significant friction still remains.

536
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,230
People are losing six

537
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,920
to 15 hours per week to inefficiencies,

538
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,100
those inefficiencies
existing in the entire

539
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,320
software development life cycle.

540
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,453
They're everywhere else outside coding.

541
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,750
This is a huge opportunity for us

542
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,340
to look into how AI
tools can actually help

543
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,173
improve the developer experience.

544
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,760
So, pick the right tools for the job.

545
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,340
AI has a positive impact.

546
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,920
Definitely there's a
growing empathy gap there.

547
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,320
So, finding the right tools for the job,

548
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,950
really trying to look at
the application, understand,

549
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,080
analyze your use cases.

550
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,150
Then you will find the right AI tools

551
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,450
for doing the right thing.

552
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:30,150
I think that's the end
of the presentation.

553
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:33,450
So, feel free to follow up with me.

554
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,550
I don't think we can take questions here,

555
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,600
but I'll be outside

556
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,540
so if you have any questions
you wanna chat about,

557
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,410
I'll be outside and
also come to our booth.

558
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,890
I think we have a booth
in the Venetian Expo,

559
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:51,269
so if you wanna come by,
there's more details on how,

560
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:54,600
within Atlassian, we use AI tools

561
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,453
to help improve the developer experience.

562
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,045
Thanks.

563
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:00,878
