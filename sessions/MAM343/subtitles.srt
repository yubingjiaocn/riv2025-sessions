1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,590
- [Alex] Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,083
So how is it going? How is re:Invent?

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,240
All good?

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,460
So welcome to this code talk.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,450
So this is code talk.

6
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,240
So I assume that you love see code

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,770
more than like seeing PowerPoint.

8
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,230
So this is the goal of this session

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,330
and also I assume that most of you

10
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,920
have .NET developer background

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,760
and you're dealing with

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,353
some legacy .NET framework applications

13
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:24,570
that you need to modernize.

14
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,850
So welcome everyone. I'm Alex.

15
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,840
- [Prasad] I'm Prasad.

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,820
- [Alex] And I'm based
in Stockholm, Sweden.

17
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,440
- [Prasad] I'm based in London, UK.

18
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,410
- [Alex] And here in this
session we will show you

19
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,910
how you can modernize

20
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,779
your legacy .NET framework applications

21
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:43,779
using agentic AI tools like
AWS Transform and Kiro.

22
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,403
And we'll do a lot of live
coding because of this code talk.

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,280
So before we get started,

24
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,420
I know just raise of hands,

25
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,827
like, how many still
managing some kind of like

26
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:56,177
.NET framework applications,
like legacy stuff?

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,220
- [Prasad] Okay, almost
everyone seems like in the room.

28
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,053
- [Alex] Perfect.

29
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:01,710
So you're in the right session.

30
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,820
Good.

31
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,870
Okay, let's get started.

32
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,670
- [Prasad] Yeah, so when we talk about

33
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,900
legacy .NET applications,

34
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,300
there are three components
to it which are legacy

35
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,100
which we need to modernize.

36
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,410
The first is the framework.

37
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,827
You know, the language that is
written is in .NET framework.

38
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,000
So .NET framework as you know,

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,982
can run only on Windows, it's proprietary.

40
00:01:19,982 --> 00:01:22,987
So we'd like to modernize it
to the latest version of .NET,

41
00:01:22,987 --> 00:01:24,480
.NET 8 or .NET 10.

42
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,060
like, both are the long term
support versions that we have.

43
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,620
So that's the first part of modernization

44
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,785
that we'll be doing,
the code modernization.

45
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:34,737
The second is the
architecture modernization,

46
00:01:34,737 --> 00:01:37,024
which means that your application

47
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,970
might be a monolith, right?

48
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,040
And where you're modernizing
you would like to

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,880
use the best practices
architectural patterns.

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,634
So you'll be using microservices,
even driven architectures.

51
00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:50,490
So that's the architecture modernization.

52
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,803
And finally it is
infrastructure modernization.

53
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:56,580
So as you know, your .NET
framework applications

54
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,750
can run only on Windows.

55
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,430
So you'd like to run them on Linux

56
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,620
and most probably if
it's ASP.NET application

57
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,240
it will be running on iOS.

58
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,350
So instead of that you
would like to run it

59
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,290
on serverless containers or EC2 Linux.

60
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,760
So we are going to look into that.

61
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,230
So in this particular session,

62
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,208
why modernize all these three aspects

63
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,809
of the legacy application?

64
00:02:16,809 --> 00:02:18,480
And to do that, what we have done

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,730
is that we have taken a
open source application

66
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,290
called Contoso University.

67
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,924
It's a ASP.NET application.

68
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:26,647
It has standard features,

69
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,467
it's a university management
application which has features

70
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:32,568
like student enrollment,
course management,

71
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:35,250
instructor assignment, right?

72
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,083
And as you can see

73
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,580
it is built quite heavily
using Windows components.

74
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,610
For example, for your
queues, it is using MSMQ.

75
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,313
For your database, it is using SQL server

76
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:46,200
and if you look at the presentation layer,

77
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,753
it is using Razor Views
with MVC controller

78
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:51,780
and then it has your service layer,

79
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,890
not a typical service layer,

80
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,373
but it has a notification service

81
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:58,903
which sends out
notifications via your MSMQ.

82
00:02:58,903 --> 00:03:01,844
And then in the data layer
it has entity framework

83
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:05,068
which it uses to connect
to your SQL server,

84
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:06,773
communicate to SQL server.

85
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:10,330
So that's the architecture
which you're going to modernize.

86
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,000
But let's look at the code,

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,790
how the current code
base looks like, Alex?

88
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,770
- [Alex] Okay, let me move to my keyboard.

89
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,850
So as you saw, like,

90
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,037
this is quite typical
.NET framework application

91
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:22,440
which contains like
quite typical components,

92
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,060
which probably you see
in your applications

93
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,400
I know from last 20 years.

94
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,013
But let me switch to the code.

95
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:34,050
So I have this application
in my GitHub repository.

96
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,050
So as you can see it's .NET
framework 4.8 application.

97
00:03:39,322 --> 00:03:43,573
Yeah, it's like this huge project file.

98
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:47,580
So all the configuration is in web config.

99
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,974
And then what we have,
so we have you know,

100
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:52,290
bunch of controllers,

101
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,150
we have database with like

102
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,737
some initializer with database
context, we have some views.

103
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:02,280
As I said, this is a university
management application.

104
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,600
So we have views to manage

105
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,420
courses, departments,
instructors, students.

106
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,880
So this is not like a small
hello world application,

107
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,410
but it's not like enterprise application.

108
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,170
But again this is very good application

109
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,643
for demo purposes we should picked.

110
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,600
So what are we going to
do with this application?

111
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,850
- [Prasad] Yep, so let's switch
to the presentation again

112
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,800
and let's see what we
are going to do, right?

113
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,490
So we have seen the code base
of the legacy application

114
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,810
architecture of the legacy application.

115
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,550
Let's talk about the tooling

116
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,650
that we'll be using to
modernize this, right?

117
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,857
The first we'll be using
AWS transform for .NET

118
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,990
through which we will be porting

119
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,980
your .NET framework application
to latest version of .NET,

120
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,917
in this session we'll be doing it .NET 8

121
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:45,180
and then we will be using Kiro.

122
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,340
So what we'll do is that
we'll take the ported code

123
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,070
from AWS Transform for .NET

124
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,798
and then we will use Kiro
to fix any compiled errors,

125
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:57,660
build it locally and then
we'll modernize the code base.

126
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,680
We'll look into each of the steps

127
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,233
at what we are going to
do when I say modernize.

128
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:06,390
So the step number one
is automatically put,

129
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,880
that will be using AWS
transform your code base

130
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,263
to the latest version of .NET.

131
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:12,264
Step number two would be fixing

132
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:15,317
any compiled errors and
building them locally.

133
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:17,910
And that's when we'll start refactoring.

134
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,860
We'll replace your SQL
server with PostgreSQL.

135
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,920
Then we are going to replace
MSMQ with Amazon SQS.

136
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,753
So what we are trying to do

137
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:28,440
is that we are going to remove
all the Windows components,

138
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,520
legacy components

139
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,153
and make it a more cloud
native application.

140
00:05:32,153 --> 00:05:33,544
Then we're going to extract

141
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:35,723
a microservice from this monolith.

142
00:05:35,723 --> 00:05:37,950
Then we are going to refactor the UI.

143
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,900
So currently as you
have seen the refactor,

144
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,900
the UI is based on your
MVC controller Razor Views.

145
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,437
We are going to move it to React app.

146
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:52,311
And then finally we are
going to deploy it on AWS

147
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,153
by creating a CDK project.

148
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,144
So like in next 45 minutes or so,

149
00:05:57,144 --> 00:05:58,620
we are going to go
through all of these steps

150
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,291
and why modernize it?

151
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,006
With that, let's start with the step one,

152
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:05,283
updating a .NET framework
application to .NET 8.

153
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:09,300
- [Alex] Okay, let's switch to the code.

154
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,590
So as Prasad said,

155
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,554
the first service we're
going to use is AWS Transform

156
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:16,286
and yesterday we completely changed

157
00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:19,350
the UI of AWS Transform,
like edit the new features.

158
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,650
So this is the new UI of AWS Transform.

159
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,839
So I already have a workspace created

160
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,050
and if I go to this workspace,

161
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,540
I already have a connector configured

162
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,160
to my GitHub repository.

163
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,368
So AWS Transform can access the code

164
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:36,384
like in my GitHub repository.

165
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:38,910
So this is the sample
Contoso University project.

166
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,393
So this is the connector, it is active,

167
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:45,447
and then yeah, it's
connector for GitHub GitLab.

168
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:49,320
So what I'm going to do, I'm
going to create a new job.

169
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,717
I'm just saying create job.

170
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:55,473
- [Prasad] How many of you
here have used AWS Transform?

171
00:06:56,843 --> 00:06:58,020
Okay, a few of them.

172
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,310
Have you heard about this service?

173
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,750
It went GA earlier this year.

174
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,010
Okay, few of them. Okay, cool.

175
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,230
- [Alex] Okay, so now it ask me what kind

176
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,940
of transformation job do I want to do?

177
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,270
Because AWS Transform
can do multiple things.

178
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,961
So it can transform your
mainframe applications,

179
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:17,379
VMware based applications,

180
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:22,230
but in this case we're going
to do .NET modernization.

181
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,110
So now it's called Windows modernization

182
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,120
because yesterday we
launched a new feature.

183
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,040
So it can not only modernize

184
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,690
your .NET framework applications,

185
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,537
it can also modernize
your SQL server database.

186
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:36,660
So I'm saying okay, I want
to do Windows modernization

187
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,213
and in this case I'm going
to .NET modernization.

188
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,577
Okay, so this is,

189
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:43,503
the job is going to create for me.

190
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:45,780
- [Prasad] So as you can see,

191
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,370
it's a more agentic AI experience.

192
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,263
You would be having, you know,
a modern UI to go through.

193
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,650
- [Alex] Yeah and this is like,

194
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,770
not fully automated experience.

195
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,278
So it involves me as a
developer in the loop.

196
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,980
So as you see, it's saying
okay, I'm awaiting user input.

197
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,250
And what it wants me to
do is to say okay, like,

198
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,910
where do I get the source
code to be transformed from?

199
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,091
And we have like, two type
of connectors supported.

200
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,380
One is through code connections.

201
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,820
So okay, if your source code is

202
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,860
in GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps,

203
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,900
when you can do it
through code connections

204
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,346
or if your source code
is in your S3 bucket.

205
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:26,896
So maybe you are not storing
it in GitHub or whatever.

206
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:30,127
So okay, you can connect
to your S3 bucket.

207
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:31,440
In my case it's in GitHub.

208
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,153
So okay, I'm just saying
my code is in the,

209
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:40,557
use code connections to
connect to my repository

210
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:43,050
and now it will start discovery.

211
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,900
So it'll connect to my
source code repository

212
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,488
and try to see what kind
of .NET framework projects

213
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:53,100
or older versions of .NET core projects

214
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,638
do I have in my repository.

215
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:57,093
And again it's saying awaiting user input.

216
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,077
So it discovered that in my GitHub report

217
00:09:02,077 --> 00:09:04,980
I have two projects with Gadgets Online

218
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,960
and with Contoso University.

219
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,326
So the beauty of AWS
transform is that it can do,

220
00:09:11,326 --> 00:09:14,700
it can transform multiple
projects at the same time.

221
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,555
So I don't need to go
like, project by project,

222
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,183
I can select multiple projects

223
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,588
and transform them like in parallel.

224
00:09:20,588 --> 00:09:22,110
But in this case I want to do

225
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,090
transformation of only one project.

226
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,951
So I'm selecting, okay,
this is Contoso University

227
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:29,507
and then I'm saying,
okay, start assessment.

228
00:09:29,507 --> 00:09:33,729
So on the assessment phase
it will look at my project

229
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:36,355
to understand, okay, what kind of .NET,

230
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:38,880
what versions of .NET it's using,

231
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,643
what kind of NuGet packages it's using

232
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:45,540
other like any dependencies
to third party NuGet packages

233
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,510
or dependencies to other repositories.

234
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,330
So it can automatically
discover what, okay,

235
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,060
I have like, two projects
in my GitHub repository

236
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,490
and actually this project
is using NuGet package,

237
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,960
which is produced by another project.

238
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,254
So it'll automatically map,
like these dependencies.

239
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:04,758
And then yeah, so I
will select the project,

240
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:06,300
I will say like, okay,

241
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,190
submit the job and then
I will run the job.

242
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,447
So for this project,

243
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:13,070
the job took like, maybe
half an hour to run.

244
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,750
So I will go back to my workspace

245
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,460
and show the results of a previous run

246
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,630
because we don't have time to
do like, live run of this job.

247
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,590
So I have it here again,

248
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,463
I mean I choose the connector
type, discover the repository

249
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,650
and did the transformation.

250
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,958
And here are transformation results.

251
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,177
So because it does, it
can do transformation

252
00:10:38,177 --> 00:10:40,590
of multiple projects at the same time,

253
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,180
the outcome of transformation

254
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,750
is a new branch in each and every project.

255
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,440
So in my case it created the this branch,

256
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,470
which I named 1-transform
because it's the first step

257
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,900
of our seven step process.

258
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,334
So it created this new branch,

259
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:59,970
it transformed like, 3000 lines of code,

260
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,948
one repository, one project.

261
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:03,480
And when I can go deeper

262
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,477
and see like, all the
transformation details,

263
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:09,674
but okay, this is our starting point.

264
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:12,572
We did the transformation
using AWS Transform

265
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:17,220
and the transformed code is
in this transform branch.

266
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,053
Okay?
- Yep.

267
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:18,960
- [Alex] What's next?

268
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,860
- [Prasad] So what Alex showed here

269
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,357
is AWS Transform for .NET

270
00:11:24,357 --> 00:11:27,525
and for those who are not
aware of this service,

271
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,730
Agentic AI experience

272
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,530
for modernizing your .NET applications,

273
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,610
and there are other features also

274
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,040
like your VMware applications,
mainframe applications,

275
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,710
but specific for .NET if we talk about

276
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,068
what Alex has shown is
a large scale porting.

277
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:42,060
And what we mean by large scale porting

278
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,280
is that you can select
more than one applications

279
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,800
to be modernized in one go.

280
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,460
But we also have a IDE extension,

281
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,987
a visual studio extension
for AWS Transform for .NET.

282
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:56,820
It's for developers who wants
to be in their, you know,

283
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,201
developer friendly experience environment.

284
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,104
They can use the visual studio extension

285
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:03,228
and have the same experience.

286
00:12:03,228 --> 00:12:05,302
So irrespective of which pathway you go,

287
00:12:05,302 --> 00:12:08,640
whether you go via web
console that Alex has shown,

288
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,748
or via ID experience,
it does three things.

289
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:12,960
First it analyzes your code base,

290
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,190
which is the assessment part,

291
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,252
then it does the transformation

292
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:18,990
replacing your code base in a way

293
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,842
that it is compatible
with the latest version

294
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:23,130
and then finally it validates, right?

295
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,500
So the outcome, the goal here
is to come up with a code base

296
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,760
that is, you know, Linux ready application

297
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,064
with compatible, right?

298
00:12:32,064 --> 00:12:35,277
So now that's what we have done now.

299
00:12:35,277 --> 00:12:36,883
Now we will take this ported code

300
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:41,040
and we'll use Kiro to fix
any compiled time errors

301
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,380
and build it locally, right?

302
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,560
So let's have a look at the step two now.

303
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,200
- [Alex] Yes, let's switch to the code.

304
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,450
So I'm switching now to Kiro.

305
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,450
So this is the branch which
was created by AWS Transform.

306
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,760
So if I go to this branch,

307
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,439
so this is my one transform branch

308
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:05,430
and you see what it was
committed by AWS Transform,

309
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,830
55 files were changed.

310
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,780
There is a lot of code changed

311
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,050
and if I go to the source code,

312
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,126
you see that now it's a .NET 8 project.

313
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:20,823
So how do I see it if I go to the project?

314
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:25,109
Yeah, you see the project file

315
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:28,313
is much smaller because it's .NET 8.

316
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:31,290
Yeah, the target framework is .NET 8.

317
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:36,290
My configuration is now moved
to application settings.

318
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:40,350
All the static files
were moved to WW route.

319
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,886
So okay, this is, I have like programs CS,

320
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:46,560
have like startups CS,
so it was transformed,

321
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,840
did all the undifferentiated heavy lifting

322
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,492
of porting my .NET framework
application to .NET 8,

323
00:13:53,492 --> 00:13:57,163
but there are like still few things left.

324
00:13:57,163 --> 00:14:01,793
So for example, if I go to this
project and say .NET build,

325
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,400
actually there are a few build errors.

326
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,290
So in many cases AWS Transform
the output will be good

327
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,670
like, compilable project.

328
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,220
In some cases, for example in this one,

329
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,860
there are still some things are missing.

330
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,660
So here it's a mismatch, some
versions of NuGet packages.

331
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,117
And again, as a developer probably

332
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:28,950
I would be able to fix
it like in a few minutes,

333
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,940
like in a half an hour.

334
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,143
But let's see if we can fix
it automatically using Kiro.

335
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,280
So I would just clear that.

336
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,190
And then this is the chat with Kiro.

337
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,140
So I'm saying okay,

338
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,503
I got built errors,

339
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,711
please fix it.

340
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:55,713
I'm trying to be polite
to Kiro so it works.

341
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,710
Yeah, so first thing it's going to do,

342
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,720
it's going to build a project itself

343
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,940
so it can hook to the console output

344
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,090
and see what our built
errors actually are.

345
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,300
Okay, so it got the output and says,

346
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,903
oh, I see the issue there is
a package version conflict.

347
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,121
So it reads my project file,

348
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:28,590
updated some version

349
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,230
so I can see all the
changes that were done.

350
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,380
And it says okay, I
want to build it again.

351
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,660
Okay, so it build it, okay,

352
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,743
there are two more errors it looks like.

353
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,390
Some still it's using like, MVC namespace,

354
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,213
which doesn't exist in the .NET 8.

355
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,251
Okay, so it did few more changes,

356
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:55,234
tries to build it again.

357
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:57,060
So again, these are the steps

358
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,430
which I will do myself as a developer.

359
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,670
So this will be like my, you
know, debugging experience,

360
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,838
but I'm offloading this
debugging experience to Kiro

361
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:07,710
and then just following, okay,

362
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,473
does it make sense from
my developer perspective?

363
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,460
And then it found like there is also issue

364
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,400
in this error Razor View that,

365
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,500
okay, it's using the system web we see,

366
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,606
which is not available ISP .NET core.

367
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:25,293
Okay, so it's fixed it.

368
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,843
Okay, one more error it says,

369
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:31,676
but okay, there is a

370
00:16:36,303 --> 00:16:38,883
post build copy task we should fix.

371
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,770
- [Prasad] It keeps packing
itself back, gate progress.

372
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:45,720
- [Alex] Yeah, and okay .NET built.

373
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,043
Okay, no more errors but it
looks like there was a warning.

374
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:54,210
And again Kiro says, okay,
like there is a warning.

375
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,890
Okay, let me fix this warning as well.

376
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,080
So it's yeah, trying to
make it as good as possible

377
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,040
and we run it okay, it's fixed.

378
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,310
Build succeeded, zero
warning, zero errors.

379
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,620
So how long it took for me and Kiro

380
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,410
to fix this build issues
around one minute,

381
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,820
couple of minutes, probably?
- Couple of minutes.

382
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,190
Yeah, so.
- Okay,

383
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,547
so now our project is compatible locally

384
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,590
and it's .NEt 8 project already.

385
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,590
I'm running it Mac,
it's not .NET framework,

386
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,423
it's .NET 8 project.

387
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:27,660
Okay, what's next?

388
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,240
- [Prasad] Cool, now it
is like building locally.

389
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,590
So let's see what next we can do.

390
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,820
But how did we do that?

391
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,820
We did using Kiro and AI
IDE that went into GA last,

392
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:41,460
a couple of weeks back actually.

393
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,842
It was on preview for some time.

394
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:46,350
And what's beautiful about this AI IDE

395
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,083
is that you provide the intent that

396
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,630
what you want to achieve
in natural language,

397
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,250
not the actual code,

398
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,360
you don't write the actual code,

399
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,420
Kiro writes the actual
code on your behalf, right?

400
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,377
And there are two ways
to provide your intent.

401
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:02,599
First is what has Alex has shown, right?

402
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:07,410
Which is mainly known as by
coding, like prompt engineering,

403
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,460
you provide the prompt

404
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,746
and Kiro does the changes on your behalf

405
00:18:10,746 --> 00:18:14,760
and it's pretty good for
tasks like as we have shown,

406
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,220
fixing errors, troubleshooting,

407
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,500
or you know, in case if you
want to build rapid prototypes,

408
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,180
like, I use it all the time for
creating POCs for customers.

409
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,257
But in case if you are doing more like,

410
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:28,650
you know, complex tasks

411
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,332
and building, you know,
production grade applications,

412
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:36,690
then probably you might want
to use spec driven development.

413
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,253
Live coding might not be
the best way to go forward

414
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,510
and thus Kiro supports spec development.

415
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,880
And we'll dive deep into it in
a moment when we'll be doing

416
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,260
the more complex aspects

417
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,660
of the modernization that we are showing.

418
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,600
But for now, let's look into
where we are in our journey.

419
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,967
So we complete the first two steps,

420
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:57,967
the third step is now replacing
SQL Server with Postgres

421
00:18:58,107 --> 00:19:00,590
and Alex, I believe we
are going to continue

422
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,250
by coding for that?

423
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,083
- Yes.
- Yeah.

424
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,230
And here if you see in that,

425
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,280
if you look at the architecture diagram,

426
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,960
what is happening first and second is done

427
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,850
and we are gonna focus
here on the SQL server.

428
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,700
We'll replace this with Postgres SQL.

429
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,470
Go for it, Alex.

430
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,200
- [Alex] Yeah, let's switch to the code.

431
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,240
So again, I'm running it on Mac

432
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,560
and with Pro there is dependence
on SQL Server local DB,

433
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,360
so I still cannot run it

434
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,730
but I have a local instance

435
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,460
of PostgreSQL running on my machine.

436
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,600
So I want to switch from
SQL server to PostgreSQL.

437
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,060
So first let me switch

438
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,910
to my PostgreSQL.

439
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:43,110
So you see, let me create a new database.

440
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,650
So it's brand new empty database.

441
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,700
Create database Contoso 99, I dunno.

442
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,080
I dunno why 99, but okay,

443
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,440
so I just created this new database

444
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,870
and then let me switch to Kiro

445
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,840
and then I'm just writing, okay?

446
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,118
Like again in Vibe code,
in mode I'm saying okay,

447
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:15,118
I want to switch to PostgreSQL.

448
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:23,080
I have local instance

449
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:30,697
running database name

450
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:36,423
Cantoso 99.

451
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,470
User name, this is my name,

452
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,020
and it's my local database.

453
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,040
So I have empty password, okay?

454
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,150
So this is my intention,

455
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:55,020
what I want to do with this
application and Kiro says okay,

456
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,900
I will help you to switch
from SQL Server to PostgreSQL,

457
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,141
let me check your current
setup, make necessary changes.

458
00:21:01,141 --> 00:21:03,033
So it's checking the,

459
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:06,119
my project file is checking

460
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,421
my application settings
database context startup file

461
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:13,930
and it's now starting making the changes

462
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,540
and I'm doing everything live.

463
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,883
Nothing is recorded.

464
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:21,500
- [Prasad] Let's see how it does

465
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,510
and what model are we using, Alex, here?

466
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,600
- So currently we're
using Claude Sonnet 4.5.

467
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,580
So this is the latest
version of Claude Sonnet.

468
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,140
- [Prasad] Yeah.

469
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,003
- [Alex] Okay, so it's
ask me to do .NET restore.

470
00:21:37,117 --> 00:21:39,147
- [Prasad] Can you point
in the screen where

471
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:41,280
now the model can be changed?

472
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,560
Just for everyone in case
they have not used Kiro.

473
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,732
- [Alex] Yeah, so we are,

474
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:47,220
yeah, we can switch
between different models.

475
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,900
- [Prasad] How many of
you here has used Kiro

476
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,053
or you know, like have
hands-on experience with Kiro?

477
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,540
Very few, okay?

478
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,520
- [Alex] And has anyone used Kiro

479
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,823
to modernize old applications
or only for prototyping?

480
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,033
Okay.

481
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:02,866
- [Prasad] I highly recommend too,

482
00:22:02,866 --> 00:22:03,699
like, you know, it's a free,

483
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:04,532
it's not a free but you know,

484
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,445
once you install it'll give
you a good amount of credits

485
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:10,770
and then every month you
get some credits free.

486
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,740
So try it out. It's a
fork of Visual Studio.

487
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,840
So you will still be in
a very developer friendly

488
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,280
experience that you might be having,

489
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,110
sorry VS Code, it's a fork of VS Code.

490
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,220
So you'll be still be

491
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,713
in a very friendly
development environment.

492
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:24,915
- [Audience Member] So you'll install it

493
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:27,570
and you plug it into the Studio?

494
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,640
- [Prasad] No, it's a separate ID.

495
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,860
You can simply install the
ID and that's pretty much,

496
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,417
so you don't need to
install VS Code for it.

497
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:36,093
You can simply go to
Kiro and install Kiro.

498
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,020
- [Alex] Okay, so it did
the first batch of changes.

499
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,852
So it says okay, it's
updated application settings,

500
00:22:45,852 --> 00:22:48,316
it's updated the project file,

501
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:52,499
updated the database context.

502
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:56,673
Okay, so let's try to run it.

503
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,619
- [Prasad] While you're
running, you had a question.

504
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:02,004
- [Audience Member] Are you planning

505
00:23:02,004 --> 00:23:04,457
for a Visual Studio plugin for it as well?

506
00:23:04,457 --> 00:23:05,580
- [Prasad] So for Visual Studio

507
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,133
we have plugin for AWS Transform,

508
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:10,113
for Kiro, I'm not sure yet.

509
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:14,730
- [Alex] Okay, so I try to run it

510
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,800
and there is an error.

511
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,393
So there is a,

512
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,890
okay, so it says that unhandled
exception entity framework,

513
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,750
datetime2 is not supported.

514
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,197
So okay, probably I'm using this datetime2

515
00:23:33,197 --> 00:23:34,533
in my SQL server code,

516
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:37,590
but datetime2 is not
available in PostgreSQL.

517
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,110
So again as developer I can fix it myself

518
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,960
but what I'm going to do,

519
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,500
I'm just going to

520
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,680
copy this stack trays and ask Kiro.

521
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,917
I have runtime exception,

522
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,480
and I'm just pasting the...

523
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,180
- [Prasad] That's a new
way of development, right?

524
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,353
So as a developer we keep guiding,

525
00:24:08,353 --> 00:24:10,260
Let's say Kiro is a junior developer

526
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,613
and they keep doing it for us.

527
00:24:11,613 --> 00:24:15,749
So it's a kind of a programming
pairing or you know,

528
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:18,350
whichever way you would like to associate,

529
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,183
a friendly developer is
always there for you.

530
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:24,480
- [Alex] Yeah, so it's trying to find

531
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,620
like, the references of
datetime2 in different projects,

532
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,393
updating the notification,

533
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:35,280
accepted the edit to it

534
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,510
and then now it's saying, okay,

535
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,010
let me check the other models.

536
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,910
So again, this is something
which I as developer would do.

537
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,550
Okay, like if I fix a
error I will try to see,

538
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,783
okay, if similar errors
exists in our code files.

539
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,813
Okay, so I was able to build it.

540
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:59,043
Let me run it again.

541
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:08,163
It looks like there is
datetime2 exist somewhere else.

542
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,280
Yeah, now it's in person table.

543
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:16,280
But again, let me just
copy this stack trace

544
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,510
and say got

545
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,990
runtime error

546
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,230
and I'm pasting it in the same session.

547
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,390
So Kiro knows like, the context,

548
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,618
okay, this is my conversation
about PostgreSQL migration.

549
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:35,910
- Yeah.
- And this says okay,

550
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,127
I found these issues in person model

551
00:25:39,127 --> 00:25:42,278
and students model, instructor model.

552
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:46,320
So it's trying to fix
it in all other classes.

553
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,370
- [Prasad] While it is fixing, yes?

554
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,570
You have a question please?

555
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,530
- [Audience Member] What
makes Kiro different

556
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,940
than using like Cursor or like,
Copilot with the same model?

557
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,190
- [Prasad] So it's like it
has much deeper integration

558
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,023
with your AWS services

559
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:59,336
and we'll see show you
how you can deploy it

560
00:25:59,336 --> 00:26:02,193
all using CDK project in AWS.

561
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,320
- [Alex] Okay, so let me build it

562
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:09,063
and let me run it again.

563
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,943
.NET run.

564
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:22,950
Okay, so now at least I don't
have like runtime errors

565
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,950
and it's running on local host 5,000.

566
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,183
So let's see,

567
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:31,110
so this is my application.

568
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,750
So again it's up, so it's
like .NET 8 application

569
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,640
already is running on my Mac

570
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,390
and if I go to students page,

571
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,830
okay, something is not working

572
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,060
so it looks like I get
another runtime error.

573
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,893
So let's see.

574
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,610
- [Prasad] So the page is loading

575
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,020
but it's not able to load the data, right?

576
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,853
- [Alex] Yeah.

577
00:26:52,853 --> 00:26:57,113
So the connection string
was not initialized.

578
00:26:57,113 --> 00:26:59,050
So okay again, let me just

579
00:27:04,232 --> 00:27:05,065
copy it.

580
00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:08,370
- [Prasad] Yes, while Alex is fixing it,

581
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,380
please go ahead ask the question.

582
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,120
- [Audience Member] Does
it support other models

583
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,800
than what is shown there?

584
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,633
- [Prasad] Yeah,

585
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,080
we'll show in a moment what
other models it supports.

586
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,827
- So currently as it can-
- We can see the differences.

587
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:23,527
- [Prasad] Try it out, experiment.

588
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:25,872
- [Alex] So you see,

589
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:30,153
there is like this Claude
Sonnet 4.54, Haiku, Opus,

590
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,483
and then yes, it's OpenCoder.

591
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,884
Okay, but now again,

592
00:27:39,884 --> 00:27:42,780
now it's trying to fix
another random error

593
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,460
but the connection string was
not correctly initialized.

594
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,513
So let's see.

595
00:27:55,431 --> 00:27:58,350
So it's trying to find,
okay, like whatever control,

596
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,421
I mean.
- Yeah, please go ahead.

597
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:04,230
- [Audience Member] Yeah
regarding the sort of the AI,

598
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,450
if you have like GitHub
Copilot or some other thing,

599
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,811
would they integrate with that

600
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,957
or is this a separate service?

601
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:12,510
- [Prasad] So it's a ID in itself, right?

602
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:15,643
So and it has the
inbuilt, what do you call?

603
00:28:15,643 --> 00:28:17,283
AI capabilities.

604
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:20,610
I don't think that it
is going to integrate

605
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,690
with GitHub or Copilot.

606
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,243
No, I would try it out or not try it out.

607
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,417
- [Alex] Okay, so yeah,
we're still like in this

608
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,380
maybe it's not vibe coding mode,

609
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,150
it's like vibe debugging mode.

610
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,900
We're trying to fix this
issue with PostgreSQL.

611
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:39,670
So, but okay, let's see

612
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,030
and let's run it again

613
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,953
and I think it's still on the port 5,000.

614
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,870
Okay, so now the page is loaded.

615
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,260
So it looks like I don't
have like any runtime errors

616
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,930
but there is no data on this page

617
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,340
and I know that this project,

618
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,210
it has the database initializer,

619
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,583
which like, seeds the sample data.

620
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,023
So again I can ask Kiro.

621
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,860
Or not ask, I'm just making the statement

622
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,860
with same sample data is not seeded.

623
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,430
- [Prasad] So as a developer,

624
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,990
you still need to know
what needs to be done

625
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,510
and then you keep
instructing Kiro, but okay,

626
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,920
can you please do this on our behalf?

627
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,390
And they'll keep doing it hopefully

628
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,690
- [Alex] Again this is
like my fair programmer,

629
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,023
I'm talking to Kiro and trying
to solve the issues together.

630
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:50,520
- [Prasad] Yes please?

631
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,700
- [Audience Member] And is
it same like Copilot, Kiro?

632
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,617
- [Prasad] It's a lot more
efficient, I would say.

633
00:29:56,617 --> 00:29:59,490
- [Audience Member] It's the same, right?

634
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,170
- [Prasad] Yeah, similar capabilities

635
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,820
and as I mentioned it has
a much deeper integration

636
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,440
of the AWS Services when
it comes to deployment.

637
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,390
We look into this, how
we'll create a CDK project

638
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,520
and we'll deploy it on AWS.

639
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,961
- [Alex] Yeah, so like what we see that

640
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:14,760
it's the database
initializer was not called.

641
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,900
So now we call initializer,
okay let's build,

642
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,488
- [Prasad] Okay, yes please continue.

643
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:21,500
- [Audience Member] So I mean,

644
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,009
we do have results studio, right?

645
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:24,614
- [Prasad] VS Code or Visual Studio?

646
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,761
- [Audience Member] Which on is that?

647
00:30:25,761 --> 00:30:28,410
- [Prasad] This is VS
Code for the Kiro ID.

648
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,830
- [Audience Member] My point was,

649
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,590
Visual Studio automatically
does the compiling, right?

650
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,670
- [Prasad] Yes.

651
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,847
- [Audience Member] So now we have to

652
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:37,122
initially install Kiro or what it was?

653
00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:39,090
- [Prasad] You can continue using that

654
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,800
but in case if you would like to,

655
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,633
so Kiro is a great alternative.

656
00:30:44,702 --> 00:30:48,210
- [Alex] Maybe let's leave
it for the discussion,

657
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,380
like maybe after this session

658
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,240
because we are really short of time,

659
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,953
like to show what we want to show.

660
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:56,034
So we are still progressing

661
00:30:56,034 --> 00:30:59,817
with this upgrade from
SQL Server to PostgreSQL

662
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:04,817
and there is this maybe I
hope if this is the last error

663
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:09,492
that it's, yeah.

664
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:13,080
So there is an error when
it's trying to seed the data.

665
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,793
So yeah, let's see what it's all about.

666
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,200
And yeah, we got run time error

667
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,333
seeding the data.

668
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:40,740
Yeah, so again this is like
still issue with datetime

669
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,350
that you need to specify
if like UTCO local.

670
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,800
So this is the PostgreSQL
specific feature.

671
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,613
So let me, yeah it did some changes.

672
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,710
Let's build it

673
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:58,833
and let's run it.

674
00:32:00,973 --> 00:32:01,806
.NET run.

675
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:08,637
Okay, update the page,

676
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:13,637
and okay, so here we have
a data so we just upgrade.

677
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:17,040
So now this application is
running locally on my macOS,

678
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,410
it's .NET 8 application

679
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,010
and instead of SQL Server
it's using PostgreSQL

680
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,900
and it took us, I dunno how many,

681
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,220
maybe 20 minutes in total

682
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,050
of like, vibe coding with Kiro.

683
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,427
- Yeah, and until now.
- Yeah, exactly.

684
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:32,160
Cool.
- So what's next?

685
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,740
- [Prasad] So let's see
where we are in our journey.

686
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,710
So we did modernize from
SQL server to PostgreSQL.

687
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,350
The next step is MSMQ to Amazon SQS.

688
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,876
And if you look at the collection diagram,

689
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,460
if you look at like where
the three is written.

690
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,339
So we replaced SQL server
with PostgreSQL there

691
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:50,070
and now we are going to focus on the MSMQ

692
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,964
and make it Amazon SQS.

693
00:32:51,964 --> 00:32:53,460
And this I think we are going to do it

694
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,860
with spec driven development

695
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,630
and this is where the
actual differentiation

696
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:01,033
would come into picture,
the spec development.

697
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,363
- [Alex] Okay, let's switch to code.

698
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:05,196
- [Prasad] Yeah, let's switch to code.

699
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,879
- [Alex] So I will start the new session

700
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:11,517
and instead of like vibe coding,

701
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:14,110
I'm now going into spec code mode

702
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,040
and I already have my prompt,

703
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,050
I don't want to type it, but okay,

704
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,820
so I'm saying current application

705
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,736
is using MSMQ for notifications.

706
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:24,997
I want to switch to SQS implementation.

707
00:33:24,997 --> 00:33:27,480
I want just base functionality,

708
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,178
like no extensive error handling,

709
00:33:29,178 --> 00:33:31,650
no unit test, no like, local testing.

710
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,801
So I want to keep it like, at MVP level

711
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:36,296
and I already have SQSQ created

712
00:33:36,296 --> 00:33:39,143
and this is the URL of the queue

713
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:42,873
and now I'm like in the
spec development mode.

714
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:47,250
- [Prasad] So what does it
do in spec development mode?

715
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,840
- [Alex] Yeah, so first it's going

716
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,670
to create the requirements document.

717
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,070
And it will create

718
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,500
requirements document based on my project.

719
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,140
Okay, what does it mean?

720
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,283
Upgrading MSMQ to SQS

721
00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:04,833
and we will see like this
document in a second.

722
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,903
Okay, so it's created the requirements

723
00:34:17,903 --> 00:34:20,793
and now it will ask me to review it.

724
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,770
So you see there is a
new folder created .Kiro

725
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,701
and under .Kiro there is a specs folder

726
00:34:27,701 --> 00:34:32,650
and it created this SQS
notification migration folder.

727
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,408
So again, the name makes perfect sense

728
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:38,686
based on my intent that
I want to migrate to SQS

729
00:34:38,686 --> 00:34:43,686
and it's created this
requirement document.

730
00:34:44,231 --> 00:34:47,550
So this specification
defines for migration

731
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,135
of this notification system from in memory

732
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:55,135
to in memory queue implementation
to SQS, some glossary.

733
00:34:55,831 --> 00:34:58,230
But here are requirements, okay,

734
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,390
as an administrator I want notifications

735
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,650
to be sent to SQS instead
of in memory queue.

736
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,888
So notifications are persistent
across application restarts.

737
00:35:08,888 --> 00:35:10,560
Second requirement,

738
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,431
as a developer I want to use SDK for .NET

739
00:35:14,431 --> 00:35:17,290
so that application can
communicate with SQS.

740
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,873
Okay, also makes sense.

741
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,760
As a developer I want queue
URL to be configurable,

742
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,370
so like, different environment.

743
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,770
So I can have different queues

744
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,030
for when I'm in production environment,

745
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,550
for my test environment and so on.

746
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:35,490
And then also as a developer,
this is quite important.

747
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,890
So as developer I want
existing notifications

748
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,330
API to remain untouched.

749
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,336
So okay, I want to change
the underlying implementation

750
00:35:42,336 --> 00:35:43,980
but not with interfaces.

751
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,077
So like all the services
we'd use notification,

752
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,960
service, I mean should be untouched.

753
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,659
Okay, so all these
requirements make sense to me.

754
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:54,540
I'm moving to design phase.

755
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,270
So what design phase is that?

756
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,210
Okay, these requirements
are quite generic.

757
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,213
So I would say that, okay,
these are requirements

758
00:36:03,213 --> 00:36:07,976
for every project where you
migrate from MSMQ to SQS.

759
00:36:07,976 --> 00:36:11,370
Now what Kiro will try to do,

760
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,710
it will try to apply these requirements

761
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,090
to my specific project.

762
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,790
Okay, what do I need to do in this project

763
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,460
in order to implement these requirements?

764
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,840
So this is the design phase

765
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,200
and it will take into account
the whole project structure,

766
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,023
my classes, my dependencies and so on.

767
00:36:29,574 --> 00:36:33,094
So it's working on this design document.

768
00:36:33,094 --> 00:36:37,740
So the design document is
created and yeah, let's see.

769
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:42,240
So it says, okay, look this
is the current architecture.

770
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,120
So again it went to my
source code to understand.

771
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,410
okay, what is the current architecture,

772
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,580
how it looks like?

773
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,960
I have notification service,

774
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,230
I have base controller, I
have notification controller.

775
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,403
Then okay, how the target
architecture should like,

776
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:59,264
okay, these are the changes
which has to be implemented.

777
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,380
And then it says, okay, like,

778
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,560
this is where it shows
also some code pieces.

779
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,920
Okay, this is how the
new notification server

780
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,420
should look like.

781
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,958
This is the interfaces,
some key design decisions,

782
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:15,750
this is the configuration.

783
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,276
So okay, I will add this into up settings,

784
00:37:19,276 --> 00:37:22,553
the configuration of a queue,
the new dependencies, okay,

785
00:37:22,553 --> 00:37:24,660
now the project must be dependent

786
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,702
on ED plus SDK, SQS and so on.

787
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:31,184
So again, when the notification

788
00:37:31,184 --> 00:37:35,694
is saved in SQS it has to be serialized.

789
00:37:35,694 --> 00:37:37,517
So this is the class

790
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:40,845
and this is how the
serialization will look like

791
00:37:40,845 --> 00:37:41,930
and so on and so on.

792
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:45,390
So again, I can review
this design document.

793
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,090
As a developer, I can
make the changes to it,

794
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,756
but okay for me now it's good enough.

795
00:37:50,756 --> 00:37:52,773
Move to implementation plan.

796
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,380
- [Prasad] So the whole process

797
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,255
is that once you provide
a intentional requirement,

798
00:37:57,255 --> 00:38:01,533
then design and then
the implementation plan.

799
00:38:02,484 --> 00:38:06,213
- [Alex] Yeah, so now
it's creating these tasks.

800
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:11,400
So tasks, these are single
units of implementation,

801
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,804
which Kiro is going to do with me

802
00:38:13,804 --> 00:38:18,804
and now it's asking me, okay,
do I want to make it fast?

803
00:38:19,184 --> 00:38:22,500
So some tasks keep as an optional ones

804
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,570
or do I want to make
all the tasks required?

805
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:28,110
Okay, we are in a short of time.

806
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:33,110
So okay, let's do this MVP
level of implementation.

807
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:39,615
So it's created the task list.

808
00:38:39,615 --> 00:38:42,415
So let's look at them.

809
00:38:42,415 --> 00:38:44,460
So these are the tasks, okay?

810
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,052
First task we need to add SDK dependency,

811
00:38:47,052 --> 00:38:48,990
add when you get package

812
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,440
and then the add the
configuration to up settings.

813
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,549
When I need to update the
notification service to use SQS,

814
00:38:56,549 --> 00:38:58,560
this is how is done.

815
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,110
And then okay, I need to
implement the send notification

816
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:05,060
with SQS instead of using MSMQ.

817
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,681
So I need to do the serialization,

818
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:09,313
send the message, get result.

819
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:12,450
I need to implement retrieve
notification and so on.

820
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,715
So these are like this list of tasks

821
00:39:14,715 --> 00:39:16,547
which has to be implemented

822
00:39:16,547 --> 00:39:19,588
in order to implement my requirements.

823
00:39:19,588 --> 00:39:23,225
And then for each task I can
just say, okay, start task.

824
00:39:23,225 --> 00:39:25,800
And then Kiro will do the implementation

825
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,710
of this specific first task, okay?

826
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,800
It'll add the dependency to SDK,

827
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,019
it'll add the NuGet package

828
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:35,850
and it'll update my configuration,

829
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,953
so that's my up settings.

830
00:39:39,072 --> 00:39:41,973
So it's working on this task.

831
00:39:41,973 --> 00:39:44,460
- [Prasad] It kind of
follows the full SDLC cycle.

832
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,810
First you're creating the requirements

833
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,610
and then the resign tasks

834
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,670
and then it starts implementing
the tasks on your behalf.

835
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,960
- [Alex] Yeah, so actually it follows,

836
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,670
like, my own mental model, okay?

837
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,580
As a developer probably
I will do the same steps.

838
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,780
I will figure out, okay,

839
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,707
what our requirements are
then I will figure out, okay,

840
00:40:00,707 --> 00:40:04,375
how is requirements are
applicable to my specific project?

841
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:05,928
And okay, like in order to implement it,

842
00:40:05,928 --> 00:40:07,290
okay, what do I need to do?

843
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,123
Like, exactly what tasks?

844
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,790
So Kiro is working

845
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:19,290
and this is the beauty of a live demo.

846
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,390
So you don't know what to expect,

847
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:26,373
but, okay.

848
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,390
You got the idea.

849
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,140
So let me quickly switch to a new branch.

850
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,213
So I will just undo all the changes,

851
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,640
discard everything.

852
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,480
And then I already

853
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:50,670
have a branch with implemented feature.

854
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,503
So just let me quickly switch to it.

855
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,900
So I have this branch
for SQS, so get, switch.

856
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,133
Yes.

857
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,597
So this is the,

858
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,500
this is the feature.

859
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,520
So these are requirements

860
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,570
and then yeah, I already
implemented this feature here.

861
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,696
Okay, so let's fast forward.

862
00:41:23,696 --> 00:41:24,720
What's next?

863
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,143
- [Prasad] Yeah, so let's
go to the presentation mode.

864
00:41:28,713 --> 00:41:31,380
So what we have seen is
the spec driven development

865
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,900
and that's the main
differentiating factor, right?

866
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,650
So vibe coding is good and that
is available like, you know,

867
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,459
and multiple other tools also, but,

868
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:41,861
and that is good for, you know,

869
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:46,467
rapid prototyping and
quick fixing the issues.

870
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:48,210
But in case if you are, you know,

871
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,445
you need a more in depth
thinking, you need a more,

872
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:53,818
you know, production
level projects to be built

873
00:41:53,818 --> 00:41:55,950
and that's where the
spec driven development

874
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,380
comes into a picture that we have seen.

875
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,640
But when talk about the journey,

876
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,020
like, where we are right now currently

877
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,987
that we did the MSMQ to Amazon SQS,

878
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,890
the next part that we're going to do

879
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,527
is actually extract our microservice to,

880
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:10,830
from this small length,

881
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,420
like, that's what we're
going to work on next.

882
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,460
So we are going to extract
this notification service

883
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,947
into its own service again

884
00:42:15,947 --> 00:42:19,890
using the spec driven
development, right Alex?

885
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,960
- [Alex] Yes, let's switch to demo.

886
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,630
So again, for the sake
of time I will show like,

887
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,880
what kind of specification was generated

888
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,479
and how the project was changed.

889
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:30,312
- [Prasad] Yep.

890
00:42:30,312 --> 00:42:32,523
- [Alex] So I will
switch to another branch.

891
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:36,543
So it's with notification service.

892
00:42:42,077 --> 00:42:44,730
So if I go to Kiro folder

893
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,970
now I have another
specification which was created

894
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,480
with notification service extraction.

895
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,650
And again, if I go to requirements

896
00:42:56,045 --> 00:42:59,088
it says okay, these are requirements

897
00:42:59,088 --> 00:43:01,650
for extraction of notification service

898
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,540
from this monolith application

899
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,138
into separate .NET 8 web microservice.

900
00:43:06,138 --> 00:43:09,090
So I can deploy it independently,

901
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,410
I can scale it independently.

902
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:12,240
So this is the beauty of microservices.

903
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,208
- [Prasad] So this is the kind
of intent that you provided

904
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:16,868
with which it created this specification.

905
00:43:16,868 --> 00:43:20,610
- [Alex] Yeah, so now
first requirement, okay,

906
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,530
as an architect I want
identification service

907
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:25,020
to be extracted into
separate web pay project

908
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,568
so it can be deployed
and scaled independently.

909
00:43:27,568 --> 00:43:32,280
As a developer I wanted to
expose rest API endpoints

910
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,147
so I can send notifications

911
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:38,548
and the main applications can
send notifications using HTTP

912
00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:42,000
and it goes like into more details, okay?

913
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,830
The endpoint should be exposed

914
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:47,370
at API/notifications and so on.

915
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,378
Okay, as a developer I
want notification API

916
00:43:49,378 --> 00:43:53,748
to expose endpoints to
receive notifications, okay?

917
00:43:53,748 --> 00:43:57,724
As a developer I want to use HTP client

918
00:43:57,724 --> 00:44:00,330
to communicate with notifications API.

919
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:02,970
So I don't want to do
like, direct references,

920
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:07,188
I want to decouple it
and use the HTTP calls

921
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:10,263
in between main application
and identification service.

922
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:15,128
And yeah, as operator I want everything

923
00:44:15,128 --> 00:44:17,790
to be configured in the URL.

924
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,013
So okay, there is a URL
of notification API,

925
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:23,670
which can be changed
based on the environment.

926
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,358
And the last one here,

927
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:28,980
like, proper dependency ejection,

928
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:33,088
again everything makes sense
from my developer standpoint.

929
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:35,673
Proper configuration files

930
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,610
and I want existing controllers

931
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,530
to continue working without changes.

932
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,763
So again, this call,

933
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,424
I mean switch between in process call

934
00:44:45,424 --> 00:44:48,090
to the HTTP call should be done,

935
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,550
like, in the lower implementation level

936
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,683
so that the APIs are not changed.

937
00:44:53,683 --> 00:44:56,730
And then yeah, it created
design based on this.

938
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:01,290
So like, design here
again it shows the flow,

939
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:02,250
what it gave us.

940
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,410
Application is called notification service

941
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,872
notification services
called notification API,

942
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:10,983
and notification API is using the SQSQ

943
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:13,470
and it goes like, into details, okay?

944
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,740
The base controller uses
this method and so on.

945
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,480
So again, design is like

946
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,823
how this specification is
implemented on my code base.

947
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:27,060
And then it ended up with
a list of tasks, okay?

948
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,888
Create this new web project,

949
00:45:28,888 --> 00:45:33,888
set up all appropriate like
models dependency injection.

950
00:45:33,947 --> 00:45:37,956
So I already, as you see,
implemented all these tasks.

951
00:45:37,956 --> 00:45:41,400
So there is a new project
created side by side

952
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,140
with my Contoso University project.

953
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,863
It's called Notification API.

954
00:45:44,863 --> 00:45:48,811
It has one controller,
it has like the service,

955
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:53,811
the model and then it's using the SDK SQS

956
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,037
to communicate with a queue

957
00:45:57,037 --> 00:45:59,401
and also it removed the references

958
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:02,223
to SQS from my main project.

959
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,973
So, okay, where we are now?

960
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:08,550
- [Prasad] We are a bit short on time,

961
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,510
so we'll take the questions at the end,

962
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,640
we'll hang around even
after the session is over.

963
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,417
And so we'll take all the questions then.

964
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:15,330
We have around 14 minutes left

965
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:18,832
to showcase few extra
things that we have here.

966
00:46:18,832 --> 00:46:20,970
So we did the step five,

967
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,280
which is extracting a
microservice from monolith.

968
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,750
So if you look from the
architecture perspective,

969
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,340
this is how it looks like now.

970
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,321
So we are incrementally
modernizing it, right?

971
00:46:29,321 --> 00:46:32,790
Now one thing that we
would like to focus now

972
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,980
is refactoring the UI.

973
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,617
So when you talk about like you see,

974
00:46:35,617 --> 00:46:36,613
.NET applications there,

975
00:46:36,613 --> 00:46:39,211
UI is in this particular is
in Razor Views for example,

976
00:46:39,211 --> 00:46:40,770
and we want to move it

977
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,815
to the modern UI frameworks like React.

978
00:46:42,815 --> 00:46:44,670
So that's what we are going to do

979
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,270
right now in the next step,
refactoring the UI part.

980
00:46:48,737 --> 00:46:50,580
- [Alex] Okay, let me switch.

981
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:54,040
So again, I will just
quickly switch to the branch

982
00:46:55,293 --> 00:46:59,253
where I already refactored to UI.

983
00:47:00,368 --> 00:47:02,700
- [Prasad] So how much
time does it take, Alex,

984
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,860
to do these refactoring like, you know?

985
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,420
- [Alex] So let me show first

986
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,930
the specification actually,
not even the specification,

987
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:13,683
let me show the tasks for
this React UI migration.

988
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,043
So you see now the list of tasks

989
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,950
is really, really huge

990
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:24,557
because what Kiro was
planning to do is, okay,

991
00:47:24,557 --> 00:47:26,910
set up backend API infrastructure

992
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,010
because I'm switching from MVC controllers

993
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,218
to API controllers,

994
00:47:31,218 --> 00:47:33,660
creating like all the response models,

995
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,453
data transfer objects,

996
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:38,220
create the students API controller,

997
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,880
create courses API controller,

998
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,795
create instructors API
controller, departments and so on.

999
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:48,779
Then yeah, initialized React application

1000
00:47:48,779 --> 00:47:51,869
using vibe and type script,

1001
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,260
add the reference to material UI,

1002
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,130
and then, yeah, configure API

1003
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:00,787
and then it started

1004
00:48:00,787 --> 00:48:05,787
implementing the forms one by one.

1005
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,173
So first it's APIs, okay?

1006
00:48:08,173 --> 00:48:11,128
Build students page,
create student list page,

1007
00:48:11,128 --> 00:48:14,898
create student form page,
create student create page.

1008
00:48:14,898 --> 00:48:19,110
And then same goes for
departments, same goes for courses.

1009
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:21,898
So it's like very extensive list of tasks.

1010
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:22,950
And again like,

1011
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:25,620
these are the tasks which I as a developer

1012
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,850
would need to do myself, okay?

1013
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:30,930
Like if I get a task
convert from Razor Views

1014
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,673
to React application, okay,

1015
00:48:32,673 --> 00:48:36,055
will be I know 50 forms which
I need to create manually

1016
00:48:36,055 --> 00:48:38,610
and these server tasks,
which I need to do,

1017
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:41,730
form by form, like
implement with new forms.

1018
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:44,790
And as I already implemented this task,

1019
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,070
so back to your question, Prasad,

1020
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,720
I think it took like maybe four

1021
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,050
or five hours to like
implement all these tasks.

1022
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:54,510
So and then again you can
think that okay, you know,

1023
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,400
maybe it's like
significant amount of time,

1024
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,700
I know working together with
Kiro, like, for five hours.

1025
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,230
But then think about like,

1026
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,567
if you do same migration
manually from like,

1027
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,660
you know, Razor Views to React, okay,

1028
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,400
how much it would take?

1029
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,110
Maybe a couple of weeks for me

1030
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,560
to implement always like 50
forms, APIs, controllers,

1031
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,300
I mean everything like that.

1032
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,550
Together with Kiro, it's
like less than a day

1033
00:49:18,416 --> 00:49:20,724
and this is this Cantoso
University UI application

1034
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:24,330
implemented with, yeah, everything,

1035
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:29,100
pages, components, I mean everything.

1036
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,190
So again, structured in a very nice way.

1037
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:34,889
So again, this is also
a way for me to learn,

1038
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:37,148
like okay, what is the
best practices nowadays

1039
00:49:37,148 --> 00:49:40,650
to implement React
application, for example?

1040
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:41,483
- [Prasad] Yeah, and that's where

1041
00:49:41,483 --> 00:49:43,770
the spec-driven development
really stands out

1042
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:45,210
because it does create the specifications

1043
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,070
then you can go and manually
edit those specifications

1044
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:50,171
if needed and then you know,
ask it to implement a task,

1045
00:49:50,171 --> 00:49:51,591
revert a task if needed.

1046
00:49:51,591 --> 00:49:52,773
You can keep guiding it

1047
00:49:52,773 --> 00:49:55,110
and it'll keep doing it on your behalf.

1048
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,165
So when it comes to like, vibe coding,

1049
00:49:56,165 --> 00:49:58,410
that's pretty straightforward

1050
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,000
but spec-driven is where actually

1051
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,620
you need to follow that
specific structure.

1052
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,700
It'll help you actually implement

1053
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,713
really complex aspects of it.

1054
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:08,027
So now we did refactoring the UI

1055
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:09,681
and the final part of it

1056
00:50:09,681 --> 00:50:12,270
would be actually
creating the CDK project.

1057
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,340
But in case if you want
to look at the diagram,

1058
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,891
so this is how it is, if you
look at the presentation layer,

1059
00:50:16,891 --> 00:50:20,070
it changes to React app and
instead of MVC controllers,

1060
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,476
it is now API controllers, right?

1061
00:50:23,476 --> 00:50:25,860
So now let's do the last part of it,

1062
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,130
which is deploying this whole
modernized applications.

1063
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,620
A code base is running locally
and it is modernized locally,

1064
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,233
but let's deploy it on AWS
by creating a CDK project.

1065
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:36,930
- [Alex] Yeah, so again,

1066
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:39,240
I already created a specification

1067
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,780
and I already run
created with CDK project.

1068
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,164
So I think like for CDK took
me maybe a couple of hours

1069
00:50:45,164 --> 00:50:48,330
to create a CDK project and deploy it

1070
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:51,271
and then there were like
some small issues to fix.

1071
00:50:51,271 --> 00:50:53,940
But again, instead of
maybe a couple of days,

1072
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,740
it took like a couple of hours.

1073
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,593
So let me switch.

1074
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:04,171
So again, I was using
spec-driven development.

1075
00:51:04,171 --> 00:51:09,171
So this is the specification
created at the CDK deployment.

1076
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,622
So from requirements perspective,

1077
00:51:12,622 --> 00:51:15,315
I want to deploy with Cantoso
University application

1078
00:51:15,315 --> 00:51:17,813
using CDK, CDK using C#,

1079
00:51:17,813 --> 00:51:20,188
because CDK supports multiple languages

1080
00:51:20,188 --> 00:51:21,923
we want to use like C#,

1081
00:51:21,923 --> 00:51:23,820
and then it detected

1082
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,010
for the key application
has three components,

1083
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:29,010
React front end, main backend,

1084
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:31,005
and also identification service API.

1085
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,482
Also it must provision

1086
00:51:32,482 --> 00:51:34,755
required infrastructure compute database.

1087
00:51:34,755 --> 00:51:38,460
So instead of my local
PostgreSQL database,

1088
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,811
it should provision
Aurora PostgreSQL database

1089
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:44,289
and all supporting resources,

1090
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:45,987
like no application load balance

1091
00:51:45,987 --> 00:51:48,470
or secrets manager to securely store

1092
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:52,017
my database credentials and so on.

1093
00:51:52,017 --> 00:51:54,851
And then it's ended up creating the tasks,

1094
00:51:54,851 --> 00:51:59,281
create CDK project, create
the EC2 based deployment,

1095
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:02,580
deployment scripts and so on.

1096
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:06,709
So the output is this CDK project.

1097
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:09,318
So it has like, multiple constructs,

1098
00:52:09,318 --> 00:52:13,290
constructs for my EC2
instances for backend services,

1099
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:17,580
construct for the database,
for front end, for messaging.

1100
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,490
And then also it created
a number of scripts

1101
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:22,977
because when it deploys it to EC2,

1102
00:52:22,977 --> 00:52:26,198
it has to provision resources first,

1103
00:52:26,198 --> 00:52:29,010
then get the URL of a load balancer

1104
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,690
and then update the React application

1105
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,570
with this URL of a load
balancer for backend API

1106
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,310
and then redeploy React application.

1107
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:40,297
So Kiro automatically discovered
these dependencies, okay,

1108
00:52:40,297 --> 00:52:43,320
the deployment must be
like, in these steps,

1109
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,440
like, in this order and
it created it for me.

1110
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,440
So this is the application
which is deployed on CloudFront

1111
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:55,860
and something failed recently,

1112
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,360
like, my load balancer died.

1113
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:02,360
But okay, this is the page with courses.

1114
00:53:02,621 --> 00:53:05,040
Yeah, okay, now it's failed load courses.

1115
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,680
But again this is the React application

1116
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,143
connected to the Amazon
Aurora PostgreSQL database

1117
00:53:11,143 --> 00:53:13,590
through the load balance.

1118
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,980
So again, everything was
deployed by the CDK project,

1119
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,640
which was created by me for me by Kiro.

1120
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,803
- [Prasad] We can show
the architecture diagram.

1121
00:53:21,803 --> 00:53:24,360
So, let's switch to the slides

1122
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,836
and let's look at the two slides.

1123
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:29,640
So, we did the last step CDK project,

1124
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,862
but when it comes to the
architecture diagram,

1125
00:53:31,862 --> 00:53:33,446
so you can see the front end,

1126
00:53:33,446 --> 00:53:36,079
the React app is deployed on S3 bucket

1127
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,390
and it's front end by Amazon CloudFront.

1128
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,900
The web API is deployed on
Amazon EC2 Linux instance

1129
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,200
with ASP.NET core API controllers.

1130
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,220
And it has, you know, in the same code

1131
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,180
business entity framework

1132
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,270
to talk to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL.

1133
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,200
So it's not just the
local PostgreSQL instance,

1134
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,318
but they're deployed,
Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL.

1135
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:56,536
And then if you can see there is another,

1136
00:53:56,536 --> 00:53:58,530
a service notification service.

1137
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:59,780
It is deployed on separate EC2 instance

1138
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,346
and that talks to your Amazon SQS.

1139
00:54:02,346 --> 00:54:05,902
So this is all the components
that were modernized

1140
00:54:05,902 --> 00:54:08,051
and deployed on AWS and Alex,

1141
00:54:08,051 --> 00:54:10,523
this is a simplified version
of that correction, right?

1142
00:54:10,523 --> 00:54:12,660
- [Alex] Yes, so this is
very simplified version

1143
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,773
because there is
application load balancer,

1144
00:54:15,773 --> 00:54:18,500
it has this route-based...

1145
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,440
- Path-based routing.
- Path-based routing.

1146
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,301
So like, web identification service,

1147
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:26,100
there is also secrets managers

1148
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,920
to connect to database and so on.

1149
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,430
But here we just showing, okay,

1150
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,076
these deployment components of,

1151
00:54:32,076 --> 00:54:37,076
so you can mentally map our
legacy analytic application

1152
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:40,350
to a new architecture net with this.

1153
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,700
- [Prasad] So that's where
the whole differentiation

1154
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,570
of Kiro comes into picture,

1155
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,590
the spec driven development

1156
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:44,640
of structured way of doing it

1157
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,740
and then you know, deploying it on AWS.

1158
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:47,730
But if you look at, you know,

1159
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,855
if I try and summarize
of what we have achieved

1160
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,770
so far in this session
is that we started from

1161
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:55,016
this legacy .NET application

1162
00:54:55,016 --> 00:54:57,247
with Razor Views and MVC controller

1163
00:54:57,247 --> 00:55:01,054
and Microsoft components
like MSMQ and SQL Server.

1164
00:55:01,054 --> 00:55:04,830
And what we ended up is this,
by doing the seven steps.

1165
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:05,663
The first step,

1166
00:55:05,663 --> 00:55:07,875
putting your .NET framework
application to .NET,

1167
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:10,686
then we actually fix
the errors and you know,

1168
00:55:10,686 --> 00:55:12,497
like, build it locally.

1169
00:55:12,497 --> 00:55:15,968
Then we replace SQL
Server with PostgreSQL,

1170
00:55:15,968 --> 00:55:20,898
and then we replaced MSMQ with Amazon SQS,

1171
00:55:20,898 --> 00:55:24,158
and then we wrote them all,
let them do microservices,

1172
00:55:24,158 --> 00:55:26,380
the notification service that is there

1173
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:29,999
and then we refactored the UI to React,

1174
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:34,686
and then finally we used
CDK to deploy it onto AWS

1175
00:55:34,686 --> 00:55:37,440
with all the components that is required

1176
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,543
to make it a functioning application.

1177
00:55:41,023 --> 00:55:43,887
So that's pretty much
that we have for today

1178
00:55:43,887 --> 00:55:46,082
and we do have few resources
for you to get started.

1179
00:55:46,082 --> 00:55:48,429
You know, AWS Transform for .NET

1180
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:50,340
for upgrading your .NET applications

1181
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,122
and AWS and Kiro,

1182
00:55:52,122 --> 00:55:55,139
for you to actually do this whole,

1183
00:55:55,139 --> 00:55:56,211
not only just vibe coding

1184
00:55:56,211 --> 00:55:58,560
but also the spec driven development.

1185
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,680
That's where the actual strength
of Kiro comes into picture,

1186
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,234
the whole AI ID comes into picture.

1187
00:56:04,234 --> 00:56:06,090
I will pause for a moment for everyone

1188
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:08,073
to take pictures who is, yeah.

1189
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,530
And then we do have a few resources,

1190
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:20,250
like a lot of agentic AI
courses on AWS Skill Builder.

1191
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,817
So feel free to actually, you know,

1192
00:56:21,817 --> 00:56:24,305
go to it and a lot of
them are quite, you know,

1193
00:56:24,305 --> 00:56:28,660
are free available courses
on agentic AI on AWS

1194
00:56:29,507 --> 00:56:31,290
- [Alex] And thank you very much.

1195
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,540
- Thank you very much.
- Hopefully you enjoyed it.

1196
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,709
- Thank you.
(audience applauding)

1197
00:56:34,709 --> 00:56:36,330
And we are around here for any questions.

1198
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:40,173
So yeah, we are here for the questions.
