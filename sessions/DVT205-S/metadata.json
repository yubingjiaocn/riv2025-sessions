  "abstract": "As engineering teams lean on AI assistants to write more code and automate more of the SDLC, new risks arise. Vulnerabilities, secret leaks, and quality regressions can creep in faster than humans can catch them. This talk explores how to prepare your organization for AI adoption by strengthening the engineering excellence foundations that matter in an AI-first world, like software ownership, testing, service catalogs, and vulnerability management. With the right culture and controls, teams can capture the speed of AI while preserving the security, reliability, and quality customers expect. This presentation is brought to you by Cortex, an AWS Partner.",
