1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,700
- All right, hello and
welcome to re:Invent

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,360
and to session Industry 3312.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,280
We are proud to share
with you today a story

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,680
about how Coinbase scaled their support,

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,710
compliance, and developer
productivity workflows

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,693
on using Gen AI on AWS.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,830
I'm Joshua Smith, I'm a
senior solutions architect

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,990
here at AWS in financial services.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,670
I'll be joined by Varsha Mahadevan,

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,470
who is the director of machine learning

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,720
and artificial intelligence at Coinbase.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,820
And let's get started.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,220
So today we're gonna start
with a quick introduction.

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,260
We'll be followed by an overview of some

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,590
of the key AWS services
we'll be talking about today.

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,240
These services are
crucial for our customers

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,930
to build scalable, secure,
and resilient AI solutions.

18
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,940
After that, I'm gonna
hand it over to Varsha

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,897
from Coinbase and she's gonna
go over their vision for AI

20
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:54,000
and then she'll break
everything down by use cases.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,620
She's going to cover customer support

22
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,050
and then she'll cover
how Coinbase uses Gen AI

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,340
additionally for compliance

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,170
and to enhance the developer experience.

25
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,420
And then lastly, we'll
close on how Coinbase

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,620
sees their path forward.

27
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,670
So taking a step back,
when we talk about Gen AI

28
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,100
for financial services specifically,

29
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,720
it's important to look
at where we came from

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,580
and where we're going and
the goals and challenges

31
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,780
that drove us there.

32
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,860
So back in 2023, what
we were seeing is LLMs

33
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,260
for customer and enterprise

34
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,670
just had started to hit the market.

35
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,440
And we were starting to
get questions around trust

36
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,440
and security of data.

37
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,030
These were basic questions.

38
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,470
How can we trust it with our data?

39
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,480
Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG,

40
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,350
was critical to businesses
and FSI customers

41
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,440
had a treasure trove of
data that they could use

42
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,230
but they weren't sure
how to make it useful

43
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,600
in a way that was safe for them.

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,380
Throughout 2024, after the
release of Amazon Bedrock

45
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,080
and other solutions to
manage secure data access,

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,570
guardrails and more,
we saw customers start

47
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,240
to begin to use AI across a few key areas

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,410
like customer support.

49
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:03,120
And the questions then started
to be more around scale,

50
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,540
capacity, and deeper
questions around data access,

51
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,840
streamlining it, granular security,

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,720
and specific data storage
or specific tools.

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,430
Customers were exploring at this point

54
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,960
how to apply the same
well-architected frameworks

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,080
that they were using for
their traditional applications

56
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,380
but apply them to AI to
architect them for future growth.

57
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,310
But now, finally in 2025,

58
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,320
with the rise of more
agentic patterns, more tools,

59
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,550
we're starting to see customers build

60
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,790
fully multi-agent autonomous applications.

61
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,260
And we're seeing customers start to ask

62
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,470
how to completely transform
their core business,

63
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,200
entire departments of their business.

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,760
And the question isn't anymore,

65
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,030
how can we build this AI chat or something

66
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,830
where it's a singular tool,

67
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,320
it's how do we revolutionize
the way that our customers

68
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,720
and our employees interact
with that workflow?

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,180
And the goal here shifts
into measurable impact

70
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,383
and business KPIs.

71
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,740
So how do we go and build this?

72
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,980
It sounds great, right?

73
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,490
I'm gonna briefly talk
through a few key ways.

74
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,803
This is AWS services for agentic AI.

75
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,550
So whether you're looking to quickly

76
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,250
deploy pre-built agents
to boost productivity,

77
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,620
you're looking to experiment
with open source tools,

78
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,140
you want to build a fleet of
sophisticated custom agents,

79
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,190
AWS provides the models,
tools, infrastructure

80
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,140
and expertise that will help you succeed.

81
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,120
We offer robust AI
infrastructure, custom silicon

82
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,690
and data foundation tools to help ensure

83
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,800
the longevity of those efforts.

84
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,040
This is based on decades of experience

85
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,350
that Amazon has building secure, resilient

86
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,330
and globally scaled infrastructure

87
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,610
and advanced controls we
have for data privacy,

88
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,520
access management,
monitoring, observability

89
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,580
to help customers
confidently deploy these.

90
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,680
And we deploy agents in
every workflow, right?

91
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,430
So we have QDeveloper, we
have Kiro and QBusiness

92
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,680
for prototyping and building agents

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,780
and taking advantage of your data.

94
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,710
AWS Transform is to automate modernization

95
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,460
of legacy workloads like
.NET, Frameworks, VMware

96
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,120
and agents in Amazon Connect.

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,940
And we also have agents
and tools in Marketplace.

98
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,070
And so if we look at this stack,

99
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,170
all of this is surrounded
by this investment

100
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,270
into interfaces, protocols, security

101
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,870
and network enhancements for AI.

102
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,950
So we'll start in the middle here

103
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,470
where we're gonna focus here today.

104
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,360
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service

105
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,130
to help build, deploy and operate

106
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,560
Gen AI applications including agents.

107
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,820
So it provides access to
leading foundation models

108
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,930
like Anthropic, Meta, Mistral and Amazon

109
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,080
through a single API and it
consistently adds new models.

110
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,220
So we have tools to
privately customize models,

111
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,580
some of which we launched this week

112
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,180
and applications with your data.

113
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,640
It applies safety guardrails,
optimize for cost and latency

114
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,860
and rapidly iterate there.

115
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,650
Bedrock also newly includes AgentCore

116
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,180
which is a set of services to deploy

117
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,940
and operate agents securely at scale.

118
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,440
So because Bedrock is serverless,

119
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,660
you don't have to manage
infrastructure for all of this

120
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,023
and again, it's based on
this proven infrastructure.

121
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,490
So Bedrock makes it easy to
build and prototype agents.

122
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,410
However, at the same time,

123
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,420
Gartner predicted in
their most recent report

124
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,810
that over 40% of agentic AI projects

125
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,550
will be canceled by 2027.

126
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,250
The reasons they cited were growing costs,

127
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,100
unclear business value
and insufficient security.

128
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,600
So getting agents to production

129
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,733
is still really, really hard.

130
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,120
So first, the first challenge
you have to overcome

131
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,000
is that you have to deploy.

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,230
In order to deploy AI agents,

133
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,790
you need a specialized runtime.

134
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,260
So unlike typical applications

135
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,560
that follow predictable
paths and user journeys,

136
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,440
agents can operate over
very long time horizons

137
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,400
and they process multiple
different types of modalities

138
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,160
and then call different tools and services

139
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,560
to make different pathways.

140
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,940
The second reason is that
as the underlying LLMs

141
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,280
are stateless, the
agents still need memory

142
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,110
to retain context, learn
from their past interactions

143
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,600
and to provide personalized experiences.

144
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,020
And thirdly, you need
fine-grained identity.

145
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,290
So access control to ensure
that agents can access

146
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,930
only the systems and
data sources they should.

147
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,540
Who is this agent and
what can they access?

148
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,370
Fourth, you need to
ensure that your AI agents

149
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,170
can discover and interact
with custom tools

150
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,680
and data sources with the
appropriate identity controls.

151
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,960
You also need to execute
multi-step workflows

152
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,900
autonomously and you need common tools

153
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,690
in those workflows that
are shared or restricted.

154
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,440
And then lastly, you need
specialized monitoring

155
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,920
that is specifically
designed for agentic systems.

156
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,260
So overall, I talked about a
lot of different problems here

157
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,250
but the real message here
is that operating them

158
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,230
in production is very
different than prototyping

159
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,200
with agents in vibe coding.

160
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,820
And so these challenges are the reason

161
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,360
that Amazon built Bedrock Agent Core.

162
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,000
So Agent Core is a modular,
fast iteration approach

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,950
to building scalable production agents.

164
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,770
So firstly, if we look at the top,

165
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,840
Agent Core is designed
to simplify operations

166
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,280
and tools for agents.

167
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,340
Agent Core runtime is a
secure serverless runtime

168
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,010
that's purpose-built for
deploying and scaling

169
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,550
dynamic agents and tools,
regardless of framework,

170
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,160
protocol, or model choice.

171
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,830
Developers can reliably
run any type of agent,

172
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,740
including multimodal,
real-time, long-running agents,

173
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,250
which means workloads up to
eight hours running with agents.

174
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,400
It has checkpointing,
recovery capabilities,

175
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,870
and it supports graceful recovery

176
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,350
in the event of an unexpected
interruption or failure.

177
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,200
Agent Core Gateway allows
you to easily integrate

178
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,900
your MCP servers, your
APIs with your agents

179
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,120
and provide an easy way to empower them

180
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,920
with an array of tools.

181
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,340
And lastly, Agent Core
Browser and Code Interpreter

182
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,620
allow your agent to act
autonomously in the browser

183
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,940
or to execute code on your
own terms, your own rules.

184
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,880
If we look at the bottom,

185
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,130
I think of these as
supporting tools, right?

186
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,780
This helps your agents
act more effectively

187
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,670
as they carry out these tasks.

188
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,230
We have Agent Core Identity,

189
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,570
which helps you build
enterprise-ready AI agents

190
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,720
from a security perspective,
an identity perspective.

191
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,940
This has standards-based authentication,

192
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,430
compatibility with existing
identity providers,

193
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,070
and native support for
OAuth-enabled services.

194
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,140
It has a secure token vault
to enable authentication,

195
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,420
to have more frictionless user experiences

196
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,503
for all your agent-powered interactions.

197
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,200
Agent Core Memory, as I mentioned before,

198
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,730
is going to allow your
agent to store and retrieve

199
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,790
short- and long-term memory
for those complex workflows.

200
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,250
How do you continuously use user input,

201
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,700
continuously history, build
on top of a shared memory?

202
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,670
And then lastly, Observability
is gonna help you

203
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,000
centralize your observability
stack for Gen AI,

204
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,550
combining logs, traces, and metrics

205
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,580
to measure performance
and accuracy at scale.

206
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,370
So, now that you have a
foundation of AWS services

207
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,770
for agentic AI, you're set up,

208
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,090
I'm gonna pass it over to Varsha,

209
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,460
who's gonna dive deeper
into Coinbase's use cases.

210
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,293
Thank you.

211
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,613
- All right.

212
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,310
Thank you, Joshua, and thank
you all for being here.

213
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,080
I know it's the lunch hour.

214
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,380
Appreciate you being here.

215
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,580
My name is Varsha.

216
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,900
Joshua already introduced me.

217
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,700
I am the Director for Machine
Learning and AI at Coinbase,

218
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,610
and today, I'm excited to share

219
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,280
how we're leveraging generative AI

220
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,890
to elevate both our customer experience

221
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,503
and our internal productivity.

222
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,113
So, let's start with a bigger picture.

223
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,500
Coinbase. Coinbase is a crypto exchange.

224
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,070
But what is crypto,
and why does it matter?

225
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,030
Right.

226
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,760
So, crypto empowers economic freedom.

227
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,760
It ensures fair participation
in a global economy.

228
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,140
At Coinbase, our mission is
to expand economic freedom

229
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,823
to over a billion people.

230
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,300
We do this by providing a
secure and trusted platform

231
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,270
for both individuals and institutions

232
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,900
to trade and transact crypto assets,

233
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,423
and do so safely and globally.

234
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,740
To truly deliver on this mission,

235
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,710
we have to concentrate
on three key pillars.

236
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,590
So, first is we build trust,

237
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:39,080
and that means we need to
safeguard our users' assets

238
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:44,080
with top-tier security, and
put in place strong protections

239
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,433
against things like fraud
and account takeovers.

240
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,023
Second is making crypto accessible.

241
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,620
We do this by designing experiences

242
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,080
that are intuitive and personalized

243
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,080
with the power of AI and machine learning,

244
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,520
and we simplify what can otherwise

245
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,163
be very complicated financial products.

246
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,210
The third is scaling globally.

247
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,360
So, we operate efficiently
and move quickly,

248
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,927
supporting millions of users
across 100-plus countries,

249
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:19,410
and we manage billions of
dollars in trading volume.

250
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,500
So, these pillars are
really the foundation

251
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,523
of everything that we do.

252
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,480
So, at Coinbase, AI and machine learning

253
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,463
aren't just buzzwords.

254
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,220
They're really fundamental to
how we operate our platform.

255
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,110
Let's take a look at how, right?

256
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,390
And let's just play along with me.

257
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,300
This is about the user's
journey on the platform.

258
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,590
So, let's say the user comes
in, and they want to log in.

259
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,560
So, at the point of login,
ML models are at play,

260
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,860
and they defend against account takeovers.

261
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,450
So, one use.

262
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,270
The second is, let's say
now the user's logged in,

263
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,360
and now they want to
move some fiat currency

264
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,430
into the crypto exchange.

265
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,760
Once again, ML models evaluate
the legitimacy of the user

266
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,050
and the risk of any credit defaults.

267
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,470
The third is, now let's say the user wants

268
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,950
to move some funds from
the centralized exchange

269
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,810
onto the blockchain.

270
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,300
Once again, ML models are at play,

271
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,890
and they play a pivotal
role to assess risks

272
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,790
of any reversals before
the funds are released

273
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,873
onto the blockchain.

274
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,060
So, that was about safety and security.

275
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,380
But that's not all, right?

276
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,230
So, we use ML to personalize every part

277
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,490
of the user experience.

278
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,390
We do this through
personalized search results,

279
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,560
tailored news feeds.

280
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,100
We've got intuitive recommendations,

281
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,790
real-time price alerts,
you name it, right?

282
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,790
Now, all of these ML-powered experiences,

283
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,300
whether it's for security
or for personalization,

284
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,460
all of these use advanced
deep learning models.

285
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,320
And these models are trained
on massive data sets.

286
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,570
The training and the inference for these

287
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,230
run on a platform called Anyscale.

288
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,570
I presume many of you have heard about it.

289
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,180
It is a cloud platform that is based

290
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,870
on an open-source framework called Ray,

291
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,683
and we operate Anyscale
on an AWS EKS cluster.

292
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,090
Now, having talked about some
of these traditional uses

293
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,500
of machine learning for
safety and personalization,

294
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,020
now let's talk about some of the,

295
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,610
what is at the intersection
of blockchain and AI?

296
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,620
Let's talk about some
of the innovative work

297
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,510
that we've done in this space.

298
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,490
So, the first one I'd like
to draw your attention to

299
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,860
is we've built an adaptive
and highly scalable

300
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,110
risk-scoring system for
blockchain addresses.

301
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,980
These are based on graph neural networks.

302
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,680
This is a powerful tool
and has been instrumental

303
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,430
in detecting and blocking
malicious blockchain addresses,

304
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,370
and therefore they protect our customers

305
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,653
from transacting with
these malicious ones.

306
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,930
Another exciting innovation is
ERC-20 Scam Token Detection.

307
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,480
Once again, this brings
together two technologies.

308
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,000
One is smart contract auditing,

309
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,040
and the other is machine learning.

310
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,340
So, this solution helps us review assets

311
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,440
before they are listed on an exchange,

312
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,283
and therefore it provides our
customers more protection.

313
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,740
And the third one here is a predictive

314
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,480
machine learning model.

315
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,420
So, all of us know about
the volatility of crypto.

316
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,183
I mean, how many of you
are investors in crypto?

317
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,493
Show of hands, yeah?

318
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,623
Okay, cool.

319
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,800
So, we all know about how
volatile the crypto market can be,

320
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,950
but in the scheme of this volatility,

321
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:15,360
we still want to run a very
reliable infrastructure.

322
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,970
And to do this, we have
these predictive models.

323
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,670
They allow us to scale
our back-end databases

324
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,413
before a surge can occur.

325
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,150
So, all together, these
innovations are a great example

326
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,280
of how we are using
machine learning actively

327
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,823
to shape the crypto landscape.

328
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,240
All right, so now let's
shift gears, right?

329
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,520
So, we've talked about all
of these traditional usages,

330
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,800
and including some
innovations and whatnot,

331
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,400
but now let's talk about a new generation

332
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,223
of AI investments that
we've been doing lately.

333
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,910
No surprise, LLMs, right?

334
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,200
So, LLMs, as we know it, have
transformed the landscape

335
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,420
ever since November of 2022.

336
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,570
I think it's like, you know,
it's a historic moment.

337
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,933
All of us talk about pre-
and post-ChatGPT era.

338
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,680
So, there are three key areas

339
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,060
that I'd like to talk to you about

340
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,073
where we are applying generative AI.

341
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,710
So, the first of them is
about customer support.

342
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:24,180
So, we leverage AI-powered
virtual assistants,

343
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,360
and we also build advanced tools

344
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,820
to support our human agents.

345
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,700
And together, these two capabilities

346
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,173
enable smarter and more
scalable customer interactions.

347
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,590
The second that I would
like to talk to you about

348
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,420
is about compliance.

349
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,520
So, Gen AI is helping us
streamline complex investigations

350
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,653
and navigate the regulatory landscape.

351
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,240
The third is, how can we not talk

352
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,803
about developer productivity?

353
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,700
I mean, all technologists
in the room, I presume.

354
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,980
So, yes, so I will touch upon

355
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,200
how we are improving developer
productivity at Coinbase.

356
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,420
So, let's dive a little
deeper into each one of these,

357
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,930
starting with Gen AI transforming

358
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,403
customer support at Coinbase.

359
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,750
All right, so let's take
a moment to understand

360
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,300
the unique challenges of delivering

361
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,510
exceptional customer support
in the world of crypto.

362
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,990
The first is, crypto
is incredibly volatile.

363
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,460
We just talked about it, right?

364
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,740
User activity can swing up and down

365
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,100
by a good 50% within a month, even.

366
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,070
So, this kind of unpredictability

367
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,610
puts a lot of pressure
on our support systems.

368
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,520
We simply cannot scale
human support quickly enough

369
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,803
to match these rapidly
expanding user base.

370
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,220
The second is trust.

371
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,140
Trust is everything, right?

372
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,750
Our customers need to
feel safe and supported

373
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,410
no matter what's happening in the market.

374
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,890
The third is, we operate globally.

375
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,470
So, this means we have to support users

376
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,420
across different languages and regulations

377
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,590
and expectations requiring solutions

378
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,393
that are flexible and adaptable.

379
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,940
This is where Gen AI
enters the arena, right?

380
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,550
So, Gen AI helps us
overcome these challenges

381
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,070
and deliver great customer support

382
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,023
no matter the market conditions.

383
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,520
All right, so we've crafted a strategy.

384
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,140
So, I'm gonna get into the technicalities

385
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,430
at this point a little bit.

386
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,530
So, we've crafted a strategy

387
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,400
that focuses both on the
breadth and the depth.

388
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,110
So, these are important aspects.

389
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,520
So, in the breadth, what we do

390
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,480
is that we have an
internal Gen AI platform

391
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,610
that integrates multiple LLMs

392
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,940
and also taps into a wide
range of data sources.

393
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,730
And all of these access points

394
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,280
are through standard interfaces.

395
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,420
So, we use OpenAI's API
standards when accessing LLMs

396
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,860
and we also use Model Context
Protocol or MCP standards

397
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,470
when accessing any of our data endpoints.

398
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,540
So, this Gen AI platform
allows every team at Coinbase

399
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,480
to easily leverage and
extend our AI capabilities

400
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,013
for their use cases.

401
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,360
When it comes to the depth,

402
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,100
we are making targeted investments

403
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,100
in a few high-impact areas
within customer support.

404
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,060
The first is we are automating

405
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,860
the customer-facing workflows
with conversational chatbots.

406
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,940
The second is we're providing
our human support agents

407
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,920
with intelligent tools to
improve their effectiveness.

408
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,160
And the third one is we also use Gen AI

409
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,050
to extract valuable insights
from support tickets

410
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,773
to help us continually improve
our products and services.

411
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:07,980
So, actually, these use cases
that I just talked about,

412
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,210
they form sort of a cycle, a continuum.

413
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,890
So, let's look at how, right?

414
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,420
First, the customer comes in.

415
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,090
The customer requires some kind of help.

416
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,940
They first interface with
the AI-powered chatbot

417
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,270
and get instant assistance if possible.

418
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,680
For the more complex cases,

419
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,320
they get escalated to a human agent

420
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,760
and then the human agents are equipped

421
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,490
with real-time AI-assistive tools.

422
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,020
One more use of AI.

423
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,990
And then next, if post-contact,

424
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:41,490
AI extracts all sorts of patterns
so that we glean insights

425
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,283
and we're able to improve our products.

426
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,880
Lastly, once the product updates,

427
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,880
we reduce the need for support

428
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,150
and we also create more knowledge

429
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,280
to be able to automate the support.

430
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,720
So, it's this whole cycle with a feedback

431
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,173
that works together.

432
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,340
All right, so now let's deep

433
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,040
into every one of these use cases.

434
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,880
So, we'll start with the
customer support chatbot.

435
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,240
Chat has quickly become
the go-to support channel

436
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,873
for more than half of our customers.

437
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,590
So, trained on Coinbase's
extensive knowledge base,

438
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,290
our AI-powered chatbot is able

439
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:30,290
to provide instant accurate
assistance around the clock,

440
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,120
adapting to any kind of
market volatility, right?

441
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,120
So, let's look at the layers

442
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:46,110
in which, the way we built the chatbot.

443
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,690
We built it sort of iteratively.

444
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,990
So, we started very simple.

445
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,150
The first layer that you
see highlighted over here,

446
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:59,150
it's a very simple FAQ-style
rag responses layer, right?

447
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,430
And so, we started simple

448
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:07,110
so that we allowed ourselves
to focus on accuracy

449
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,380
and build a strong foundation
for more capabilities

450
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,480
that we wanted to add in the chatbot.

451
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,140
So now, these simple
queries, such as sign-in,

452
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,660
how do, if users have
a problem with sign-in

453
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,050
or two-factor auth or any
other how-to questions,

454
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,303
this layer is able to automate that.

455
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,980
Let's look at the agentic architecture

456
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,500
that sort of underpins this, right?

457
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,000
So, as shown in the picture,
we start with the user input

458
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,940
and any other prior conversation
history that is stored.

459
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,730
We store it in a vector database

460
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,983
and that serves as the
memory layer for us.

461
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:49,170
The rag retriever is the
fulcrum of this design.

462
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,750
So, it uses bedrock knowledge bases

463
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,160
where we vectorize and store

464
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,620
all of the Coinbase help articles.

465
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,150
And then we also use
coherence re-ranker models

466
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,513
to get high accuracy from
the retrieved rag articles.

467
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,830
We also, the other important
component over here

468
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,460
is the response generation.

469
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,410
This is sort of a mixture of LLMs,

470
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,650
including the cloud models
that are served through bedrock

471
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,710
to generate a very precise response.

472
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,260
This response generation
is an important step

473
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,930
and it actually involves a sub-agent

474
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,323
developed in an actor-critic architecture.

475
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,040
Then come the guardrails, right?

476
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,740
You can see two gatekeepers over here.

477
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,940
You have input guardrails

478
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,760
and you've also got output guardrails.

479
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,620
These guardrails are powered

480
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,170
with bedrock guardrails, actually.

481
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,380
Bedrock helps protect us
against harmful content

482
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,813
and leakage of any sensitive PII.

483
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,720
Additionally, we also have some

484
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,910
custom domain-specific filters

485
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,320
that participate in the
input and output guardrails.

486
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,093
These help us minimize any
chances of prompt injection.

487
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,750
We also have some custom rules

488
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,330
which help keep our responses grounded

489
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,793
and reduce the propensity
for any hallucination.

490
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,070
All right, so we looked
at the first layer.

491
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,313
Now let's look at the next
layer that gets added to it.

492
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,130
As things moved on, all of
what I'm speaking about,

493
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:31,130
rewind time back to about
18 to 24 months ago.

494
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,250
That's when we started.

495
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,900
As we were building the chatbot

496
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,950
and launching it to production,

497
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,590
we also saw a lot of
movement in the industry

498
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,360
and the capabilities of the LLMs.

499
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,490
We definitely knew that
we could achieve more

500
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,530
out of the chatbot than
just that rag layer

501
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,360
that we had introduced.

502
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,180
That's where this next layer comes in.

503
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,640
As these model capabilities got better,

504
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,370
we enhanced our chatbot to directly follow

505
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,953
what are called business procedures.

506
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,020
From conversationally
collecting information

507
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,260
to actually taking direct
actions on behalf of the user,

508
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,320
this second layer, which
autonomously operates

509
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,143
on business procedures,
it achieves all of that.

510
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,580
Now the best part here is
these business procedures

511
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,590
form what we call a
single source of truth.

512
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,910
This is very powerful.

513
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,780
Just think about it.

514
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,910
You've got these business procedures

515
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:28,890
that both humans and AI agents use alike.

516
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,330
It becomes a single source of truth.

517
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,730
This is indeed exceptionally powerful

518
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,470
and it gives us a lot of adaptability

519
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,833
to how we train both our
humans and AI systems.

520
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,400
Queries about the user's account

521
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,250
or specific queries about a transaction

522
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,990
that may have been pending,

523
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,713
all of these get automated
through the second layer now.

524
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,210
Now, looking at the same
agentic architecture

525
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,350
that I was showing you earlier,

526
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,810
now this is a little expanded.

527
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,990
It has added these business
procedure capabilities.

528
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,600
We introduced what we call

529
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,030
the business procedure classifier.

530
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,080
So this is an important component

531
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,750
that allows a query to be
routed to the correct sub-agent.

532
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,120
So as you can see, there is a sub-agent

533
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,600
that is emulating every business
procedure in our system.

534
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,600
And this is a router, the
business procedure classifier.

535
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,060
Next, you can also see that the RAG agent

536
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,680
that we saw earlier,

537
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,270
it's actually one of the
specialized sub-agents.

538
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,880
It's just executing a
specialized procedure

539
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,513
which involves looking up
the RAG knowledge base.

540
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,810
All right, so now let's
talk about the third

541
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,850
and the last layer that we added.

542
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,920
This is the capability

543
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,920
to actually do proactive issue resolution.

544
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,480
So by tapping into things
like the user's signals

545
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,400
and active incidents that may
be happening in the platform,

546
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,420
our AI agents are now able
to anticipate common problems

547
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,190
that users might be facing

548
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,100
even before they need
to ask us explicitly.

549
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,880
Hence the term proactive resolution.

550
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,600
So we've powered our
chatbot with this capability

551
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,330
and you can see that layer also augmented

552
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,380
in this agentic design over here.

553
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,490
The proactive issue resolution
layer is another React agent.

554
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,480
And if the bot is not able to
find a proactive resolution

555
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,650
for the user, then it does fall back

556
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,660
to the business procedure classifier layer

557
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,700
that I mentioned earlier.

558
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,570
And as you'd expect, the
proactive agent is also powered

559
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,623
for all of its data access
through standardized MCP servers.

560
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,760
All right, so you've
seen the iterative design

561
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,170
that I talked about.

562
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,080
Now there are a few factors
that were very central.

563
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,340
We held it very important as we chose,

564
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,560
made all of our design decisions.

565
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,400
The model selection is a key aspect of it.

566
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,840
So model selection
wasn't just about finding

567
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,390
the most accurate model that works.

568
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,590
We needed a solution that
struck the right balance

569
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:33,590
between accuracy, latency,
scalability, and all of that.

570
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,870
And it also wasn't a one-time decision.

571
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,920
We realized that as the model
capabilities were growing,

572
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,160
we needed to re-evaluate
these choices time and again.

573
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,860
So that was a pretty central aspect

574
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,810
to how we decided to operate on things.

575
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,410
The next is the tool standardization part.

576
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,610
I did talk about this.

577
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:57,210
So we specifically chose to standardize

578
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,180
all of our tools access through MCPs,

579
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,220
or Model Context Protocol.

580
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,770
And it gave us a really strong foundation,

581
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,210
not just for customer support,

582
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,340
but for many other domains
that we were operating in,

583
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,173
in fact.

584
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,470
We also focused on business adaptability.

585
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,560
Like I was mentioning about
the single source of truth,

586
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,010
the single source of truth
of business procedures

587
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,040
that was able to power both humans and AI.

588
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,520
So that gave us the business
adaptability that we wanted.

589
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,290
And above all, we also made sure

590
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,170
that the bot's responses were grounded.

591
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,500
So the factual correctness
of what the bot was saying

592
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,300
was an important factor.

593
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,370
So all of these were important principles

594
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,630
that we always kept in mind,

595
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,480
as we were building the solution out.

596
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,230
Now, we've seen all of these
careful considerations,

597
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,930
but despite all of this, it is paramount

598
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,900
that we are able to observe and monitor

599
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,290
how our chatbot is
performing in production.

600
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,480
So to make sure we are consistently

601
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,820
delivering high quality responses,

602
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,820
we made sure that we were using
LLM as a judge evaluations.

603
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,760
So every chatbot response is assessed

604
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,910
for things like relevancy, accuracy,

605
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:18,303
potential buyers,
hallucinations, and more.

606
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,530
We actively track all
of these quality metrics

607
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,360
and monitor trends, and that allows us

608
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,413
to quickly spot any anomalies
and step in as needed.

609
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,120
All right.

610
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,390
Now, having talked a
lot about the chatbot,

611
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,880
let's look at one other use case

612
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,410
that I had mentioned earlier.

613
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,840
This is called Agent Assist.

614
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,740
So what you're looking at over here

615
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,600
is a picture of our
AI-powered Agent Assist tool,

616
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:55,440
which is designed to help our
human customer support agents.

617
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,980
So as you can see, the middle pane

618
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,563
is that of the human
chatting with the customer.

619
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,030
And on the right side is where you see

620
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,710
this Agent Assist tool,
and it provides suggestions

621
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,130
to the human agent to
respond to the customer.

622
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,560
So as we've established,
it's the complex issues

623
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,010
that actually come to the human agent.

624
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,960
So the human agent is actually dealing

625
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,680
with a stressful, highly
complex situation,

626
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,650
and in that environment,
the Agent Assist tool

627
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,520
provides real-time assistance to diagnose

628
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,713
the customer's issue and also mitigate it.

629
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,920
It draws, of course, the Agent Assist tool

630
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,520
also draws from account
signals, ongoing incident data,

631
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,320
past customer support tickets, and so on.

632
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,230
So Agent Assist provides
personalized guidance,

633
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,650
and it generates very precise responses

634
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,720
in many different languages.

635
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,460
That's another important aspect,

636
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,490
because as we talked,
Coinbase serves customers

637
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,970
across 100-plus geographies globally.

638
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,333
So this is an important aspect
that Agent Assist provides.

639
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,780
So obviously, the end
result of all of this

640
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,420
is faster resolutions, happier customers,

641
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,143
and great efficiency across the
board for our support teams.

642
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,600
Let's draw some attention
to the actual numbers here.

643
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,893
So what did the impact look like?

644
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,350
It's pretty impressive, actually.

645
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:33,350
So today, close to 65%
of our customer contacts

646
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:37,983
are handled automatically
by our AI systems.

647
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,883
That's a big number.

648
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,720
This automation, consequently,

649
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,720
saves us nearly five million
employee hours every year.

650
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,690
It's an annualized number,

651
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,980
which is significant cost
savings to the business,

652
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,440
and productivity boost, as well.

653
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,790
Most importantly, this 65% automated cases

654
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:09,750
are now resolved in a single interaction.

655
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,733
Now, this is a very important aspect.

656
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,780
When cases are handled by automation,

657
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,150
they get resolved in less than 10 minutes.

658
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:22,340
But when cases go to a human
agent, they can be long-drawn.

659
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,420
It can take up to 40 minutes.

660
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:29,070
So these systems, as much as
they are a productivity boost,

661
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,010
they actually enhance the
user experience substantially.

662
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,610
So that's an important takeaway.

663
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,710
Right, so these results are showing us

664
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,250
how powerful AI can be when
it's operating at scale,

665
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,110
and the difference that it is making,

666
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:46,263
both to the business and to the customers.

667
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:51,180
All right, so we've talked a
lot about customer support.

668
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:55,753
Now let's move on to
another sphere, compliance.

669
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:02,690
Super important for a
fintech entity like Coinbase.

670
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,500
So let's look how it works.

671
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,890
So when it comes to compliance,

672
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:11,850
you've probably heard
about terms such as AML,

673
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,750
anti-money laundering,
CFT, stands for counter,

674
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,003
financing of terrorism, ABC,

675
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,543
stands for anti-bribery and corruption.

676
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,980
Now, as a regulations-abiding
financial entity,

677
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,390
Coinbase as a company is committed

678
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:31,110
to upholding the highest
standards of these practices.

679
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,250
And you do not want
anybody using the platform

680
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,173
for any such malpractices.

681
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,790
So in order to implement,
in order to uphold these,

682
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,590
we implement several
processes such as KYC,

683
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,180
stands for Know Your Customer,

684
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,060
KYB stands for Know Your Business,

685
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,543
TMS stands for Transaction
Monitoring Systems.

686
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,790
So all of these processes,
while they are super important,

687
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,700
they are a very heavy lift for the company

688
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,413
and highly human-intensive.

689
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,090
And to top that, of course,
we have the market volatility

690
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,100
that we've been talking about, right,

691
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,980
which means that the human workforce,

692
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,470
scaling them is not easy.

693
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,020
The second is the regulatory bodies

694
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,870
expect a very thorough investigation

695
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,213
of all of these compliance cases.

696
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,790
And they need absolute,
detailed, full explainability

697
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,970
of all the cases that
go through our system.

698
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,700
So that is a very important
aspect to keep in mind.

699
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,950
And then the third one
is because we operate

700
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,383
in so many different countries,

701
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,820
we have to adapt our compliance processes

702
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,330
to meet those diverse
regulatory requirements

703
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,290
across the board.

704
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,553
So one size definitely does
not fit all in this case.

705
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,940
Right, so once again,
what was our strategy?

706
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,160
We look at the breadth and then
we look at the depth, right?

707
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,530
I talked about this earlier.

708
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,910
So on the breadth, we leverage

709
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,510
the same internal Gen-AI platform
that I mentioned earlier.

710
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,900
So the Gen-AI platform gives
you fluid access to LLMs

711
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,290
and the data through MCP interfaces.

712
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,720
Then the second, but there is something

713
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,910
that is a little
different about compliance

714
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,700
and compared to customer support,

715
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,830
which is compliance solution also entails

716
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,530
a traditional machine
learning model, okay?

717
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,973
This model detects
high-risk compliance cases.

718
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,040
So for these, we rely on, once again,

719
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,480
I had talked about any scale

720
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,730
which is based on the Ray framework.

721
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,360
So we use our any scale based ML platform

722
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,850
to build these traditional
machine learning models

723
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:52,263
that detect the high-risk
compliance cases for us.

724
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,990
On the depth aspect with compliance,

725
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:01,920
we built several different
solutions, right?

726
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,520
So we've made some
intentional investments.

727
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,120
For example, we've built these
advanced deep learning models

728
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,160
that are able to detect high-risk cases

729
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,580
in multiple different
compliance processes,

730
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,570
including KYC, KYB, and TMS.

731
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,020
I talked about these earlier.

732
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,790
Beyond the detection, we also use AI

733
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,173
to automate and accelerate
complex investigations.

734
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,740
These investigations involve gathering

735
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,430
and synthesizing data from a
variety of different sources

736
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:39,990
and we apply these rigorous
approaches of investigations

737
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,880
across all of these compliance workflows

738
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,253
like KYC, KYB, TMS, and so on.

739
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,780
All right, so what you see over here

740
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,650
is a screenshot of another tool

741
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,940
called the compliance assist tool.

742
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,350
So earlier, I showed you

743
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,500
the customer support agent assist tool.

744
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,760
This is sort of analogous,

745
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,500
but this is for the compliance agents.

746
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,240
This is an assistive tool.

747
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,970
So you can see that, once
again, this is AI-powered

748
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,330
and the AI system actually
has automatically gathered

749
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,590
and synthesized information

750
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,740
from a wide range of different sources.

751
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,200
It has pulled data from
our internal systems

752
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,813
as well as open-source intelligence.

753
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,470
The AI then composes a narrative summary

754
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:30,470
and it also gathers a set of
clear risk-review signals.

755
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,060
Our compliance agents, the human agents,

756
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,880
are now handed a fully-documented,

757
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,030
explainable investigation that equips them

758
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,660
to make well-informed decisions quickly

759
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,833
and with a lot of confidence.

760
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,440
So this is a great example

761
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,750
of where AI is empowering our teams

762
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,720
and it's also elevating the standards

763
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,433
of our compliance operations.

764
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,170
So this is a quick walkthrough
of the block diagram

765
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,510
that sort of illustrates
the agentic architecture

766
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,010
that we follow.

767
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,740
So starting on the
left, our process begins

768
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,720
where the compliance risk models

769
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,800
that I talked about earlier,

770
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,450
these are the deep learning models,

771
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,750
when they trigger alerts
on high-risk cases.

772
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,920
So that's where it all begins

773
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,240
and this initiates what's
called a holistic review.

774
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,030
A holistic review is a
comprehensive investigation

775
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,133
of a high-risk compliance case.

776
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,460
So at the center of this solution

777
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,460
is our compliance auto-resolution
engine, or CAR for short,

778
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,480
which acts as the orchestrator

779
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,800
for the entire holistic review process.

780
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,190
This is where the agentic
AI-driven workflow

781
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,060
comes into play.

782
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,240
It mobilizes both automation
and human expertise.

783
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,220
We'll look at it in just a moment.

784
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,530
So the orchestration engine coordinates

785
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:52,320
human-in-the-loop process interacting

786
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,263
with two different human personas.

787
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:00,240
The first is our own
compliance operations agents.

788
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,730
They review the findings of this AI system

789
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,690
and they provide essential
feedback to keep improving it.

790
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,060
And then the second is wherever necessary,

791
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,690
the system also reaches
out to our end customers

792
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,510
for additional information through RFIs

793
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,103
or request for information.

794
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,000
So throughout this process,

795
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,420
the engine also aggregates
and synthesizes data

796
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,920
from a wide variety of sources.

797
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,030
We talked about this,

798
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,043
internal, external, open-source
intelligence, all of it.

799
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:32,280
And all of this access is through

800
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,003
standardized MCP-fied data connectors.

801
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,270
The end result is a robust
AI-generated report,

802
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,070
which we call the narrative summary.

803
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:48,600
Now, it is important to
note that the final decision

804
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,600
always rests with our human
compliance operations agent.

805
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,000
After reviewing the AI's reasoning

806
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,130
and all of the compliance evidence

807
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,100
that the AI system has gathered,

808
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,830
it is this individual,
the human individual here,

809
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,470
who determines whether a case warrants

810
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:12,240
filing what's called a SAR,
or suspicious activity report,

811
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,820
that needs to be filed with
the government authorities.

812
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,590
Because the company is liable to that.

813
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,830
I mean, we are responsible for

814
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,840
reporting it to the government

815
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,973
should a particular
high-risk case be proven so.

816
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,530
This approach brings together
the best of both worlds,

817
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,180
the speed and the depth of AI,

818
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,183
combined with human oversight.

819
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,663
All right.

820
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,750
Okay, all right, so we've
talked about customer support,

821
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,640
we've talked about compliance.

822
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,003
Now, how can we not talk
about developer productivity?

823
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,630
We'd be doing this service.

824
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,150
All right, so this is a hot favorite.

825
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:54,020
Let's talk about how we're
making a real difference.

826
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:59,020
Okay, so let's talk about how
AI is radically transforming

827
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,840
our software development
lifecycle, or SDLC, at Coinbase.

828
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,340
So today, as we know it,

829
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:13,340
AI agents help our engineering
teams at different stages.

830
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:18,720
It helps consolidate tasks
like coding, ticketing,

831
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,930
documenting, pull request creation,

832
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,750
reviewing those pull requests, and more.

833
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:32,750
So in short, what we really
have is an AI-powered SDLC

834
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,743
that's accelerating
productivity across the board.

835
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,750
So today, I will specifically
talk about three aspects

836
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,580
of this whole SDLC process.

837
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,190
I'll talk about code
authoring, code reviewing,

838
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,603
and quality assurance.

839
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,650
Okay, so let's talk about code authoring.

840
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,960
The visual that you see
is probably very familiar

841
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,000
to many of you.

842
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,560
This is Cloud Code.

843
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,630
It's a state-of-the-art coding assistant,

844
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,990
and it integrates directly into your IDE,

845
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,600
or it can also be used
from the command line.

846
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,780
Developers love it.

847
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,073
Coinbase developers definitely love it.

848
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,240
This other visual is that of Cursor,

849
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,200
yet another intelligent,
context-aware IDE.

850
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,110
Again, it is designed to make
software development faster,

851
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:25,080
more collaborative, and more efficient.

852
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,330
So as most of you would concur with me,

853
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,850
developers are a passionate lot,

854
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,250
and they're an opinionated lot, right?

855
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,890
So that is why what we do at Coinbase

856
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:38,890
is we offer a few of these
best-in-class coding tools

857
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,660
as paved paths, options,
to our developers,

858
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,910
and our engineers have the freedom

859
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,860
to choose whatever works best for them.

860
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:50,940
So all of these tools, of course,

861
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,040
are powered with anthropic models

862
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,640
that are served through Bedrock.

863
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,940
Now, so we've talked about code authoring.

864
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,920
Now the next step in
the development process

865
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,760
is pull request and code reviewing, right?

866
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,600
So the tool that you see over
here is a homegrown tool.

867
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,290
It is adapted from an open-source tool,

868
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:16,110
and it's enhanced with
Cloud models from Bedrock.

869
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:21,110
This agent is implemented as
an AI-powered GitHub Action.

870
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:26,400
It integrates, it automates
PR reviews, basically.

871
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,500
So it summarizes the pull request

872
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,350
and the underlying code
changes that have happened.

873
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:34,180
So how many times, as a developer,

874
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,540
you're given this PR review,

875
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,030
it has several tens of files of changes,

876
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:42,540
and we don't know what is the context.

877
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,320
Not all developers are very
diligent about explaining

878
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,190
what is the change,

879
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,320
why have they made that change, et cetera.

880
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,400
Now, tools like these
actually automatically

881
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,430
summarize that change for you,
and that's very informative

882
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,720
for the person trying to review it, right?

883
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,350
So they summarize it.

884
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,910
Then they also generate

885
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,400
clear natural language review comments

886
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,690
wherever it is applicable,

887
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,613
just like a senior engineer would.

888
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,523
Beyond that, this tool also
enforces coding conventions.

889
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,860
That's an important aspect.

890
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,990
So many a times, human reviewers,

891
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,980
all they're doing is just
explaining to a newbie developer

892
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,490
what are the coding conventions,

893
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,140
how must they write the code better

894
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,143
for better maintainability, and so on.

895
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:33,660
So it highlights any gaps
in unit testing coverage.

896
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,030
That is another important aspect, right?

897
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:41,030
And icing on the cake, if
there is any CI failure,

898
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,020
if there are any failures

899
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,480
in the continuous integration system,

900
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,120
then it also provides some useful tips

901
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,270
on how to debug that, right?

902
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:53,310
So, very powerful tool.

903
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,290
We've seen great yields from it.

904
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,390
I'll talk about the numbers in just a bit.

905
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,370
Now, that doesn't mean that developers

906
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:05,190
don't have to review the code manually.

907
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,430
It's just, what we do over here

908
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,730
is that all of these
run-of-the-mill aspects

909
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,040
of reviewing the code are taken care of

910
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,100
by this automated system,
AI-powered automated system,

911
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,050
and so that the human developers

912
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,930
only look for the nuanced
aspects of the code,

913
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,780
and so they can deliver higher value.

914
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,900
Okay, next, talking about
quality assurance, right?

915
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,840
So, coding assistants like
Cloud Code and Cursor,

916
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,510
they already allow you to
automate unit test generation,

917
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:37,710
so we know that,

918
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:41,910
but we are taking things
a step further, right?

919
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,680
So, the visual that you see here

920
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,930
is another homegrown AI-powered tool

921
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:49,380
for automated UI testing, right?

922
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:53,600
This tool brings end-to-end
quality assurance automation

923
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,080
for our web and mobile UI.

924
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:02,040
It converts a natural
language test description

925
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,513
directly into autonomous browser actions.

926
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,910
This is very powerful,
right, if you'd imagine.

927
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:16,770
It allows us to test the UI
like a human would, right?

928
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,870
The browser actions are then performed

929
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,630
in a variety of different form factors,

930
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,700
like we use services like BrowserStack

931
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,400
that give us access to
different form factors,

932
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,440
where we can test these browser actions,

933
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,050
and the browser actions are also emulated

934
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:35,220
through frameworks like
Playwright and whatnot, right?

935
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,830
But this brings us incredible scale

936
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,843
and agility to UI testing.

937
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,810
And even better, right, when
issues are actually found,

938
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,540
this system captures screenshots

939
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,100
and generates structured reports,

940
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,140
making it easy for our development teams

941
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,933
to go address those bugs and problems.

942
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,160
Right, so once again, let's
talk about the impact.

943
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,640
What do the numbers say, right?

944
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,800
So developer productivity is
showing a lot of green shoots,

945
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,720
and we are fairly confident

946
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,240
that this will continue
to keep growing, right?

947
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:17,240
So today, nearly 40% of all
code written daily at Coinbase

948
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:23,430
is AI-generated, or
AI-influenced, I should say.

949
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,790
So our goal is to surpass 50% pretty soon.

950
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:30,600
Of course, we do understand
that every line of code

951
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,340
still needs to be reviewed and understood

952
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:37,350
by a human developer, and we
know that AI-generated code

953
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:40,200
isn't suitable for every
part of the business.

954
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,080
Nonetheless, wherever it makes sense,

955
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,740
we do want our teams to harness
the superpower responsibly

956
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,693
and as often as possible.

957
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,360
All right, next, our
investment in the PR reviewer

958
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,630
that I showed earlier,
that's also paying off.

959
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:02,280
So we estimate saving
about 75,000 hours annually

960
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,553
through these automated PR reviews.

961
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:09,090
And not just that, it's
also raising the bar,

962
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:11,220
raising the code quality overall

963
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,833
by enforcing coding
conventions and whatnot.

964
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,970
Next is quality assurance.

965
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,760
Now this one is particularly impressive.

966
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,620
It's achieving accuracy on
par with our human testers.

967
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:30,620
It's also able to detect
three times as many bugs

968
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,753
as a human would in the
same amount of time.

969
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,350
And it is also dramatically
speeding up the process

970
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:40,710
of introducing new tests,
sometimes as little as 15 minutes.

971
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:44,370
Imagine, how does that
compare with the hours

972
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:47,433
that you need to train a
human tester to test some UI?

973
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:50,483
Oops.

974
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:55,080
And when you look at the cost efficiency,

975
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,950
we are seeing about 86% cost reductions

976
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,580
compared to traditional manual testing.

977
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:07,580
So, all in all, great results.

978
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,210
We're really stoked about it

979
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,910
and we're looking to go places with it.

980
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,880
Now, having talked about
these three dominant domains,

981
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,740
our investments, our impact,

982
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,990
what we are seeing from it, et cetera,

983
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:22,413
let's talk about what's next at Coinbase.

984
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,690
So, through all of these use
cases that I've shared today,

985
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,940
we can see that we are
unlocking a lot of power,

986
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,060
but truly our mission is to put AI agents,

987
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,190
the ability to build agents,

988
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:38,180
the ability to get hands-on with it,

989
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,580
in the hands of every employee, right?

990
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:46,580
And we truly believe we have
many a mile to go towards that.

991
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,970
So, we want to empower
both individuals and teams

992
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:55,970
to create, experiment, innovate,
and not only bring benefits

993
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,490
in terms of everyday productivity,

994
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:03,120
but also reimagine how
we offer our products

995
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,960
to our customers, right?

996
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,770
So, as we look into the future,

997
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,800
our focus is now on
scaling these capabilities

998
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,033
for even bigger enterprise-wide impact.

999
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,820
We are working to modernize and upgrade

1000
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,970
many of the tools and technologies

1001
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:24,600
that we've developed
over the past two years.

1002
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,850
So, note, this is sort of ironical, right?

1003
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,660
Like, I mean, all of us
have talked about software

1004
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,000
that has been built.

1005
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,400
You know, there are some
sessions that I've seen

1006
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:36,150
about upgrades from .NET to
a newer framework, et cetera.

1007
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:37,920
I mean, these are systems
that we're talking about

1008
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,300
that have lasted a decade.

1009
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,220
But now we're talking about modernizing

1010
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,930
what has been built in
the last couple of years.

1011
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:45,360
But that's the nature of
this landscape, right?

1012
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,870
Like, AI is moving at breakneck speed.

1013
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,850
So, yes, we do need to keep thinking

1014
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:53,490
about how we're going to
modernize these AI systems

1015
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:56,433
and keep up with the
innovation in the industry.

1016
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,640
So, that's where platforms
like Bedrock Agent Core

1017
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,600
truly come in.

1018
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,720
And we're really excited
about using Agent Core

1019
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,720
for this next wave of expansion
in our AI investments.

1020
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:16,530
So, for secure, we have
talked about Agent Core

1021
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,720
in many different regards.

1022
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,360
One is, of course, the
secure agent deployment,

1023
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,500
the robust identity and
authentication management

1024
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,880
that it offers across both
agents as well as MCP tools,

1025
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,350
features like powerful memory,
advanced interoperability.

1026
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:37,800
All of these are very,
very exciting for us

1027
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,253
and they really hold
many, many possibilities.

1028
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:46,080
All right, so summing it up, once again,

1029
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,530
our goal is to democratize
AI across Coinbase

1030
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,840
so that every employee at Coinbase

1031
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,580
can leverage this technology
and solve problems

1032
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,820
and create value for our customers

1033
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,493
and keep us at the
forefront of our industry.

1034
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,640
Thank you so much.

1035
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,873
Thank you for listening.

1036
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,886
(audience applauds)
