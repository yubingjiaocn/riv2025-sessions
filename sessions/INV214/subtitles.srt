1
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,039
Good morning.

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,079
Thanks for joining us this morning,

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,000
everyone.
I'm super excited to be here.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,700
I'm Amy.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,200
I'm the CISO for AWS,

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,959
and I'll be joined by Neharunta,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,750
one of my colleagues,

8
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:25,399
and Andrea Abel from Lily,

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,379
and we're going to talk about scaling your security team.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,869
I'm super excited about this because securing systems at scale

11
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:36,759
and adapting to the changes around us is a super important topic,

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,000
especially right now.

13
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:38,849
I don't know if you've heard,

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,630
but there's been some technological changes around AI in the last couple of years.

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:43,590
Um,

16
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:45,610
I'm gonna mix it up in this innovation talk.

17
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,009
I want to talk a little bit about how we do this inside at AWS.

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,720
I wanna talk a little bit about how we do this for you,

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,599
our customers,

20
00:00:52,849 --> 00:00:56,130
and then I want to share a great customer story that really inspired me.

21
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:57,990
So

22
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,709
It's not just AI,

23
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,330
OK,

24
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:03,830
but AI is definitely a great example of how

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,750
the game we play as security teams is changing.

26
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:10,699
Traditional ways that we've achieved strong security for our customers

27
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,029
have often relied on deterministic systems,

28
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:14,610
on us understanding

29
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:15,750
that if we do this,

30
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,889
then that happens or doesn't happen,

31
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,470
and that's not enough with non-deterministic systems.

32
00:01:20,589 --> 00:01:24,230
So we can't know for sure that if we do this in terms of defense,

33
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:27,750
this exactly is what's going to happen in terms of protection.

34
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:32,760
We don't yet fully know how adding Gen AI to the mix is going to reshape things,

35
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:35,349
right?
This is still a field that's changing super fast,

36
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,199
but

37
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:39,080
we are starting to learn about some problems that AI is

38
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,699
helpful to solve both for us and for threat actors.

39
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:45,830
And so I want to talk through those a little bit before we get

40
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,879
into three things that I want you to encourage your security teams to do

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,919
in order to scale to the changes ahead.

42
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:54,430
So first,

43
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,099
on the threat actor side,

44
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,510
the thing that I think it's most important to think about is that Gen

45
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,190
AI makes it really inexpensive to generate

46
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,900
meaningful targeted variations for threat actors.

47
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,089
So the economics of making

48
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,070
attacks targeted to a particular phishing target or brand

49
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,470
have gotten much cheaper,

50
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,929
and we're seeing broader deployment and more convincing lures because of that.

51
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:22,259
We're also observing attacks starting to target the AI tools that

52
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:27,270
builders are depending on as Gen AI coding becomes more prevalent.

53
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,830
Prompt injection isn't really new at this point,

54
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,669
but we're definitely seeing an evolution and iteration

55
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,899
of its use,

56
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,669
like prompts buried inside content that the attacker knows

57
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:40,449
that the developer's tool chain is going to interpret.

58
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,220
And attackers understand that AI agents are acting more autonomously,

59
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:48,270
and they're planning for that in their threats.

60
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:52,309
And so this is changing what it looks like to be a security team today.

61
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,830
Our traditional approaches aren't enough,

62
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,970
but it's definitely not all doom and gloom.

63
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,470
In fact,
I'm pretty optimistic because

64
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,970
these same opportunities and advancements are there for us as defenders too,

65
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:10,710
particularly around increasing the speed at which we can assemble and process

66
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,690
the information.

67
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,315
We need

68
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:13,494
as a security team,

69
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:15,115
as defenders and responders.

70
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:15,955
So,

71
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:16,604
um,

72
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:21,095
we're often in the game of having to look across a vast amount of information

73
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:25,054
and identifying what my colleague CJ likes to call the needle in the needle stack,

74
00:03:25,294 --> 00:03:25,884
and Jenny Ay,

75
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:29,794
it turns out is super good at helping us solve that problem very quickly.

76
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:32,199
And as I'm sure your teams have been,

77
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:36,889
my response teams have been super eager to experiment with this stuff,

78
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,639
and internally we've brought our deeper log dive processes down from

79
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,220
around 4 hours to around 11 minutes on average so far,

80
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,720
and we're continuing to see gains in that space.

81
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,990
So this has really been an advantage for us.

82
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,050
For example,

83
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,750
When internally,

84
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,789
when a credential compromise is detected,

85
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:57,559
we can automatically retrieve the cloud trail data.

86
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:00,520
We can use AI to discover all affected entities

87
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,100
and any possible signs of any lateral movement,

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,740
and we can really prepare for the human responder

89
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,039
a package that's sort of complete with

90
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,179
entity graphs and actionable starting recommendations,

91
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,619
and this really enables responders to kind of rapidly assess and contain a threat

92
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,899
versus something that's more manual.

93
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,269
We're exploring making investments like this

94
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,839
um across our work program

95
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:28,549
and it's really important for us to do so.

96
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:30,600
We're eager to engage here

97
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:31,839
because

98
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:35,160
we know that we're going to need to move faster.

99
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,100
Between the speed of development increasing

100
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:42,380
and the speed of threat actor advancement,

101
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,079
we've got to be quick here,

102
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,619
and this is going to include both the basics that haven't changed,

103
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:53,359
but might become more important as stuff starts happening at machine scale

104
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,079
like credential management,

105
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,140
observability,

106
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:56,940
visibility,

107
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,369
response workflows,

108
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,019
and the things that are changing and have

109
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:03,839
changed because nondeterministic systems are just different.

110
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,829
So in this hour,

111
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,140
I want to share with you how we're scaling security at speed.

112
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,579
I want to dive deeper into some of the ways to help you scale too,

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,399
and then we'll make it real with a story

114
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,269
that I found pretty compelling from Eli Lily.

115
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,540
OK,

116
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,649
so this talk is going to focus around 3 main things I want you

117
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:26,989
to remember when you leave this room to encourage your security teams to do.

118
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:30,579
I want you to think about changing

119
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:34,279
where and how your security team is carrying out our work

120
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,040
versus traditionally,

121
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,959
uh,
the way it's traditionally practiced so that we can scale

122
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:40,459
and in particular I'm gonna talk

123
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:43,519
about embedding security team expertise and activity

124
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:45,720
throughout your product development workflows.

125
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,820
I'm going to talk about how I would like you to change how you adapt to

126
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,859
to to the changes around us,

127
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,559
making adjustments so that you can keep a close eye

128
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,320
on the risk you want to prevent or manage.

129
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:02,980
And then I'm going to talk about working side by side with the business you support

130
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,880
to keep your security teamwork grounded

131
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,040
in the problems your business specifically has

132
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:14,019
rather than approaching security as a one size fits all generic approach

133
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,059
to something that we need to do in business.

134
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:16,940
Let's get started.

135
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,700
So if you aren't already,

136
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,660
you have to embed security expertise

137
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:24,799
throughout

138
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,549
your business' development and operational workflows.

139
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:29,619
So I'm gonna,

140
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,239
I'm going to go on a bit of a rant.

141
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,420
I don't like the phrase shift left,

142
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:36,000
although that's probably what half of this room is thinking,

143
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:37,200
because

144
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,920
shift left implies that products get out the door in a linear way.

145
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,519
Right?

146
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,920
We're on a timeline and you're going backwards on it.

147
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,820
You're shifting earlier in this linear frame,

148
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,950
and that is super not how products get developed anymore,

149
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,320
and that is definitely not how products are going to

150
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,119
be developed as Gen AI changes what development looks like,

151
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,760
right?

152
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,140
This is a chaotic iterative mess.

153
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,200
And so instead of thinking about shifting your security team left,

154
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,070
I want you to think about embedding security expertise

155
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,019
through all the different parts of that product development process

156
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,239
that we need to secure.

157
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:13,619
And so I wanna talk a little bit about what we do internally

158
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:17,459
and how we've helped your teams and are continuing to do so.

159
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:21,959
So at AWS we've been iterating on this theme since the

160
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,079
beginning because of the scale we have to operate at.

161
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,959
So

162
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,739
our security builders on my team

163
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,119
are builders themselves because we can't secure the

164
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,070
size of AWS without that being true,

165
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:38,540
and we create and invest in three different kinds of things.

166
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,829
First,

167
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,510
Whenever we notice that there's tricky work happening

168
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:45,239
that we can help with,

169
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:48,920
we invest in primitives to just take that work away for the builder teams.

170
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,170
Let's do it right once.

171
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,290
Let's make it easy for you with a library.

172
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:53,700
Second,

173
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,670
we embed security guidance and tooling across the life cycle from what we call

174
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,420
internally sec through issue management and active

175
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,470
defense and response and compliance and assurance

176
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,730
to make sure

177
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,450
that

178
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,489
whenever a builder needs a bit of information to do something the safe way,

179
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:12,709
it's there for them.

180
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,000
And 3

181
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,190
We,

182
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:17,170
uh.

183
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:25,149
Adapt our own builder experience as a security team to make it scalable for us

184
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:26,920
to do what we need to do,

185
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,160
and we use our own internal tooling

186
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,229
and the external tooling that we developed to make sure

187
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,760
that the unique perspective we gain from our vantage point

188
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,650
helps helps keep our builders and you as customers safe

189
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:42,349
and as often as we can,

190
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:46,510
we share these advancements externally to make sure that your job is easier.

191
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,760
So if we think about primitives,

192
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:52,210
if I go through those three things that we do.

193
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,770
These are foundational level building blocks for

194
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,820
developers that take tricky or um,

195
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:00,309
sorry,
can we go back one slide?

196
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,150
Thanks.

197
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,549
That take tricky security sensitive work and do it well by default.

198
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,130
The primitives are optimized for developer ease of use,

199
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,250
right?
We make lots of these internally,

200
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:14,799
and when we know they will work for your environment,

201
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,289
we make them for you too.

202
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:20,200
And I wanted to talk about kind of an oldie but a goodie as an example of this,

203
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,650
as it's changed over time.

204
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,229
Now we can go to the next slide.

205
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,650
So

206
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,869
S2NTLS is an example of this kind of primitive that we knew would be

207
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:32,650
useful for you that we released and has evolved and grown over the years.

208
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,929
So this is an open source implementation of the TLS protocol.

209
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,919
It's designed to be small,

210
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:39,830
fast,

211
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,090
and with simplicity as a priority.

212
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,030
We looked at,

213
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:44,750
I think it was OpenSSL at the time,

214
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:47,710
noticed that that was 500,000 lines of code or more,

215
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,390
and thought,

216
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,549
how are we going to make sure that's secure?

217
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,979
And so we wrote,

218
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:52,559
we looked at,

219
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,969
we eliminated a bunch of,

220
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:56,460
uh,
extra features that people didn't ordinarily use.

221
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,309
We looked at what was really necessary,

222
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,580
and we took that down to 6000,

223
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,599
released it to the community

224
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:05,340
in a way that we knew that it would be secure.

225
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:08,239
We knew we could understand its security implementations,

226
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:10,539
and that was in 2015.

227
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,030
And in 22,

228
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,640
uh,
we released a similar version called S2N Quick as an

229
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,710
open source implementation that was again following the same principles

230
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:23,750
of the Quick Transport protocol.

231
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:25,640
And then later on that year,

232
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,979
we also added support for post quantum key exchange,

233
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,039
and the,

234
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,659
the key exchange ad,

235
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:32,169
uh,

236
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:33,510
adds support for the three

237
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,590
of the post quantum key encapsulation mechanisms,

238
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:37,409
uh,

239
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,510
from the Nest PQC project.

240
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:42,520
We knew that proper implementation of any of

241
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,359
these protocols needed to be carefully done,

242
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,700
carefully built,

243
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,239
thoroughly tested,

244
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,419
extensively validated

245
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:52,840
to make sure that everyone could rely on

246
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,320
these foundational building blocks in the long run.

247
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,390
We knew that you had that problem too,

248
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
and so we released it,

249
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:00,140
and this is just a great example

250
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,719
that you can play with and use on your own,

251
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,099
as many of you do,

252
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,760
um,

253
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,840
of a security primitive.

254
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,880
So that's the first kind of work we do.

255
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,719
To be builders ourselves and embed what we

256
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,119
know throughout the product's development life cycle.

257
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15,789
In addition to primitives like this,

258
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,289
we embed across the whole workflow.

259
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,690
We first mentioned this example,

260
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,619
uh,
during reinforce this year,

261
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,469
and the system has continued to improve.

262
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,549
And so I wanted to give a little update on it.

263
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:29,210
So AWS runs on APIs.

264
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:32,049
We need to test them thoroughly as a security team

265
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,530
for,

266
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,309
to make sure that they're going to keep everyone safe

267
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:38,030
as well as any functional testing that needs to happen.

268
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:41,719
And recently we're helping eliminate testing toil

269
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:44,859
from builder teams via an agent-powered solution.

270
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,599
When a change is proposed to an API,

271
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,679
an agent analyzes that API

272
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:54,799
and then it creates all of the required resources to properly test each endpoint.

273
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,059
And then

274
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:57,760
that's not just the simple test.

275
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:59,669
It creates a bunch of tests

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,409
to,

277
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:00,909
um,

278
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:06,659
cover the entire landscape of that API for a wide variety of normal and edge cases,

279
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:08,929
and this approach makes sure that we've

280
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,950
got consistency in our security testing and assurance

281
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,049
without

282
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:17,010
requiring the builder to do a lot of that fiddly work every time.

283
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,630
I'll go through a few more examples.

284
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,479
Ensuring the right thing that's happening from a compliance and

285
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:26,440
assurance perspective as smoothly and as scaled as possible,

286
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,770
that's another thing that builders have had to do

287
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,150
throughout the product development cycle in the past.

288
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,809
This used to be pretty manual.

289
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,469
I'm gonna be vocally self-critical to use an internal,

290
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,229
uh,
Amazon little phrase.

291
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:38,590
It turns out.

292
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:41,559
We were asking builders a bunch of times in a

293
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:45,539
row things about the controls or implementations of their system,

294
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,640
and

295
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,719
it also turns out when we looked at this that we

296
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:52,380
know an awful lot about how our products are built.

297
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,049
And we asked ourselves,

298
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,010
could we use that knowledge to help meet our security,

299
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:00,210
compliance and assurance goals to scale and

300
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,150
strengthen what we can give to builders.

301
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,989
And so

302
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,010
we've invested a lot over the years in

303
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,950
automating a bunch of the assessment preparation,

304
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:09,690
but Gen AI has really helped us

305
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,150
move away from standalone separate compliance work streams

306
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,770
toward initial assessments that don't require builder engagement

307
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,830
and pulls together most of the information that

308
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,609
we're pretty sure is going to be relevant.

309
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,489
We still perform compliance evaluations.

310
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:26,429
There are still humans involved,

311
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,609
but we're leveraging automated tooling,

312
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,070
including Gen AI to perform that assessment and verification

313
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,090
that used to be human to human at every step.

314
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:37,630
And this makes that flow smoother.

315
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:40,679
It speeds up and accelerates the development process,

316
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:45,190
and it makes sure that customers can know that they can trust and use our stuff.

317
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,020
After product launch,

318
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:51,659
our active defense system is designed to protect

319
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:54,140
customers and gather threat intelligence at scale.

320
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,739
This is another thing that we've talked about because it's cool,

321
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,549
but I don't know that we've discussed sort of how it works in

322
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,020
our software development life cycle and operation flow,

323
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,080
so I'm gonna go through it a little bit here

324
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,520
in that context.

325
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:09,690
So Blackfoot is an internal system that sits at our

326
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,400
network edge and translates external IP addresses to internal ones.

327
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:19,109
Madpot is a large honeypot system that we have that monitors,

328
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,260
uh,
that includes monitoring sensors and automated response capabilities.

329
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,109
Mithra is another internal system that is a

330
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,190
kind of massive neural network graph model

331
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,330
that's focused on helping us understand reputation analysis

332
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,979
and then Sonaris actively defends and

333
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:40,090
mitigates potential security threats automatically for customers

334
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,969
by analyzing network traffic

335
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,090
and.

336
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,119
The fun thing about working at AWS is that you think you know

337
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,049
what the word scale means before you take a job like this,

338
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,150
and then you get in and a month later you're like,

339
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,229
00,

340
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,380
I really didn't know what that word meant.

341
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:56,400
Um,

342
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,460
so Blackfoot translates over 312 trillion flows a day.

343
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,159
Madpot engages over 550 million malicious activities a day.

344
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,260
Mithra

345
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,150
takes care of over 200,000 malicious domains a day,

346
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,929
and Sonaris blocks almost 5 billion scans

347
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,390
every day for us.

348
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:20,380
And

349
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,229
the cool thing

350
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,710
about all of these working together

351
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:26,869
is that even after launch,

352
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,210
while we're operating,

353
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:30,750
right,
that's part of your product development.

354
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,739
We guide not only our internal protections,

355
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,580
but we're able to

356
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,710
provide additional protection to you through AWS Shield,

357
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,570
Route 53 resolver,

358
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,989
DNS firewall,

359
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,380
and other services.

360
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,919
This powers the managed rule sets and service

361
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,469
like services like WAF and network firewall,

362
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:55,320
and it delivers findings to customers in guard duty and inspector.

363
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,260
And so this flow,

364
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,289
this our embedding of security through our operations,

365
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,119
not just helps us scale as a security team,

366
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,140
but provides you with the information

367
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,119
about threats in the context of your accounts to

368
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:13,080
drive your strong security decisions throughout your operations too.

369
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,539
It's a great example

370
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,859
of working security through what it looks like

371
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,280
to build and operate a product in the long run.

372
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:26,159
A key to all of these efforts is that we can't do this well

373
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:29,599
unless we understand deeply how products are being built

374
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:32,619
at AWS and we're there at the right time.

375
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,140
If we didn't understand how products were being built and operated,

376
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:37,679
none of this stuff would work.

377
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:41,010
And these are just a small sample of

378
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,390
the systems and tools that we've built internally,

379
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,489
not only helping to protect you,

380
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,309
but to ensure that we as builders work through

381
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,190
that build,

382
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:49,710
deploy,

383
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:51,450
operate life cycle every day,

384
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:55,359
and we understand what it means for our builders to be doing the same thing.

385
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,609
AI is helping us in this area,

386
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,929
right?
It's a positive impact.

387
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,540
It's expanding the ways that we can accomplish our tasks

388
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,089
because it's good at doing some of the problem assembly and solution

389
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:11,630
that we've previously needed humans to do.

390
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,540
But

391
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,920
in the grand scheme of things,

392
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,118
this is just another example of how we're scaling

393
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:19,770
effectively when a new tool falls into our hands,

394
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:22,900
right?
Gen AI did not enable us to do some new

395
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:24,719
magic type of thing.

396
00:17:25,229 --> 00:17:28,800
It is helping us do the thing that we were already doing better,

397
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:31,229
and I think that's really key as you think about

398
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:33,890
how to scale to meet the demands of this new

399
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:34,750
phase that we're,

400
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:35,510
uh,

401
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,369
edging into,

402
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,209
um,
and I'll talk through a couple of the ways that we're working

403
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,869
what AI is good at

404
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,030
into our own processes.

405
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,030
So one area where we're in.

406
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,484
Internally using AI to help scale is with our denied party screening team.

407
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:50,775
So this team uses agents as well as

408
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:53,935
a bunch of traditional machine learning and other automation

409
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:56,474
to make sure that our transactions adhere

410
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:58,555
to global sanction requirements without delay.

411
00:17:58,805 --> 00:17:59,305
And again,

412
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,395
we're talking about pretty big scale.

413
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:04,954
Every day we answer this question over 2 billion times.

414
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:07,089
So we have always been automating

415
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:08,390
this process,

416
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,430
but this year,

417
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,170
using Bedrock Agent Core,

418
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:13,689
we launched AI agents to manage aspects

419
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:16,780
of this workflow that previously required humans,

420
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,449
and we've got a blog post about this.

421
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,199
You can read about it.

422
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:20,020
It's pretty cool,

423
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,050
but specifically the ability to fine tune matching,

424
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,030
take actions on particular matches,

425
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,300
or enable a customer to continue,

426
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,609
we're now able to do that better thanks to our work with Agent Core,

427
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,410
and we're seeing one.

428
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:32,694
Wonderful results from it.

429
00:18:32,935 --> 00:18:37,334
We've got 96% overall accuracy with 96% precision and

430
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:41,015
100% recall when we're comparing against our historical decisions.

431
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:41,795
So this is,

432
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:46,074
these are kind of helping us outperform the humans and automate decision making

433
00:18:46,255 --> 00:18:49,454
for over 60% of that massive transaction volume.

434
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:51,275
We've really moved beyond

435
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:53,854
trying to figure out what this can do

436
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:57,614
and leveraging it to generate business value widely at scale.

437
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,959
And we're here to help you do the same

438
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:04,420
and to dig into that a little bit more,

439
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,099
I want to invite Neha Runta to the stage to talk about

440
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:09,099
one of the ways that we're going to help you do that,

441
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,849
an announcement that Matt shared yesterday that I'm particularly excited about.

442
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,880
So please welcome Neha to the stage.

443
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,010
Thank you Amy.

444
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:31,510
I am Neha and I am thrilled to be here with you to share

445
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:33,109
what we've been building

446
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:34,910
and using internally

447
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,010
to scale proactive security.

448
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:39,630
The AWS security agent

449
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,910
transforms security

450
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,530
by helping teams

451
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:46,030
use the right security primitives

452
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:47,569
at the right time

453
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,469
in the right context.

454
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:52,290
But to understand

455
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:53,829
how that happens,

456
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,910
let's dig into a construct

457
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:58,109
we use a lot at Amazon,

458
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,170
intentions versus mechanisms.

459
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:04,810
Intentions are the things you want to happen.

460
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,819
They are a best effort,

461
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:08,560
trying to do the right thing.

462
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:11,959
But the intentions always require effort.

463
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,219
They need implementation.

464
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,439
They need constant auditing,

465
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,540
and they

466
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,520
can fail.

467
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:22,219
Mechanisms on the other hand are different.

468
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:25,030
They are intentions that have been codified

469
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,550
and baked in.

470
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,030
They work without somebody having to remember,

471
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:32,469
without somebody having to enforce

472
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,609
and track.

473
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:37,599
An example is that the lines on a freeway

474
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,209
are intentions,

475
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,400
but the concrete barriers

476
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:42,979
are mechanisms.

477
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,810
AWS as Amy has been talking about has a lot of great mechanisms,

478
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,119
but we still have some intentions.

479
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,040
Take for example

480
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,550
block public access.

481
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,699
Our automated reasoning team built this policy analysis engine

482
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:00,640
which you can use

483
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,839
to block public access to a resource.

484
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:06,189
When you turn on BPA

485
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,900
for your S3 bucket,

486
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,400
you can be sure

487
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:12,079
that your bucket will not be public today

488
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:14,660
or ever be public in the future.

489
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:16,780
And to make this possible,

490
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,640
different services integrate

491
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,579
with BPA

492
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:20,660
S3,

493
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,010
Dynamo DB,

494
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:22,939
EFS.

495
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,140
A lot of these services integrate with BPA capability.

496
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,310
Now what happens if you're a new service?

497
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,979
You're building something new.

498
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:34,369
How would you know that BPA is required?

499
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,140
The trick here is not that all services or features need this,

500
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,780
only those

501
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,500
that are

502
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,180
critical

503
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,380
and have cross account sharing

504
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,000
need,

505
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,739
need it,

506
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,910
but when they need it,

507
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,579
it is important that they have it.

508
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,489
The security knowledge exists.

509
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,040
It's there,

510
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,689
but it's scattered across many knowledge bases.

511
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,280
Teams have to sift through irrelevant bits of

512
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,420
requirements to find out what applies to them.

513
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,979
It's tedious,

514
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,739
it,
it's inconsistent

515
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,660
and like an intention,

516
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:07,859
it fails.

517
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:11,589
What we need is a mechanism to deliver

518
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,390
the right knowledge to the right people

519
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:15,729
at the right time.

520
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:20,260
So how are we doing it?

521
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:21,650
Yesterday,

522
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,650
Matt's keynote introduced Frontier agents,

523
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,359
a sophisticated class of AI agents

524
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:28,800
that are autonomous,

525
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,780
scalable,

526
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,280
can work long periods of time

527
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,500
without requiring human intervention.

528
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:38,380
There are 3 of these agents the Kira Autonomous agent,

529
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,010
the DevOps agent,

530
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,900
and the AWS security agent.

531
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,439
The security agent

532
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:46,510
is context aware.

533
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,000
It's aware of your organization's security requirement.

534
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:52,329
It checks the documents you write

535
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,729
to find security

536
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:54,650
issues.

537
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,569
It checks the code you write,

538
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,109
the code you implement,

539
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,709
the code that your coding assistants implement.

540
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:04,569
The security agent does on-demand

541
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,949
context of air penetration testing.

542
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:11,630
To provide a complete proactive security solution.

543
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:14,260
Stepping back,

544
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:16,130
what the security agent is doing

545
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,349
is turning

546
00:23:17,849 --> 00:23:19,150
security intentions

547
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:20,530
into mechanism

548
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,150
from lines on the road

549
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,189
to concrete barriers.

550
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:27,829
So

551
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,380
we've been using this very successfully for the past few months

552
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:32,949
and it's been our way

553
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:33,670
to turn

554
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:36,310
security intentions into mechanisms.

555
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,189
Let's look at an example.

556
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,750
We added the block public access

557
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,349
as a security requirement

558
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,569
for the relevant teams and the security agent.

559
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:48,270
When you create a design doc,

560
00:23:48,689 --> 00:23:50,349
it becomes a mechanism.

561
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:53,630
Let's look at one that a design doc for a fictional service.

562
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:55,910
The security agent

563
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:01,089
analyzes the requirements against all for all of the requirements in the document

564
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,449
in under a minute.

565
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:04,699
It uses the relevant context.

566
00:24:04,979 --> 00:24:06,650
Does this requirement matter?

567
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,040
Which of the security

568
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,699
requirements are applicable,

569
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,640
which are not?

570
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,520
And here you can see 11 are not applicable

571
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,500
because

572
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:18,010
in general for a given service you won't have everything that is

573
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:20,119
applicable to a given service.

574
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:22,469
You'll have 5 that are compliant.

575
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:22,989
Great,

576
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:24,469
I don't need to do anything about it.

577
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:27,089
2 that need more information

578
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,449
because you may have underspecified something in your document

579
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,469
and the agent says,

580
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,989
I don't know enough to say whether you're compliant or not,

581
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:35,199
while 1,

582
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,949
you have that is not compliant.

583
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,180
So let's look closer.

584
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,880
This fictional service fails the block public access requirement.

585
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:48,069
The amazing part is the team finds out about this in the design phase

586
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,329
before a single line of code is written.

587
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:53,069
They know exactly what needs to be done.

588
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,329
Nobody had to put in additional effort to remember to make it happen.

589
00:24:57,569 --> 00:25:02,349
It now happens on every design review every time in the right context.

590
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:05,569
Let's look at another example.

591
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:07,569
We have an internal

592
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,949
security primitive called Daffodil.

593
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,770
It's internal to us because it's a

594
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,170
formally verified IAM library that helps the

595
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,369
other service teams to integrate with IAM correctly.

596
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,729
It's proven correct,

597
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:21,390
mathematically proven correct.

598
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,579
But the proof doesn't do the teams any good if they don't know about daffodil.

599
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,319
Great,

600
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,040
you may have the best thing to use,

601
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,800
but if you don't know it exists,

602
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,000
how am I gonna use it?

603
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,939
So the I and also the other challenge is the IM integration is so standard,

604
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,890
the teams will rarely document it in their design,

605
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:42,739
so design review alone wouldn't catch this gap.

606
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:47,479
So the security agent also analyzes code reviews.

607
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:50,810
It uses the same security requirements we've defined

608
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:51,609
below,

609
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,859
and here's an example.

610
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,270
It's within our internal code system,

611
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,040
a proposed commit,

612
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:58,569
a new service is launching,

613
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,969
but the team forgot to integrate with Daffodil.

614
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,839
So the security agent flags it.

615
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,089
And immediately it says,

616
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,010
here's some remediation guidance.

617
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:08,969
Now,

618
00:26:08,989 --> 00:26:09,819
for all it,

619
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:11,819
the agent integrates with GitHub,

620
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,900
so for all of you,

621
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,050
you can have the same capabilities

622
00:26:15,189 --> 00:26:16,729
in your GitHub pull requests.

623
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,439
Again,

624
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,219
here

625
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:21,219
an intention to remember

626
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,839
has a mechanism now that doesn't forget.

627
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:28,079
You only need to define your requirements one,

628
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,140
and they

629
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,180
can be applied to your design review

630
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:32,859
and your code reviews

631
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,030
equally.

632
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,290
Now this was about us and our internal requirements,

633
00:26:38,619 --> 00:26:42,040
but you will have your own internal security requirements.

634
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,420
They will be specific to your company,

635
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:45,699
your industry,

636
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,099
your compliance,

637
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,900
and the markets you operate in.

638
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,780
You may have new rules on how MCP servers

639
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,219
are built and integrated in your company.

640
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,099
These guidelines change monthly.

641
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:00,420
It may even change on a weekly basis,

642
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,819
but now you can encode these as security requirements

643
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,660
and turn them into mechanisms that apply to all your design and code reviews.

644
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,520
When your guidelines change,

645
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,119
you can update the requirements.

646
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,300
There is no more lag time

647
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,579
between what you want to happen and what actually happens.

648
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:22,239
We've loved this velocity change at AWS over the past few months

649
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:25,920
and we are very eager for you to experience it as well,

650
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:27,119
so

651
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,119
go to AWS security agent today

652
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,079
and turn your security intentions

653
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:32,760
into

654
00:27:32,939 --> 00:27:34,760
your security mechanisms.

655
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,040
Thank you very much

656
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,640
and

657
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:37,859
back to Amy.

658
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,369
Thank you so much,

659
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:46,989
Neha.

660
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:49,359
I'm pretty excited about this.

661
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:52,410
I,
like I'm super excited to see where it goes and in particular

662
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,829
how we can all customize it to our particular different business needs.

663
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:56,949
So,
OK,

664
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,060
so let's assume

665
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:00,890
thanks to our collaborations and work that you're doing

666
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,650
on your own that you're well on your way to

667
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,130
embedding security expertise throughout your

668
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,209
business and engineering operations rather

669
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:09,109
than trying to bolt it on at the end.

670
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,239
You're not done.

671
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:10,869
Sorry.

672
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:14,640
The second thing that you're going to need your security team to do

673
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:17,859
is to be adaptive to the changing realities

674
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:21,510
both outside and inside of your organization,

675
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,640
because a bunch of stuff is changing right now.

676
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,400
Outside your organization,

677
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,160
risk is constantly changing,

678
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:30,619
and you should be deeply aware of it.

679
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:35,589
Our cyber threat intelligence team AC ACTI recently published,

680
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:35,959
um,

681
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:39,800
the details of their work helping to disrupt a watering hole campaign

682
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,219
from APT 29 or Midnight Blizzard at the end of the summer.

683
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:48,660
And we identified that the actor had compromised legitimate websites and injected

684
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,630
JavaScript that redirected only around 10%

685
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,229
of visitors to these actor controlled domains

686
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:54,949
like

687
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,020
Findcloudflare.com or other domains that mimicked legitimate

688
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,670
verification pages in order to appear legitimate.

689
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,359
The ultimate target wasn't AWS.

690
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,410
It was a Microsoft device code authentication flow,

691
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:10,760
but we were able to look at what was happening,

692
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,510
and our analysis of the code revealed some

693
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:16,569
some evasion techniques that made them harder to detect,

694
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:21,829
including using randomization to only direct that small percentage of visitors,

695
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:24,510
employing Bay 64 encoding to hide

696
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:25,890
the malicious code,

697
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,780
setting cookies to prevent repeat.

698
00:29:27,922 --> 00:29:29,822
redirects of the same visitor

699
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:32,672
and pivoting to new infrastructure when it was blocked.

700
00:29:32,932 --> 00:29:33,432
And there were,

701
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:35,812
there were no compromises of AWS systems or

702
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:38,973
any impact observed on our services or infrastructure,

703
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:39,572
but

704
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:40,932
we saw this was going on.

705
00:29:41,003 --> 00:29:44,113
We're committed to protecting the security of the internet,

706
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:48,253
and we actively hunt for and disrupt sophisticated threat actors like this.

707
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,772
And so we worked to quickly isolate the affected instances,

708
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:53,052
track and disrupt.

709
00:29:53,176 --> 00:29:53,895
Operations,

710
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:55,836
even when they were moving

711
00:29:56,015 --> 00:29:58,715
and to share relevant information with our partners.

712
00:29:58,776 --> 00:29:59,776
This is crucial.

713
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:01,375
This is super interesting work.

714
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:05,375
It's a great story and you can read it about it on the AWS security blog,

715
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:06,015
but

716
00:30:06,015 --> 00:30:10,475
I wanted to pull it out because it's just one example of the types of increasing

717
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:15,015
evolution and scale of attacks that we will all have to defend against,

718
00:30:15,176 --> 00:30:18,276
and we will all have to figure out how to defend against together.

719
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,420
Another example

720
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,229
was when the Amazon inspector team contributed

721
00:30:24,229 --> 00:30:26,459
research to 3 different open source package

722
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,260
supply chain attacks this fall.

723
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:32,489
So all of these attacks targeted package in open source registries.

724
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,839
The Shihuludworm that flashed up a little bit

725
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:39,109
ago used typical developer workflows to harvest credentials,

726
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,800
and when it found NPM creds,

727
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,140
creds of a particular kind,

728
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:44,479
it used those to self-propagate.

729
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,040
And detection is of course more challenging when the

730
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,969
adversary is using legitimate credentials and doing normal stuff.

731
00:30:52,199 --> 00:30:52,979
And so we

732
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,979
collaborated with security researchers

733
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,589
and deployed a new detection rule that we paired with AI

734
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:05,420
to identify suspicious package patterns in the MPM registry,

735
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,800
and that the

736
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,900
the kind of combination of that

737
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:12,420
was that we were able to use indicators like circular

738
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,500
dependency.

739
00:31:14,314 --> 00:31:18,045
or presence or absence of a particular configuration file to get

740
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:21,055
a better idea of when we thought this package was suspicious.

741
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:21,944
And

742
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:25,285
we identified over 150,000 packages based on

743
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:27,824
that that were linked to a particular campaign

744
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:31,045
and we worked with OpenSSF to coordinate

745
00:31:31,045 --> 00:31:33,405
our response and disclosure and detection.

746
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,920
And this is a little bit further into the Gen AI evolution from a threat actor side.

747
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,780
We think this is just going to continue

748
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:44,479
and so teams need to be adaptive to the risks that we're trying to present,

749
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,160
prevent,

750
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,560
I'm sorry,

751
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,319
and properly defend against them.

752
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,449
Outside is not the only place that's changing.

753
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:53,290
Probably some of you have noticed

754
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:57,449
that different stuff is happening with development workflows right now too.

755
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,680
And

756
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:04,739
as developers change what they do by using Gen AI to to build more of the code,

757
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,910
more of the tests,

758
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,540
and we move to more of a specification mode with,

759
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:10,219
with Quiro or something else,

760
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,119
um,

761
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,069
you need to

762
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,459
keep your eye on the risks that you're trying to.

763
00:32:14,555 --> 00:32:19,094
Prevent so that you can be ready to adapt how you act as a security team

764
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:20,444
to meet the risk

765
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:23,515
and I'm actually really excited about something,

766
00:32:23,714 --> 00:32:27,334
um,
in this particular change of developer workflows

767
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:31,015
because I think it will open up a new opportunity for security teams.

768
00:32:31,555 --> 00:32:33,994
So Gen AI augmented code development is

769
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:37,895
just one more example of distance being inserted

770
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:39,354
between the developer,

771
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:40,055
the human,

772
00:32:40,435 --> 00:32:42,234
and the running code and production.

773
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:43,969
So
we've seen several,

774
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:44,969
uh,

775
00:32:45,349 --> 00:32:45,890
uh,

776
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,150
steps apart from these two over the course of my career anyway.

777
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:49,869
When I started,

778
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:50,449
we were not,

779
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,449
we were working in pretty low-level languages,

780
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:53,550
I'll just say.

781
00:32:53,829 --> 00:32:56,229
And then when CICD became more of a thing,

782
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,550
and then when test-driven development became more of a thing,

783
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,989
we were like increasing the distance between the

784
00:33:00,989 --> 00:33:02,750
human and the machine running the code.

785
00:33:03,069 --> 00:33:04,739
And Gen AI is going to do that like,

786
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,270
whoa.

787
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:09,339
And this is a real opportunity for security teams,

788
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:10,469
because today,

789
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:13,160
if your tests are a little off,

790
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:16,010
but a human is kind of involved with their high judgment,

791
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,359
it's probably OK.

792
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:19,910
You can catch when something is going off the rails.

793
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:21,729
In the future,

794
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:25,229
if the tests are a little off and the human is nowhere near any of this,

795
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,150
things could potentially go really wrong really fast,

796
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,869
not just from a security perspective,

797
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,030
but from an ops perspective,

798
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,890
right?
You might have availability risk.

799
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:35,709
And so as we move into this new world,

800
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,469
our developers that we support,

801
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:40,390
they are going to need the tests to be great.

802
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,459
They're going to need a robust safety net in this new reality,

803
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:46,839
and that's going to open something up for

804
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:49,479
the security team that wasn't necessarily true before,

805
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,839
which is that we can use that same robust safety

806
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:56,579
net to fix the things that we know need fixing without

807
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:57,520
input,

808
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:00,479
coordination or any dependency on the developer.

809
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,469
We can just solve it for them.

810
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,640
And the technology is really giving us an opportunity to change

811
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,739
the contract we have with our developers as a result,

812
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,699
and

813
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,320
this is going to let us adapt much more quickly than we could in

814
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,159
terms of response when we discover something new that needs to be changed.

815
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:18,870
So I'm really pumped about this,

816
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,060
and I think there are lots more examples

817
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,020
in the coming months and years that we'll find

818
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,020
if

819
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,860
the way we're approaching this problem

820
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,379
is to focus on the risk.

821
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,409
And things are still changing quickly,

822
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:37,010
but this focus on the outcome rather than the process to get there

823
00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:38,649
is another example

824
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,989
of muscle that we've built inside AWS over time.

825
00:34:42,228 --> 00:34:44,030
When we realize we need to adapt,

826
00:34:44,188 --> 00:34:46,070
which we do because we notice things are

827
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,389
Changing and we know where we wanna go,

828
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,840
we start with sort of two-way door learning and experimentation

829
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,110
that's human to human.

830
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,760
We're bringing our best innovation together with the builders that we support

831
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,770
and then

832
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:02,040
we figure out how to automate something or or

833
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:06,100
create an initial experiment and then we can iterate and scale

834
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,040
from there

835
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,379
and the key to this kind of adaptation,

836
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:12,800
your key to succeed when you're doing it with your security team

837
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,860
is to think very carefully about what you're measuring.

838
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,620
And,

839
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,310
and you're going to be good at this because you're a security person and

840
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,840
to think very carefully about what could go wrong with that system of measurement.

841
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,439
What are the perverse incentives?

842
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,909
What happens if someone tries to game the numbers?

843
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,790
Be really attentive to what you're looking at as a security team,

844
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,020
and then you'll be able to adapt as things change.

845
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,780
I'll talk briefly about this before we

846
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:40,540
move on to the last thing that your security organization needs to do.

847
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,860
We began experimenting with agents in trying to

848
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,260
create more kind of general purpose helpers,

849
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:47,889
right?
Our,

850
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:49,979
our mental model at the beginning was,

851
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:51,300
these are non-deterministic,

852
00:35:51,379 --> 00:35:52,580
they can do stuff that,

853
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,840
that's generative,

854
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:55,520
so let's think about them as humans.

855
00:35:55,899 --> 00:36:00,530
And because we were measuring the security quality of what they were trying to do,

856
00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:04,689
along with the speed and cost of what it takes to achieve that,

857
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:06,679
we were able to notice that

858
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,620
this was not actually going to be a successful approach for us writ large.

859
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
We realized that a collection of more

860
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,280
specific agents outperforms something more general,

861
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,909
both in terms of what it can find,

862
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:21,500
but crucially in terms of how much iteration

863
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,860
and human engagement was needed along the process.

864
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,639
Success comes when agents are doing one thing well and then you

865
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:32,199
can assemble them into something larger and magic like Neha talked about.

866
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:35,340
So we're building that into our security approach

867
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,969
because we weren't just looking at one thing,

868
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,129
we were thinking about the complete picture of what we needed to measure.

869
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,919
If an agent does one thing well,

870
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,639
it is also,

871
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,399
it turns out,

872
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,780
easier to reason about in terms of securing the agent itself.

873
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:52,590
Right?

874
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,310
If I'm doing,

875
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:53,750
if I'm,

876
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,979
I'm creating an agent that's sort of wild and needs access to everything,

877
00:36:57,229 --> 00:36:57,709
well,

878
00:36:57,709 --> 00:36:59,179
it needs access to everything.

879
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,510
If I'm creating an agent that does one thing really specifically,

880
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,310
really well,

881
00:37:03,469 --> 00:37:05,139
I know what permissions it needs.

882
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,310
And so not only performance,

883
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,689
but security are kind of complementary here,

884
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:11,250
we discovered in our approach,

885
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:16,090
since this kind of agent lends itself to a least privileged permissions model.

886
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,550
If you've got a virtual teammate that's handling.

887
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:19,929
Everything for your team,

888
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:21,639
you're going to be,

889
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,000
you're going to need to give it a bunch of different access.

890
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:26,540
If you have one that's doing on call,

891
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,659
you can give it one kind of permissions.

892
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:30,580
If you have it doing reliability,

893
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:33,669
maybe you've got just read only sensor permissions.

894
00:37:33,899 --> 00:37:35,399
And this allows you

895
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:36,060
to,

896
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,540
to use agents to take autonomous actions with lower

897
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,520
risk because the credentials that they're granted are scoped

898
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,189
to what they need to do and to know more.

899
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,560
Striking this balance of scope and independent action

900
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,840
really allows you to put your controls in place

901
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,510
to meet your specific risk appetite and needs.

902
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,580
This agent was trying to do everything you lose that ability.

903
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,459
If you really think carefully about your,

904
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,709
what you're trying to achieve and measure that,

905
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:05,979
you're going to be able to set up a system that scales for yourself.

906
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,120
Because

907
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,649
we've set up our teams to stay focused on risk,

908
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:13,639
we're able to understand this,

909
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:15,300
but I wanted to give a little bit of,

910
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:15,889
um,

911
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:17,500
advice and perspective to those of you

912
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,399
bringing this talk back to your organizations.

913
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,360
Um,

914
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:22,639
agents that serve your,

915
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:25,419
your purpose are easy to reason about if you've

916
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:28,870
got tight and holistic measurement that keeps you structured

917
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,679
and focused on the right things.

918
00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:35,600
I think it can be very common for security teams to measure what it's easy to measure.

919
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:37,679
How many findings have we generated?

920
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,959
How many findings have we fixed?

921
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,110
That's not really what matters.

922
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:47,040
What matters is how long it takes you to fix the findings that you've gotten,

923
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,639
not just the volumes,

924
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:50,729
but what does that curve look like?

925
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,429
How many of them can we get in under 3 minutes?

926
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,179
How many of them can we get?

927
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,189
What,
what's our P50 time?

928
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,199
How long is the longest tail open?

929
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:01,790
What do we do about that?

930
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,379
How many builder actions are involved

931
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:07,229
in taking this stuff and fixing it?

932
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,800
By ins by focusing on that,

933
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:11,979
even though it's harder to measure,

934
00:39:12,229 --> 00:39:16,110
you're going to get better scaled results from security over time,

935
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:18,929
right?
If you think about findings and resolving,

936
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,530
campaign away.

937
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,989
Issue all the tickets you want.

938
00:39:23,149 --> 00:39:24,790
You're gonna get great finding numbers,

939
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,100
you're gonna get great resolution numbers,

940
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:31,570
and you're gonna completely miss the human timelines that are involved there

941
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,810
as well as the toil on your builders.

942
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:37,679
If you're measuring everything together like I just talked about,

943
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:39,479
you're going to be able to come up with

944
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:41,780
better ways to automate and scale your practice.

945
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,429
And so the takeaway for the second part of the talk

946
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:50,250
is that you need to measure the right things in order to stay agile and adapt,

947
00:39:50,409 --> 00:39:53,750
even at scale and even through fast change.

948
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,040
The final thing that I want to talk about,

949
00:39:58,219 --> 00:40:01,090
right,
you're embedding security throughout the workflows you support,

950
00:40:01,129 --> 00:40:02,290
you're acting as builders,

951
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,389
you're keeping your eye on the right things.

952
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,649
There's one more bit that you need to take

953
00:40:06,649 --> 00:40:09,370
back to your security team to scale it effectively,

954
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,149
and that is to work

955
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:11,909
as

956
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,389
partners with your business

957
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,629
throughout everything that they do.

958
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:17,530
And like before,

959
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:21,000
I'll talk through a couple of examples including how Gen AI is changing this,

960
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,810
and then I'm excited to hear from Andrea.

961
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:27,969
The thing that you get out of working lockstep with your business is that you're

962
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:31,060
going to solve their actual problems instead of

963
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,909
just doing security in some general sense.

964
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,350
At AWS our problem

965
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:38,820
is that we operate at a massive scale,

966
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:41,570
and prioritizing our focus and breaking our

967
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,189
work down into manageable chunks is huge.

968
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,250
It is what we need to do.

969
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,469
It is the core thing

970
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,110
that I need my security team to be conscious of

971
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,870
as they try to solve for this risk.

972
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,129
And so I'll talk through two quick examples of how

973
00:40:53,129 --> 00:40:56,550
we've scaled effectively because we understand our business' problems.

974
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,080
So across AWS work is tracked through tickets,

975
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:01,909
and in a support context,

976
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:05,469
we use a system called Target for Investigation or TFI,

977
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:06,600
I know our names,

978
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,510
to identify,

979
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,260
classify,

980
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:12,100
and escalate tickets that may require my team to engage.

981
00:41:12,669 --> 00:41:14,020
And these tags,

982
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,729
uh,

983
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:15,469
get

984
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,989
put tickets into a follow-up queue so that we can

985
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:20,409
proactively help builders when we might be needed to.

986
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:22,409
And this runs on all cases

987
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,469
for all AWS services

988
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:26,929
and to the point about scale being our problem,

989
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:32,550
that means AWS support who annually resolves around 1.5 million cases

990
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:36,850
across 285+ services across enterprise,

991
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:37,239
business,

992
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,689
and developer customers,

993
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:41,449
needs us to be there at that scale and pace.

994
00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:46,040
The way TFI automatically reviews case correspondence in real time

995
00:41:46,419 --> 00:41:50,320
started back in 2022 with keywords and regular expressions.

996
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:54,389
It evolved to use ML and it's evolving again to use Gen AI.

997
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,100
And by leveraging our partnership with that business

998
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,209
and our deep understanding of their problems,

999
00:42:00,419 --> 00:42:03,419
we've been able to scale TFI to raise the security bar for

1000
00:42:03,419 --> 00:42:08,639
AWS and our customers despite that massive scale and continued growth.

1001
00:42:11,189 --> 00:42:13,409
A little closer to home on the security team,

1002
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:18,810
our scale combined with the rapid increase in CVE publications is a real challenge

1003
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:20,939
for us and for our business teams.

1004
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:21,600
So

1005
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,629
they're projected to increase about 22% year over year

1006
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:26,750
this year from a little over 40,000 in.

1007
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:27,810
2024

1008
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,750
to a little under 50,000 now in 2025

1009
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:32,850
and if you,

1010
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:35,449
you think about this from the AWS team's perspective,

1011
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:38,929
a single CVE might impact tens of millions of assets and so

1012
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:42,429
it's pretty important that we can understand and act on this stuff quickly

1013
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:43,270
and

1014
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:47,209
again we've been automating this stuff for some time now

1015
00:42:47,449 --> 00:42:49,969
and we've automated the first assessment pass.

1016
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:51,399
To,

1017
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:51,899
uh,

1018
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,800
handle a newly published and updated

1019
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,370
vulnerability within 5 minutes of publication.

1020
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:57,350
This is pretty good,

1021
00:42:57,689 --> 00:43:00,209
but we're also iteratively improving the speed

1022
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:03,229
at which we can conduct deeper vulnerability assessments

1023
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:07,429
for the cases where a security engineer is really required to understand the risk.

1024
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,790
And there we're using Gen AI and thanks to our work,

1025
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,459
security engineers can now complete comprehensive

1026
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:15,260
assessments in under 10 minutes,

1027
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,979
and we've used that,

1028
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,510
uh,
compared to a previous P90 time of around 27 hours,

1029
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,649
and we've used that

1030
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:22,610
to increase

1031
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:24,270
the number of things we can.

1032
00:43:24,364 --> 00:43:25,685
Do deep analysis on,

1033
00:43:25,764 --> 00:43:26,084
right?

1034
00:43:26,084 --> 00:43:28,425
We're able to leverage our security engineers

1035
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,625
to deeply understand more stuff

1036
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:31,425
and

1037
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:32,185
in fact,

1038
00:43:32,205 --> 00:43:36,834
it's helped us extend that deep analysis coverage by 520%,

1039
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:40,885
which scales our ability to confidently respond to changes.

1040
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:43,060
Finally,

1041
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,000
we're able to use our knowledge of the business

1042
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:49,899
and compensating controls to ensure that we're addressing the right

1043
00:43:49,899 --> 00:43:52,959
risks to our infrastructure and customers in the right way.

1044
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:57,239
We're training an AI-based assessment engine that continuously monitors all

1045
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:00,600
of the CVEs and maintains a contextual posture for us,

1046
00:44:00,899 --> 00:44:03,340
taking factors like network reachability or

1047
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,419
instance details or identity or data classification

1048
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,399
into account in order to characterize that risk in a nuanced way

1049
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,100
and do what our business needs.

1050
00:44:12,169 --> 00:44:15,489
And this is going to help us further reduce our false positives

1051
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,820
and properly characterize risk across millions of assets.

1052
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:22,570
This knowledge of our business is what's actively helping us

1053
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,679
to respond and remediate security issues at our scale,

1054
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,110
at the speed that we need

1055
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,659
without making our builders very angry all the time.

1056
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,620
Another thing that the AWS business uniquely needs is

1057
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,899
the ability to understand the security of an API.

1058
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,639
We're basically an API vendor.

1059
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,669
And the way we work through these problems with our business

1060
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,639
is that we start with the largest opportunity we know how to tackle.

1061
00:44:47,179 --> 00:44:48,459
We do it coarse-grained,

1062
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,340
and then we refine from there.

1063
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:51,620
This is a ratchet,

1064
00:44:51,729 --> 00:44:54,739
an iterative cycle that we're using to ever improve

1065
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:57,090
the effectiveness of the security that we deliver,

1066
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,459
while allowing us to avoid the paralysis at the

1067
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:03,239
start that I think sometimes trips security teams up.

1068
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,300
To understand the security picture for an API way back when,

1069
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:10,300
we started by understanding the SDK really well,

1070
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,830
and we created a whole bunch of tests based on that.

1071
00:45:12,909 --> 00:45:13,770
That's awesome,

1072
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:15,090
but it's static.

1073
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:17,010
So look at how the API is used.

1074
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:17,629
OK,

1075
00:45:17,629 --> 00:45:18,879
what does the interaction look like?

1076
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:20,070
What's it trying to do?

1077
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:23,469
We use that to understand the security and refine what we're doing.

1078
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:26,850
And increasingly now we're able to automate helpers

1079
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,949
that can give us a much richer picture

1080
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,189
of the overall system's context and how they connect to each other,

1081
00:45:33,409 --> 00:45:34,159
and so on.

1082
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,229
We're going to do something else next time

1083
00:45:36,729 --> 00:45:38,550
because we're there with the business,

1084
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,780
because we understand what they're trying to do,

1085
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,169
we know where to start,

1086
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:45,750
and then we know how to use all of the stuff that I've discussed so far

1087
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,689
to be ever more effective.

1088
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,030
What advice do I have for you to help

1089
00:45:52,169 --> 00:45:53,600
do this in your environment?

1090
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,530
Start by really understanding what your business is trying to achieve.

1091
00:45:57,649 --> 00:45:59,929
It will be different than what we're trying to achieve.

1092
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:00,659
That's awesome.

1093
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,530
That's great.

1094
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,350
What's your particular problem and constraints?

1095
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:05,810
Look at the overall system.

1096
00:46:05,905 --> 00:46:06,764
You're living in,

1097
00:46:06,945 --> 00:46:09,145
identify some big opportunities,

1098
00:46:09,584 --> 00:46:11,024
solve them at a core grain.

1099
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:12,885
It's better than where you are today.

1100
00:46:13,064 --> 00:46:15,614
And then once you deeply understand those two points,

1101
00:46:15,665 --> 00:46:17,284
you're going to be able to innovate.

1102
00:46:17,584 --> 00:46:21,995
Ask questions end to end and notice when things around you are changing.

1103
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:23,489
So

1104
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:25,429
many of you in this room are responsible

1105
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:27,419
for companies that build and deploy software.

1106
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,550
There are 3 kinds of cost that happen in that process.

1107
00:46:30,629 --> 00:46:31,909
You've got a cost to build,

1108
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:33,189
you've got a cost secure,

1109
00:46:33,229 --> 00:46:34,949
and you've got a cost to deploy it.

1110
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:38,100
Gen AI is changing the first and last of those.

1111
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:41,070
Stay tight with your business so you understand how

1112
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,229
you can reduce the cost of the middle too.

1113
00:46:45,689 --> 00:46:48,439
Noticing these changes in our own business got us asking what

1114
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:51,149
needed to be different as we moved into an agentic world,

1115
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:53,209
and I've talked a little bit already about some of the

1116
00:46:53,209 --> 00:46:56,800
ways we're using AI to help scale our security business,

1117
00:46:56,969 --> 00:46:59,399
but there's also the securing of agents itself,

1118
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:01,139
and so I wanted to take just a minute

1119
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:02,149
to talk through

1120
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,290
how we approached this problem because I think

1121
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,750
it will be applicable to your environment too.

1122
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,610
We started by noticing that we're going to need to securely build,

1123
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,479
we're going to need to securely configure,

1124
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,489
we're going to need to securely execute and

1125
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:19,770
scale agents and ensure isolation between them.

1126
00:47:20,209 --> 00:47:23,689
We're going to have to be able to remember past interactions and learn

1127
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:26,610
from them for these systems to deliver value in the long term.

1128
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,330
We need to know what the agent is,

1129
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:29,639
what it needs to access,

1130
00:47:29,729 --> 00:47:32,590
does it need this table in a fine-grained way,

1131
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:33,790
because these are neither

1132
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:37,110
exactly like a human nor exactly like a service.

1133
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,979
And then we need our agents to be able to carry out

1134
00:47:39,979 --> 00:47:45,040
complicated workflows and discover and connect with custom and common tools.

1135
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,250
And then finally,

1136
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,320
we need telemetry,

1137
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,860
because if you don't know what's going on,

1138
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:49,979
you can't secure it.

1139
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:51,760
To address these needs,

1140
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,139
we built Agent Core

1141
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,100
modular services that you can mix and match

1142
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,760
with everything you need for getting agents safely into production.

1143
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,120
And if you kind of think about the problem and break it out in that way,

1144
00:48:03,399 --> 00:48:05,179
you'll see in your business

1145
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,959
how to unlock the value of this stuff in the long term.

1146
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:11,850
Whether you're talking about agentic systems,

1147
00:48:11,979 --> 00:48:13,580
fast API analysis,

1148
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:14,260
ticketing,

1149
00:48:14,379 --> 00:48:15,219
something else,

1150
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,800
working hand in hand with the business that you support is crucial

1151
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,260
for any security team that needs to scale.

1152
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,669
I was super inspired by a story from Andrea at Lily

1153
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:27,540
about how they did just that around supply chain risk,

1154
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,899
and I'd love to welcome her to the stage to tell us more.

1155
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:31,560
Please give her a big round of applause.

1156
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:34,050
Thank you.

1157
00:48:36,939 --> 00:48:38,399
Hello.

1158
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:39,979
At Lily,

1159
00:48:40,139 --> 00:48:45,540
we are always working to bring life-changing medicine to our patients faster.

1160
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,290
And for me and my team,

1161
00:48:47,419 --> 00:48:49,199
that means doing it securely

1162
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:53,379
and navigating a complex supply chain in the process.

1163
00:48:54,219 --> 00:48:55,050
So,

1164
00:48:55,219 --> 00:48:55,919
of course,

1165
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:59,560
we're also working to navigate AI,

1166
00:48:59,899 --> 00:49:03,370
the threats and the immense opportunities that go with it.

1167
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,419
I don't know about you.

1168
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,979
I don't want to go back to a world without AI.

1169
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,139
I love it,

1170
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:09,959
but when it comes to

1171
00:49:10,179 --> 00:49:11,620
defending an enterprise,

1172
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:13,280
I'm definitely old school.

1173
00:49:13,459 --> 00:49:16,090
I live by the principles of the cyberkill chain,

1174
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,639
which at the most basic level

1175
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,010
are what Amy just said.

1176
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,739
You can't defend what you can't see.

1177
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:25,379
So we at Lily have spent a lot of

1178
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:29,030
time making sure we have visibility across our ecosystem

1179
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:29,889
because,

1180
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:30,939
you know,

1181
00:49:30,939 --> 00:49:31,439
face it,

1182
00:49:31,459 --> 00:49:33,479
we have to be able to

1183
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,879
stop and or detect

1184
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,399
before a cyber event before it impacts the business.

1185
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:43,889
Uh,
and if we're embedding AI in our workflows,

1186
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:45,570
that's even more important,

1187
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,560
but the place where we're still struggling to do that

1188
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,280
is the supply chain.

1189
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,120
In fact,

1190
00:49:51,139 --> 00:49:53,280
I can't think of another place

1191
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,719
where we determine the security

1192
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:00,239
or or the security posture of something by answering a questionnaire,

1193
00:50:00,939 --> 00:50:01,379
um,

1194
00:50:01,379 --> 00:50:02,840
and I think that,

1195
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,219
uh,

1196
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:05,679
a friend and I were just talking about this and we were saying.

1197
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:06,729
Uh,

1198
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,439
we're actually even approaching the problem wrong.

1199
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,419
We're using AI and bots

1200
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,679
to answer the questionnaires faster

1201
00:50:13,879 --> 00:50:15,739
rather than uplift security.

1202
00:50:16,399 --> 00:50:20,080
And so the attackers are proving us wrong time and time again,

1203
00:50:20,399 --> 00:50:23,239
because the supply chain compromises are killing us.

1204
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,500
So we've got to flip the equation.

1205
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,280
I'm not sure we flipped the equation,

1206
00:50:27,439 --> 00:50:30,620
but we definitely went old school at Lily and said anytime.

1207
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:34,729
That we are connecting a third party or vendor software

1208
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,439
to something we care about,

1209
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:38,260
we're going to threat model it.

1210
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,429
And so

1211
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:40,989
that's what we started doing,

1212
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,679
and I'm going to share a little bit of a story with you,

1213
00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:45,739
slightly exaggerated story,

1214
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,899
uh,
but I think it may resonate to go through.

1215
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:49,679
Uh,

1216
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,060
and hopefully maybe entertain you as well.

1217
00:50:53,489 --> 00:50:54,030
So,

1218
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:54,689
uh,
if,

1219
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:55,370
if you remember,

1220
00:50:55,429 --> 00:50:56,919
I said that at Lily,

1221
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,760
what we're always trying to do is increase access to our life changing medicines,

1222
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:02,629
and it's a noble goal.

1223
00:51:03,129 --> 00:51:04,090
And if you think about it,

1224
00:51:04,169 --> 00:51:08,429
the business is highly motivated to go out and find novel technologies

1225
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:10,949
that are going to accelerate reach and scale.

1226
00:51:11,489 --> 00:51:12,850
And so if you think about it,

1227
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,719
somebody goes and finds this new technology that is

1228
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:18,709
going to bring life changing medicines out faster.

1229
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,310
And so what that sometimes looks like to me

1230
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:25,149
is a kid who says to their parents,

1231
00:51:25,889 --> 00:51:29,050
if you just get me this one toy for Christmas,

1232
00:51:29,149 --> 00:51:32,310
I will never ask for anything ever again.

1233
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:33,750
And so.

1234
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:35,260
Security,

1235
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:37,330
as we're starting to threat model

1236
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:40,860
often says things like the adults or,

1237
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:41,429
you know,

1238
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:42,889
the reasonable

1239
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:44,250
person who says,

1240
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:44,709
well,

1241
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:46,969
kid,
you're gonna shoot your eye out,

1242
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,860
or,

1243
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:48,229
uh,

1244
00:51:48,229 --> 00:51:50,510
and the threat model comes through and you know.

1245
00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:51,290
says,

1246
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:51,790
well,

1247
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:52,729
there are,

1248
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,489
you know,

1249
00:51:53,969 --> 00:51:55,370
clear text passwords,

1250
00:51:55,729 --> 00:51:57,280
there are shared services,

1251
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:01,750
there are lateral movement potential to go through

1252
00:52:01,969 --> 00:52:03,159
excessive admin,

1253
00:52:03,169 --> 00:52:03,830
and so on.

1254
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:06,870
And when we actually start explaining to the business,

1255
00:52:07,489 --> 00:52:11,030
you can actually see the business start to be deflated.

1256
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,679
But a good threat model does more than that,

1257
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:14,310
right?

1258
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:17,370
A good threat model also says the mitigation

1259
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,770
options and the priorities that come with it.

1260
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:21,169
And

1261
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:22,449
if we take,

1262
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:22,929
you know,

1263
00:52:22,929 --> 00:52:25,679
what we were hearing from Neha earlier,

1264
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,770
just think about what could happen

1265
00:52:27,929 --> 00:52:30,169
if we had an agent that could threat model.

1266
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:31,810
So hopefully coming soon,

1267
00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:32,429
maybe,

1268
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,010
to go through.

1269
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:38,790
But if we start to think about how threat modeling can then start to be a solution,

1270
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:39,719
Uh,

1271
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:41,679
and we bring the business along and say,

1272
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,300
OK,

1273
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,639
we can't take the solution as is.

1274
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,800
And if it's an internal problem,

1275
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,830
we'd be already working forward.

1276
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,919
But that's where the supply chain is really tricky,

1277
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:51,520
right?

1278
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,300
It isn't just

1279
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,520
The two of us,

1280
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,379
it's not just the business and security.

1281
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:57,770
We've got the vendor,

1282
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,810
and that's where this year we've been lucky in multiple instances to have the,

1283
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:04,899
the supplier platform

1284
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:07,159
actually be on AWS.

1285
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,919
And so I've actually been able to call our account managers.

1286
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,129
So shout out to Matt Sater and Dave Reed,

1287
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:14,300
who could keep picking up the phone when I call,

1288
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:15,580
and we've become

1289
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,919
a three-legged stool who we look at the threat models.

1290
00:53:19,024 --> 00:53:20,574
And we actually map out a plan,

1291
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:21,425
starting,
of course,

1292
00:53:21,425 --> 00:53:22,445
with the most critical,

1293
00:53:22,864 --> 00:53:25,364
so we can start to move forward

1294
00:53:25,544 --> 00:53:28,925
to a mitigation plan and actually start moving forward

1295
00:53:29,145 --> 00:53:31,604
to meet what the business needs to do

1296
00:53:31,864 --> 00:53:34,435
so that we can get those technologies in place.

1297
00:53:34,905 --> 00:53:38,445
And I think that the challenge that all of us have in the industry

1298
00:53:38,784 --> 00:53:42,225
is that we know we're not doing the right things when it comes to supply chain risk.

1299
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:44,145
I think everyone acknowledges that.

1300
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:49,379
I think the great news is with AI we actually have an opportunity in front of us,

1301
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:52,000
and I think with agents and a new approach,

1302
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,330
uh,
and the right partners,

1303
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,709
we can actually start to change that

1304
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,030
because no one in security

1305
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:00,419
wants to prevent joy.

1306
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,419
That's actually not our goal,

1307
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,100
uh,
but I think what we want to do.

1308
00:54:04,489 --> 00:54:08,379
is that when you fall in love with technology or the latest toy,

1309
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:11,800
we want to make sure that you're able to get what you want out of it

1310
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,090
without the unintended consequences.

1311
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,639
So in the age of AI,

1312
00:54:15,649 --> 00:54:17,780
I think we actually can do that.

1313
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,860
We can take a threat driven approach,

1314
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:21,699
we can be sophisticated,

1315
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:23,639
we can use technology.

1316
00:54:24,149 --> 00:54:26,149
And together we can fly.

1317
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:29,810
So I wanna thank AWS for being great partners,

1318
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:33,149
and I really wanna thank Amy and Neha for sharing the stage.

1319
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:33,810
Uh,

1320
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,310
I've loved working with them,

1321
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:36,110
so.

1322
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,560
Thank you so much,

1323
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:47,050
Andrea.

1324
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,290
We love working together with Lily and working

1325
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,280
hand in hand to meet these challenges,

1326
00:54:51,449 --> 00:54:52,969
but the thing that I love most about the

1327
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:55,689
work Andrea was just describing here is that it,

1328
00:54:55,729 --> 00:54:58,070
it creates a positive flywheel

1329
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:00,949
that emerges when you work backward.

1330
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,919
The business outcomes you're trying to deliver

1331
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,590
and reduce developer friction along the way.

1332
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:09,750
Security is part of what any business delivers to its customers,

1333
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,000
and a business framing of your security goals really helps

1334
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,520
clarify how you can work across your business to deliver.

1335
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,360
Our active defense team way back when actually started this

1336
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,149
way and found really eager investment partners from our S3 organization

1337
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:26,580
when they were trying to reduce the chance

1338
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:30,399
of unintended data discovery by all the mean folks on the Internet.

1339
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:32,659
This led to data science,

1340
00:55:32,919 --> 00:55:34,360
distributed systems engineering,

1341
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,479
threat intelligence,

1342
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:36,860
and software developers

1343
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,659
all working together cross-disciplinary

1344
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,080
to leverage AWS's.

1345
00:55:41,185 --> 00:55:42,125
Unique scale

1346
00:55:42,264 --> 00:55:45,864
and solve the business's security need to protect customers,

1347
00:55:46,104 --> 00:55:49,175
which glue and that effort grew to include some of the

1348
00:55:49,175 --> 00:55:51,435
super fun stuff I talked about earlier in the talk.

1349
00:55:51,824 --> 00:55:55,604
Scaling your security team through these changes like the ones that we're in

1350
00:55:55,784 --> 00:55:56,804
is not easy,

1351
00:55:56,905 --> 00:55:58,695
and I know it can be unsettling,

1352
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:01,824
but I've tried to lay out three things that will make it

1353
00:56:01,824 --> 00:56:05,284
much simpler than you might think in order to get started.

1354
00:56:06,889 --> 00:56:08,879
It requires you to embed your

1355
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:12,129
expertise throughout your business processes and workflows

1356
00:56:12,129 --> 00:56:15,030
to keep your eye on the risk and adapt when you need to,

1357
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,169
and to do it all with a strong culture

1358
00:56:17,169 --> 00:56:19,689
in your security team of working with your business.

1359
00:56:19,929 --> 00:56:23,110
I'll leave you with a few quick practical ways to accomplish this

1360
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,110
and then in your own world,

1361
00:56:25,129 --> 00:56:25,489
and then I,

1362
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:27,169
I hope you'll enjoy the rest of your show.

1363
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:32,679
So embedding your expertise throughout your business processes and workflows

1364
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:35,659
is much easier when you are a builder too,

1365
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,979
and this doesn't mean you need to go it alone.

1366
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,040
We are here to help you.

1367
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,760
It doesn't mean you need to change everything all at once,

1368
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,629
of course,

1369
00:56:42,959 --> 00:56:48,280
but the constructive mindset of figuring out what you can build to solve problems,

1370
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,439
not being afraid of creating the tools or extensions you need,

1371
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,360
is key to making this work.

1372
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:58,570
It's much easier to keep your eye on the risk and

1373
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:02,129
adapt as things change when you're actually measuring the right things

1374
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:03,530
security quality,

1375
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:07,370
how quickly are you fixing stuff rather than what you are finding,

1376
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:11,159
intention with what it's actually taking to achieve that goal,

1377
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:12,449
and your error rates,

1378
00:57:12,689 --> 00:57:14,090
particularly false positives.

1379
00:57:14,169 --> 00:57:14,909
They burn trust.

1380
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:17,590
And finally,

1381
00:57:17,629 --> 00:57:21,169
your business partnerships are going to improve when you understand

1382
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:23,879
and work backward from business outcomes,

1383
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:27,889
especially framing any security needs that you have

1384
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:30,709
in terms of what your customers expect from you.

1385
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:33,590
Understanding from the business,

1386
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,110
when you're,

1387
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,810
where you're putting in friction,

1388
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:38,330
whether that's the right place to put in friction,

1389
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:38,929
right?

1390
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,629
We're not ever going to have none.

1391
00:57:40,709 --> 00:57:43,110
We don't want people releasing unsafe stuff,

1392
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:44,649
but doing it smartly

1393
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,209
with your business bought in

1394
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:48,129
is going to help you scale.

1395
00:57:49,879 --> 00:57:50,800
And yes,

1396
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:52,280
AI can help.

1397
00:57:52,439 --> 00:57:54,719
It's making it more challenging in some ways,

1398
00:57:54,959 --> 00:57:56,080
but I'm super bullish.

1399
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,600
I'm very optimistic

1400
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:02,580
about us as defenders being able to do some pretty awesome stuff with this.

1401
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,479
It's going to open up new opportunities like the

1402
00:58:05,479 --> 00:58:08,300
ability to deploy fixes like I talked about earlier.

1403
00:58:09,209 --> 00:58:09,709
And

1404
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,469
on the whole,

1405
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,169
I'm going to be optimistic and say that I think

1406
00:58:12,169 --> 00:58:14,439
it can be helpful as we undertake this journey,

1407
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:15,270
but

1408
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:18,370
that it's just another tool as we undertake the

1409
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,949
same journey that we have been on all along.

1410
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:26,090
Thank you so much for joining me today.

1411
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:29,229
Please do complete the survey linked in your mobile app.

1412
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:33,250
Um,
we run on data and continuous improvement at AWS and

1413
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,169
we would love to hear how we can do better.

1414
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,949
I hope you have found this useful

1415
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,649
and that you have a great rest of your show.

1416
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:39,350
Take care.
