1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,370
- Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,432
Thank you so much for
joining us here today.

3
00:00:05,432 --> 00:00:09,090
This is a Leader's guide
to Achieving Compliance

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,470
through Software Excellence.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,987
A super exciting topic,

6
00:00:12,987 --> 00:00:14,970
actually I think it's
a little bit exciting.

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,340
This guy here with me thinks
it's even more exciting.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,690
My name is Tom Godden.

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,840
I am an executive in residence with AWS.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,490
Our executive in residence team

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,540
is a team made up of
15 former CIOs and CTOs

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,550
from large multinational companies.

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,970
I was the Chief information
Officer at Foundation Medicine.

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,840
For those of you who don't know,

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,720
foundation Medicine is the
world's largest genomics company

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,000
based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,730
And a lot of what we did and focused on,

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,799
in that was doing exactly
these types of things.

19
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,450
I'm very lucky here today to
be joined by my colleague Ian,

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,620
why don't you introduce yourself?

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,760
- Yep. I'm Ian Sutcliffe.

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,940
I am a principal tech
strategist in our healthcare

23
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,313
and life science industry vertical.

24
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,370
My background is primarily
in life sciences,

25
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,920
so medical device, pharmaceutical.

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,520
I've been anything with
architect in the title.

27
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,010
- Wonderful. Well, let's
go ahead and get started.

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,270
So this is a topic that I'm
sure you're all, like I said,

29
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,235
super excited about, because
maybe if you're like me,

30
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:18,570
compliance can feel overwhelming.

31
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,270
Maybe you're drowning in documentation,

32
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,730
or maybe unfortunately
you're just watching

33
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,470
your competitors move faster.

34
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,270
We've accepted as an industry
that innovation and compliance

35
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,778
are opposing forces,

36
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:34,770
that are things that we
cannot have simultaneously.

37
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,170
But what if that isn't true?

38
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,440
What if we could use them to
actually re:Inforce one another

39
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,450
to go faster, to innovate more,

40
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,260
and to have better compliant
and higher quality software?

41
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,300
So we're gonna talk with
you about an approach

42
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,840
that Ian and I have individually
done and we've worked

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,880
with other organizations on,

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,230
on how software excellence
makes compliance

45
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,440
more of a natural
outcome of your activity.

46
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,170
So before we dive into solutions,
we need to acknowledge,

47
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,320
well, maybe an uncomfortable reality.

48
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,720
The compliance approach that we all,

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,030
and I'm gonna group you in with me here,

50
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,090
that we've all inherited,

51
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,450
obviously wasn't designed
for modern software,

52
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,450
but it is being ruthlessly
applied to modern software.

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,280
So let's face some
uncomfortable truths about

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,430
what that's costing us
maybe, but the implications,

55
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,020
and I wanna start with a question

56
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,640
that might make you uncomfortable.

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,011
What if our compliance teams are actually,

58
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:38,700
well, what if they're
solving the wrong problem?

59
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,970
What if those hundreds
of hours that we're doing

60
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,190
and trying to document compliance,

61
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,320
what if we're just chasing shadows?

62
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,600
What if compliance could actually emerge

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,240
just solely from that good engineering?

64
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,240
So let me introduce you
to natural compliance.

65
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,810
It's how we learn to
stop fighting the forces

66
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,280
within these organizations.

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,590
When you build software with excellence,

68
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,530
compliance becomes automatic,

69
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,400
like a healthy tree bearing,
well fruit, no force,

70
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,370
no additional additives.

71
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,960
This isn't about lowering standards

72
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,580
and I wanna be clear on this.

73
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,420
I talked to lots of executives
in highly regulated spaces.

74
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,720
No one is talking about being reckless.

75
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,810
No one is talking about lowering quality.

76
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,560
In fact, I wanna raise quality,

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,410
as we go through and how we approach this.

78
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,930
It's about how we do that in achieve them

79
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,610
in a different way.

80
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,280
So let me dive into the details
on how these approaches,

81
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,230
well, maybe how they differ a little bit.

82
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,170
They aren't just different processes

83
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,680
in how we approach this.

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,583
They're fundamentally different
worlds in how we do this.

85
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:52,560
The traditional way of achieving
compliance is well you,

86
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,210
you build it, you you create it,

87
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,830
and then you scramble at the end.

88
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,330
Now maybe you guys are
better than I was my teams,

89
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,797
but you bolt compliance on in the end,

90
00:04:02,797 --> 00:04:07,320
it's kind of like our souped
up car there over on the left.

91
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,490
This creates what I call,

92
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,613
well, documentation theater looks good.

93
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,400
You're required to have
it. It's impressive.

94
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,773
Look at this stack of documents I created,

95
00:04:18,573 --> 00:04:21,750
and I won't go so far as maybe
to say it protects little,

96
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,240
but it doesn't actually drive

97
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,013
the results that we want to have.

98
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,330
You know, this natural compliance way,

99
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,600
builds excellent in,
compliance is engineered

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,360
into the process and the workflow

101
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,250
of doing software development.

102
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,050
And here's what's
transformed our thinking.

103
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,210
These aren't competing priorities.

104
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,355
Speed, quality, compliance,

105
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:46,920
the breakthrough that changes everything

106
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,650
is when we pursue them all together.

107
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,990
Automated testing helps
quality and provides

108
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,760
that compliance evidence.

109
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,070
Continuous monitoring, improved security

110
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,620
and satisfies those audit requirements.

111
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,960
But let's be honest about what traditional

112
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,540
compliance again is costing us.

113
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,540
In financial services, $30
million annually per company

114
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,190
is the estimate for compliance.

115
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,700
In healthcare, it's a
trillion dollars yearly,

116
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,990
of administrative burden
across the entire ecosystem.

117
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,542
We're trading speed and innovation

118
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:26,542
in this new modern AI world for theater,

119
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,930
not getting into actual production
and getting actual value.

120
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,810
And unfortunately guys, the
news is, it's getting worse.

121
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,560
98% of companies report

122
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,563
that their cost of
compliance it's going up.

123
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,790
61 billion just for in the United States

124
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,950
for financial crime compliance.

125
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,600
42% is labor costs, people
doing the manual work

126
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,340
that we could have systems doing.

127
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,750
And this trajectory is
just not sustainable.

128
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,930
Not only economically, but
from an innovation standpoint.

129
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,590
Again, in this new world that we live in,

130
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,020
and here's a number that
should drive every compliance

131
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,587
decision for every
dollar you don't invest,

132
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:18,120
you'll pay $2 and 71 cents in penalties.

133
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,953
This isn't theoretical,

134
00:06:19,953 --> 00:06:23,460
it's from research across 53 companies.

135
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,830
It poses the question, why can we not?

136
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,720
We can't afford not to transform
and to make these changes,

137
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,160
and here's why we have this problem.

138
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,410
It's a fundamental mismatch in thinking.

139
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,695
Compliance wants a snapshot.

140
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:40,290
What'd your software look
like the day you deployed it

141
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,650
so they can stamp it, file it away forever

142
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,080
into a filing cabinet that
will only get accessed

143
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,150
when your auditor shows up and says,

144
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,650
prove to me that you did that.

145
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,330
Theater, but the reality
is, software's continuous.

146
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,870
It's not a photograph,
it's a movie. It deploys.

147
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,260
It should deploy daily, be
updated on a regular basis.

148
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,830
By the time we validate
and document the software,

149
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,930
it's already moved on.

150
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,723
At least it should have already moved on.

151
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,710
This isn't wishful thinking.

152
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,480
In fact, regulators worldwide,

153
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,780
they're beginning to endorse
this kind of automation.

154
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,410
I remember when I sat down
with my auditors from the FDA,

155
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,870
love my auditors from the FDA.

156
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,340
Class three regulated device.

157
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,440
I'm sure many of you experienced the same.

158
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,010
I talked to him and I said, guys,

159
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,940
you realize you're having me
spend more time proving to you

160
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,740
that I have good quality,

161
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,340
than actually investing in good quality.

162
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,290
Now the good news is we
didn't have quality problem

163
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,430
at Foundation Medicine, but
it was so far out of balance

164
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,130
and we're seeing them find this approach.

165
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,060
FDA is moving towards this
least burdensome approach.

166
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,753
They prefer finely testing
over documentation.

167
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,700
The regulatory world is
actually screaming at us

168
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,950
and telling us to modernize.

169
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,340
We in this industry just need to listen.

170
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,440
And for the first time ever,

171
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,290
those regulators are helping us go faster.

172
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,440
The FDA says, do more automated testing,

173
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,870
not write more documents.

174
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,960
Cloud platforms deliver
enterprise grade compliance

175
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,900
capabilities built into these solution,

176
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,713
digital native companies
are shipping daily.

177
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,740
Well in some cases
they're still validating,

178
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,860
amazingly, quarterly, the hidden costs

179
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,550
go just beyond operational
delays and rework

180
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,650
three to six month validation cycles.

181
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,450
Gosh, how many of those did I have?

182
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,190
Talented engineers, they wanna
build innovative solutions.

183
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,833
They don't want to write word documents.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,700
Meanwhile, new companies
use modern approaches

185
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,830
to ship continuously.

186
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,480
The good news is,

187
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,752
Ian and I are gonna take you through

188
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:04,380
how you can adopt some of these practices.

189
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,170
And here's the pivot
that changes everything.

190
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,300
Stop fighting compliance

191
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,643
with more documentation and procedures.

192
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,330
Instead start achieving
it through engineering

193
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,250
excellence that works naturally.

194
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,300
Compliance becomes the result,
not the enemy of innovation.

195
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,830
And you might be wondering,
okay, sounds good.

196
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,140
I mean what's there to object to so far?

197
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,910
But how, how do I do this?

198
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,160
After working with dozens of companies,

199
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,290
we found a pattern that has worked,

200
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,183
four pillars that must align.

201
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,583
Fortunately, if you miss one,

202
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,580
everything's gonna fail together.

203
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,630
First is culture. Gosh, we've
heard it so many times, right?

204
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,950
In any transformation.

205
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,410
The culture is so critical and important,

206
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,780
but it's also important
how we think and organize

207
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,553
our teams to succeed.

208
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,840
We need the appropriate
mechanisms, the processes,

209
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,760
the procedures and how we operate this.

210
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,170
And then finally, you gotta
deliver, it's time to execute.

211
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,940
And let me walk you through each one

212
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,803
and how they build upon each other.

213
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:11,370
You know, you might think this is great,

214
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,350
maybe it works well in a
pharmaceutical industry

215
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,610
with the FDA, but every
regulatory industry

216
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,040
faces this same exact challenge.

217
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,490
Healthcare drowns in
documentation, financial services,

218
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,330
in their validation, the
root cause is identical.

219
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,670
So Ian and I now are gonna take you

220
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,040
through this solution foundation.

221
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,350
I'm gonna turn it over
to Ethan to break down

222
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,630
how we look at these cultural,

223
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,390
these organizational and these mechanisms

224
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,060
to help you guys understand
how we can achieve

225
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,890
that natural compliance.

226
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,390
Ian, I'll turn it over to you.

227
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,404
- Thank you Tom.
- Thank you.

228
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:53,250
- Alright, so as Tom said,

229
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,460
we have developed this
framework, AWS likes frameworks.

230
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,740
You may have heard of the
cloud adoption framework.

231
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,710
Well architected framework,
we like these frameworks.

232
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,410
Let's cover some of the foundations first.

233
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,630
So hopefully this will give
you an idea of, you know,

234
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,150
why we're developing this framework.

235
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,348
Some of the benefits we're
hoping that you can gain from it.

236
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:13,680
And again, this is not theory,

237
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,950
this is work we've done
with numerous customers

238
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,410
who kind of condensed that experience.

239
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,240
There's no accelerator for experience

240
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,253
and we've come up with these assets.

241
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:27,570
So let's just look at
some of the attributes

242
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,250
of what we consider one

243
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,623
of these more progressive organizations.

244
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,205
First thing, separation of concerns.

245
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:37,770
What we see, one of the main problems

246
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,021
is this kind of combination of quality,

247
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:43,440
product quality teams and IT quality.

248
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,230
We need to separate and we
need to pull them apart.

249
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,070
We need to allow product quality teams

250
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,240
to define the control
objectives, the requirements,

251
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,850
but then defer to IT quality teams

252
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,743
to actually decide how to
implement those controls.

253
00:12:00,743 --> 00:12:03,150
The control framework
is the middle ground.

254
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,470
So that's where we collaborate.

255
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,930
Those two teams get together,
put their heads together,

256
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,060
define those control objectives,

257
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,180
but they leave the actual
implementation to the IT experts.

258
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,990
So we want to avoid situations
where quality is saying,

259
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,170
you need to demonstrate your
product quality controls

260
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,710
by producing a particular
document using this template.

261
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,863
We wanna shift away from
that old way of working.

262
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,850
Traditional quality management

263
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,062
kind of stemmed out of
the manufacturing world.

264
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:37,689
So you have a a production
line where product quality

265
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:41,400
was influenced by
consistency of the process.

266
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,520
So you log the processes
that ensures a certain level

267
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,990
of quality for that product.

268
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,970
But in IT every product is different.

269
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,020
Every IT system, the product
has different architectures,

270
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,000
different technologies.

271
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,210
So we need to adopt a
quality management system

272
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,650
with flexibility of process.

273
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:03,650
Stop locking it into a single
SOP mandated way of delivery.

274
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,500
Automate, automate, automate.

275
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,680
So if you're doing anything
twice, automate it.

276
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,749
If there's IT tooling that
can do the job, use it,

277
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:18,150
again, shifting away from manual processes

278
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,130
and document centric processes

279
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,840
that start to leverage the tooling

280
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,380
that any self-respecting
IT engineering team

281
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,833
is already using today.

282
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,670
What we wanna provide these dev teams

283
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,740
is what I'm calling freedom in a box.

284
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,540
So you provide them this environment

285
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,780
in which they can operate
quickly, efficiently,

286
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,640
they can provide business value,

287
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,130
they can focus on delivering
that business value

288
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,233
without really having to worry

289
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:44,190
about compliance all the time.

290
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,073
Try and take that lift
off their shoulders.

291
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,310
Few more attributes, shift left.

292
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,460
So in a lot of traditional
IT organizations

293
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,040
that compliance work is, is
kind of late in the cycle,

294
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,650
in the development cycle,
it's in the testing phase.

295
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,170
We wanna try and shift
as much of that up left.

296
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,420
You'll see from regulatory
agencies like the FDA,

297
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,350
that this idea of quality
by design is a big thing,

298
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,610
a culture of quality.

299
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,490
We want to instill that
into the IT processes

300
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,353
so that it's considered upfront.

301
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,533
System documentation.

302
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Too often I see, you know, the
IT teams creating the system

303
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,860
documentation as part of their SDLC,

304
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,435
but there's then still
SOPs around these things.

305
00:14:32,435 --> 00:14:33,570
So if you think about it,

306
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,810
when if you want to
control a manual process,

307
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,730
you have an SOP, fine.

308
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,130
Soon as you automate that process,

309
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,720
all of that information is transferred

310
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,010
into the system documentation,

311
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,220
and the workflows, and
the design documentation.

312
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,060
So in those situations you
should be retiring the SOP.

313
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,823
But still we see the two
being maintained in parallel.

314
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,565
Capture artifacts.

315
00:14:56,565 --> 00:15:01,290
So as a natural byproduct of our work

316
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,790
of an engineering team,

317
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,580
we want to be generating
these compliance artifacts.

318
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,983
It's just naturally part
of the day-to-day work.

319
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,170
We don't wanna be doing extra activity

320
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,243
just for ticking compliance boxes.

321
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,529
The immutable pipeline
and immutable production.

322
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:21,035
We want to ensure that all
change goes through a pipeline.

323
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:24,750
We can demonstrate control
in that case, it's automated.

324
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,120
We are generating data,
which is our records,

325
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,310
our proof of compliance.

326
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,630
We want an immutable production.

327
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,480
We want to prevent people
from directly accessing

328
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,270
production accounts through

329
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,310
command line interface or the console.

330
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,867
'Cause as soon as you allow
that, you run the risk of drift

331
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,980
and things getting out of sync

332
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,750
with what you've already documented

333
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,640
in your system documentation.

334
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,932
So that's some of the
attributes we're looking for,

335
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:52,283
and that's why we kind of
put this framework together.

336
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,660
Now the benefit is that all
of these things get improved.

337
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,660
So speed increases by eliminating
handoffs between teams.

338
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,810
Quality improves, by finding issues early

339
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,000
rather than fixing them late.

340
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,640
The risk drops because
we're enforcing compliance.

341
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,440
We've shifted left,
we've built the controls

342
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,933
into our tooling and our processes.

343
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,010
Efficiency increases
because we're removing waste

344
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,183
from our processes.

345
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,350
And the talent stays or is attracted

346
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,660
to high performing engineering teams.

347
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,760
They get to focus on the cool stuff

348
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,683
rather than worrying about compliance.

349
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,049
But there's a cost benefit.

350
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:43,260
I mean, we've known this in the
IT industry for a long time.

351
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,070
The earlier you can identify
a defect or an issue,

352
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,027
and the quicker you can
fix it, the cheaper it is.

353
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:50,860
We've known this forever.

354
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,170
So you know, you fix something,

355
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,540
a problem in the requirements
and design say phase

356
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,670
you incur a cost of a dollar.

357
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,590
It's an order of magnitude greater

358
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,573
if you are fixing things in production.

359
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,690
The typical compliance phase
though is, is tail end of this.

360
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,720
It's maybe not production,
but certainly in the testing

361
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,220
and deployment phase, that's typically

362
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,660
where there's a lot of
compliance activity.

363
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,903
So it's a higher cost already.
We want to shift that left.

364
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,790
Now many of you here,

365
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,363
you already have a gold
mine of information.

366
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,790
I think pretty much any engineering team

367
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,845
these days is using tooling.

368
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:30,270
You know, JIRA for
requirements management,

369
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,830
confluence for documentation.

370
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,510
You've got CICD pipelines,

371
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,973
you've got automated testing happening.

372
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:42,000
These are all generating
data or IT records.

373
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,940
This is your compliance documentation,

374
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,110
your compliance evidence.

375
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,790
It makes no sense to
extract your requirements

376
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,100
from JIRA just to create a document.

377
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,746
Just manage them in the
tooling. Leverage the tooling.

378
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:58,860
Stop creating word documents

379
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,013
when you can manage
everything in this tooling.

380
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,830
So the fundamental equation
of trust is changing.

381
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,520
So we used to trust people and processes.

382
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,520
Now we're saying we'll trust
the tooling, the automation,

383
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,040
and that immutable evidence
that this tooling is generating.

384
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,350
So the automated controls,
the mutual evidence,

385
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,793
and now that equals trust.

386
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,890
So we're trying to change the mindset.

387
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,240
As Tom mentioned, that one
of the, the biggest things

388
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,008
that has to change first is culture.

389
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:41,008
So culture is what will derail
any transformation effort.

390
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,250
You know, you may have the
best tooling in the world,

391
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,810
great architecture, but 70%
of transformation efforts

392
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,540
fail because of culture.

393
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,160
So that's what the first pillar.

394
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,580
That's what we want to tackle
first. The hardest part.

395
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,280
And this was confirmed by McKinsey,

396
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,780
they did research again confirming

397
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,270
70% of transformations fail.

398
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,130
And the reason is not technology,

399
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,050
it's culture and resistant.

400
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,150
So you can buy the best tooling,

401
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,190
but with the wrong culture,

402
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,140
you're gonna have an expensive failure.

403
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,704
As I always like to say,

404
00:19:20,704 --> 00:19:21,690
culture eats strategy for breakfast.

405
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,240
You can have the best plan in the world,

406
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,603
but without addressing culture
first, you're gonna fail.

407
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:34,002
So we're trying to shift
from a culture of compliance,

408
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,442
to a culture of quality.

409
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:41,430
I always contend that if you
adopt a culture of quality,

410
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,470
compliance is a natural byproduct.

411
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,470
So we want to shift from
this idea of checking

412
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,423
did we follow the SOP to,
does the system actually work?

413
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,480
This becomes kind of a new mantra

414
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,660
when you get back to the office on Monday.

415
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,090
If you've recovered from replay,

416
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,840
start to re:Inforce this with your teams.

417
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,390
Start to change their thinking.

418
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,850
So we first need to create
transformation army,

419
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,500
but it's a tiger team.

420
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,493
It's a small team.

421
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:24,170
We wanna find those champions
with the willingness

422
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,320
and eagerness to go out,

423
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,360
try and help with this transformation.

424
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,770
So I think it's 20%
roughly love automation.

425
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,470
If they do something twice,
they will automate it.

426
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,530
If 10% of quality
professionals have an interest

427
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,460
in growing beyond what their
role is currently defined as,

428
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,550
these are the people
you want to get first.

429
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,540
Work with them.

430
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,480
Those that are keen, avoid
the skeptics for now.

431
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,758
We'll deal with them in the future phase.

432
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:54,603
And their mission, this of this team

433
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:55,830
is to automate the compliance checks,

434
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,100
and we want a continuous flow
of these compliance checks

435
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,300
coming out of this team.

436
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,330
So we want to show working
systems not slides.

437
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,790
Now this is a practice
that has transformed

438
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,020
dozens of cultures.

439
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,040
It's proven to work.

440
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,090
Again, we worked with a lot of customers,

441
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,840
and it's around demos.

442
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,130
So weekly, 30 minute demo
shows something working.

443
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,940
A working system will build trust

444
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,803
faster than slides ever will.

445
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,460
Actually working systems.

446
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,880
So start with your team
in the first few weeks,

447
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,490
try and build some of these automations,

448
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,090
and another few weeks,
show it to your management.

449
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,590
Maybe around 12.

450
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,780
Actually invite auditors in,

451
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,333
show them what you're
doing, get them on board.

452
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,350
Now no framework would be
complete without metrics measures.

453
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,720
So what gets measured gets done.

454
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,500
But what gets celebrated gets repeated.

455
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,080
So you can track the leading indicators,

456
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,010
automation coverage, demo
attendance, but celebrate them.

457
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,680
Celebrate those monthly wins,
promote these champions,

458
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,813
have it improve their career.

459
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,373
You know, encourage them
to start adding to this.

460
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,510
Again, the goal is to make
compliance so automated

461
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,000
that nobody really
thinks about it anymore.

462
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,340
That may kind of sound kind of contrary

463
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,560
to this whole career progression.

464
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,766
So you need to celebrate
these wins, these automations.

465
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:33,663
Link their careers to these.

466
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,000
Okay, so we've covered culture,
hopefully we've nailed that.

467
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,030
We've got people, the mindset is changing.

468
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,610
We then need to match
the organization to it.

469
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,200
So this demo culture creates
something pretty powerful,

470
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,887
which is people wanting to automate.

471
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:56,820
When the teams see the automation working,

472
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,270
they naturally start thinking
about automation first,

473
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,600
rather than the old manual processes.

474
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,142
That mindset shift is starting to happen,

475
00:23:08,142 --> 00:23:11,673
and we need to start
breaking down these silos,

476
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,267
avoid silos from fighting
each other, turf wars,

477
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:19,203
and try and bring them together.

478
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:29,210
So you can't reorganize people
that don't want to change,

479
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,980
which is why culture must come first.

480
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,850
But once teams start to see
this automation working,

481
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,543
and that mind shift starts to happen,

482
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,710
you start to see them no longer

483
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,080
trying to defend their territory,

484
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,470
but start to ask how can we work together?

485
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,793
They're seeing the value.

486
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,570
This is when you can start
to kind of break those silos

487
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,510
by embedding compliance
experts in your teams.

488
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,190
So in in several of our frameworks,

489
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,760
we always like to promote
this concept of a product

490
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,340
based operating models
where you build the team

491
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,460
around a product and they
have all the resources

492
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,845
that they need.

493
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,630
So there's none of these
handoffs between organizations.

494
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,740
Same concept here,

495
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,530
but now we're bringing
compliance experts into the team.

496
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,371
So they're no longer a review step

497
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,510
after you've done some work,

498
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,520
they're actively embedded in the team.

499
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,570
They're providing input.

500
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,760
They have a vested
interest in this product

501
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,243
working and being compliant
by design from day one.

502
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,470
One of the things you
always see is, is you know,

503
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,710
we mentioned waste or lack of efficiency.

504
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,280
So the traditional org structures

505
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,400
often slow things down.

506
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,770
Kill speed, innovation, they create waste,

507
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,603
because every kind of
handoff introduces delay.

508
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:53,610
Two to four weeks information gets lost.

509
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,443
It's like playing Chinese whispers.

510
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,660
It's not working. There we go.

511
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,880
Every handoff degrades information.

512
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,655
It introduces waste.

513
00:25:07,655 --> 00:25:10,200
So when your compliance
team sits in one building,

514
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,820
your dev teams are in another,

515
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,185
you are unable to answer the question

516
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:16,636
of how can we go fast and
meet these requirements?

517
00:25:16,636 --> 00:25:17,610
The questions kind of drop between

518
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,383
the cracks between organizations.

519
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,843
So we need to rethink how
we organize these things.

520
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,310
What does transformation
look like on the ground?

521
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,520
So quality professionals get
brought into the product teams.

522
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,383
So there's no handoff anymore.

523
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,650
The compliance engineers
sit in the standups

524
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,763
with your dev teams.

525
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,150
As part of their career
progression maybe they also start

526
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,130
to write code, start small.

527
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,728
They look at automation.

528
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,444
They are trying to
automate their own checks.

529
00:25:48,444 --> 00:25:51,090
They really start to get
into this automation,

530
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,400
automation, automation mentality.

531
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,710
The old review gates start to disappear

532
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,660
because it's, again, it's all built in.

533
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,130
As I said, world transformation
starts to happen.

534
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,370
The skills start to shift as they upskill,

535
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,860
the decision rights happen
within the product team

536
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,540
and you start to see a positive impact

537
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,983
on these success metrics.

538
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,610
Again, no framework is complete

539
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,220
without governance models in this case.

540
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,910
But here we want to try and
split the what from the how.

541
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,670
So we want quality teams
to define the standards

542
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,820
and the requirements or set
those control objectives,

543
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,276
yet defer to IT teams that
really understand automation

544
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:40,380
and the technical
implementation to figure out

545
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,620
the best way implementing those controls.

546
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,790
The key is both sides working
together in real time,

547
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,453
not sequentially handing
over but together,

548
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,330
and creating this cycle much smoother

549
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,823
than this old school handoff approach.

550
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,720
Now I mentioned earlier things

551
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,010
like the cloud adoption framework,

552
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,120
product based operating models.

553
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,060
A foundational piece is the platform team.

554
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,360
So you know, an example is
to create your landing zone.

555
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,230
You have a cloud center of
excellence sitting around that.

556
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,940
The platform team is an
enabler of multiple dev teams.

557
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,710
So they start to take
some of that compliance,

558
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,840
heavy lifting off the
shoulders of dev teams,

559
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,513
build capabilities into
the underlying platform.

560
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,320
This could be account vending,
baselining your accounts.

561
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,990
You've got that, you know,
freedom within the box

562
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,910
because you are giving them
an account that's already

563
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,337
got all the guard guardrails around it.

564
00:27:41,337 --> 00:27:43,290
You can create building blocks.

565
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,420
So these are pre-approved infrastructures,

566
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,553
code like cloud formation templates,

567
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,880
made available to them
through a service catalog.

568
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,980
It's things that they can start to use

569
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,870
shifting towards self-service.

570
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,813
The platform team becomes
a great enabler of this.

571
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,900
There's going to be some
upskilling I mentioned,

572
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,003
those compliance engineers.

573
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,930
We need to establish some
training paths for them again,

574
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,940
linked to their own career progression.

575
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,020
Those compliance engineers
that used to just handle

576
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,850
documentation all of the time,

577
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,540
start to shift them
towards automation experts.

578
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,540
Teach 'em basic coding, teach
'em the automation tooling,

579
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,376
how to use testing tools.

580
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:31,050
All of these things make them aware

581
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,625
of how CICD pipelines
really help compliance.

582
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:37,924
Again, get them embedded
in the product team

583
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,778
but upskill them so that they understand

584
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:40,611
what we're talking about.

585
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,380
So here's an idea of your first week.

586
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,260
Again, when you get back
to the office on Monday,

587
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,123
you're fully recovered from replay.

588
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:56,670
Pick some kind of control
that you want to implement.

589
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,590
Maybe you want to turn on GIT signing

590
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,540
so that you are starting
to generate evidence

591
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,733
whenever there's a
commit in your Git repo.

592
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:07,410
Create that first compliance test.

593
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,570
Start to collect that
evidence on the Wednesday,

594
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,830
basic dashboarding.

595
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,810
So now that you've got
the data and the evidence,

596
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,360
create a dashboard to show it.

597
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,683
Demo to the auditor.

598
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,750
Week one, you already have one
control potentially automated

599
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,330
in collaboration with your IT teams.

600
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,000
This is gonna start that flywheel

601
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,523
of producing more and
more of these controls.

602
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:37,440
Okay, so we've got culture, done tick,

603
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,390
got the organization hopefully aligned,

604
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,720
something great happens then,

605
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,770
the technical work and
generating this evidence starts

606
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,733
to become natural.

607
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,680
And these aren't theoretical concepts,

608
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,930
they're patterns that are
working in production today

609
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,280
with many of our customers.

610
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,800
Well, let's look at more
into these mechanisms.

611
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,963
We'll kind of do a compare and contrast.

612
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,470
When compliance is automated,
it almost becomes invisible.

613
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,089
It's just again,

614
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:13,770
a natural byproduct of
your day-to-day work.

615
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,123
It's happening naturally.

616
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,070
It's just part of your
dev team's day-to-day work

617
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,783
through proper automation.

618
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,200
However, it was a case
where you do manual testing.

619
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,560
So your validation cycles
never actually catch up

620
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,090
to your rate of delivery.

621
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,860
So by the time you finished validating,

622
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,500
your systems already
changed, Tom mentioned this.

623
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,350
It's the same even if you
buy off the shelf software,

624
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,470
you install it, you start
your validation cycle,

625
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,270
you report a bug to the vendor,

626
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,650
they have to fix it, patch it,

627
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,720
you've gotta restart your cycle again,

628
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,470
it's just this never
ending pain of validation,

629
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,230
never keeping up with the pace of change.

630
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,530
So we need to change that.

631
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,740
When you get to the audit,

632
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,460
every audit is kind of this
archeological investigation

633
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,970
into piles of documentation
that's already out of date.

634
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:09,803
It's painful.

635
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:12,540
So basically we really
need to encourage, I dunno,

636
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,580
test driven development, test automation,

637
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,160
anything to make testing
faster, so that every commit,

638
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,823
every release, is getting
validated every single time.

639
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,980
Requirements in code may
be a step too far for some,

640
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,700
but really the message
is that requirements

641
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,770
don't need to be in a Word document.

642
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,500
Doesn't that be to be any
user requirement specification

643
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,450
in a set template format.

644
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,510
You could at least store
your requirements in JIRA,

645
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,620
manage them there.

646
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,000
Demonstrate control over

647
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,760
your requirements management
using the tooling.

648
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,280
If you are having to
extract your requirements

649
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,310
to create a document, something
is wrong with your process,

650
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,743
talk with your engineer,
your quality engineers.

651
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,182
Every time your code changes,

652
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:05,400
you're gonna have| to
update the requirements.

653
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,750
You could actually use them.

654
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,870
You probably see it in
the in the hallways.

655
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,920
Anything to do with KIRA,

656
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,470
spec driven development
is a great new tool.

657
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,826
You should really look into
it where you are capturing

658
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:18,210
the requirements in a specification.

659
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,282
KIRAs helping you develop those.

660
00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:24,003
Again, it's requirements is
embedded in the code almost.

661
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,500
What's interesting is that the regulations

662
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,030
have been around forever.

663
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,120
They haven't changed in many, many years,

664
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,283
but what they're actually asking for,

665
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,630
it used to require specialized systems

666
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:44,460
to capture those audit
trails, to have e-signatures.

667
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,200
These capabilities are now built

668
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,420
into your regular IT tooling.

669
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,120
Yet we're still using old school processes

670
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,040
and document centric processes,

671
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,750
and not using the capabilities

672
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,910
in the tooling we already have.

673
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,023
So we need to shift.

674
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,030
You are already generating
all the evidence.

675
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,130
So again, as we mentioned,

676
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,690
that tool chain from
requirements management

677
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,220
linked to your test management tools,

678
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,200
CICD pipelines that are telling you

679
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,872
what was deployed and when,

680
00:33:14,872 --> 00:33:19,800
defect management tools to
automated testing, you name it,

681
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,943
you have that plethora of
evidence already in your tooling.

682
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,870
We need need to bring it together.

683
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,290
There isn't a kind of an
integrated tool set that brings

684
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,830
everything across your
entire SDRC into one place.

685
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,130
So let's start to draw that
data together into a compliance

686
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,580
data lake or you know,
data virtualization.

687
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,530
Pull it together so you can automatically

688
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,630
generate things like trace matrices.

689
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,530
It's very easy once you have the data.

690
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,403
Turn every system into
a compliance generator.

691
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,670
Start by inventorying what you have today.

692
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,040
Odds are you have requirements management.

693
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,860
You're probably using CICD pipelines.

694
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,290
You're performing security scans.

695
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,774
So start to inventory what you have,

696
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:12,960
and start to pull that
together into one place

697
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,700
with the goal of auto
generating reports if need be.

698
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,320
Or answering questions

699
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,083
that are gonna come from your inspectors.

700
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,550
Make your pipeline your validator.

701
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,073
So think about the
current validation cycle.

702
00:34:30,032 --> 00:34:31,650
You're probably doing it quarterly.

703
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,763
It's very stressful.

704
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,770
We are striving for
validation on every commit.

705
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:41,804
So you commit something, it
gets with a pull request,

706
00:34:41,804 --> 00:34:43,080
it triggers the CRCD pipeline.

707
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,480
The pipeline has all
the compliance checks,

708
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,212
does automated testing.

709
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:50,073
You are validating after every release.

710
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,310
We don't wanna be scrambling
every quarter to do this thing.

711
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:59,060
Again, it's natural part of
your normal way of working.

712
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,470
Apply this to infrastructure as well.

713
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,527
So one of the big things with cloud

714
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:08,160
was the introduction of
infrastructure as code.

715
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,960
So what I've described was, you know,

716
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,430
we all do it with code, do it
the same with infrastructure.

717
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,530
Now we have a cloud formation template,

718
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,940
we do a pull request.

719
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,400
It gets reviewed approved,
triggers a pipeline,

720
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,710
gets deployed through cloud formation,

721
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,187
or terraform your choice.

722
00:35:25,187 --> 00:35:27,570
But we have the same
mechanism now of controlling

723
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,787
infrastructure as we did with code,

724
00:35:29,787 --> 00:35:32,340
and it's generating evidence.

725
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,600
So we had the old IQ, OQ,
PQ and regulated systems.

726
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,587
That whole infrastructure
qualification step,

727
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:43,285
is now automatable and
arguably you no longer need

728
00:35:43,285 --> 00:35:46,147
to do verification steps afterwards

729
00:35:46,147 --> 00:35:49,530
if you've already got
that pipeline in place

730
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,530
and an immutable production
because you've already tested

731
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,280
the tooling and proven that
whatever you feed into it

732
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,510
in your cloud formation template

733
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,130
is what is getting deployed.

734
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,450
So you've quickly speed up

735
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,250
that verification of infrastructure.

736
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,140
Think about how we
discover compliance issues

737
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,871
in your systems today.

738
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:12,990
It's usually during an audit,

739
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,420
where the auditor asks some question

740
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,860
and you have an oh sugar
moment, we missed something.

741
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,186
It's a little late.

742
00:36:21,186 --> 00:36:26,130
So we want to again shift
towards automated monitoring,

743
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,900
watching for Drift.

744
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,600
We want to be able to detect
any compliance issues.

745
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,553
Well in advance of any audit.

746
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,773
Then we get to execution.

747
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,333
This is where the rubber eats the road

748
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,166
and I'll hand it back to Tom.

749
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,460
- Thanks Ian.

750
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,850
You know I'm excited
about this and you know,

751
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,140
you bring together the culture

752
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,000
of the organization and the mechanisms.

753
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,870
You know, really what we're
trying to build is a solution

754
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,903
that allows you to use your
current requirement tool.

755
00:36:58,775 --> 00:37:00,390
Maybe it's JIRA, maybe
it's something else.

756
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,430
Just do the documentation in there.

757
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,853
Use your architecture tool,
variety of different tools.

758
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,690
Document your information inside of there.

759
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:13,530
Having the automated pipeline
that captures the information,

760
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,572
executes the automated test,

761
00:37:15,572 --> 00:37:20,572
captures the evidence of the
automated test and inputs

762
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,753
all of that into a compliance
documentation automatically.

763
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,090
So that your engineers

764
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,190
who are already doing these activities

765
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,330
of designing your software,

766
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,250
gathering requirements for your software,

767
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,180
building your software,

768
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,210
checking in code for your
software, testing your software,

769
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,070
getting the results from the test.

770
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:41,970
These are things that they
should already be doing every day

771
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,563
just to write your software.

772
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,460
And if you do it right, all
of that can then generate

773
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,350
the compliance software or
the compliance capabilities

774
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:57,241
that we need so that we can
execute all of this at speed.

775
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,090
You know, we built the
culture where teams, you know,

776
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,490
hopefully wanna automate is part of this.

777
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,650
You've structured the
organization the way you want.

778
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:08,370
Now comes the part that
feels scary, executing,

779
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:12,360
putting this into production,
but here's what changes.

780
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,980
You're not hoping it works.

781
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,350
You know this will work,

782
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,780
because this is how you've
been writing the software,

783
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,250
how you've been approaching it.

784
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,610
We've seen teams spend
six months validating

785
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,593
their validation approach.

786
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,113
Congratulations.

787
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,180
They want everything perfect

788
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,770
before they start anything at all.

789
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:35,661
And again, I'm not telling
you to be reckless,

790
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:38,700
but their systems are accumulating debt,

791
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,157
their competitors are out flanking them.

792
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:43,170
And the cost isn't just in time,

793
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,790
it's in the momentum of the things

794
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,790
that you never even get a chance to do.

795
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,360
So 90 days is the
transformation sweet spot

796
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,330
for where we want to target
long enough for real results.

797
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,790
Short enough to maintain focus.

798
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,820
You don't have to be great to start,

799
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,620
but you must start to be great.

800
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,900
This is something that
you will iterate on,

801
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,490
as Ian broke down for you.

802
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,430
Small incremental steps
for your teams to take,

803
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,460
fast enough that you can't overthink this.

804
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,643
Give your team short term deliverables.

805
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,510
Even though we might be going
for a 90 day project on it.

806
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,163
I want to see something today,

807
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,100
I wanna see something tomorrow.

808
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,190
Give your team the impetus, the drive,

809
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,800
the energy on this to innovate and again,

810
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,390
to not overthink it, start
with what you control.

811
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:37,050
Maybe get your Git
signatures working correctly,

812
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:40,410
as Ian mentioned you know, set
up that first compliance test

813
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,360
and build that simple dashboard.

814
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,400
And each week as you iterate over this,

815
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,013
you will build increasing
amounts of confidence.

816
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,880
You know, consider where
your team spend time today,

817
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,590
that manual compliance work.

818
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,020
Go after those things religiously.

819
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,760
Developers waiting for approvals.

820
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,600
Gosh, if I ever heard,
you know the the term,

821
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,880
I need wet ink signature on a paper.

822
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,773
Again, I'll lose my mind.

823
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,680
Trying to push something into production,

824
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,869
but we can't put it into production

825
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:11,940
'cause you need to get
someone to sign off on it,

826
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,240
and they're at their
daughter's softball game.

827
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,763
We live in a digital world.

828
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,940
How can we evolve past that
and move past these things?

829
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,299
And it's through this automation,

830
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,740
through these automated capabilities.

831
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,260
You see though, you know,
different stakeholders care about

832
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,210
different aspects of this.

833
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,540
You know, your CEO likely thinks
about your market position

834
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,470
in competitive philosophy,
velocity, your CFO,

835
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,990
well, they wanna understand
the cost and the savings

836
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:46,560
and the risk exposure, but
your engineering leaders

837
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,683
want to know how can we go faster?

838
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,740
How can we innovate?

839
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,630
Unfortunately, the quality teams lose,

840
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,000
think that they're gonna lose
control in this automation.

841
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,370
But what I've experienced and seen

842
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,520
is they actually gain more control,

843
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,440
because they have input and control

844
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,980
into the process and
the ability themselves

845
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,679
to directly influence what happened.

846
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,960
You see, I've seen teams get stuck waiting

847
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,300
for the perfect automation plan.

848
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,580
They wanna solve everything at once.

849
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,950
Others, well, they buy
expensive tools and things.

850
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:23,700
What actually works, again,
going back to what Ian said,

851
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:28,700
pick that one issue, get it working,

852
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,060
and then let the success spread
those small visible wins.

853
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,243
Guys, we've done this in every
transformation we've led.

854
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,480
This is no different
than how this happens.

855
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,100
Scaling too fast can also be a problem.

856
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,470
You get excited after
those early successes,

857
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,820
but you wanna roll it out everywhere.

858
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,720
All of our compliance gonna
change the whole organization.

859
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,733
Slow down.

860
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,140
Each team will surface new
requirements and new issues,

861
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,720
move progressively, move with purpose,

862
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,660
move to that 90 day target.

863
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,590
But don't do it to the extreme.

864
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:11,400
The temptation is to
scale too or scale fast.

865
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,490
But the teams that rush into
those organizational wide

866
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,090
solutions, they often hit a
problem that they can't solve.

867
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:21,716
You see one team, well
they learn how to actually

868
00:42:21,716 --> 00:42:25,890
first start that operating
three to five your next teams,

869
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:28,500
well, they show whether
or not your approach

870
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,590
will actually scale and actually
whether or not it'll work.

871
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,820
Doing it once is good.

872
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,370
As Ian mentioned, get the momentum,

873
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,620
but I gotta push more people to figure out

874
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,180
how well this scales,

875
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,730
but do that thoughtfully and deliberately.

876
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,790
Before I get to that
organizational wide rollout,

877
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,757
you're gonna know that this is working,

878
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:49,200
when certain things are happening,

879
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,480
teams outside your pilot will ask

880
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,980
how they can join what you're doing.

881
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,880
It happened to me.

882
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:58,296
I had teams coming up to me going,

883
00:42:58,296 --> 00:42:59,790
all the cool kids are
doing this new compliance

884
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:03,843
documentation and they love
it, and do I become a cool kid?

885
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,540
Your weekly demos will grow in attendance

886
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,330
without you requiring people to come,

887
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:16,896
and your auditors will ship
from skeptical to curious.

888
00:43:16,896 --> 00:43:19,635
I had my auditor come up to me and say,

889
00:43:19,635 --> 00:43:22,890
I didn't when you started this,

890
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,800
I didn't think you were
gonna be successful.

891
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,273
And I didn't believe in it,

892
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,500
but I am impressed with where we are,

893
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,173
and I wish I'd participated
in it from the beginning.

894
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,870
We need to bring those minds

895
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,367
and those people all along with us.

896
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,270
And as Ian mentioned,
bring them into the process

897
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:44,583
on this and not have them sit outside.

898
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,940
You know, I know a common
fear is that your regulators

899
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,710
won't accept automated compliance,

900
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,710
but modern regulatory guidance again,

901
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:57,510
encourages this automation,
encourages using this tooling,

902
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,310
you gain more visibility.

903
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:02,010
I had so much control and visibility.

904
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:05,070
I knew exactly what we
deployed into production,

905
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:09,240
why we did it, the requirements
for it, how it was designed,

906
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,810
how it was tested, the
results of those tests.

907
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,110
Every single time we put
something into production,

908
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,490
and when I talk to my auditors,

909
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,673
I'm like, what else do you want?

910
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,020
I mean, assuming it
resulted in quality, right?

911
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,070
Which is the end game.

912
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:28,383
But I was like, what do you want?

913
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,563
That's where we want to get to.

914
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,640
But yeah, you're gonna hear objections.

915
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,470
Everyone who tries this, my experience,

916
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,210
Ian probably can say the same thing,

917
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,110
has heard the same things.

918
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,080
We tried automation before,
it didn't work for us.

919
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,470
But that's usually because
the tools came first

920
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,290
without thinking of the
workflow in the process,

921
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,970
Ian and I gave you a little,

922
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,487
how you can capture requirements in JIRA

923
00:44:53,487 --> 00:44:54,750
and move that through the process.

924
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,420
Each one of you has a unique process.

925
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,670
We're happy to work with you on that.

926
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:03,150
But you have that unique
process and that's because,

927
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,520
well it's, you're all unique,

928
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,070
so start small, iterate on this.

929
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:12,120
The fear of breaking
compliance. Well it's real.

930
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,740
So be thoughtful, be careful,

931
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,170
you're not switching this overnight.

932
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,823
I ran mine in parallel,

933
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,750
so I still followed the
traditional waterfall,

934
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:26,430
word-based, documentation,
you know, all those things.

935
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:30,390
Well, I implemented this
automated process and I showed

936
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,430
not only to my internal compliance teams,

937
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,560
but the external compliance teams.

938
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,050
The old way came up with this,

939
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:39,300
the new way came up with that.

940
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,569
And when we point to whether or not,

941
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:43,170
they're documented control
over the environment,

942
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:47,280
exhibiting quality systems,
they were the same.

943
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,660
And it took time.

944
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,980
I had to keep going back,

945
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,870
keep showing 'em, keep demonstrating.

946
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,240
And eventually they said,
yeah, yeah, yeah, we're good.

947
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,773
Get rid of that other stuff.

948
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,220
You are gonna go through
these same things.

949
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,360
So we've covered a lot.

950
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,730
We've talked about culture, organizations,

951
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,680
mechanisms and execution.

952
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,230
Each piece in this puzzle matters,

953
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,110
but together they create
something well, bigger.

954
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:13,140
Culture makes the teams want to automate.

955
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,290
So help them understand
why we need to move

956
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:19,140
through compliance theater
and quality excellence.

957
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,990
Build that transformation
army as Ian talked about,

958
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,790
and show those working systems.

959
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:27,510
This isn't about slides and and
and beautiful presentations.

960
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:31,590
It's about showing things
at work and have those KPIs,

961
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,510
great name and shame board.

962
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,250
Here's the teams that have implemented

963
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,230
fully automated compliance.

964
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,680
Here's the ones that haven't.

965
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,873
No one wants to be on the
bottom end of the leaderboard.

966
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,020
Then move into the organization.

967
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,830
We want to get to instead
of silos to squads,

968
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,033
we need ownership of this.

969
00:46:52,033 --> 00:46:54,960
I used to tell my
compliance people their job

970
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,080
was not to make sure I
wrote compliance software.

971
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,011
Their job was to ensure that I delivered

972
00:47:01,011 --> 00:47:03,453
compliance software into production.

973
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,950
We need them to all have
the same goal and objective,

974
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,890
the engineering teams, the
compliance teams on this,

975
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:14,880
and we need to empower
these teams on how to do it.

976
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,060
But we can still do
that by having control.

977
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,010
And then we need to
move to the mechanisms.

978
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,740
As Ian mentioned, every tool and system

979
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,680
that you're using today
probably is creating evidence

980
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,140
and proof of how it's being operated.

981
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,093
Implement controls over that.

982
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,470
Your pipeline then becomes your validator,

983
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:35,820
your control system.

984
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,490
My pipeline was under
the most change control

985
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:40,260
out of anything I had,

986
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,632
because my pipeline was
the way that I guaranteed

987
00:47:43,632 --> 00:47:45,903
that all of my systems worked correctly.

988
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,890
And get into that self documentation

989
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:51,450
and extract that information.

990
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,570
And then we wanna move on to execution.

991
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,370
Focus on that 90 day sprint,

992
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,070
but focus on how you can
have that small value

993
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:02,400
and incrementally grow as you do this,

994
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,090
as you run these in parallel
the traditional way,

995
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,940
and the new natural compliance way.

996
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,160
And then ultimately I think you'll see

997
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,203
that you have a lot of success in this.

998
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,114
I appreciate your time here today,

999
00:48:17,114 --> 00:48:19,950
these QR codes as well as
the information up there,

1000
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:22,560
the contact information for Ian and I.

1001
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,290
We would both be happy to
continue the conversation

1002
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:27,930
with you guys, to answer
any further questions

1003
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:30,060
as you guys begin on this journey.

1004
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,570
We will also be spending
some time here afterwards

1005
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,310
after the presentation
if you want to come up.

1006
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:37,920
If any of you guys have any questions.

1007
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,320
Guys, thank you very much for your time.

1008
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,880
I know it's been a long day,

1009
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,350
and thanks for hanging out with us here

1010
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:44,670
at the end of the day today.

1011
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:48,623
Thank you very much.
