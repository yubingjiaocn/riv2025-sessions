1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,800
- Hello everybody.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,633
Can you hear me

3
00:00:02,633 --> 00:00:03,858
with your headphones on?

4
00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:04,734
All right, good?

5
00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:05,567
All right, cool.

6
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:06,400
Let's just get a little

7
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,233
quick show of hands.

8
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:08,441
I always like to do this.

9
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:11,690
How many of you use SFTP...

10
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,280
How many of you use

11
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,350
an MFT, a managed file transfer,

12
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,530
or are responsible for delivering an MFT?

13
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,363
Great.

14
00:00:20,363 --> 00:00:22,050
How about AS2, the protocol?

15
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,883
EDI?

16
00:00:22,883 --> 00:00:24,120
Anyone here?

17
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,290
Okay, see some.

18
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,550
And how about partners here

19
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,861
who are helping our customers

20
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,280
with their journey?

21
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,113
Nice, I know.

22
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,170
I recognize a few here.

23
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,003
Awesome.

24
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:33,881
Look, y'all are in the right session here.

25
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:37,127
STG 339, helping customers modernize

26
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:38,879
their managed file transfer

27
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,798
with event driven SFTP.

28
00:00:40,798 --> 00:00:42,454
I'm Smitha Sriram,

29
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:44,820
I lead the product management

30
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,650
for AWS Transfer Family.

31
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,940
Joined by me is Suh,

32
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,859
who's also the PM

33
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:50,307
for Transfer Family,

34
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:51,334
and Prabir,

35
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:54,363
principal solutions
architect for transfer.

36
00:00:54,363 --> 00:00:57,912
So yeah, before the
afternoon slump gets...

37
00:00:57,912 --> 00:00:59,763
Kicks in, let's get started.

38
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,240
So I'm gonna talk a little bit

39
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,390
about managed file transfer and EDI,

40
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,470
just level setting

41
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,860
on what that means to you

42
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,035
and our customers.

43
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:14,676
And then talk a bit about trends

44
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:16,470
that I've been hearing,

45
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,584
and how those trends are informing

46
00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:20,936
our roadmap and our approach

47
00:01:20,936 --> 00:01:22,274
to this space.

48
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:23,970
And then, I'm gonna hand

49
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,470
that over to Suh,

50
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,023
who's gonna do a deep dive

51
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:29,057
into features that underpin

52
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:31,484
our MFT and EDI offering.

53
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:34,152
Then Prabir has a demo showing

54
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:38,100
how you can build a cloud native MFT.

55
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,540
There's some agentic in there,

56
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,190
so I'm not gonna steal his thunder

57
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,350
with that demo talking about it now.

58
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,484
And we'll wrap it up,

59
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:47,160
we won't have time for Q&A here

60
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,410
but me and my colleagues
can meet you outside

61
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,703
if you want to talk more.

62
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:56,610
So as your businesses grow, right?

63
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,510
So does your data and data sources.

64
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,640
And in order to get value

65
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,750
from that data,

66
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,952
you want data to be mobile.

67
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,467
For best of class data mobility,

68
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:10,802
you need an MFT strategy

69
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:13,081
that can help you move data

70
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:16,475
securely, effortlessly, and efficiently

71
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:20,223
within your organization and across.

72
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:23,868
And this value means different

73
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,170
for many of...

74
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,790
For different customers.

75
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,380
For example, right?

76
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,920
If you're in the payments, reconciliation,

77
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,680
or you're healthcare company needing

78
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,243
to process claims and claim payments,

79
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:39,285
you perhaps need to interact

80
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:42,020
with a clearinghouse for settlements.

81
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,866
Or you are a producer

82
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:45,720
of value added data sets

83
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,167
that you want to sell,

84
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,916
you want a robust MFT

85
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,430
that helps you grow

86
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,042
your subscriber base.

87
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:54,842
Many of our customers use MFT

88
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,600
to automate their internal processes,

89
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,841
from HR, to finance, to payroll.

90
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:03,982
Customers in healthcare, pharmaceutical,

91
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:06,030
or financial services have to

92
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,075
regularly submit filings

93
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,966
to regulatory bodies,

94
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:12,080
like the FDA or SEC,

95
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,520
and that's where an MFT has helped

96
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,803
them streamline those submissions.

97
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:21,240
A big industry, or group of industries,

98
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,989
are supply chain and logistics,

99
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,583
where MFT is used

100
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,884
for exchanging transactional data,

101
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:28,763
like purchase orders,

102
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:30,995
shipping notifications.

103
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:33,189
And for all of these customers,

104
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:35,730
building their data pipeline using

105
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,571
their MFT data has become super important.

106
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:41,640
As such, there are four pillars

107
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,910
that we see that underpin an MFT.

108
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,730
One is support for industry
standard protocols.

109
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,710
So you have a business application

110
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,420
that resides in your environment

111
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,040
and your trading partners' environment,

112
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,140
and the common denominator for them

113
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,493
to communicate are SFTP, AS2,

114
00:03:58,493 --> 00:04:00,260
I said EDI, X12.

115
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,620
So these data formats make it seamless

116
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,680
for applications and users

117
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,990
across environments to communicate.

118
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,390
Second is authentication

119
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,290
and access control.

120
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,271
So you give access to data

121
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:14,220
that your users should

122
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,473
only be able to see and use.

123
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,660
Processing and automation

124
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,400
so that you can build a data pipeline

125
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,350
from this data end to end.

126
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,060
And fourth, and most important,

127
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,125
is robust auditing to meet

128
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,873
your data security and regulatory needs.

129
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:31,904
Some of the trends that I'm hearing,

130
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,655
starting with security,

131
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:35,610
has always been a priority

132
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,870
and will always be.

133
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,856
Customers are looking for secure

134
00:04:39,856 --> 00:04:44,048
and reliable SFTP and MFT in the cloud.

135
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:46,551
Second is tools that give them

136
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:48,990
proper governance so that they're able

137
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,600
to track, audit what's happening,

138
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,740
who's accessing the data,

139
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,740
who has access to what kind of data.

140
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,004
And third is simplicity,

141
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:58,530
so that they manage

142
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,315
as less infrastructure as possible,

143
00:05:01,315 --> 00:05:04,491
and make it easy to build their MFT.

144
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:07,560
And lately, three more
trends have popped up.

145
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,420
One is, I mentioned, automation.

146
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,880
So they want their trading
partner relationship

147
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,204
to serve a double duty,

148
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:15,120
even as a data pipeline.

149
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,650
So as they're transacting,

150
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,000
they're also able to get

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,709
real time insights into that data.

152
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,457
By running analytics,

153
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:24,450
a lot of these customers are

154
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,474
also looking to become AI ready,

155
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:30,826
and innovate in their own business areas.

156
00:05:30,826 --> 00:05:32,347
And that's exactly the reason

157
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:34,860
we launched AWS Transfer Family

158
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,646
here at re:Invent 2018.

159
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:39,570
Our team has seven years of experience

160
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,450
in helping customers like you modernize

161
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,860
your MFT.

162
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,570
The service is fully managed,

163
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,530
highly available,

164
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,880
and scales in real time

165
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,719
to meet your business needs.

166
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:51,300
There are a lot of features

167
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,147
that we've developed over the years

168
00:05:53,147 --> 00:05:54,990
that help you migrate

169
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,530
from existing MFT systems

170
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,732
without having to change a lot

171
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:02,070
where it's difficult to change,

172
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,421
let's say your business
partner integrations.

173
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:06,540
So we make it easy so that

174
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,313
you can accelerate your migration.

175
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,135
AWS Transfer Family is built

176
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:12,983
on event-driven paradigms

177
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:14,933
so that you get run

178
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:16,530
the whole processes.

179
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,850
Gone are the days

180
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,850
of (indistinct) writing scripts.

181
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,530
Now you can plug into Amazon EventBridge

182
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,740
and automate your processes end-to-end.

183
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,173
And finally, and most importantly,

184
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:29,010
the service comes built-in

185
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,200
with industry standard compliance,

186
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,578
such as HIPAA eligibility, PCI,

187
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:37,533
to help you meet your
security requirements.

188
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:39,720
More recently,

189
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,270
we launched AWS B2B Data Interchange,

190
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,460
which is a managed EDI service.

191
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,020
The service helps you automate

192
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,205
the translation, validation,

193
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:50,948
and generation of X12 documents.

194
00:06:50,948 --> 00:06:53,160
Again, the service is fully managed,

195
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,019
just like AWS Transfer Family,

196
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,910
and it's pay-as-you-go,

197
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,849
like any managed cloud service.

198
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:00,537
A favorite feature of mine is

199
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:02,932
the use of generative AI

200
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:06,006
to generate mapping code between X12

201
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:08,230
and your custom format

202
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,430
for JSON and XML, and vice versa.

203
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,660
So that has really helped

204
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,520
our customers accelerate

205
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,013
their EDI migration using this service.

206
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:21,576
So just a little bit

207
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:23,850
into the resources that we provide.

208
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,200
Suh is gonna go deeper into

209
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,154
some of the features we've added.

210
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:28,110
We offer...

211
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,943
We started...

212
00:07:28,943 --> 00:07:30,252
We launched the service

213
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:32,125
with SFTP servers.

214
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,623
So you have SFTP, FTP clients

215
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:36,718
anywhere in the world who can connect,

216
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:39,990
and the files land in your S3 bucket

217
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,978
or EFS file system.

218
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:45,510
And then, we added a feature
called "SFTP connectors"

219
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,980
so that you may need to talk

220
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,260
to external SFTP servers.

221
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,790
Now, whether they are located

222
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,930
on a public IP,

223
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,100
or even accessible

224
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,540
over a private network,

225
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,102
you can use SFTP connectors

226
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:58,777
to talk to those servers.

227
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,251
Now, more recently,

228
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:03,330
we added Transfer Family web apps,

229
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,698
which is a managed web UI

230
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:06,291
for non-technical users

231
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,880
in your organization

232
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,510
to access files stored in S3.

233
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,145
Suh's gonna talk more in detail

234
00:08:12,145 --> 00:08:13,851
about Transfer Family web apps

235
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:15,909
and how you can use it to empower

236
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,613
those business users.

237
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:19,909
And look, with the files

238
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:21,484
in your Amazon S3 bucket,

239
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:22,675
as many of you know,

240
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:24,377
the possibilities are endless

241
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:26,618
on what you can do with that data.

242
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:29,613
As an example is EDI processing,

243
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:33,390
I wanna take a moment

244
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,710
to thank tens of thousands

245
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,420
of customers around the world

246
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,513
who are using AWS Transfer Family today.

247
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:42,625
And one specific customer that

248
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:46,233
I'm excited to talk about is FICO.

249
00:08:47,224 --> 00:08:51,025
So FICO, they help customers

250
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:54,442
in around 80 countries globally,

251
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:59,442
with anything from protecting
credit cards from fraud,

252
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:02,280
to increasing financial inclusion,

253
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,040
to improving supply chain resiliency.

254
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,254
Now, as a global leader

255
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,896
in credit card scoring and analytics,

256
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:11,910
FICO processes massive amounts

257
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,954
of sensitive data using
managed file transfer,

258
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,179
which means security

259
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:19,290
and efficient file transfer is

260
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,453
super important for

261
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:22,366
their business operations.

262
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:24,553
They were using a legacy MFT,

263
00:09:24,553 --> 00:09:26,970
and with that the problem was

264
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,930
they had to manage

265
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,396
a lot of infrastructure,

266
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:31,292
even when they weren't using it,

267
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:34,769
which resulted in overhead and costs.

268
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:37,230
They embarked on a journey to modernize

269
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,951
their MFT using AWS Transfer Family,

270
00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:42,060
and now they've eliminated

271
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,328
a lot of infrastructure,

272
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:45,588
reduced their deployment time,

273
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:48,840
because now they can use
infrastructure-as-code

274
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,974
and also lowered their TCO.

275
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:53,687
They also now can track their costs

276
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:56,091
more granularly and accurately

277
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:58,618
as they roll out Transfer Family

278
00:09:58,618 --> 00:10:01,980
across FICO's multiple business units.

279
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,240
There's a QR code there

280
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,740
that goes into detail

281
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,413
on FICO's MFT transformation journey.

282
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:11,504
Another customer,

283
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:13,800
they don't need an introduction, right?

284
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,320
BMW Group, a global leader

285
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,030
and manufacturer of
vehicles and motorcycles.

286
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,224
They developed a vision,

287
00:10:22,224 --> 00:10:25,594
sound, and analytics service on AWS.

288
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:26,940
Now, to keep up with

289
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,980
their reputation of delivering

290
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,492
high quality vehicles,

291
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:33,317
they used AI and analytics

292
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:36,850
to analyze the image and audio assets

293
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,975
from their production line.

294
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,769
But in order to do that,

295
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:42,699
they needed their camera data

296
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,585
to go into AWS.

297
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:46,711
AWS Transfer Family helped bridge

298
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,970
this camera data into Amazon S3

299
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,140
by SFTP the data directly

300
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,730
into their S3 buckets,

301
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,391
and with low latency.

302
00:10:55,391 --> 00:10:56,580
Now, with that,

303
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,262
now all of this data into S3,

304
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:01,681
they're now able to process and deliver

305
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:03,773
very compelling analytics

306
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:05,813
with high quality.

307
00:11:05,813 --> 00:11:07,050
And they store

308
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,830
about 1.3 million files
worth 1.3 petabytes

309
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,943
in Amazon S3.

310
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:16,500
Let me take also a moment

311
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,850
to talk about our partners.

312
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,423
We have a service delivery program

313
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,414
where we validate partners

314
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,460
who follow best practices

315
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,590
to deploy AWS Transfer Family

316
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,369
for customers' MFT implementation.

317
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:31,800
For example, ScaleCapacity recently helped

318
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,750
the city of Los Angeles save

319
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,910
substantial costs by migrating

320
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,460
their MFT to AWS Transfer Family,

321
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,521
and that QR code goes into detail

322
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:43,370
about ScaleCapacity and city of LA,

323
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,153
a public sector customer.

324
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:50,560
Another partner story

325
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,490
that I wanna share is Bizcloud Experts.

326
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,899
So they are a leading IT consultant

327
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:57,450
and DevOps company

328
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,278
who helps businesses empower

329
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:01,140
with scale and confidence

330
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,725
as customers innovate.

331
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:04,140
So a supply chain

332
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,805
and logistics customer
approached Bizcloud Experts

333
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:08,429
because they were struggling

334
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,500
with their EDI infrastructure

335
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,744
because of overhead.

336
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:15,029
Similar story with overhead and costs.

337
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,490
Now, this customer were managing

338
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,260
about 100 plus trading partners

339
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,049
and exchanging 250,000 messages per month.

340
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:26,310
Bizcloud Experts stepped in, right?

341
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,733
Developed expertise in AWS Transfer Family

342
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:30,665
and B2B data interchange,

343
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:32,848
and helped this customer migrate

344
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:35,011
their EDI to these services

345
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:37,320
within a very short amount of time.

346
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,030
So short, they did not have

347
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,590
to renew their license.

348
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,610
As a result,

349
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,110
the customer saved over

350
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,267
a million dollars annually.

351
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:47,775
And also, not only cost savings,

352
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:48,964
they also reduced

353
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:51,360
their trading partner onboarding time

354
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,280
because now they have full control

355
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,360
over the process.

356
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,890
So this is a great story.

357
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,300
Again, another QR code,

358
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,310
so you can read about more customers

359
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,203
who have benefited from our services.

360
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,083
All right, with that,

361
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:03,916
I'll hand it off to Suh

362
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,600
so she'll talk about the features.

363
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,080
- Great.

364
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,280
Thanks, Smitha.

365
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,660
And it's so great to be here

366
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,493
with you all.

367
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:18,790
So Smitha gave you all a great overview

368
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,390
as to the common use cases,

369
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,100
trends in MFT and EDI,

370
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,592
and an overview of our service.

371
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:26,040
Now, in this part,

372
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,210
I wanna talk a little bit more

373
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,650
about some of the specific features

374
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,933
that you can use to build

375
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:31,463
end-to-end complete MFT

376
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:33,446
and EDI workflows.

377
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,282
We're gonna start with talking

378
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,410
about the launches for this year.

379
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,580
The great news is everything

380
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,380
I talk about today will be tied

381
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,700
to a recent launch

382
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,740
that you can see highlighted in pink.

383
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,210
Unfortunately, I don't have time

384
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,743
to go into every single launch

385
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,860
but after this, as Smitha mentioned,

386
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,343
Prabir, Smitha and I
will be sticking around

387
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:52,950
to make sure we answer any

388
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,910
and all of your questions,

389
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,743
and we're looking forward

390
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:55,623
to the discussion.

391
00:13:56,658 --> 00:13:58,320
We're gonna return to

392
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,700
this service overview

393
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,674
that Smitha had gone over earlier,

394
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,960
and we're gonna use this

395
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,290
to really navigate through

396
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,910
the various modular offerings

397
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,944
of Transfer Family and B2Bi.

398
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:10,620
And here, I wanted to start with servers.

399
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,820
Transfer Family servers are

400
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,260
fully managed endpoints

401
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,730
that eliminate the need for you

402
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,598
to have to manage or maintain

403
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:19,140
your file transfer infrastructure.

404
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:19,980
For servers today,

405
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,756
we support protocols SFTP,

406
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:24,616
FTP, FTPS, and AS2.

407
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:27,773
And because servers are fully managed,

408
00:14:27,773 --> 00:14:29,920
they're scalable, they're secure,

409
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,849
and they scale to your demand,

410
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,599
we're finding that a lot of customers

411
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,970
like you are using servers

412
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,400
as the foundation for your MFT,

413
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,531
whether this is for use cases

414
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:43,271
like B2B exchange,

415
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:46,274
or you are integrating your applications,

416
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:49,713
or you are managing data distribution.

417
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:55,166
Now, when we're talking about servers,

418
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,774
and especially if you're in

419
00:14:56,774 --> 00:14:58,470
a regulated industry,

420
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,913
like financial services or healthcare,

421
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:02,340
your first priority is

422
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,155
often networking controls.

423
00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:05,306
And in 2018,

424
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:06,990
we launched a service

425
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,550
with a public endpoint.

426
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,930
And the public endpoint is

427
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,760
really simple to set up.

428
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,170
In the console, you could set this up

429
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,100
with a few clicks,

430
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,631
and then your external
partners can start connecting

431
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:18,332
and transferring files

432
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:20,439
over the public internet

433
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:22,200
to a managed host name,

434
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,300
and it lands in your S3 bucket.

435
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,980
And we also use this managed host name

436
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,233
for high availability, failover,

437
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:31,957
and load balancing as well.

438
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:34,490
And also, on the public endpoint,

439
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,373
there's built-in endpoint protection

440
00:15:37,373 --> 00:15:41,223
that benefits you as well.

441
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:44,653
But as we are talking to you,

442
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:47,310
we started to learn from you

443
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,067
that you wanted more control,

444
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,850
and you wanted more control

445
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,680
over who can access your endpoint.

446
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,810
And you also sometimes didn't want

447
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,106
public internet at all.

448
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:57,690
And that's why we launched

449
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,905
the VPC endpoint,

450
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:02,130
where you can choose
to make this internal.

451
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,360
So anything that routes

452
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,230
into your VPC,

453
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,063
so this is great for

454
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:06,472
your internal pipelines,

455
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:08,934
your users can connect over VPN

456
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,149
or direct connect

457
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:12,030
and this is great if you're...

458
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,997
You can manage access

459
00:16:12,997 --> 00:16:14,790
through your security groups

460
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,131
and things like that.

461
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:17,520
But what if you want the best

462
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,630
of both worlds?

463
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,460
You want to open up

464
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,298
your VPC endpoint to the public internet

465
00:16:22,298 --> 00:16:23,958
while you still wanna leverage

466
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,500
the existing controls

467
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,000
in your security groups.

468
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,770
And you can also choose to make

469
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,290
your VPC endpoint internet-facing as well.

470
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,450
You can choose which elastic IPs

471
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,100
to bind to your internal IPs

472
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,200
and you can still leverage the controls

473
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,790
in your VPC and in your security groups.

474
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,172
And also, you can also specify

475
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:44,760
non-standard ports that

476
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,840
you may be interested in,

477
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,390
alternate ports that Transfer
Family support today,

478
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,277
like port 2222 or port 2223.

479
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,854
And also, for this,

480
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:55,062
I wanted to mention that

481
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:56,294
a few months ago,

482
00:16:56,294 --> 00:16:57,912
we support IPv6

483
00:16:57,912 --> 00:17:00,360
for both the VPC endpoint

484
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,280
and for public endpoints as well.

485
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,939
So now, the benefit of this is

486
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,610
with a dual stack endpoint,

487
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:06,443
you can support clients

488
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,900
that are IPv6 and IPv4-enabled,

489
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,737
without having to transition

490
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:13,953
to IPv6 all at once.

491
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:17,100
Now, that we've talked about

492
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,750
who can access your endpoint,

493
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,300
now let's talk about who
can authenticate to them.

494
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,621
Transfer Family today supports

495
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,720
three authentication modes.

496
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,971
The first is "service managed"

497
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:28,500
for simple key-based authentication.

498
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,440
And this is great for
getting started quickly.

499
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,630
You can manage create users, right?

500
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,890
In Transfer Family,

501
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,060
and you can manage your users

502
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,363
in the console as well.

503
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:39,335
We also support a direct integration

504
00:17:39,335 --> 00:17:41,610
with AWS Directory Services.

505
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,250
So if you're using AWS-managed AD

506
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,469
or you're using AD Connector,

507
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:46,800
you can simply select

508
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,120
your domain in the console

509
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,953
and use this with

510
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:51,090
your existing users and groups.

511
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,350
This is great if you want

512
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,900
to maintain consistent access.

513
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,298
And then, our third,
most flexible option is

514
00:17:57,298 --> 00:17:59,640
the custom identity provider,

515
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,375
or custom IdP option.

516
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,120
There's two deployment models

517
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,170
you can use here.

518
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,730
You can call Lambda directly,

519
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,720
which is great for

520
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,520
straightforward authentication flows,

521
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,269
and what we recommend generally.

522
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:11,640
But you can also route

523
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,171
through API gateway as well,

524
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:15,320
which provides you the benefit

525
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,320
of being able to leverage
web application firewall

526
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,468
in front of your authentication endpoint

527
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,964
if you're looking for

528
00:18:22,964 --> 00:18:25,147
more things like freight limiting,

529
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,795
geoblocking, and so on.

530
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:28,922
A few years ago,

531
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,877
with custom IdP,

532
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,687
we did announce the option

533
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:35,010
for multi-method authentication.

534
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,065
So now, you can specify

535
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:37,849
a combination of methods

536
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:40,440
that your users will provide.

537
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,722
For example, you can specify key-only,

538
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,346
password-only, key or password,

539
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:48,114
or key and password.

540
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:49,770
And how this would work is in

541
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,372
the initial authentication request,

542
00:18:51,372 --> 00:18:53,400
your user would provide the key

543
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,233
and then the server would

544
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,880
then prompt for a password.

545
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,314
The final thing I want

546
00:18:57,314 --> 00:18:58,604
to say here is that as

547
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,072
of a couple months ago,

548
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,687
we made it even more flexible

549
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:03,738
for your identity provider.

550
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:05,915
So now on a Transfer Family server,

551
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:08,271
you can dynamically shift between

552
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:10,440
whatever IdP option you're using.

553
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,270
And this is because we've heard

554
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,220
from you for use cases like,

555
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,630
let's say you start with a POC,

556
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,980
you wanna get started quickly,

557
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,180
you start with service managed

558
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,800
for key-based authentication.

559
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,122
Your POC goes off smoothly,

560
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:22,110
you're ready to move

561
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,190
your workload to prod,

562
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,860
but you don't want to
recreate your server.

563
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,185
And that's what this
capability allows you to do.

564
00:19:28,185 --> 00:19:29,287
You can simply shift

565
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:30,870
between your IdP modes,

566
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,298
and there's zero downtime

567
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:33,723
to your users.

568
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:38,010
And double click a little bit

569
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,782
into the custom identity provider option.

570
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:42,567
The custom IdP option,

571
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,190
as I mentioned earlier,

572
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,080
is our most flexible option.

573
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,318
So it's an adapter,

574
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:49,620
and it can pretty much talk

575
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,840
to any IdP out there,

576
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,640
which is great for lift and shift

577
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,000
without having to worry about importing

578
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,692
your users or passwords.

579
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:00,450
But we also heard from you

580
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,900
that writing your custom IdP can...

581
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,096
Or writing your custom
adapter can feel daunting,

582
00:20:07,096 --> 00:20:08,514
and you want a blueprint

583
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:10,265
for your specific IdP.

584
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:11,865
And also, your IdP,

585
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:15,673
you can't store
access-specific information

586
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,220
that Transfer Family needs

587
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,600
for your users.

588
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,480
And that's exactly why

589
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,800
our SA community,

590
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,465
in partnership with our service team,

591
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:25,860
launched a Transfer Family

592
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,432
custom identity provider solution,

593
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:30,057
which is an open source
standardized option

594
00:20:30,057 --> 00:20:31,470
that you can use.

595
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,676
And it's easy to deploy

596
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:34,927
with some templates

597
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:36,990
over infrastructure-as-code.

598
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,382
And it also has several
ready-to-use modules

599
00:20:39,382 --> 00:20:41,368
for popular identity providers

600
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:42,840
you may already be using,

601
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,600
like Cognito, Okta, Entra.

602
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,379
You can see the list on the screen.

603
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:50,574
And finally, there are several

604
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:53,220
built-in best security...

605
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,870
Security best practices built-in,

606
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,780
like granular per user controls.

607
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,700
So you can specify things

608
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,899
like IP allow listing per user,

609
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:03,638
or per IdP.

610
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,520
And with this option,

611
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,873
this really gives you the flexibility

612
00:21:06,873 --> 00:21:09,933
while maintaining security best practices.

613
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,257
A few months ago,

614
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:13,590
and Prabir's gonna talk

615
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,700
a little bit more about this,

616
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,110
I won't go too deep here,

617
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,281
but we already supported Terraform

618
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:19,908
for Transfer Family resources,

619
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:21,060
but we invested

620
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,830
in Transfer Family specific modules

621
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,850
and Terraform,

622
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,080
which gives you the benefit

623
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,940
of being able to automatically provision

624
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,854
and deploy Transfer Family resources

625
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,691
along with your existing infrastructure.

626
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,139
And as of a couple weeks ago,

627
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:35,370
we also announced Terraform support

628
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,420
for custom IdP.

629
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,160
So there's a QR code there,

630
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,330
and I'd love for you all

631
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,163
to check it out

632
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:41,010
and give us feedback.

633
00:21:41,974 --> 00:21:44,399
All right, so we've talked about access,

634
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:45,981
we've talked about authentication.

635
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:48,021
Now, let's talk about storage.

636
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:50,150
Transfer Family directly integrates

637
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,102
with Amazon EFS and Amazon S3

638
00:21:53,102 --> 00:21:55,826
so your users can transfer files

639
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:59,734
to two EFS file systems and S3 buckets.

640
00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:01,976
For more granular controls,

641
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:05,197
we also support S3 access points,

642
00:22:05,197 --> 00:22:07,765
which, through unique access endpoints,

643
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:10,620
you can specify permission policies

644
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,535
and network controls.

645
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:15,570
Now, earlier you may
have heard Matt Garman

646
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,830
in his keynote sharing

647
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,270
that S3 access points

648
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,274
now supports FSXN.

649
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:21,957
Well, I'm super excited

650
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:23,730
to share that Transfer Family

651
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,459
also supports this integration,

652
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:30,459
and also supports S3
access points with FSXN.

653
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,922
And I'm really excited about

654
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:34,847
some of the hybrid access patterns

655
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:36,540
that this will open up.

656
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,373
For example,

657
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:39,780
your external users can
continue transferring files

658
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,700
through SFTP,

659
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,920
while your internal
users can continue using

660
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,599
familiar protocols, like NFS and SMB.

661
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,870
And getting started is simple.

662
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,330
Just create an S3 access point

663
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,800
for your FSX file system,

664
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,540
and Transfer Family will talk to it

665
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,125
just like any other access point today.

666
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,457
And with this launch,

667
00:22:58,457 --> 00:22:59,820
your users will be able

668
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,320
to perform file operations,

669
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,810
like upload, download,

670
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,332
delete, and copy.

671
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:06,819
While some limitations

672
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,943
to keep in mind are that rename

673
00:23:09,943 --> 00:23:12,390
and append operations are not supported.

674
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,360
And there's also an upload file size

675
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,680
of five GB.

676
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,850
If you wanna learn more

677
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,750
about the full list

678
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,490
of what's supported and what's not,

679
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,320
there is a QR code where you can read

680
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,853
the launch bot to learn more.

681
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,198
Great, so we've talked about servers.

682
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,600
Now, let's talk about connectors.

683
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,742
So while servers are endpoints

684
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:34,546
that your clients connect to,

685
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,330
connectors work in reverse.

686
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,285
Connectors are fully managed SFTP clients

687
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:42,959
that connect to remote SFTP servers.

688
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:45,542
And how connectors work today is,

689
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,861
again, they establish a connection

690
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:50,659
to your remote SFTP source in S3.

691
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:54,270
And if you wanted to
initiate your connector,

692
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,309
you would do that through

693
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,679
a CLI or API calls.

694
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,229
Now, let's say you wanted to send

695
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,037
a file to your partner.

696
00:24:01,037 --> 00:24:03,927
You can simply use a star file transfer

697
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:05,309
with the file path.

698
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:06,630
Now, let's say you wanted

699
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,521
to retrieve a file from your partner.

700
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:11,086
You just specify the retrieve file path

701
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:13,736
and the S3 destination.

702
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:15,659
Now, let's say you wanna check

703
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,275
what files are available.

704
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:18,180
To do that,

705
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,890
you can use StartDirectoryListing

706
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,150
to get a complete inventory

707
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,060
on the remote SFTP source.

708
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,320
Finally, let's say you finish processing,

709
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,153
you wanna clean up,

710
00:24:26,153 --> 00:24:28,018
you can use remote file operations

711
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:30,018
that we recently supported,

712
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:31,751
which is move, delete,

713
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:33,840
and also rename as well.

714
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,770
If you wanna learn more

715
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,240
about these new operations,

716
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,140
there's a QR code

717
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,940
that I'd love for you to click into.

718
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:43,813
And just like we support VPC for servers,

719
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:45,570
I'm really excited to share

720
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,261
that we're bringing that same capability

721
00:24:47,261 --> 00:24:49,162
to our SFTP connectors.

722
00:24:49,162 --> 00:24:51,638
This means your SFTP connectors can

723
00:24:51,638 --> 00:24:54,055
now connect to private SFTP servers

724
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:55,830
wherever they're hosted,

725
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,932
whether this is in
shared VPCs, on premises,

726
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:00,900
or in your partner environments

727
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,010
that are accessible through

728
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,827
your private networks.

729
00:25:03,827 --> 00:25:05,640
All traffic does route

730
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,380
through your VPC environment.

731
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,010
So this allows you to
enhance your security

732
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,725
and comply with your security mandates

733
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:15,954
by traversing through
centralized firewalls

734
00:25:15,954 --> 00:25:18,690
and traffic inspection points.

735
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,711
You present the...

736
00:25:19,711 --> 00:25:21,304
You present the IP address,

737
00:25:21,304 --> 00:25:22,740
which eliminates the need

738
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,940
for your partner to have

739
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,709
to allow us any additional IPs.

740
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:29,310
And finally, for heavy file volumes,

741
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,680
you get the full performance

742
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,863
of your NAT gateway.

743
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,710
Let's talk a little bit

744
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,120
about how to set this up.

745
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,380
So as a quick note,

746
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,647
this does not require you

747
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:40,145
to modify anything

748
00:25:40,145 --> 00:25:42,895
in your existing VPC configuration.

749
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:45,390
However, this does require you

750
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,010
to set up two simple components

751
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,940
in VPC Lattice,

752
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,340
which is a feature of VPC.

753
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,812
So first, you would create

754
00:25:51,812 --> 00:25:53,280
a resource gateway,

755
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,320
and you can think of this as a bridge

756
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,518
between Transfer Family

757
00:25:56,518 --> 00:25:58,854
and your VPC environment.

758
00:25:58,854 --> 00:26:01,343
Then create a resource configuration.

759
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:05,160
So this represents your
SFTP server address.

760
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,030
You can use either

761
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,290
the private IP address

762
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,570
or the public DNS name.

763
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,541
Then your resource gateway connects

764
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:14,526
your connector to these configurations,

765
00:26:14,526 --> 00:26:16,350
and now can connect to

766
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,440
your remote servers through your VPC.

767
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,640
The best part again is that

768
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,050
there's no changes required

769
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,967
to your VPC environment,

770
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:27,300
and you can use your
existing security controls,

771
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,970
you can present your existing IP address.

772
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,370
Everything should just work.

773
00:26:33,086 --> 00:26:34,570
All right, so now,

774
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,990
I wanna shift gears slightly

775
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,720
because what if the end user persona

776
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,580
we're talking about is different?

777
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,813
What if these are human users,

778
00:26:43,813 --> 00:26:46,170
these are non-technical users

779
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,340
in your organization,

780
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,920
like your HR business partners

781
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,530
or your financial analysts, or so on?

782
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,663
All these people need

783
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:56,088
to transfer files to S3,

784
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:59,155
and for you S3 is where you wanna be

785
00:26:59,155 --> 00:27:01,772
because it offers security,

786
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:04,506
durability, scalability, and so on.

787
00:27:04,506 --> 00:27:05,989
But for your end users,

788
00:27:05,989 --> 00:27:08,220
you want to, or you need to,

789
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,920
provide an easy-to-use experience

790
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,760
so that they can

791
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,800
easily upload and download.

792
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,164
And that's where Transfer
Family WebOps comes in.

793
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:19,092
Authentication is driven

794
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:21,360
through IAM Identity Center,

795
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,614
so your users can SSO

796
00:27:22,614 --> 00:27:24,900
or present their existing credentials

797
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,733
that they're already using

798
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:27,298
for other applications.

799
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:29,278
Now, user permissions is driven

800
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:31,573
through S3 access grants.

801
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:33,690
So with Access grants,

802
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,354
you can really enable

803
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,140
fine grain access controls,

804
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,270
so your users only authorize the data

805
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,650
that they're authorized to access,

806
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,918
and they only have permissions

807
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:44,940
to the data that you allow them to have.

808
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,773
So for example,

809
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:48,182
read-only access or read-write access.

810
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:49,860
And finally with the web app,

811
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,880
and I'll go a little bit more

812
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,990
into the different options,

813
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,370
but you also have

814
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,870
a few customization options,

815
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,070
so your web app aligns

816
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,414
with your company brand.

817
00:27:58,414 --> 00:28:01,380
Now, as to how to set up a web app,

818
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,250
it's pretty simple,

819
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,770
and you can set this up in the console

820
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,993
in just a few clicks.

821
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:07,110
And while you're setting up your web app,

822
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,192
you have a few options

823
00:28:08,192 --> 00:28:10,275
where you can add a company logo,

824
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:12,124
you can add a favicon

825
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,250
or a browser tab icon.

826
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,080
You can also specify the page title,

827
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,010
which is what shows up

828
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,970
in the browser top

829
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,961
that's presented to your end users.

830
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:22,590
As WebOps is part of Transfer Family,

831
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,060
it shares compliance status,

832
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,527
like HIPAA eligibility,

833
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:28,076
FedRAMP, PCI, and more.

834
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:30,000
And most importantly, again,

835
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,410
with your end user in mind,

836
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,949
it's a simple to use experience

837
00:28:32,949 --> 00:28:35,058
that's accessible through any browser

838
00:28:35,058 --> 00:28:36,667
that they're already using.

839
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,554
And it's a drag-and-draw,

840
00:28:38,554 --> 00:28:40,683
point-and-click experience.

841
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:45,110
Now, we launched WebOps

842
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,040
this time last year,

843
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,014
and in that year,

844
00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:49,911
we've really learned a ton from you

845
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:51,600
as to what use cases

846
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,100
you're using WebOps for.

847
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,322
For example, we're hearing that

848
00:28:54,322 --> 00:28:56,793
your finance teams are exchanging reports

849
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:58,052
through WebOps,

850
00:28:58,052 --> 00:29:02,497
or your marketing teams
are uploading media assets

851
00:29:02,497 --> 00:29:04,050
through WebOps,

852
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,900
or your research scientists
are collaborating

853
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,340
on datasets through WebOps.

854
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,600
There's a lot of use cases

855
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,795
and while they all sound different,

856
00:29:10,795 --> 00:29:12,870
the underlying themes are the same.

857
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:16,140
One, easy to use end-user experience.

858
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,280
And the second is that

859
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,878
you're centralizing access

860
00:29:18,878 --> 00:29:20,426
across your workforce,

861
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,466
again, using existing security controls

862
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:26,129
and identity credentials.

863
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:28,352
Now, if we look at this flow here,

864
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:30,150
it's straightforward.

865
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,327
So you as the admin
would create the web app,

866
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:33,446
you'd share the URL

867
00:29:33,446 --> 00:29:35,010
with your end user.

868
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,420
Your end user would then access

869
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,894
the web app through the URL.

870
00:29:37,894 --> 00:29:40,427
And then, they would SSO, or present,

871
00:29:40,427 --> 00:29:42,390
or log in with their username,

872
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,700
password, MFA that they're already using

873
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,100
with whatever IdP that you're using.

874
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,720
And after the token exchange

875
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,625
between your IdP and Identity Center,

876
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,776
your user then lands in the web app

877
00:29:52,776 --> 00:29:54,540
where they're only seeing

878
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,942
the files and folders that

879
00:29:55,942 --> 00:29:57,317
you've given them access to access

880
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:59,695
either because of their user identity

881
00:29:59,695 --> 00:30:01,160
or their group membership.

882
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,670
And then, they're only allowed

883
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,530
to perform certain actions that,

884
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,780
again, through S3 access grants,

885
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,030
you've given them permission to do.

886
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,342
The backend, all file transfers
are going direct to S3.

887
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:13,920
And in CloudTrail,

888
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,368
you can audit all user interactions,

889
00:30:15,368 --> 00:30:17,086
down to the user identity,

890
00:30:17,086 --> 00:30:19,263
so you're able to see who does what.

891
00:30:20,172 --> 00:30:23,087
And just like we brought VPC support

892
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,277
for servers and for connectors,

893
00:30:25,277 --> 00:30:26,741
I'm excited to share that

894
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,680
as of a few weeks ago,

895
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,610
you can also enable

896
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,945
a VPC endpoint for WebOps.

897
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:32,843
So with a VPC endpoint,

898
00:30:32,843 --> 00:30:35,700
we create a service managed endpoint

899
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,720
within your VPC

900
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,087
at no additional charge.

901
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,286
Your users can now securely access

902
00:30:40,286 --> 00:30:41,991
the web app through a web browser

903
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:43,313
while keeping all traffic

904
00:30:43,313 --> 00:30:44,865
within your VPC.

905
00:30:44,865 --> 00:30:46,338
So this is really important

906
00:30:46,338 --> 00:30:47,862
if you have like internal teams

907
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:50,106
who need to handle sensitive documents,

908
00:30:50,106 --> 00:30:51,624
and you have regulatory

909
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:52,982
or security mandates

910
00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:54,720
that you're trying to meet.

911
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,400
And now, your users can connect

912
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,398
directly through Direct Connect,

913
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,438
or VPN, or from within your VPC.

914
00:31:02,438 --> 00:31:05,018
You can also further enhance your security

915
00:31:05,018 --> 00:31:06,750
by only allowing access

916
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,133
from approved client IPs.

917
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,912
And again, if you have

918
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:11,700
some mandates you need to meet,

919
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,690
you can do that through

920
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,740
through this feature.

921
00:31:15,285 --> 00:31:16,650
Now, with this launch,

922
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,120
you have two flexible options

923
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,560
for using WebOps.

924
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,640
Through public endpoints,

925
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,620
your users can continue connecting

926
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,880
over the public internet,

927
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,006
which is great for

928
00:31:25,006 --> 00:31:27,492
if you're using this with

929
00:31:27,492 --> 00:31:31,040
external collaborators or partners.

930
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,055
And now, through a private endpoint,

931
00:31:34,055 --> 00:31:35,850
your users can connect through

932
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,516
your VPC, direct connect, or a VPN.

933
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:40,159
And this is great, again,

934
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,385
for sensitive workloads

935
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:42,660
that might require

936
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,130
strict network controls.

937
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:44,963
You can choose

938
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:46,950
whatever deployment option works for you,

939
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,326
or you can use both depending on

940
00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:51,123
who the user is within your organization.

941
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,900
Great, so we've talked about

942
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,040
different modes of being able

943
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,802
to transfer data through servers,

944
00:31:57,802 --> 00:31:59,604
connectors, and now web apps.

945
00:31:59,604 --> 00:32:01,688
But now I wanna shift gears slightly

946
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:04,530
because what happens if you need pre

947
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,720
or post transfer processing,

948
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,880
especially for your EDI workloads?

949
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,533
That's where B2Bi comes in.

950
00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:13,860
We are seeing a lot

951
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,747
of customers using Transfer Family

952
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:17,139
and B2Bi together

953
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:19,863
for their EDI workloads.

954
00:32:19,863 --> 00:32:21,329
And here's a typical architecture

955
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:22,410
that we see.

956
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,760
And I'm gonna start from the left

957
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,020
and just walk through.

958
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,307
So in this architecture,

959
00:32:26,307 --> 00:32:28,762
your trading partner
is transferring files,

960
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:29,913
your EDI files,

961
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:31,770
through industry standard protocols

962
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,610
with Transfer Family,

963
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,563
like SFTP or AS2.

964
00:32:34,563 --> 00:32:36,332
Transfer Family takes this file

965
00:32:36,332 --> 00:32:38,463
and puts it in an S3 bucket.

966
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:40,710
B2Bi is listening to the event,

967
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,090
monitoring the bucket.

968
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,297
And now, as soon as the file arrives,

969
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:46,813
B2Bi is validating the EDI file,

970
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:49,839
it's translating it to JSON or XML,

971
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:52,170
and it's writing to transform data

972
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,540
into an output S3 bucket.

973
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,090
It also emits an EventBridge event

974
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,632
with the output location as well,

975
00:32:59,632 --> 00:33:01,184
and the status.

976
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,000
Then this event triggers

977
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,165
any post-processing actions

978
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:06,210
you might want,

979
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,800
and allows your data to flow

980
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,210
into your business applications,

981
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,431
like your ERPs or your data lakes.

982
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:13,170
If you're interested in learning

983
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,330
more about architectures like these,

984
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,320
there's a QR code

985
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,570
where you can learn more.

986
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:20,070
We launched B2Bi

987
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,420
just a couple years ago

988
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,380
and as you can see,

989
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,180
we've been really busy investing

990
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,760
into the different features for B2Bi.

991
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,901
More so this year,

992
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:29,593
as you can see.

993
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:32,444
Most recently, we expanded support

994
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:36,210
into our first European
region, into Dublin,

995
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,610
to now support four regions.

996
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,930
And if you wanna learn more,

997
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,490
there is also another QR code

998
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,440
that you can click into.

999
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,280
Great.

1000
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,930
With that, I've talked about

1001
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:46,800
some of the components

1002
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,477
that you can use to build

1003
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:50,240
your modern MFT systems,

1004
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,330
and now I'm excited

1005
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,200
to pass off to Prabir,

1006
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,000
who's gonna show you this in action.

1007
00:33:56,972 --> 00:33:58,263
- Thank you so much, Suh.

1008
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:02,181
Now, building on top of some

1009
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:03,403
of the components that Suh

1010
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:04,965
and Smitha mentioned,

1011
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:06,390
today, I'm gonna walk you through

1012
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,530
how you can build

1013
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,710
a modern managed file
transfer system using AWS

1014
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,635
that leverages agentic AI.

1015
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:14,160
Let me quickly highlight

1016
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,635
the core building blocks.

1017
00:34:15,635 --> 00:34:17,850
We're gonna build our secure file transfer

1018
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,700
by using Amazon AWS Transfer Family.

1019
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,980
We're gonna add malware protection

1020
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,593
by using Amazon GuardDuty.

1021
00:34:24,593 --> 00:34:25,786
And this is what makes

1022
00:34:25,786 --> 00:34:27,600
the solution truly modern.

1023
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,241
So instead of using rigid code,

1024
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:30,690
rules-based engines,

1025
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,950
we're gonna use AI agents

1026
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,020
to be the intelligence behind

1027
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,705
our file processing.

1028
00:34:35,705 --> 00:34:37,950
Tying it all together is going

1029
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,360
to be Amazon EventBridge,

1030
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,040
which forms the foundation

1031
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,867
of our event-driven architecture,

1032
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:44,160
and this is what automates

1033
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,893
the entire system.

1034
00:34:45,893 --> 00:34:49,203
How many folks over here use Terraform?

1035
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:52,241
Awesome, quite a few of you.

1036
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:54,420
So you'll be super excited to know

1037
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,253
that the demo that

1038
00:34:55,253 --> 00:34:56,340
I'm gonna show you today is built

1039
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,493
entirely using Terraform.

1040
00:34:57,493 --> 00:34:59,700
I will be linking the QR code in the end,

1041
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,260
so please feel free to check it out.

1042
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,160
There's some other examples

1043
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,510
that you can also build on.

1044
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:06,561
Now, for today's use case,

1045
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:08,010
we're gonna take

1046
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,694
a traditional insurance
claims processing system,

1047
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:12,150
and we're gonna see how

1048
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,320
we can modernize this using

1049
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,069
our modern architecture.

1050
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:16,470
Also, like how many of you are

1051
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:20,378
from insurance or financial
services organizations?

1052
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:22,034
Okay, I see a few of you.

1053
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:24,630
So the use case that I'm
gonna show you today is

1054
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,726
actually quite applicable to almost

1055
00:35:25,726 --> 00:35:27,720
all industries who do some kind

1056
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,143
of file processing.

1057
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:31,835
Typically, we start with an ingest phase

1058
00:35:31,835 --> 00:35:33,068
in which you may have

1059
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:34,594
some kind of documents,

1060
00:35:34,594 --> 00:35:36,019
like for our use case,

1061
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:37,494
we have policy documents,

1062
00:35:37,494 --> 00:35:39,285
images, or repair estimates

1063
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:42,543
that are ingested in an SFTP folder.

1064
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:45,920
The next up is our extract phase,

1065
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,791
in which case most organizations do have

1066
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:49,037
some kind of a basic OCR.

1067
00:35:49,037 --> 00:35:50,927
An OCR is a technique,

1068
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:52,440
for those who know noise,

1069
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,919
a technique to extract text from images.

1070
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:57,390
The challenge with

1071
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,696
traditional OCR is that

1072
00:35:58,696 --> 00:35:59,618
it is rigid,

1073
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:01,530
it only expects files and formats

1074
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,380
in a certain way.

1075
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,270
And finally, our next phase,

1076
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,110
or the last phase,

1077
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,300
of our flow is the analysis phase,

1078
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,770
in which typically there is

1079
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,880
a bit of manual processing.

1080
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,713
You may have some kind

1081
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:13,999
of rules-based engine that does part

1082
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:15,126
of the automation for you,

1083
00:36:15,126 --> 00:36:16,800
but this is where humans have

1084
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,730
to kind of get involved

1085
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,568
and you have the human in the loop.

1086
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:21,813
The challenge with this entire approach is

1087
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:23,910
that not only this is error prone,

1088
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,900
it is time consuming,

1089
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,200
and it just doesn't scale.

1090
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:28,860
Now, let me walk you through

1091
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,060
how you can modernize this

1092
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,810
by using cloud-native architecture.

1093
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,090
Now, here's our modern approach

1094
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,310
that builds on top of

1095
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,460
the core building blocks

1096
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,330
that I spoke about,

1097
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,980
secure file transfer,

1098
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,631
malware scanning, and agentic AI.

1099
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:45,200
I'm gonna show you a demo

1100
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,160
that will be...

1101
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,750
That will automate an end-to-end workflow

1102
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,210
of claims processing using agentic AI,

1103
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,495
all powered by event-driven architecture.

1104
00:36:53,495 --> 00:36:55,020
Let's dive deep into each

1105
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,003
of those components to explore more.

1106
00:36:59,748 --> 00:37:01,800
Our first stage is where

1107
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,603
we are modernizing our foundation.

1108
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:07,470
We will replace our legacy SFTP servers

1109
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,820
with Transfer Family,

1110
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,960
which means that there's

1111
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,260
no infrastructure to manage,

1112
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,750
it automatically scales,

1113
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,414
and is highly available.

1114
00:37:14,414 --> 00:37:17,520
Now we want to authenticate
external users,

1115
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,050
and we do that by adding support

1116
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,043
with custom IdP.

1117
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:23,250
These external users could be anywhere

1118
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,960
from repair shops to partners

1119
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,400
that your company works with,

1120
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,058
and it allows you to offload

1121
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:29,730
and almost integrate with

1122
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,563
their identity provider,

1123
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:31,396
and you don't have

1124
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:33,050
to do separate credential management.

1125
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,460
Now, we want to store everything

1126
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,909
in Amazon S3 for its unlimited scalability

1127
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:40,293
and high durability for all your files.

1128
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:44,460
In the next stage,

1129
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,810
we will be adding

1130
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,730
automatic malware scanning.

1131
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,690
This is a requirement

1132
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,580
for most regulated industries

1133
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,450
to do malware scanning

1134
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,130
of all files as they land.

1135
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,210
So we're gonna achieve that

1136
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,440
by leveraging GuardDuty's

1137
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,487
native malware scanning capability.

1138
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:59,850
GuardDuty offers
immediate threat detection

1139
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,399
and intelligent file routing

1140
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:02,870
for all your files.

1141
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,038
What it means that

1142
00:38:04,038 --> 00:38:06,240
your clean files will land

1143
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,722
automatically in a clean bucket,

1144
00:38:07,722 --> 00:38:08,923
and any malicious file,

1145
00:38:08,923 --> 00:38:10,224
or suspicious files,

1146
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:12,720
move directly to a quarantine bucket.

1147
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,920
All done through
event-driven architectures.

1148
00:38:16,768 --> 00:38:18,667
And lastly, when we talk

1149
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:20,040
about intelligence layer,

1150
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,940
this is where we've seen

1151
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,740
a huge transformation happening

1152
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,621
in industries that are trying to modernize

1153
00:38:24,621 --> 00:38:27,298
their traditional file
processing workflows.

1154
00:38:27,298 --> 00:38:30,413
So we are gonna be using
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore,

1155
00:38:30,413 --> 00:38:33,060
and we have AgentCore orchestrating

1156
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,897
all of our AI agents.

1157
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:36,923
Now, the agents themselves,

1158
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:39,210
they can use the most sophisticated models

1159
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,840
that are available not only in Bedrock,

1160
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,470
even from other cloud providers.

1161
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,120
So these could be from Anthropic,

1162
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,607
the cloud models,

1163
00:38:47,607 --> 00:38:48,840
these could also be

1164
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,610
our Amazon novel models.

1165
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,810
And these in general offer

1166
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,070
a lot more flexibility

1167
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:56,447
and accuracy over a traditional CR.

1168
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:58,350
Now finally, you wanna make

1169
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,062
this accessible to human users

1170
00:39:00,062 --> 00:39:01,890
in a simple way.

1171
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,060
So this is where

1172
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,550
we use Transfer Family's web UI

1173
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,826
or web apps feature

1174
00:39:06,826 --> 00:39:08,790
that is a simple browser-based access

1175
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,320
for your end users

1176
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,940
to access these files.

1177
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,213
It's completely self-serve.

1178
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:15,180
It has security built-in,

1179
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,536
which means that it
provides rule-based access,

1180
00:39:17,536 --> 00:39:19,260
the right access to the right people

1181
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,430
at the right time,

1182
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,330
built on the principles of zero trust.

1183
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,173
Now, let me show you

1184
00:39:24,173 --> 00:39:25,140
all of this in action.

1185
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,010
It's probably the demo

1186
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,111
that you've been waiting for.

1187
00:39:28,111 --> 00:39:29,910
And before I dive deep in,

1188
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,260
I wanna mention that I've broken

1189
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,604
this demo down into multiple stages.

1190
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,940
You will see that in the code as well.

1191
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,773
For this demo,

1192
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:38,400
I've pre-deployed certain stages.

1193
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,671
I have the Identity
Foundation pre-deployed,

1194
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:42,450
I've set up a Transfer Family server

1195
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,480
with custom IdP.

1196
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,762
I've also set up our

1197
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:47,223
automatic malware
scanning using GuardDuty.

1198
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:49,410
Now, we are starting

1199
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,880
with the dual identity system.

1200
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,344
We are using IAM Identity Center

1201
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,392
for our insurance users.

1202
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,460
For this demo, I've traded local users,

1203
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,140
but your IDC setup may
look very differently.

1204
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,640
You may have already federated

1205
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,995
with another identity provider.

1206
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:06,863
You see, I have two users,

1207
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,880
claim reviewers and claim admins,

1208
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,200
and these are what I'm gonna be using

1209
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,033
for our demo.

1210
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,537
Now, for our external users,

1211
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,440
I'm using Amazon Cognito

1212
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,810
to simulate user management.

1213
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,736
I've made Any Company insurance user

1214
00:40:21,736 --> 00:40:24,655
and you see Any Company repairs user is

1215
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,905
the entity and identity

1216
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:28,860
that I'm gonna be using throughout

1217
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,310
the presentation of the demo.

1218
00:40:31,856 --> 00:40:33,750
I've also set up a transfer server,

1219
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,220
so let's just check that out

1220
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,213
in a second.

1221
00:40:36,213 --> 00:40:37,200
And if you look at

1222
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,730
the identity provider configuration,

1223
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,700
I set this up using custom AWS Lambda,

1224
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,613
which is our custom IdP solution.

1225
00:40:47,663 --> 00:40:50,220
I've created a bunch of different buckets.

1226
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,340
I am using my random page generators.

1227
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,993
So if you like these names,

1228
00:40:54,993 --> 00:40:56,540
I'm glad you did.

1229
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,410
All right, so we're gonna be using

1230
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,550
our claims file to ingest

1231
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,787
all our files.

1232
00:41:00,787 --> 00:41:02,484
But the bottom three buckets,

1233
00:41:02,484 --> 00:41:04,500
clean bucket, errors bucket,

1234
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,210
and the quarantine bucket is gonna be used

1235
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,593
by our malware scanning.

1236
00:41:10,883 --> 00:41:13,702
Now, to test our
event-driven architecture,

1237
00:41:13,702 --> 00:41:15,030
what I'm gonna do is that

1238
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,830
I'm gonna upload a file.

1239
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,270
And I'm using Kiro CLI by the way,

1240
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:21,038
so I'm not typing SFTP commands.

1241
00:41:21,038 --> 00:41:22,440
I'm very clumsy so I thought

1242
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,200
this was a better use of natural language,

1243
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,375
by asking Kiro to do the work for me.

1244
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:28,380
So what I've done is

1245
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,180
that Kiro created a test file.

1246
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,673
I've uploaded this to my bucket.

1247
00:41:32,673 --> 00:41:36,180
Kiro is also parsing logs from CloudWatch,

1248
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,860
so it states that the GuardDuty scan has

1249
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,300
now been kicked in.

1250
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,356
And let's see what's happening.

1251
00:41:40,356 --> 00:41:42,090
So the first thing I see is

1252
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,181
that my claims file...

1253
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:45,856
Test file did land up in my SFTP bucket.

1254
00:41:45,856 --> 00:41:47,954
If my malware protection is working

1255
00:41:47,954 --> 00:41:48,996
as designed,

1256
00:41:48,996 --> 00:41:50,370
I should have seen this file

1257
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,750
automatically processed.

1258
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,755
And if I do a refresh,

1259
00:41:52,755 --> 00:41:55,379
it should end up in my clean bucket,

1260
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,890
which is exactly what you see.

1261
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,208
Now, I want to test the same thing

1262
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,650
for my malicious file.

1263
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,870
So I don't wanna infect my system,

1264
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,130
so I'm using an ICAR file,

1265
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,420
which is a test file that's used

1266
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,949
to detect malware scanning.

1267
00:42:07,949 --> 00:42:09,270
It's the same flow...

1268
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,410
I'm gonna be uploading this

1269
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,973
into an SFTP folder.

1270
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,052
Okay, so again,

1271
00:42:19,052 --> 00:42:22,495
Kiro's uploaded this file using SFTP.

1272
00:42:22,495 --> 00:42:25,170
We can double check in our console.

1273
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,150
We see that this file did land up

1274
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,613
in our SFTP folder.

1275
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:30,690
Now, I also wanna double check

1276
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,060
if my clean bucket is intact.

1277
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,811
And if I quickly do a refresh,

1278
00:42:34,811 --> 00:42:37,163
I see that nothing's changed.

1279
00:42:37,163 --> 00:42:38,880
I still have my clean file

1280
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,182
that I uploaded earlier.

1281
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,860
But if I go into my quarantine bucket,

1282
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,530
this is where the magic is.

1283
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,210
GuardDuty automatically detected this

1284
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,350
as a malicious file

1285
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,183
and it moved this to

1286
00:42:47,183 --> 00:42:48,210
my quarantine bucket.

1287
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:55,640
So now that I've done this again,

1288
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,290
Kiro is summarizing all the findings

1289
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,010
to detect everything that we saw

1290
00:42:59,010 --> 00:42:59,843
in the console,

1291
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,020
so nothing new there.

1292
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,920
Now, what I'm gonna do is that

1293
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,290
I'm gonna actually deploy my stage three,

1294
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,990
which is the agentic AI foundation layer.

1295
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:07,823
And this is...

1296
00:43:07,823 --> 00:43:08,656
You can, by the way,

1297
00:43:08,656 --> 00:43:10,170
do this using a simple Terraform apply.

1298
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,850
That's all that the Kiro is doing

1299
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,050
on my behalf.

1300
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,640
So the commands that you see over here,

1301
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,350
they're not something from the Matrix,

1302
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,790
they are a Terraform apply,

1303
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,350
so most of you are familiar with this.

1304
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,853
That's all I'm doing right now.

1305
00:43:20,853 --> 00:43:22,955
I wanna just quickly walk you through

1306
00:43:22,955 --> 00:43:26,700
a snippet of what my agents look like.

1307
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,629
And what you see over here is

1308
00:43:28,629 --> 00:43:30,949
that instead of using complex logic,

1309
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:33,162
I'm using a very simple prompt.

1310
00:43:33,162 --> 00:43:35,340
And if those who have used some kind

1311
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,180
of chat-based interface,

1312
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,170
such as ChatGPT,

1313
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,910
this actually might look very familiar.

1314
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:40,350
So I've actually asked this agent

1315
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,220
to do something for me.

1316
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,053
I've said that

1317
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,017
"You are a claims
processing workflow agent.

1318
00:43:44,017 --> 00:43:45,217
"You use STRANDS.

1319
00:43:45,217 --> 00:43:47,130
"And your job is to extract entities,

1320
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,357
"validate the damage claim,

1321
00:43:49,357 --> 00:43:50,650
"insert the enriched data

1322
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,547
"into a database,

1323
00:43:51,547 --> 00:43:52,680
"engineer the summary."

1324
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,020
So that is my instruction to this agent.

1325
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,130
Now, the agent's gonna figure out

1326
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,413
what to do and how to do,

1327
00:43:57,413 --> 00:43:59,853
and which subagent to engage.

1328
00:44:01,604 --> 00:44:03,007
Now, for this demo,

1329
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,669
I'm actually using two

1330
00:44:04,669 --> 00:44:06,060
different claim files,

1331
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,392
so I'm gonna just show you this

1332
00:44:07,392 --> 00:44:08,670
just in a second.

1333
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:09,840
But before I do that,

1334
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,099
let's check our agents in AgentCore.

1335
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:14,574
Anybody using Agent Core today?

1336
00:44:14,574 --> 00:44:15,720
Okay, some of you.

1337
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,620
All right.

1338
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,240
So for those who are using this,

1339
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,290
this might look very familiar.

1340
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,730
I've deployed five different agents

1341
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,950
and I'm using AgentCore Runtime.

1342
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,000
That's exactly what we saw,

1343
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,773
like we had five different agent files.

1344
00:44:25,773 --> 00:44:26,731
For this demo,

1345
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:29,070
I've also created a DynamoDB table,

1346
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,544
which, again, kind of simulates how

1347
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:32,850
most financial services organizations do

1348
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:33,923
downstream processing.

1349
00:44:33,923 --> 00:44:35,533
You may have some kind of database

1350
00:44:35,533 --> 00:44:37,850
that you will keep as a book of records

1351
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,603
or downstream processing of claims.

1352
00:44:40,584 --> 00:44:42,750
Now, I'm gonna show you quickly

1353
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,815
our claims files

1354
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:45,903
that we're gonna be testing.

1355
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,900
So our first claim is

1356
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,323
a regular claim that ha...

1357
00:44:51,323 --> 00:44:53,331
Of a car that had a rear bumper damage

1358
00:44:53,331 --> 00:44:54,561
in a shopping car...

1359
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:56,194
Shopping center parking lot.

1360
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:59,270
There's an estimated repair cost of $995.

1361
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,220
So just...

1362
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,580
Yeah, some entities over here.

1363
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,530
And I have an image of a car

1364
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:05,580
that has a bump...

1365
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,413
A fender bender,

1366
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:07,680
so very consistent with what you saw

1367
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,678
in the claims form.

1368
00:45:09,678 --> 00:45:10,835
Now, let's test this.

1369
00:45:10,835 --> 00:45:12,060
I'm gonna upload this

1370
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,110
in the same process.

1371
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,130
Our event-driven architecture,

1372
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:14,963
we're gonna upload this

1373
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:16,203
into our SFTP folder.

1374
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,961
We see that's just happened.

1375
00:45:19,961 --> 00:45:22,225
NQO is gonna start parsing the logs.

1376
00:45:22,225 --> 00:45:24,398
Okay, it's the second phase

1377
00:45:24,398 --> 00:45:26,366
of our agentic AI was malware scanning.

1378
00:45:26,366 --> 00:45:29,880
We see that the file was
successfully uploaded

1379
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,930
into my clean bucket,

1380
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,220
and the agents actually moved them

1381
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,630
to a submitted claims prefix.

1382
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,560
So again, just for organization.

1383
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,435
I see those same files that you saw.

1384
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,807
Now, Kiro, I've actually asked you

1385
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:42,329
to parse CloudWatch logs.

1386
00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:43,912
So instead of going to
CloudWatch console...

1387
00:45:43,912 --> 00:45:45,450
I like working the ID,

1388
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,380
so that's what I'm doing, right?

1389
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,522
So instead of going to the console,

1390
00:45:47,522 --> 00:45:49,122
Kiro is parsing the logs for me

1391
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:50,630
and we see that our agents

1392
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,785
successfully parsed the entities,

1393
00:45:52,785 --> 00:45:54,605
and now it's giving me a summary

1394
00:45:54,605 --> 00:45:56,013
of exactly what it found.

1395
00:45:57,373 --> 00:45:58,710
My agent says that

1396
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,120
this damage is consistent,

1397
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,560
it is 90% confident that

1398
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,081
this claim is legitimate,

1399
00:46:03,081 --> 00:46:04,481
and it gave me a reason

1400
00:46:04,481 --> 00:46:06,303
why it thinks it's legitimate.

1401
00:46:09,347 --> 00:46:11,310
I've also instructed this agent

1402
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,470
to write this file to an S3 bucket.

1403
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,760
So that's exactly what it is.

1404
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,230
So it's processed the claim

1405
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,730
and it created a summary for me,

1406
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:18,753
for my end users.

1407
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,747
If I open this file,

1408
00:46:20,747 --> 00:46:22,350
this is the exact same thing

1409
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:25,314
that we saw in the ID, right?

1410
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:27,240
So basically, it says that there's a car

1411
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,087
that had a minor bumper damage.

1412
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:30,920
It is consistent with
the claim description.

1413
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,850
So perfect, everything's fine.

1414
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:36,396
Great, so it can be processed and paid.

1415
00:46:36,396 --> 00:46:37,947
I'm gonna do the same test

1416
00:46:37,947 --> 00:46:40,014
for our "claims 2" now.

1417
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:41,970
We see our "claims 2" was

1418
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:42,810
successfully uploaded.

1419
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:44,746
So same flow, nothing's changed.

1420
00:46:44,746 --> 00:46:47,322
I see that my agents have
finished the processing,

1421
00:46:47,322 --> 00:46:48,738
it extracted the entities,

1422
00:46:48,738 --> 00:46:51,183
and now let's look at the results.

1423
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:57,090
All right, so this claim is fraudulent.

1424
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,260
That's what my agent says.

1425
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,000
And it's 95% confident that

1426
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,140
it is fraudulent.

1427
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,190
Again, I didn't have to hardcore

1428
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,090
any of this thing,

1429
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:04,745
the agents did the reasoning.

1430
00:47:04,745 --> 00:47:06,157
Let's look at "Claim 2"

1431
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,370
and understand why it is fraudulent.

1432
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,420
So I'm just gonna quickly open "Claim 2."

1433
00:47:12,945 --> 00:47:14,545
If I look at my claim form,

1434
00:47:14,545 --> 00:47:17,040
it's a form that states that this car had

1435
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,570
a minor front bumper scratch

1436
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,382
in a grocery store parking lot.

1437
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:21,600
There's some more description

1438
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,704
about the scratch itself.

1439
00:47:22,704 --> 00:47:25,396
The scratch is about three inches long,

1440
00:47:25,396 --> 00:47:28,321
and so on and so forth.

1441
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:31,743
Now, if I look at the image of this claim,

1442
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:35,820
do you guys think this is a scratch?

1443
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,660
Probably not.

1444
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,830
By the way, no cars were harmed

1445
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:38,663
in creating this demo.

1446
00:47:38,663 --> 00:47:40,320
This is all AI-generated.

1447
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,153
This would've been

1448
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:42,395
a very expensive demo otherwise.

1449
00:47:42,395 --> 00:47:43,893
Awesome, so remember,

1450
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:45,870
I recreated DynamoDB table.

1451
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:47,405
So one of my agents

1452
00:47:47,405 --> 00:47:50,010
also ingested meaningful entities.

1453
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,744
Again, it knew exactly what to ingest

1454
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,329
into a DynamoDB table.

1455
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,230
So very consistent what we saw,

1456
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,310
we have two claims.

1457
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,748
One has a consistent damage,

1458
00:47:57,748 --> 00:48:00,198
which is labeled as true,

1459
00:48:00,198 --> 00:48:01,779
and the others as false.

1460
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:03,540
All the entities that were extracted

1461
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,620
by a claim form

1462
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,643
and other metadata.

1463
00:48:07,647 --> 00:48:09,569
Now, all of this is great,

1464
00:48:09,569 --> 00:48:11,310
but we want to make this data accessible

1465
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,027
to human users in a simple way.

1466
00:48:13,027 --> 00:48:14,878
Your human users are business users.

1467
00:48:14,878 --> 00:48:16,312
They're not gonna log into Kiro

1468
00:48:16,312 --> 00:48:17,790
and check out this data,

1469
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:18,870
and they're probably not gonna log

1470
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:20,280
into the (indistinct) console.

1471
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,949
So this is where we are gonna be deploying

1472
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:23,430
the web app's functionality.

1473
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,200
So I just did the same thing.

1474
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,752
I created web apps using Terraform,

1475
00:48:26,752 --> 00:48:29,193
and we see that the web
app has been created.

1476
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:33,000
I'm gonna log into the web app using

1477
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,318
its access point,

1478
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:36,568
and I'm gonna use the two identities

1479
00:48:36,568 --> 00:48:37,950
that I created in the beginning

1480
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,120
of the presentation,

1481
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,440
which were my claim reviewers

1482
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,047
and my claim admins.

1483
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:43,631
For my claim reviewers,

1484
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:45,783
I've given them read-only access.

1485
00:48:45,783 --> 00:48:48,252
And let's see if they have indeed

1486
00:48:48,252 --> 00:48:51,363
what I define in infrastructure-as-code.

1487
00:48:55,848 --> 00:48:57,660
As we see that our claims reviewer

1488
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,400
only have access to read these files,

1489
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,420
so our processed claims

1490
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,380
and submitted claims,

1491
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,092
again very consistent with what we saw,

1492
00:49:03,092 --> 00:49:04,940
we see that our two claims

1493
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,474
from our S3 bucket.

1494
00:49:06,474 --> 00:49:07,850
And just to double check,

1495
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,601
I can download this claim

1496
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:12,124
and this is exactly what we saw.

1497
00:49:12,124 --> 00:49:14,040
But instead of going with the console,

1498
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,075
typing SFTP commands,

1499
00:49:15,075 --> 00:49:17,220
this offers a very simple interface

1500
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,243
for our end users.

1501
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:21,210
I also wanna test the same thing

1502
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,822
for our claims admins.

1503
00:49:22,822 --> 00:49:24,641
And for the claim admins,

1504
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:26,310
I've given them rewrite access

1505
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:27,150
to the entire bucket.

1506
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,190
So they should ideally see,

1507
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:29,423
if everything's working as designed,

1508
00:49:29,423 --> 00:49:30,930
a little more than what we saw

1509
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:32,130
for our claim reviewers.

1510
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:39,923
Perfect.

1511
00:49:39,923 --> 00:49:41,070
So they see the entire bucket,

1512
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:42,030
they have rewrite access.

1513
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,750
This is working as designed.

1514
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,143
We see all the prefixes

1515
00:49:45,143 --> 00:49:46,550
that were in the bucket.

1516
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:47,880
And just to test that

1517
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,780
they have rewrite access,

1518
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:49,770
I'm actually gonna delete

1519
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:50,603
this claim file.

1520
00:49:53,844 --> 00:49:55,620
Perfect, so if I do a refresh,

1521
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,640
I see that there are no files.

1522
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,186
So again, this is working as designed.

1523
00:49:59,186 --> 00:50:00,891
Now, many of you may have

1524
00:50:00,891 --> 00:50:02,360
some questions about agents,

1525
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,020
so I just wanna maybe double click on

1526
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,865
how I've created these agents.

1527
00:50:05,865 --> 00:50:08,070
So AgentCore is the foundation over here

1528
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,934
that's orchestrating all of our agents,

1529
00:50:09,934 --> 00:50:11,220
and I've built all of

1530
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,133
these agents using STRANDS.

1531
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:14,853
Anybody familiar with the STRANDS?

1532
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:16,913
Okay, some of you are.

1533
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:18,630
So STRANDS, for those
who are not familiar,

1534
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:19,567
it's an open source SDK

1535
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:20,832
that we built,

1536
00:50:20,832 --> 00:50:22,043
built by AWS,

1537
00:50:22,043 --> 00:50:24,450
that really allows you to create agents

1538
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:26,050
in a very easy and flexible way.

1539
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,050
Fun fact is that although

1540
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,340
these agents that I built,

1541
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,480
they were created in five minutes

1542
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,860
or less using Kiro CLI,

1543
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,191
so lots of prompting.

1544
00:50:33,191 --> 00:50:35,220
Yeah, and I would just wanna walk you

1545
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,450
through what these agents are doing

1546
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,283
at a high level.

1547
00:50:37,283 --> 00:50:39,210
So we have our entity detection agent,

1548
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,440
and I've actually asked it

1549
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,970
to detect entities

1550
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:42,900
and extract entities

1551
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:43,957
from my PDS.

1552
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,990
I have my validation agent,

1553
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,747
that has a multimodal

1554
00:50:47,747 --> 00:50:50,160
that is able to extract entities

1555
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:50,993
and read the text,

1556
00:50:50,993 --> 00:50:52,290
and also compare it with my image.

1557
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,123
So this is what's doing

1558
00:50:53,123 --> 00:50:54,143
the fraud detection, right?

1559
00:50:54,143 --> 00:50:55,680
And this is what kind of gave

1560
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,300
the score that it's 90% confident,

1561
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,457
or it's the validation agent's product.

1562
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:01,740
Our summarization agent is creating

1563
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,150
a meaningful summary that we all saw

1564
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,020
in our S3 bucket

1565
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,370
and also through web apps.

1566
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:07,559
And our database agent ingested

1567
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:08,700
all these records

1568
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,034
into a DynamoDB table.

1569
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:12,420
Now, the brain behind all of this is

1570
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,725
our supervisor agent.

1571
00:51:13,725 --> 00:51:15,775
Remember the prompt that we saw earlier?

1572
00:51:15,775 --> 00:51:16,950
You guys remember?

1573
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:18,840
So the prompt was for my supervisor agent

1574
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,114
to decide which agent...

1575
00:51:20,114 --> 00:51:23,005
Which subagent to invoke at what time.

1576
00:51:23,005 --> 00:51:24,930
So the patent...

1577
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,130
The reason why I'm showing this is

1578
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,660
because this pattern is not

1579
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,160
only applicable to insurance,

1580
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,060
but it can be applied to

1581
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,740
any industries, any use case.

1582
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,676
So whether you're in payments,

1583
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:34,228
whether you're in hospitality,

1584
00:51:34,228 --> 00:51:35,674
whether you're in healthcare,

1585
00:51:35,674 --> 00:51:37,860
this kind of shows you how you can take

1586
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,051
a file processing workflow,

1587
00:51:39,051 --> 00:51:41,000
use agentic AI to transform

1588
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,016
your file processing workflows,

1589
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:45,603
add intelligence to it
by using agentic AI.

1590
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:48,809
Now, before I wrap up,

1591
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:50,190
I wanna emphasize that

1592
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,537
what you saw isn't just a demo.

1593
00:51:51,537 --> 00:51:53,910
Everything that we built is powered

1594
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,692
by our Terraform Transfer Family module.

1595
00:51:55,692 --> 00:51:57,510
I have given the QR code over here,

1596
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:58,590
so if you wanna grab it,

1597
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,085
please feel free to do so.

1598
00:52:00,085 --> 00:52:02,730
Today, we saw that we deployed

1599
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:03,810
a Transfer Family server,

1600
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,735
we deployed custom IdP support with it.

1601
00:52:05,735 --> 00:52:07,950
I set up malware protection,

1602
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,364
agentic AI, web apps.

1603
00:52:09,364 --> 00:52:10,620
And this is just one

1604
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:11,862
of many examples that we have

1605
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:14,250
in our Terraform Transfer Family module.

1606
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,210
They're all built around

1607
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:16,140
real world use cases

1608
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,973
that you can deploy

1609
00:52:16,973 --> 00:52:17,870
and use right away.

1610
00:52:18,738 --> 00:52:20,362
We launched this module

1611
00:52:20,362 --> 00:52:21,930
only a couple of months ago,

1612
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:22,763
and we've already had

1613
00:52:22,763 --> 00:52:24,390
over 10,000 downloads.

1614
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:25,290
And I just wanna call out

1615
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:27,150
and thank the amazing solution architects

1616
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:28,110
that have been contributing

1617
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,010
to this module,

1618
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,420
but also external contributors

1619
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,253
such as you.

1620
00:52:31,253 --> 00:52:32,086
We've actually had a lot

1621
00:52:32,086 --> 00:52:33,000
of external contributions.

1622
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,500
So if you are there in the room,

1623
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,431
awesome, thank you.

1624
00:52:35,431 --> 00:52:37,807
We do maintain a public roadmap,

1625
00:52:37,807 --> 00:52:39,736
so if you like what we're working on,

1626
00:52:39,736 --> 00:52:41,550
please do a plus one on that

1627
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:42,879
so we know where to focus on.

1628
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,282
But if you think there is

1629
00:52:44,282 --> 00:52:45,471
anything that's missing,

1630
00:52:45,471 --> 00:52:46,911
please do create a GitHub issue.

1631
00:52:46,911 --> 00:52:48,090
My team and I,

1632
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,860
we review these feature requests daily

1633
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,360
and I'm like actually super excited

1634
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,193
to see which

1635
00:52:52,193 --> 00:52:53,556
you will build using these modules.

1636
00:52:53,556 --> 00:52:54,720
So with that,

1637
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,890
I'm gonna pass it on to Suh.

1638
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:56,723
Thank you.

1639
00:52:59,372 --> 00:53:02,622
(audience applauding)

1640
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:05,813
- Awesome.

1641
00:53:05,813 --> 00:53:06,717
Great demo, Prabir,

1642
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:08,100
and so excited that this is

1643
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,030
all supporting Terraform,

1644
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,500
so I can do it later.

1645
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,520
So for this,

1646
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,510
we're just gonna wrap it up

1647
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,680
with a few resources

1648
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,510
and next steps for you all.

1649
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:16,950
So hopefully, from this session,

1650
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,469
you are able to take away

1651
00:53:18,469 --> 00:53:21,330
how simple it is to create a secure

1652
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:25,140
and modern MFT system
using Transfer Family B2Bi.

1653
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,760
And like Prabir's demo showed,

1654
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,260
you're able to see how

1655
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,420
you can unlock innovations using agents

1656
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,133
with Transfer Family as well.

1657
00:53:33,075 --> 00:53:34,284
As for availability,

1658
00:53:34,284 --> 00:53:35,550
here are all the regions

1659
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,965
that Transfer Family
is available in today.

1660
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,893
All recent regions are
highlighted in pink.

1661
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:43,768
At re:Invent, if you want to learn

1662
00:53:43,768 --> 00:53:45,333
more about Transfer Family,

1663
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:47,413
and even rebuild what Prabir

1664
00:53:47,413 --> 00:53:48,630
just showed you,

1665
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,130
here are some sessions for you

1666
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,393
to check out as well.

1667
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:55,996
And finally, here are some resources

1668
00:53:55,996 --> 00:53:57,911
with QR codes for you all

1669
00:53:57,911 --> 00:53:59,945
to save for later.

1670
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,545
So we have our user guide,

1671
00:54:01,545 --> 00:54:04,904
where you can see end-to-end
tutorials, guidance.

1672
00:54:04,904 --> 00:54:06,690
Here's our website

1673
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:07,523
where you can learn more

1674
00:54:07,523 --> 00:54:08,940
about our different offerings.

1675
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,500
And most exciting to me is

1676
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,600
a self-paced workshop that's hands-on,

1677
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,913
so you can get your hands dirty

1678
00:54:14,913 --> 00:54:17,820
and build event-driven MFT workflows

1679
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,653
for yourself.

1680
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,120
With that, thank you so much,

1681
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,230
and please reach out to

1682
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,640
your account teams to connect to us.

1683
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,200
We're looking forward to talking

1684
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,310
more with you.

1685
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:29,783
Thanks.
