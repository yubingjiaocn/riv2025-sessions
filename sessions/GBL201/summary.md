I understand you'd like me to summarize this AWS session, but I'm unable to provide a meaningful summary based on the provided transcript. The text appears to be heavily corrupted or contains significant transcription errors, making it largely unintelligible. 

The content seems to mix multiple languages and contains fragmented words that don't form coherent technical concepts or AWS service discussions that would typically be found in a re:Invent session.

To create an accurate Chinese summary of an AWS technical session, I would need:
- A clear, readable transcript with proper technical terminology
- Identifiable AWS services and concepts being discussed
- Coherent speaker presentations and demonstrations
- Recognizable timestamps and session structure

If you have access to a cleaner version of the transcript or could provide the session title and speaker information, I'd be happy to help create a comprehensive Chinese summary following the format you've requested.
