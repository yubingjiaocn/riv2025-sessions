1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,773
- Good afternoon.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,579
Come on guys, good afternoon.

3
00:00:04,579 --> 00:00:05,412
- [Audience] Good afternoon.

4
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:08,548
- Yeah, very happy to be
here with my good friend,

5
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:10,317
Nitesh Ambastha.

6
00:00:10,317 --> 00:00:11,550
And we are going to be talking

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,550
about modernizing wealth
management using cloud and AI.

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,040
Now, wealth management is
a very interesting space

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,640
within financial services,
highly profitable,

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,160
but from a technology perspective,

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,190
I think it's fair to say,
has been a bit of a laggard.

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,680
And that's, I think, an opportunity

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,560
because with all the
changes happening with cloud

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,640
and now AI, there is a real
opportunity to leapfrog

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,120
and what better, who better
to talk about it than Nitesh?

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,420
Nitesh is a industry leader,

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,420
senior leader at LPL Financial

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,280
and I know that he is,

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,560
this is something he's
very passionate about.

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,900
So Nitesh, we'll do it in three parts.

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,223
- Okay.
- So,

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,640
see, it's about strategy to
execution, it's about impact.

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,070
So we'll cover the spectrum.

24
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,980
We'll start with maybe laying out

25
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,840
what is the opportunity here.

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,310
- Yeah
- We'll start with that.

27
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,620
We'll then get to the but part of it,

28
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,440
you know, so, you know, that
what are some of the challenges

29
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,090
and then we'll get to to solutions,

30
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,098
all in the next 15 minutes.

31
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:17,996
- Awesome.
- Okay?

32
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:18,900
- Yeah, let's go for it.
- Without further ado,

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,910
let's start with the opportunity.

34
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,350
The hero of the story for wealth
managers are our advisors.

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,750
- Yeah.
- And everybody is trying

36
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,900
to make the experience
better for advisors.

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,873
There has been this promise
about advisor personalization,

38
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,840
not fully delivered,

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,650
but with AI, how do you
see this playing out?

40
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,610
You know, how could you know
AI transform the experience

41
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,670
and the proposition for advisors?

42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,260
- Yeah, thank you.
Thanks for that question.

43
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,840
I think all of us are trying
to figure that one out.

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,150
You know, personalization is very easy

45
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,500
if you have only one client

46
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,980
and if they don't change their mind ever,

47
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,390
then it's super easy.

48
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,050
But the hard part with
personalization has been

49
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,070
that it's an ecosystem, it's a system.

50
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,560
It's not a feature or a product, right?

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,490
It's a system.

52
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,380
And systems are messy.

53
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,090
And the reason systems are messy is

54
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,320
because clients are messy
and not in a humorous way.

55
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,760
- And Nitesh is a client of mine.

56
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,690
- Yes.

57
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,373
So you know that from experience,

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,600
I made everybody wait while I
was running through the expo.

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
So yeah, clients are messy,
they change their mind,

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,940
they have their preferences
changing and so on.

61
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,880
And so personalization
has been a challenge

62
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,890
and it continues to be a challenge.

63
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,400
The part about personalization
has always been

64
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,590
that let's say you are an advisor

65
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,540
and all these are your clients.

66
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,580
If you try to personalize it for everyone,

67
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,170
let's say you do it,

68
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,710
everyone will have unique demands off you.

69
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,860
And that is hard for an
advisor to keep up with.

70
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,090
And so where AI comes in is
it takes the heavy lifting

71
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,530
from advisor's plate.

72
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,010
Today, I think advisors spend 60 to 70%

73
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,840
of their time preparing for
meetings, collecting documents,

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,160
and lot of stuff

75
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,190
that they are not spending
time with clients.

76
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,880
And so that 60, 70% is
your attack space with AI.

77
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,650
If you can get to that

78
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,340
and then advisors can focus
their time with customers

79
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,010
and they can use their
relationships better,

80
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,600
that's the holy grail.

81
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,210
And so we'll see how
far we can get to that.

82
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,060
But I think AI has all those promises.

83
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,350
With agentic AI, we can
automate a lot of that work

84
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,260
that advisors are doing manually today

85
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,060
or they have to spend their time doing.

86
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,790
- So that's very exciting
that AI can take, you know,

87
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,650
do a lot of the heavy lifting, you know,

88
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,000
behind personalization.

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,720
Now let's get to the big,
the bigger picture that,

90
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,660
what does that imply from a
business model perspective

91
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,780
and maybe even putting the
LPL hat on that, you know,

92
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,790
where you play in the value chain

93
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,860
and you know, everybody's trying to,

94
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,510
you know, in wealth management, you know,

95
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,780
trying to be this financial
kind of supermarket.

96
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,110
So how could AI be bit of a disruptor

97
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,490
and maybe help you leapfrog?

98
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,230
Is that a possibility?

99
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,650
- Yeah, definitely for
LPL, it's a possibility.

100
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,160
Like we were not advanced
in a lot of products

101
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,620
and feature capabilities like warehouses.

102
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,130
And LPL having 30,000 advisors

103
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,050
affecting the financial wellbeing

104
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,060
of about 8 million clients,

105
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,123
can definitely be that
marketplace ecosystem.

106
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,480
And you mentioned the word leapfrog.

107
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,590
We do have that opportunity.

108
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,470
We don't have to go
through traditional models

109
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,960
of building a banking lending product

110
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,680
or traditional ways of
creating sec lending desk.

111
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,857
You can go straight to
agentic and AI based model.

112
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,950
You can skip a generation, as LPL,

113
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,100
go straight to those opportunities that,

114
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,290
let's say existing players
will take a long time

115
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,180
to change their model.

116
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,013
We don't have anything,

117
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:04,590
so we can go straight to
the target segment there.

118
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,220
So that's an opportunity segment,
opportunity space for us.

119
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,723
How does that translate is,

120
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,610
you know, we have our own
margin expansion targets

121
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,170
and you and me were talking about

122
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,210
like boards are excited about it,

123
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,760
all the management teams
is excited about it.

124
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,970
So the trick is to really
figure out those use cases.

125
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,980
You can't stop the hype, right?

126
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,650
If you try to fight the
hype curve, you will lose.

127
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,440
So you have to pick and choose those areas

128
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,990
where you can actually make a difference.

129
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,560
AI clearly is very good
at natural language text,

130
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,390
all of that use cases.

131
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,940
And so you would want
to deploy it there first

132
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,330
and get some value and
then it becomes a flywheel.

133
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,770
And so that's kind of the direction

134
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,120
of travel we are after with AI at LPL.

135
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,600
We definitely believe that
we can leapfrog a generation

136
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,060
and come, close the gap with warehouses

137
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,060
in terms of capabilities
and features much faster.

138
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,200
- So that's very exciting.

139
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,900
And you know, you talked
about customer experience,

140
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,430
you talked about business model

141
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,070
and that eventually
implies revenue and growth.

142
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,530
Let's talk about the
third big business KPI

143
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,450
which is cost, cost to serve.

144
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,283
- Yeah.

145
00:06:13,283 --> 00:06:15,030
- And you did mention
margin, you know, earlier

146
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,100
that cost to serve has
also been a bit sticky

147
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,610
in this industry.

148
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,040
So how do you see AI really making a

149
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,347
difference to the cost to serve?

150
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:28,560
- No, that's actually an opportunity area

151
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,420
where we can attack first.

152
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,350
And cost to serve has been
on our radar for a while

153
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,550
and we have tried to
make incremental progress

154
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,700
in that space.

155
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,880
But what is now possible is you can look

156
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,600
at those end-to-end workflow
steps in the cost to serve.

157
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,760
Like whether it is
account opening workflows

158
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,940
or commission processing workflows
or simple money movement,

159
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,100
how fast you can do those things.

160
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,830
Today, there are a lot of exception cases

161
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,270
or even supervision use cases.

162
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,690
There are so many human beings involved

163
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,990
in an account opening, account
transfer kind of use cases.

164
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,260
And those are ripe areas
where you can say, okay,

165
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,710
we can look at this as a
completely inside out approach

166
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,620
instead of incrementally
making those workflows better,

167
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,740
right? You don't have to do
the typical workflow systems

168
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,650
like our favorite workflow
products from the past.

169
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,483
- Right.

170
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:23,310
- And say, hey, let's look at
this completely differently.

171
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,460
And until I saw a demo of this live,

172
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,220
I couldn't believe where an advisor

173
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,460
or end user is trying to chat
to create an account opening

174
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,580
or KYC AML kind of use case.

175
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,610
And on the side you can see
what the agents are doing

176
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,300
and that experience is fully
personalized to that advisor.

177
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,300
So each advisor office
can do this differently

178
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,280
and they have a very
personalized experience

179
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,430
on how they open accounts,
how they deal with clients

180
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,030
and all, how they lift
that margin up for them.

181
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,570
And that results into us
having a significant boost

182
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,310
in our margin targets.

183
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,900
And so that's the first area

184
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,210
in 2026 we are going to go after,

185
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,150
which is starting with the
operational transformation area

186
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,290
and then learn from that

187
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,030
and go after other business clients.

188
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,813
- And it's fascinating that,

189
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:12,300
you know, as you're
talking about operations,

190
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,890
that this is not just about cost,

191
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,900
but this is also about personalization

192
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,580
and improving the customer experience.

193
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,680
So fascinating set of possibilities,

194
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,490
almost feels like being
a child in a toy shop,

195
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,990
there is so much you can do.
- Yeah.

196
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,580
- But there's also a reality check

197
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,050
that I think it's fair to say, Nitesh

198
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,571
and I know that you're very aware of it,

199
00:08:30,571 --> 00:08:33,240
that there is a chasm between
the promise and the reality.

200
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,073
- Yeah.

201
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:35,310
- So what are some of
the challenges that you

202
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,280
and your teams are seeing
in terms of implementing AI

203
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,170
and cloud and realizing this vision?

204
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,480
- Yeah, like there are a
couple of stats I'll give you.

205
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,900
One is the number of AI use cases truly

206
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,800
in production according to
McKinsey survey was about 6, 7%.

207
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,870
So we should be aware of that.

208
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,580
The second stat is getting
to a 60 to 70% accurate model

209
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,680
and result is very fast.

210
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,570
But from there, trying to get
to 80%, 90% is extremely hard.

211
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,500
And so knowing that it's,
those things are hard,

212
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,600
you solve for, to answer your question,

213
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,430
the difficult problems first,

214
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,740
which is something, you know,
my team keeps reminding me.

215
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,890
I always say solve for the
difficult problems first.

216
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,980
And that is creating a data ecosystem

217
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,080
which is conducive to this, right?

218
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,410
So, at LPL we have been on
this journey of transforming

219
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,140
with your team's help, Incedo team's help,

220
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,520
we have been on this journey, you know,

221
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,920
on transforming from a monolith

222
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,810
to a data product environment

223
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,910
where you can have a modern fabric

224
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,020
and it's event driven where
you can now connect data

225
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,990
that we have on platform
versus off platform data.

226
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,393
And now you can do those use cases faster.

227
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,850
So that is a hard yard
fixing the data ecosystem,

228
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,080
getting it ready, but that's
in itself is not enough.

229
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,340
In a financial services firm,

230
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,170
you have to think about security,

231
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,170
you need to think about
trust in the ecosystem

232
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,600
because our business is all about trust.

233
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,820
Our clients trust our advisors,

234
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,740
and that's how they are in business.

235
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,070
So we are have to be
extremely prepared for trust

236
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,990
and security.

237
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,070
Now, we all know that this
whole technology landscape

238
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,800
is very new, two and a half
years old, three years old.

239
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,010
And so the maturity of
that is not there yet.

240
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,290
So you want to start in an area

241
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,780
where you feel strong, comfortable with

242
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,380
and not like a most important
segment of your business,

243
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,910
you put AI through.

244
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,860
So I would say those two.

245
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,560
And the third one, which is
obvious to all the people here,

246
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,000
is about talent, right?

247
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,130
You have to do a talent transformation.

248
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,980
It's not just, you know,

249
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,740
like I would take an
example of my own team.

250
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,160
I see leaders who are
actually embracing AI

251
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,260
and they're doing it themselves.

252
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,050
Like, and then there are leaders
who are telling their teams

253
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,750
to do it, but they're
not themselves doing it.

254
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,430
And you know, when I self-reflect,

255
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,530
I was one of those second type of leaders.

256
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,420
So I've just enrolled in a course myself

257
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,950
so I can do it myself.

258
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,497
But talent transformation is very good.

259
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:09,678
- And let's double click
on a couple of these.

260
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:12,240
You know, there are three
or four important issues

261
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,010
that you have raised, Nitesh.

262
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,330
Let's talk about data.

263
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,163
- Yeah.

264
00:11:16,163 --> 00:11:17,190
- Because you know, you also talked about,

265
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,260
you know, choosing the right sequence

266
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,580
and data is very tricky

267
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,070
because, you know, data
is, can be like everything

268
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,170
and very hard to kind of work through.

269
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,770
And in your case, you've
had the added complexity

270
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,750
or challenge that you have been kind

271
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,070
of doing a spate of M&As, you
know, at least one every year.

272
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,903
- Yeah.

273
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,560
- And what I've found
very interesting is that,

274
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,760
you have used that,

275
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,860
that has been a challenge
from a data perspective,

276
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,720
but you have used that as an opportunity

277
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,540
to actually upgrade your
kind of data foundation.

278
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,280
So talk us through that a bit,

279
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,770
that how have you approached
this whole data journey?

280
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,240
And especially with this, you know,

281
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,760
the whole focus on inorganic growth?

282
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,950
- Yeah, no, I think
that has helped us a lot

283
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,890
because many places when firms try

284
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,080
to upgrade their data ecosystem,

285
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,710
the challenge is your main
business runs on legacy

286
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,390
and now you want to build something

287
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,490
or transform through something new.

288
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,680
But how do you, you know,

289
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,190
motivate or change that
much of current ecosystem,

290
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,740
that applications, advisor, workstation,

291
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,140
all of that to go to the new platform?

292
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,510
So we use M&A as an opportunity,

293
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,430
think of it as a beachhead approach.

294
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,840
So when we were integrating

295
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,730
with our largest client till date,

296
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,230
Credential Financial,

297
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,540
we introduced a new broker dealer concept,

298
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,160
introducing broker dealer.

299
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,810
And that didn't exist at LPL.

300
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,710
So we got that as an opportunity
to put that data flow,

301
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,500
all the ecosystem around
credential integration

302
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,160
onto data foundation,
which is the new AWS based,

303
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,550
cloud-based modernized
platform that we are building.

304
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,950
And then as we did the next M&A

305
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,340
which is, you know, we
acquired Atria Wealth,

306
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,700
we put all the TAMP flows,
which are new to LPL,

307
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,240
what we used to do was
very small tiny footprint,

308
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,260
whereas Atria got us an
opportunity where it was all TAMPs.

309
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,940
And so we took all that flow

310
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,620
and put that on data foundation.

311
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,100
But we didn't, so we
continue that journey in 2026

312
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,275
where we have announced the acquisition

313
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:15,990
of Commonwealth Financial
and Commonwealth,

314
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,600
we are going to do the big piece now

315
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,840
where all of our custody
data will be moving

316
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,890
on to data foundation.

317
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,950
So this is the real big milestone.

318
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,060
So we've used those opportunities
to transform our journey.

319
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,980
It does comes with the complexity

320
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,690
of keeping the two systems,
two sets of ecosystem in sync.

321
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,690
That's where your teams come
in and help us from Incedo.

322
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,710
So thanks for your partnership
there, but it's complex.

323
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,720
That's the hardier you need to do

324
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,790
before we could be ready
for the AI journey.

325
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,010
But we are very glad that we did all

326
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,390
that work over the last two, three years.

327
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,790
So we are ready for the next phase.

328
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,590
- You know, I wanna go
back to the point you made

329
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,000
about sequence.

330
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,380
I think that's a very important thing

331
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,880
that how do you skin the cat?

332
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,590
So share some tips with us

333
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,280
that how do you choose the
right things to do, you know,

334
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,060
what may seem like the biggest
may not be what you focus on.

335
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,711
I know that that's something
you think a lot about.

336
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,544
- Yeah.

337
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:13,690
- So give us some tips around that.

338
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,000
- I think, you know, that's
the, if I have to give one tip,

339
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,740
it is really the sequencing.

340
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,300
It's not so much about can you come up

341
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,490
with the best architecture, right?

342
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,210
Or what's the best
architecture for agentic AI

343
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,690
and, you know, what technology
tool products we should buy,

344
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,550
that's not going to get you there.

345
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,940
It's really doing things
in the right sequence.

346
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,700
And the fundamental part,
or the most important thing

347
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,770
for us from a sequencing perspective

348
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,040
that we have learned is the
journey to data foundation

349
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,660
and journey to cloud.

350
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,050
Without those ingredients,
you cannot even start.

351
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,700
And so since we have done,

352
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,300
or we on our journey to
get those two things done,

353
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,530
now comes the, how do you
democratize access to data

354
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,020
and AI tools to a broader ecosystem.

355
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,860
So right now, while we are
experimenting with use cases,

356
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,450
the thing that we are trying to solve for

357
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,910
is how our business lines get engaged,

358
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,770
how the product teams get engaged,

359
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,970
how is it democratized for
everyone to start working with AI

360
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,350
at a pace.

361
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,810
Otherwise they, if all of
them wait for technology

362
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,940
and product to give them tools,

363
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,710
then we'll be behind the game.

364
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,470
So that's the next one that,
which is learning journey

365
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,970
for the organization

366
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,580
and building that momentum,
which is what we are up.

367
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,380
And the third thing, which
I said is the security

368
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,460
and the trust in the solution we've built.

369
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,590
That, those three things in the sequence

370
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,180
and then you can go after,

371
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,490
you know, what is the
best technology out there

372
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,988
and what should we, whom
should we partner with?

373
00:15:43,988 --> 00:15:47,190
- I, on the clock here, I'll
come to my last question,

374
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,240
which is about talent.

375
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,800
You know, in the AI age,

376
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,190
paradoxically the human
aspect becomes more important.

377
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,230
So finally, people, talent.

378
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,063
- Yeah.

379
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:57,960
- You know, what are
your top three kind of,

380
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,790
you know, mantras or, you know,

381
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,500
what are, what is the different

382
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,450
that you're expecting from your teams?

383
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,460
I know a lot of your
teammates are sitting here,

384
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,930
so very important for them.

385
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,310
- Yeah. I think, you know,

386
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,430
anecdotally what I heard is
we are the last generation

387
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,650
who are managing only human beings.

388
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,060
After this,

389
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,460
our next generations will
be managing human beings

390
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,540
and AI agents.

391
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,173
I don't know if it'll be true,
but that's the promised land.

392
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:28,070
I think it's not something
magical is what I would say,

393
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,580
but it's something you embrace, right?

394
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,110
It's no longer like, okay,

395
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,150
can I stay on the sidelines approach?

396
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,310
So it's happening and as I said,

397
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,290
I'm taking it on myself to learn.

398
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,750
Some of my team members
are already experimenting

399
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,760
and doing the coding themselves.

400
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,590
And it's become so easy
that you don't have

401
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,240
to be a programmer anymore.

402
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,300
So I think it's about everyone trying

403
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,970
to do it themselves is the mantra.

404
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,250
And you know, the hiring
will change in future more

405
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,610
towards ML engineering
will become the main thing

406
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,950
as opposed to software
engineering or Python

407
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,190
or what used to be, you
know, full stack engineer.

408
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,350
So the twist will be more towards,

409
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,760
like all our hirings will shift

410
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,443
towards ML engineering skillset.

411
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,640
- Amazing. I have a, you
know, we are at time,

412
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,870
Gautam is looking at me.

413
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,000
So, Nitesh Ambastha, thank you so much.

414
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,991
- Well thank you.

415
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:16,824
- You know, 18 minutes.

416
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:19,110
We managed to cover the entire value chain

417
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,290
of modernizing wealth
management with cloud and AI.

418
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,640
You know, appreciate your insights

419
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,440
and thank you to all the audience.

420
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,750
Thank you also to AWS

421
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,680
to bring us together here. Thank you.

422
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,513
- Thank you.
