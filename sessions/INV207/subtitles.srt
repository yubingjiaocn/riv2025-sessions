1
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:06,420
Please welcome to the stage,

2
00:00:06,659 --> 00:00:09,300
vice president of Amazon EC2

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,699
core platform at AWS

4
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:12,920
Willem Viser.

5
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:23,809
Hello everyone.

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,389
Good to see all of you here.

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:26,790
Um,

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,540
What an exciting time to be in our industry.

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:32,950
I,

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,549
uh,

11
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:35,889
I have the privilege of leading

12
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:36,790
EC2.

13
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:38,720
And uh

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,299
I spend a lot of time with customers every day.

15
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:47,270
And a lot of those customer conversations are actually about

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,330
what features they're looking for.

17
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,990
And I then actually also get to experience

18
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,110
my team

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,590
looking at those features

20
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,590
and deciding

21
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:57,990
how we develop that.

22
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:01,150
So we're living and competing in a world today where

23
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:02,459
technology

24
00:01:02,849 --> 00:01:05,690
is advancing faster than strategy can keep up.

25
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:07,739
Artificial intelligence,

26
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:09,110
automation,

27
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,870
real-time analytics,

28
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,330
these are all no longer future concepts.

29
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:17,529
They are driving measurable results today.

30
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:21,849
And what's key here is that organizations that move first,

31
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:23,750
adapt faster.

32
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:25,900
And make data-driven decisions,

33
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:28,160
those are the ones that's gonna win markets

34
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,099
and those are the ones that are gonna rewrite industries.

35
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,260
And this is more than just a technological shift.

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,160
It's a business revolution.

37
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,440
And success belongs to those who can turn innovation

38
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,080
into execution

39
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,620
at speed and scale.

40
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,089
And today I want to share how AWSS Compute continues to transform what's possible

41
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,510
in cloud computing.

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,470
How we develop and apply technology to solve what were previously considered

43
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,989
impossible problems.

44
00:01:58,099 --> 00:01:58,620
As I've said,

45
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,860
I have the privilege of leading Amazon

46
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:01,809
EC2,

47
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:03,639
and I get to see this every day.

48
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:08,619
And every innovation that I'll share today stems from similar customer journeys.

49
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:10,240
Real challenges

50
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,119
that demanded delivering

51
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,320
new solutions.

52
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,449
So,

53
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,889
I wanna start by talking about scale.

54
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:21,169
Scale creates possibilities.

55
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,509
Our customers every day

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,190
launch more than 271 million instances on EC2.

57
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,210
And so kind of like if you do the math that

58
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,190
gets you to just over 1 billion instances every week.

59
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,110
Um,

60
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:37,169
and since 2006,

61
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:41,570
we've launched 287 billion instances on EC2,

62
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:43,169
which is a staggering number.

63
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,229
And so with 38 regions globally and over 1000 instance

64
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,520
types to pick from for every kind of workload,

65
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:53,889
we're delivering compute capabilities

66
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,759
from cloud to edge.

67
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:57,350
And what does this mean for you?

68
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:00,979
You can launch global applications within minutes

69
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,699
instead of months.

70
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,240
Our managed services automatically pick the right resource for you

71
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,539
while our global

72
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,419
presence lets you deploy as close as possible to your customers.

73
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,520
And you can run anything from microservices

74
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,389
up to massive AI models.

75
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:17,250
We love them all.

76
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,399
Operating at this scale gives us unique insights into your challenges,

77
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:26,240
all while continually optimizing our own infrastructure

78
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,339
across compute

79
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:28,759
and networking

80
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,720
and storage.

81
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:35,970
So every layer of our stack represents countless conversations with customers

82
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:39,250
who've pushed us to think differently about computes.

83
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:41,679
Innovation requires partnership

84
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:43,699
and collaboration at every layer

85
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:45,600
from silicon to software,

86
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:47,119
and we're gonna go into each of those

87
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,600
in this presentation.

88
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:51,800
But that brings me perhaps to the most important

89
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:53,380
lesson we've learned of them all.

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,100
It's not just about building a future.

91
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,889
It's about building building blocks.

92
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,210
Building things that millions of customers can actually build on top of.

93
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,720
So as promised earlier,

94
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,500
I wanna share remarkable customer stories today.

95
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:14,369
And if you can't tell from that image already,

96
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:17,230
the first customer story is very close to my heart.

97
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,048
It's Zou's.

98
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,928
Now these cars,

99
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:23,359
you might have seen them zooming around the strip already.

100
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,838
You can download the app

101
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:26,519
and you can take a ride in them.

102
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,679
And so in October,

103
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,779
I actually had the opportunity to go and ride in one of these.

104
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,260
And so the car

105
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,700
really,
really is pretty cool.

106
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,630
There's,
there's,

107
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,149
there's a lot of innovation in the design of the car itself.

108
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,959
The way that you sit is different.

109
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,239
You actually face each other.

110
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:43,309
It's like little train compartments,

111
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,220
lots of space,

112
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,480
and the ride is just absolutely incredible.

113
00:04:46,549 --> 00:04:48,890
It's just different than anything else in the market,

114
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,600
and I loved it.

115
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:50,959
But

116
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,369
what's fascinating is not just the physical design.

117
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,269
What's fascinating,

118
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,779
of course,

119
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:55,309
for us,

120
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,089
is the massive data operation

121
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:57,910
behind

122
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,730
these cars.

123
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,660
Zoos operates on a unique rhythm.

124
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,059
During the week,

125
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:04,859
their instruments and vehicles.

126
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,279
Gather lots and lots of information,

127
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,959
ta petabytes of information in actual fact.

128
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,029
And then what happens over weekends,

129
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,739
they take the data set of the week

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,220
and they run this through advanced ML models

131
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,149
in massive simulation runs,

132
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,000
the whole week of data.

133
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:21,519
And so this creates an interesting challenge.

134
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:24,829
How do you efficiently manage your compute resources

135
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:28,989
when your needs dramatically swing from that week of gathering information

136
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,989
and then this intense weekend run that you have.

137
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:35,670
And so Xos manages shared infrastructure where application

138
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,390
teams deploy and run the services on EC2.

139
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:41,529
And then when the weekend simulation run comes around

140
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,980
and they require thousands of GPU instances,

141
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:46,829
they leverage AWS ML capacity blocks,

142
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,529
on-demand capacity reservations,

143
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:49,429
and finally,

144
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,170
Sage make a hyperpod

145
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,029
with flexible training plan.

146
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:55,209
So

147
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:58,500
Just a few weeks.

148
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,309
I met with a new bank in Seattle.

149
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,230
This is a company that in 2013

150
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,559
Set out to take on a really big challenge in Brazil.

151
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:15,190
So this was a market at the time in 2013 that was dominated by essentially five banks,

152
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,000
new bank obviously not being one of them.

153
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,079
And so their mission seemed impossible.

154
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,410
Build a digital bank first

155
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,029
in this market dominated by these 5 banks

156
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:28,890
and specifically in this market where financial literacy was low

157
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:30,630
and millions were unbanked.

158
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:32,149
Today,

159
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,450
massive success story.

160
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:37,429
New Bank serves more than 130 million customers across

161
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,309
Brazil

162
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:39,390
and Mexico

163
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,570
and Colombia.

164
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,029
90% of their work complete workloads run on AWS.

165
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,429
30% of that compute workload runs on Graviton.

166
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,040
So

167
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,750
the fact that they're running Graviton

168
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,989
had them achieve a 14% reduction in cloud costs

169
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,459
and a 21% reduction

170
00:06:58,799 --> 00:06:59,760
in cloud emissions,

171
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,559
the carbon emissions,

172
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,299
apologies.

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,239
New Bank also uses Amazon EKS with Carpenter to run 60% of their EC2 capacity.

174
00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:12,049
With an Amazon itself,

175
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:15,769
we're also tackling seemingly impossible challenges.

176
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:17,410
Amazon Leo

177
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:20,489
aims to deliver worldwide internet access through

178
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,790
over 3000 satellites.

179
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,859
So before launching a single satellite,

180
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,609
their simulations

181
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,869
include entire constellations

182
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,410
using easy to graviton instances

183
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,510
and using FPGA enabled F2 instances.

184
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:39,700
These simulations model satellites moving at

185
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,570
over 17,000

186
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,720
MPH

187
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,679
while dodging space debris.

188
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,140
And at the same time,

189
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,730
Requiring complex communications all the while ensuring reliable

190
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:52,929
internet

191
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,630
service delivery.

192
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,019
And consider

193
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,119
Intercom's journey into revolutionary customer service.

194
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:04,260
Intercom served over 25,000 global customers,

195
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,220
and they've developed Fin.

196
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,480
Their AI agent which has transformed the customer service landscape.

197
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,880
What once seemed impossible,

198
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:17,420
having an AI handle complex customer queries across multiple channels

199
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,380
with a human-like understanding

200
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,660
is now a reality.

201
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,619
With Finn successfully resolving 67% of customer queries

202
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,700
and doing over a million a week.

203
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,179
Their technical architecture is equally impressive.

204
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,859
They run on AWS Graviton.

205
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,260
You see a little bit of a pattern here,

206
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,739
and they process 50,000 asynchronous jobs per second.

207
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:41,590
Their migration to Graviton 4 for Elastic Search

208
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,890
achieved a 56% latency reduction in search queries

209
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:47,460
while cutting their EC2 costs

210
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,590
by 22%.

211
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,859
Partnerships

212
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:55,049
are an important component to AWS success

213
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,580
because they allow us to accelerate

214
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:58,619
innovation

215
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,500
and quickly deliver the latest computer technologies to our customers.

216
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:03,520
Today,

217
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,299
I want to take you through the journey of our strategic partnerships

218
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,419
that have fundamentally transformed cloud computing.

219
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,900
And I wanna start with

220
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:12,159
our oldest.

221
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,109
Intel

222
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:20,229
has been there since the beginning of AWS

223
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,440
and we still work closely today to solve challenging customer problems.

224
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,789
And let me share a very powerful example of one such interaction.

225
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,450
Mercedes-Benz recently completed an extraordinary migration

226
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,210
of their one ERP system.

227
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:35,700
Basically,

228
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,369
they moved us to SAP Rise on AWS using our U7 INH platform.

229
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:44,299
And this platform we developed with Intel

230
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:48,500
specifically for memory-intensive workloads like SAP Hanna.

231
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,580
And this wasn't a simple migration.

232
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:57,080
We're talking about a 32 terabyte supporting system supporting over 40,000 users

233
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,840
across 17 different systems.

234
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,460
And so what would have seemed impossible before

235
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,599
and what it would have taken multiple years

236
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,940
was accomplished in just 9 months.

237
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,809
So together with Intel,

238
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,409
we've redefined what's possible in cloud computing

239
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:15,710
through innovation,

240
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:19,169
but also very importantly through custom processors.

241
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,159
When we say custom processors at AWS,

242
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,159
we truly mean custom

243
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:27,150
designed specifically for your cloud workloads.

244
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,440
We introduced our latest 8th generation of Amazon

245
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,520
EC2 instances powered by custom Intel Xeon processors,

246
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,059
which delivers

247
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,580
the highest Intel 6 performance,

248
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,299
not just in the cloud,

249
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,280
but anywhere.

250
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:46,070
What does this mean for you?

251
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,219
If you're using the latest Intel Xeon sex-based instances,

252
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,229
you'll see a 15% better price performance,

253
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,010
first of all,

254
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:58,989
and you can process data 2.5 times faster with our enhanced memory throughput.

255
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,359
And for those demanding workloads,

256
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:04,179
you're gonna look at 20% higher performance,

257
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,049
directly adding to your bottom line.

258
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:10,090
These improvements come to life across our new R8I,

259
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:10,929
C8I,

260
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,929
and M8I instance families.

261
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,469
CHI instance families

262
00:11:15,729 --> 00:11:18,890
deliver up to 60% faster engine X performance.

263
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:20,979
R8I instance deliver

264
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,919
industry-leading SAP performance workloads,

265
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,030
and MHI instance deliver

266
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:28,900
accelerated post-stress performance

267
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,590
by up to 30%.

268
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:32,229
Each of these families

269
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,789
offer our standard.

270
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,190
13 different additional sizes,

271
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,530
including bare metal,

272
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:41,669
and 96 X large options for your most demanding applications.

273
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:47,049
We're also expanding our flex instance options.

274
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:48,070
Now,
as a reminder,

275
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,330
these are our instances designed to specifically help customers save money

276
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,570
when their applications do not consistently need all the available CPU resources.

277
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:03,130
Building on the success of our C7 iFlex and M7 iFlex instances,

278
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:09,159
we've now added R8iFlex to join the C8iFlex and M8iFlex family.

279
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:13,989
These instances offer the most common sizes from large to 16X large.

280
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,750
This means whether you're running compute optimized workloads like web servers

281
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,909
and caches and general purpose applications

282
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,619
like microservices and virtual desktops.

283
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,280
Now,

284
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:28,419
memory intensive workloads are added and you can

285
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:31,080
save an additional 5% on your compute cost.

286
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:36,239
Our customers continually ask for more options,

287
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:41,109
and we're now launching a preview of X8I instances

288
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:44,719
powered by custom Intel Xion 6 processors.

289
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:48,130
These instances deliver up to 6 terabytes of memory,

290
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,330
1.5 more capacity,

291
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:54,830
and 3.4 more memory bandwidth compared to our previous generation.

292
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,409
Making them ideal for in-memory databases and mission-critical SAP workloads,

293
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,239
delivering 46% higher SAPS performance.

294
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,469
That's not our only new Intel instance this week.

295
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,820
We're also introducing new C8 INE

296
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:16,200
also powered by Intel Xeon 6 processors

297
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:18,919
and our latest Nitro V6 card.

298
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:24,640
C8 INE instances deliver up to 2.5x higher packet performance per VCPU

299
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,690
and 2 times higher network bandwidth versus C6 IN instances,

300
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,869
making them ideal for security appliances and firewalls.

301
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,330
Our partnership with AMD

302
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,010
represents another breakthrough in cloud computing.

303
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:46,440
AWS was the first major cloud provider to launch AMD Epic instances,

304
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,440
and since that introduction in 2018,

305
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,859
we've launched every generation of their processors.

306
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,330
Earlier this year,

307
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,090
we introduced the fifth-gen AMD Epic processors into

308
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,309
our portfolio and we're now launching the latest instance

309
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,969
C8A.

310
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:11,030
C8A instances deliver up to 30% higher performance compared to C7A instances

311
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:14,729
with memory bandwidth and networking capabilities that transform

312
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,609
what's possible for your compute intensive workloads.

313
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,659
These instances deliver up to 384 gigabytes of memory

314
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,419
backed by up to 75 gigs of network bandwidth

315
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:27,169
and

316
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:28,539
60 gigs

317
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,869
of EBS bandwidth.

318
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:34,400
CHA instances are perfect for everything from batch processing,

319
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,080
distributed analytics,

320
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,900
to high performance computing

321
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,900
and highly scalable

322
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,520
multiplayer gaming.

323
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:46,960
Next,

324
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,619
we're launching a tongue twister.

325
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:49,890
The AMD

326
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,099
X-based instance.

327
00:14:52,469 --> 00:14:55,239
X 8 AEDZ,

328
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:56,549
right?
That's a lot of letters.

329
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,679
I apologize for the letters,

330
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,739
but that's important.

331
00:14:59,070 --> 00:14:59,950
Um,
they all,

332
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,479
they all tell you exactly what,

333
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,659
uh,
what these are.

334
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,580
Um,
so these are powered by fifth-gen AMD Epic processors

335
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,520
with a maximum frequency of 5 gigahertz,

336
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,950
the highest CPU frequency in the cloud,

337
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,719
and one of the reasons for the many letters.

338
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,179
They deliver up to 2 times higher compute performance

339
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:23,299
and 31% better price performance compared to previous generation X2 iEZNs

340
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,880
with up to 8

341
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,039
terabytes

342
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:28,940
of local AirBnB SSD storage.

343
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:32,400
These instances are ideal for EDA workloads.

344
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,479
And so for chip designers,

345
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,380
this means faster processing.

346
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:40,500
In memory intensive tasks like floor planning

347
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,400
or routing and power integrity analysis.

348
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,690
And to round out today's AMD CPU based announcements,

349
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,429
I have two final instance types to share with you.

350
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:54,349
First,

351
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,270
we're announcing HPC 8A instances powered by 5th-gen AMD Epic

352
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,599
available in 2026.

353
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,950
These instances are designed for compute incentive,

354
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:06,690
high-performance computing workloads,

355
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,119
including computational fluid dynamics,

356
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,690
weather forecasting,

357
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:12,869
finite element analytics,

358
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:14,849
and drug discovery applications.

359
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,390
And then available in preview,

360
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:22,270
M8AZN.

361
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:28,059
These general purpose instances are powered again by 5th-gen AMD Epic processors

362
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,599
and deliver industry leading that 5 gigahertz of clock speed,

363
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,780
the highest maximum CPU frequency in the cloud.

364
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,599
M88 AZN instances deliver up to 2 times higher compute performance

365
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,130
and up to 2 times network throughput compared to prior generation

366
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:44,840
M5

367
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:46,140
AZN instances.

368
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,700
So

369
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,239
the high computes and network performance makes them

370
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:53,380
ideal for latency sensitive and compute insensitive,

371
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,989
sensitive workloads such as gaming.

372
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:56,520
Again,

373
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
financial services,

374
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,900
high frequency trading,

375
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:01,479
and simulation modeling for the automotive,

376
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,239
aerospace,

377
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,179
energy,

378
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,540
and telco industries.

379
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,689
Let me put all of these AMD innovations

380
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:12,310
into perspective because there's been quite a lot of them that I,

381
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,500
that I went through now.

382
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:15,540
So for EDA customers,

383
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,650
the X8 AEDZ instances will accelerate chip design

384
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,848
and verification.

385
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,920
For e-commerce platforms,

386
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,390
using our M8AZN instances,

387
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:29,270
this means supporting more concurrent customers during peak shopping periods

388
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:31,810
with the highest single threaded performance

389
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,520
available.

390
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,819
Our new R8A,

391
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:35,699
M8A,

392
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,900
and C8A instances deliver up to 30% higher

393
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,189
performance and up to 19% better price performance

394
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:43,890
compared to their predecessors.

395
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,680
With R8A also

396
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:46,560
offering

397
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:49,540
45% more memory bandwidth

398
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:50,680
for databases,

399
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:54,770
and M8A showing off that 39% faster Cassandra workloads,

400
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:58,180
and C8A enabling thousands of additional players

401
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,560
to concurrently join the same game.

402
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,949
Without experiencing latency issues.

403
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,140
And these are the ones that my sons are the most

404
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,640
interested in because they'd like the games to be less laggy.

405
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:12,109
Now shifting gears,

406
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,390
AWS was the first and still is the only

407
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,189
major cloud provider to offer Apple Mac-based instances.

408
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:24,209
And today I'm happy to announce the next generation of our Mac instances available

409
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:25,660
on AWS.

410
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,910
So first,

411
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:34,449
EC2 M4 Max Mac instances powered by Apple M4 Mac Mac Studio

412
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,760
are now in preview,

413
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:41,140
and EC 2 M3 Ultra Mac instances powered by the Apple M3 Ultra Mac Studio

414
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,219
are coming soon.

415
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,829
Now these join our recently launched Mac 4 and Mac 4 Pro instances,

416
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,339
completing our portfolio

417
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,229
of the latest Apple Silicon options.

418
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:54,410
And these new instances will further help

419
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,410
eliminate the need for physical lab environments,

420
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,160
reduce capital expenses,

421
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:02,030
and simplify CICD pipelines,

422
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,829
enabling developers to build and test

423
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,010
and also sign your Apple apps

424
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:09,449
using the very latest Apple hardware.

425
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,380
We've been collaborating with Nvidia for 15 years.

426
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:16,390
That's a long time.

427
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,089
And we were the first to launch Nvidia GPUs to the cloud.

428
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,680
And since then,

429
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,270
we've never stopped innovating.

430
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,900
And we've spent all of this time

431
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,520
learning about operating GPUs at scale.

432
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,959
And I think we excel at doing exactly that.

433
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,849
Through our first elastic fabric adapter,

434
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:36,609
EFA

435
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,449
we enabled HPC grade networking with lower latency

436
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:44,109
and higher throughput than traditional TCP transport.

437
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,150
And we think this differentiates us.

438
00:19:46,449 --> 00:19:49,430
It allows customers to achieve on-premise cluster performance

439
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:51,229
with that cloud flexibility.

440
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,119
Earlier this year,

441
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,910
we released our P6 generation,

442
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:56,069
easy to instance

443
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,770
with Nvidia Blackwall.

444
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:04,219
The P6 GB 200 instance deliver up to 2 times faster performance for AI training

445
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,660
and inference compared to P5s.

446
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:08,910
Three weeks ago,

447
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,719
for those of you that might have seen it,

448
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:14,430
we launched P6EB 300 as well.

449
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,099
And these instances are ideal for larger scale

450
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:20,430
AI training and delivered 2 times more networking bandwidth

451
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:23,469
and 1.5 times more GPU memory

452
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,069
than previous generations.

453
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:28,439
Yesterday,

454
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:29,569
for those of you that watched it,

455
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,760
Matt announced the launch of EC2 P6E GB 300 Ultra Server,

456
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:38,699
which is the first AWS instance to be powered

457
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:42,599
by the Nvidia's latest GB 300 NVL 72 system.

458
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,670
GB 300 offers 1.5X,

459
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,699
FP4

460
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:48,959
flops,

461
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:52,160
and GPU memory to improve performance for the

462
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,979
biggest models and the most demanding AI workloads.

463
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,380
A couple of weeks ago,

464
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:59,030
we also launched P6B 300,

465
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:03,780
which delivered two times networking bandwidth and 1.5X GPU memory size

466
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,780
and 1.5X

467
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:06,640
GPU

468
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:08,160
teraflops

469
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,619
compared to

470
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,319
P6B 200 instances,

471
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,800
making them well suited.

472
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,400
For those of you that um is in this detail,

473
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,390
makes them well suited to train and

474
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,979
deploy large trillion parameter uh foundational models

475
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,510
and large language models.

476
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,540
The recent launch of B300 and GB 300 instances demonstrate our commitment

477
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,500
to

478
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,430
stay at the forefront of GPU computing.

479
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,560
These are the latest and greatest generations of GPUs.

480
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:36,270
And so as you've heard today,

481
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,910
AWS continues to deliver breakthrough innovations at every layer of the stack.

482
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:46,270
And from a deep collaboration with Intel and AMD and Apple and Nvidia,

483
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,219
to the incredible customer stories that we've already shared,

484
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,020
we're helping customers unlock entirely new possibilities in the cloud.

485
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:56,449
These innovations aren't just about

486
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,719
raw performance.

487
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,729
They're about enabling better customer experience

488
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,530
and delivering more value

489
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,609
at lower cost.

490
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:06,130
But innovation at AWS

491
00:22:06,349 --> 00:22:09,540
isn't limited just to these large technological leaps.

492
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:11,969
We're equally passionate about

493
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,300
the smaller things,

494
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,989
the countless of smaller things

495
00:22:15,189 --> 00:22:16,969
that help our customers achieve

496
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:18,410
operational excellence

497
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,969
in their day to day work.

498
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,069
And to tell you a little bit more about how

499
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:25,219
we've turned this focus into real innovation for our customers,

500
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,890
I'm excited to announce or to welcome Jeremy Connolly to the stage.

501
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,650
Jeremy.

502
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:47,199
Hi everyone.

503
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,380
Good afternoon.

504
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:50,109
I'm Jeremy Connolly,

505
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,670
the principal technical customer success manager

506
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:54,150
in Amazon EC2.

507
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:55,839
You know,

508
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:57,479
in today's cloud environment,

509
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:59,520
every millisecond of downtime

510
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:03,380
and every minute of operational overhead directly affects our customers.

511
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:04,920
That's why

512
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,030
I'm particularly excited to share some breakthrough

513
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:11,500
improvements we've made in EC2 operational excellence.

514
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,689
Improvements that are transforming how our customers launch,

515
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,660
run.

516
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,380
And manage their compute workloads.

517
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,160
At AWS

518
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,280
we believe

519
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,219
that every incremental improvement

520
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:26,959
unlocks new possibilities for our customers.

521
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,000
Today,

522
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,640
I'll show you how these targeted innovations

523
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,199
are creating transformative outcomes

524
00:23:33,699 --> 00:23:34,979
across our compute platform.

525
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,130
Let's start with launch time improvements.

526
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,030
With our latest Amazon Linux OI release,

527
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,660
we've achieved a 12% improvement

528
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,339
in instance launch to SSH ready time.

529
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,420
Across our most commonly used in instance types.

530
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:57,560
This comes from extensive optimization work,

531
00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:00,859
including streamlined random number generation services

532
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:03,040
and boot process improvements.

533
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,520
On our C6G medium instances,

534
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:07,270
for example,

535
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,150
Excuse me.

536
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:13,349
We've reduced launch times from 9.1 seconds

537
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:16,729
to 8.05 seconds with similar improvements

538
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:19,709
across other compute optimized and general purpose

539
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:20,910
instance families.

540
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,150
And speaking of ready time,

541
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,449
time is critical

542
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,670
in cloud operations,

543
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:28,760
which is why

544
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:30,890
I'm particularly excited about our new

545
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:34,510
Amazon EBS time-based snapshot copy capability.

546
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:37,099
Customers can now.

547
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:41,040
Copy EBS snapshots within or between

548
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,140
AWS regions and accounts with a predictable completion duration.

549
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,119
Ranging from 15 minutes

550
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,359
to 48 hours,

551
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:53,400
and some customers are seeing up to 350% improvements

552
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,339
when adding a 1 terabyte node.

553
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,920
Let me walk you through how this works.

554
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,329
This feature guarantees consistent and predictable

555
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:08,150
snapshot copy performance by reserving dedicated throughput

556
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:10,150
for our copy operations

557
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,569
based on the completion time you specify.

558
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,469
When you initiate a time-based copy,

559
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,479
AWS allocates the necessary bandwidth,

560
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:22,719
giving you the guaranteed completion times needed

561
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,900
for your most time-sensitive workloads.

562
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,270
You can monitor progress using the console,

563
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,640
or API.

564
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,790
And even Amazon event Bridge events

565
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:35,000
that notify you when a copy completes.

566
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:42,609
With guaranteed completion duration,

567
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:45,760
you can address strict RPO requirements,

568
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,430
improved disaster recovery runbooks,

569
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,280
development workflows,

570
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:52,520
and testing cycles with confidence.

571
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,329
Knowing exactly when your snapshot will be available

572
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,109
in the destination region or account.

573
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:02,459
Customers such as MongoDB are using this

574
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:05,479
feature to accelerate their cross-region node provisioning

575
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:07,939
for their Atlas multi-region clusters.

576
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,619
And speaking of data assurance.

577
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:16,479
I'm excited to share a major feature in how we help customers

578
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:18,239
maintain instance health.

579
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:21,319
Our EBS status health check capability

580
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,280
represents a fundamental shift

581
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:24,719
in how we detect

582
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:25,800
and prevent

583
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,680
storage-related issues.

584
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,930
Previously,

585
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,709
customers might only discover a rare EBS

586
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,920
uh related problem

587
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,359
after their application had experienced impact.

588
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,560
Today,

589
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:42,339
We can detect potential issues and deliver that in the form of a health check.

590
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,099
Removing the operational overhead of troubleshooting

591
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:48,739
any data IO availability concerns.

592
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:53,589
In building on our storage innovations,

593
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,270
I'm thrilled to announce

594
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:59,010
Amazon EBS provision rate for volume initialization.

595
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,099
This feature allows customers to create fully performing EBS volumes

596
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:08,089
within a predictable time frame by specifying initialization rates

597
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:10,750
between 100 megabytes per 2nd and 300 megabytes.

598
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,109
We've seen customers use this feature

599
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:17,949
to accelerate their easy to instance launch

600
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:20,949
to build more resilient disaster recovery posture,

601
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,729
to achieve faster workload readiness for applications

602
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:26,930
such as gaming and virtual desktops.

603
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:28,560
On average,

604
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:32,140
customers are realizing 40 to 60% improvement

605
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,160
in their rate of volume initialization.

606
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:38,439
Also,

607
00:27:38,939 --> 00:27:41,959
understanding instance placement and proximity is another area

608
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,839
where we've made advances.

609
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,800
Our instance typology feature provides unprecedented

610
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,790
visibility

611
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:51,900
into the relative proximity of your EC2 instances,

612
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,160
delivering up to 50%

613
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:56,060
faster latency improvements.

614
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,300
I'm also excited to announce

615
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,339
a new

616
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:02,040
capacity reservation typology API.

617
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,219
This capability

618
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,380
allows you to determine the placement

619
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,689
of your reserved capacity before launching instances,

620
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:12,380
a critical advancement in workloads

621
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,719
for every minute.

622
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,219
Customers such as Anthropic

623
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,660
used to spend up to 60 minutes

624
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,619
launching

625
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:20,760
and validating

626
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,300
their instance placement

627
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,020
and can now optimize

628
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,459
on infrastructure placement strategies

629
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,760
before deployment,

630
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:29,599
reducing the operational overhead.

631
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,359
All these improvements

632
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,459
work together

633
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:37,199
to create a more reliable,

634
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:38,319
efficient,

635
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,310
and manageable compute environment.

636
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,609
But perhaps more importantly,

637
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,099
It represents our commitment

638
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:45,979
to

639
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,219
continuous operational excellence.

640
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,459
We're not just fixing problems,

641
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,140
but we're preventing them,

642
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,719
and we're not just improving performance.

643
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,890
We're making it more predictable.

644
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,819
And we're not just reducing operational overhead,

645
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,719
we're innovating on how operations work.

646
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,420
These improvements reflect our commitment

647
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,800
to operational excellence,

648
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,900
but as always,

649
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,500
we're just getting started.

650
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,050
As Andy Jasse says,

651
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:18,369
there's not a compression algorithm

652
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,689
for experience.

653
00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:21,589
And it's this,

654
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,750
excuse me,

655
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,229
accumulated experience

656
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:28,489
that enables us to continuously improve every aspect of our service.

657
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:32,459
Just as we've seen with these operational innovations.

658
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:36,880
This is the same drive and excellence leads us

659
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:38,459
to dive deeper.

660
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,030
All the way to the silicon level.

661
00:29:41,689 --> 00:29:42,430
And now,

662
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,069
I'd like to welcome Willem Vissor back to the stage.

663
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:47,469
He'll share on our focus

664
00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:49,550
of these operational details

665
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,349
that has led us to develop our own silicon innovations,

666
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,319
bringing even more benefits to our customers.

667
00:29:56,729 --> 00:29:57,229
Thank you.

668
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:02,790
Thanks,
Jeremy.

669
00:30:03,449 --> 00:30:04,040
I,
uh,

670
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,130
managed to make the stage.

671
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,050
I'm told yesterday somebody took a stumble.

672
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,949
So at least that's 1 point better than the person that took a stumble.

673
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:12,630
So Jeremy is my right-hand person,

674
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:12,969
uh,

675
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:14,150
when it comes to

676
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,469
spending lots of time

677
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,630
with customer on operational things.

678
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:18,329
And,

679
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:18,650
uh,

680
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,520
he certainly is the right person to speak to the improvements that,

681
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,449
uh,
that we've made.

682
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:23,810
So

683
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:24,930
Next,

684
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,349
I wanna show you how we're redefining what's possible at the chip level.

685
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:33,199
You see,
silicon innovation isn't just about better performance.

686
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,750
It's about where performance meets possibility.

687
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:40,030
And every advancement we make at the silicon level creates a ripple effect

688
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,310
across thousands of applications worldwide,

689
00:30:42,489 --> 00:30:43,439
as well as those,

690
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,410
those partners that we've just discussed.

691
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:50,400
Our journey into custom silicon innovation

692
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,459
began with a seemingly impossible challenge,

693
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,099
reimagining cloud infrastructure from the ground up.

694
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,959
We started very small,

695
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,449
working with KVM on the off-shelf hardware for our nitro system.

696
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,920
The initial step led to something transformative,

697
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,199
the AWS Nitro System,

698
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,959
the foundation today for all of EC2.

699
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,359
Traditionally,

700
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,979
hypervisors were responsible for everything.

701
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,489
Protecting physical hardware and BIOS and virtualization,

702
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,250
CPU,

703
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,449
storage and networking

704
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:23,689
while providing management

705
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,760
capabilities.

706
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:25,930
And that,
of course,

707
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:27,449
requires resources.

708
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:30,650
The Nitro system completely reimagined this approach

709
00:31:31,109 --> 00:31:33,050
by breaking apart these functions

710
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,530
and then offloading them

711
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,810
onto dedicated hardware and software.

712
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,119
And we can now deliver practically all of the service resources to our customers.

713
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,130
And it's fundamentally changed how we deliver cloud computing.

714
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,689
Enabling us to innovate faster and reducing costs for our customers,

715
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:51,959
as well of course as providing enhanced security.

716
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,319
The AWS Nitro System is a comprehensive

717
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,560
security and performance foundation for EC2.

718
00:31:57,859 --> 00:32:01,020
It provides zero operator access.

719
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,760
Something that we're so confident in

720
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,140
that we had it independently verified.

721
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:09,780
The AWS Nitroy delivers hardware-based protection

722
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,880
and enables encryption for your VPC traffic and EBS volumes.

723
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,900
Those of you that listened to Rob about networking a little bit before.

724
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:19,250
Through the AWS Nitro Hypervisor,

725
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,920
customers get bare metal performance,

726
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,449
and for demanding workloads,

727
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,020
Nitro supports elastic fabric adapter,

728
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:27,209
what I mentioned before,

729
00:32:27,469 --> 00:32:30,859
for ultra low latency RDMA communications.

730
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:36,449
The secure Foundation extends to our networking infrastructure.

731
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,010
We've built the most secure,

732
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:40,319
reliable,

733
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:43,689
and scalable network connecting all of EC2.

734
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,430
And unlike traditional architectures,

735
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:48,680
we've created one large,

736
00:32:48,689 --> 00:32:49,829
fast network

737
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,160
that unifies all of our traffic flows.

738
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:55,000
And the scale here is unprecedented.

739
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:00,829
We connect over 1 million accelerators as an example in the single flat network.

740
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,069
But it's not just about scale.

741
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,780
It's about reliability.

742
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:07,680
Our network automatically routes around link

743
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,510
or switch failures without performance impact,

744
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,119
completely transparently.

745
00:33:12,939 --> 00:33:16,550
We've built one common network that connects everything from GPUs

746
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,880
to raniums to AMDs to Intels to gravitons to,

747
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,619
um,

748
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:20,979
you know,

749
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:23,160
the Apple processes that we talked about before.

750
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:26,199
Our graviton journey

751
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,719
Which began in 2018,

752
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:31,119
kind of like rapidly moved through the generations of

753
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,520
here that you see in front of you,

754
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:34,020
starting from 2018,

755
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:37,020
2018 to 2019 up to 2023

756
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,300
when we released Graviton 4.

757
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,780
And each generation has marked a significant leap

758
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:43,459
forward.

759
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,390
Graviton 4,

760
00:33:46,699 --> 00:33:49,640
released in 2024 remains one of the most exciting chips

761
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,959
that we've ever released.

762
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,959
It features 96 cores

763
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,010
and 73 billion transistors.

764
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,329
Like I can't even compre comprehend that number.

765
00:33:58,699 --> 00:33:59,010
Um,

766
00:33:59,010 --> 00:33:59,579
and so if you,

767
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,380
if you take that 73 billion for graviton 4,

768
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,000
graviton 1 had

769
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,099
5.

770
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,219
So it's just amazing,

771
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:06,930
right?
So these,

772
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,728
these numbers just become incomprehensible really to,

773
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:11,320
to wrap your mind around

774
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,000
how many,

775
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,060
how much we pack into these chips.

776
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:17,188
So

777
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,530
the benefits are compelling.

778
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:23,370
Up to 40% better price performance while assuming up to 60% less energy.

779
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:25,120
One of the things for Graviton that we're really,

780
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:25,770
really proud of,

781
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,110
like uses less energy.

782
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:32,010
So net potential soft soft cost savings um of up to 20%.

783
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:35,928
The performance gain often means using fewer instances for you,

784
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:39,628
for your workloads and potentially decreasing your total cost of ownership

785
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:40,668
even further.

786
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:43,789
And we spoke about that carbon footprint earlier in the deck as well.

787
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:47,938
So,

788
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,449
here is my challenge for you today.

789
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,550
Take our,

790
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,810
it only takes one initiative.

791
00:34:53,228 --> 00:34:56,449
I promise you'll be amazed by this and what you're gonna accomplish in just

792
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,489
one week.

793
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,040
With one developer

794
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:00,360
and one workload.

795
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,520
I've had so many examples from customers that took up this challenge

796
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:04,419
and took a,

797
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,620
took one developer,

798
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:07,530
put them for one week on this.

799
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,540
Absolutely incredible.

800
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,219
Just think about it,

801
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,800
right?

802
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:12,399
Less time that it takes you to plan your next sprint,

803
00:35:12,669 --> 00:35:15,939
you can take one engineer and put them on this and see what you get.

804
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:18,949
And the potential upside for you is incredible over here.

805
00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:20,899
So I really encourage you to go and spend that

806
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:23,449
one week of one engineer and see what actually,

807
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:24,860
um,
what you can gain here.

808
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:26,489
So

809
00:35:26,729 --> 00:35:28,370
building on our security first approach,

810
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:33,209
we've now made EC2 instances also at the station generally available.

811
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:37,719
And this is a game changer for a big subset of our customers who needs to validate

812
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:41,379
that only trusted software is running on the EC2 instances,

813
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,739
including those

814
00:35:42,889 --> 00:35:44,479
with AI chips and GPUs.

815
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,310
So

816
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,979
with a combination of Nitro TPM and a testable Amazon

817
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:50,199
machine images,

818
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:53,379
customers can now cryptographically verify

819
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,320
their instances are actually running trusted configurations on the software.

820
00:35:57,659 --> 00:35:59,840
And by integrating with AWS

821
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:00,820
KMS,

822
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,360
customers can restrict key operations to instances

823
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,800
that passes this attestation test.

824
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,159
And let's talk about

825
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,250
Amazon EC2 ranium 3 Ultra Servers,

826
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:16,060
powered by our 4th generation ranium 3 chips.

827
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:16,939
Now again,

828
00:36:16,939 --> 00:36:18,100
there's gonna be some numbers here.

829
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:20,330
It's very hard really to put these numbers into,

830
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,189
into uh

831
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:21,939
context,

832
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:23,419
but I'm gonna try and kind of like,

833
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:23,899
you know,

834
00:36:23,899 --> 00:36:25,649
give them to you so that you can interpret them.

835
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:29,239
So these instances delivers up to 4.4% higher performance,

836
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,939
3.9% higher memory bandwidth,

837
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,820
and over 4 times better performance for what compared to ranium 2 ultra servers.

838
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,060
And what's truly groundbreaking is the scale that we can achieve.

839
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:44,100
Terranium 3 Ultra servers represent significant leap forward in performance,

840
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:44,800
um,

841
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,030
scale up to an impressive 144 chips that we packed together in the Ultra servers,

842
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,500
which is essentially 4 of these hosts packed together.

843
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,340
Um,

844
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,179
So truly groundbreaking performance for uranium 3.

845
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,040
But numbers and specifications only tell part of the story.

846
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:03,330
The true power of these innovations emerges when you see

847
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,209
how they enable entirely new ways of building applications,

848
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,570
which is the more interesting part.

849
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:11,290
You've heard me talk extensively about our innovations in silicon,

850
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,860
our broad portfolio of EC2 instances,

851
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:16,030
and hopefully you interpreted some of those numbers,

852
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,669
and the incredible performance

853
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,870
that we're delivering at the chip level.

854
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:23,989
Many of our customers love this level of control.

855
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:28,540
The ability to fine tune their infrastructure down to the instance type

856
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:30,100
and processor architecture.

857
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,310
They need that control.

858
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,800
But we also hear from customers who

859
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,330
want to abstract away infrastructure decisions.

860
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,419
They want to focus purely on the application code and business logic,

861
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,219
letting AWS handle everything else.

862
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:46,100
And so I like to think of my team as,

863
00:37:46,149 --> 00:37:46,709
uh,
you know,

864
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:47,629
if you can visualize this,

865
00:37:47,669 --> 00:37:49,429
I like to think of my team as

866
00:37:49,629 --> 00:37:51,899
the team that creates little Lego blocks,

867
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:52,649
right?

868
00:37:52,709 --> 00:37:55,689
And we decide on the size and we decide on the color,

869
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,219
and we decide where we're gonna actually go and produce them and,

870
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,830
you know,
which regions we're gonna put them down,

871
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:01,120
where you can go and buy them.

872
00:38:01,629 --> 00:38:02,909
And our next speaker over here,

873
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:03,899
Barry Cooks,

874
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:04,510
um,

875
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,810
VP of Computer abstractions,

876
00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:07,750
he's the,

877
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,689
he and his team

878
00:38:09,149 --> 00:38:11,250
is that kid who walks in.

879
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,780
Looks at all the Lego blocks that we've built,

880
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,419
and he snaps them all together,

881
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,159
and he's the one that wins the,

882
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:17,600
that,

883
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,399
that wins the best spaceship award.

884
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,280
So

885
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,750
let me show you how it is.

886
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:22,850
Barry Cooks,

887
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,280
please come onto the stage.

888
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,060
Thank you.

889
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:28,810
Right.

890
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,879
How's everybody doing?

891
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:35,709
I'm gonna take us in a slightly new direction here,

892
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,679
and that is,

893
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:38,500
I,
I'm gonna talk about compute abstractions,

894
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,459
but I also kinda wanna do this in the frame of a little inside baseball.

895
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,879
So let's talk a little bit

896
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:43,820
about

897
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,129
our strategy internally for our compute abstractions.

898
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:47,860
What are our strategic pillars?

899
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,399
What are we trying to do with all of these abstractions?

900
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,500
I think there's a,

901
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,129
a great quote,

902
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:53,659
it's attributed to Mark Twain,

903
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,959
although I hear there's some French mathematician that

904
00:38:56,179 --> 00:38:58,179
in the 1600s also claims the same quote.

905
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,310
And that is,

906
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:01,070
I didn't have time to write you a short letter,

907
00:39:01,149 --> 00:39:02,689
so I wrote you a long one instead.

908
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,550
One of our key goals with our compute abstractions

909
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,030
is that we want to be able to give you

910
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,189
exactly what you need in a concise,

911
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,419
clean way so that you can use that abstraction to meet your goals.

912
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,060
And there looks like a lot of different logo madness going on on here,

913
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,860
and there is.

914
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,280
Because the other thing that's also true around compute abstractions,

915
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,959
is that we have this inside joke slash criticism,

916
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:24,689
and that is,

917
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:25,830
if there's a good idea,

918
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:27,750
there's at least 12 ways to do it in AWS.

919
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,489
And the reality of that quote

920
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:31,610
and that joke.

921
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:32,889
I,

922
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:33,370
yeah,

923
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,139
there is.

924
00:39:34,649 --> 00:39:35,550
But realistically,

925
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,169
there's just one way,

926
00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:37,370
it's the way you chose.

927
00:39:37,729 --> 00:39:39,320
All of those different 12 ways,

928
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:40,659
we do that on purpose.

929
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,560
We do that because customers tell us,

930
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:43,929
here's how I wanna do it,

931
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:45,370
and here's how I wanna do it.

932
00:39:45,689 --> 00:39:46,879
And we try to meet customers where they are,

933
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:48,870
we don't try to force function them into other things.

934
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:51,090
So that's been a key attribute of how we

935
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,669
are trying to build these compute abstractions over time.

936
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:57,000
There's a lot of detail hidden behind our compute abstractions.

937
00:39:57,409 --> 00:40:00,209
So there's 3 things to take away with respect to our strategy,

938
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,479
our strategic pillars.

939
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,270
Number 1,

940
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,629
we do wanna make it easy.

941
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,090
We wanna make it easy for your newer employees to use compute abstractions.

942
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:10,909
We wanna make it easy for AI agents to leverage these compute abstractions.

943
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,350
We don't want you to feel like you've stepped into a cul-de-sac.

944
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,929
Right?
The worst thing we can do for a customer is they

945
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:19,770
make a critical decision to leverage one of our abstractions.

946
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:23,290
And then a year or two later as their workload's growing and changing,

947
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,399
they feel like we pushed them into a cul-de-sac and they have to back out

948
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,889
and re-implement or rearchitect in a different way.

949
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,659
So we want to avoid those cul-de-sacs,

950
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:32,219
we wanna be able to have you come in,

951
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,360
pick an abstraction,

952
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,239
and grow on that as needed.

953
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:36,750
Then the third one.

954
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,790
Is we want our expertise,

955
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:42,489
we've got 20 years of experience running workloads at global scale,

956
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,550
all over the place.

957
00:40:43,629 --> 00:40:47,570
We want that expertise built into the abstraction so that you can take advantage

958
00:40:47,939 --> 00:40:50,350
of the hard lessons we've learned over those 20 years.

959
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:52,770
So that's a super important piece for us.

960
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,770
Um,

961
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,969
and I wanna say like,

962
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:56,209
for you,

963
00:40:56,229 --> 00:40:57,909
what does it really boil down to?

964
00:40:58,149 --> 00:41:00,110
So our goal for our customers,

965
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:01,629
we want anyone.

966
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,120
To be able to use these abstractions.

967
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,429
We want you to use them for any application,

968
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:08,629
whatever language you've chosen.

969
00:41:09,169 --> 00:41:11,570
Whether you're doing a big fat old school monolith,

970
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:13,169
whether you're gonna use containers,

971
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:14,770
if you wanna just have functions,

972
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,479
we want that to work across the board.

973
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,189
We want you to be able to run it anywhere.

974
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,770
Willem early in his talk,

975
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,330
he showed you the global reach that AWS has.

976
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:24,989
We want you to be able to run your abstraction and your code

977
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:26,770
as close to your customers as you choose.

978
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:27,919
And lastly,

979
00:41:27,939 --> 00:41:29,760
we want you to be able to do it at any scale.

980
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,659
And I think this is an important one because,

981
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,939
you know,
we talked a lot of startups and I have yet to meet a startup where they

982
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:37,449
think they have a terrible idea and they're gonna be out of business in 9 months.

983
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,580
Most of them want to grow in scale,

984
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,479
and we want to be able to take it from small

985
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:42,790
to global scale,

986
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,419
and we want to support customers with that.

987
00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:45,770
So

988
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,399
I asked my teams,

989
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:48,840
what should we cover off as,

990
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:50,040
as interesting launches,

991
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,310
and they gave me 50 things.

992
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,600
And I don't have 50 minutes,

993
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,620
so I couldn't even do

994
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,790
any kind of justice on launches today.

995
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:59,600
Uh,
so a huge shout out though to the org because it has been a very busy year,

996
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:00,600
we've done a ton of things.

997
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:01,860
I'm gonna walk you through

998
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,459
a few items that I think are super interesting.

999
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,580
A great place to start is lambda.

1000
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,989
Lambda is kind of the ultimate of abstractions,

1001
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,330
right?
It's a developer-friendly system where you don't know

1002
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:13,179
anything about what we're doing under the covers.

1003
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,879
You just run your code.

1004
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,030
We take care of everything to do with infrastructure,

1005
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,659
so it's a super high level abstraction,

1006
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:20,300
it's super friendly for developers.

1007
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:23,419
But Lambda doesn't know everything about what you're doing.

1008
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:26,219
So one of the challenges that we identified this year.

1009
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:27,659
Was,

1010
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:28,379
hey,

1011
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,530
we are running at a scale and we have adversarial tenants.

1012
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:34,080
And we want to continue to use lambda,

1013
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,780
but we need to protect tenant A from tenant B.

1014
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,800
So you're running a multi-tenant workload.

1015
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,780
How can I do this?

1016
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:43,139
And the answer is you can,

1017
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:43,939
you can do it today,

1018
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:44,540
it's great.

1019
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,709
You just create a copy of every function that you have a tenant for.

1020
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:50,350
And if you've got 10,000 tenants,

1021
00:42:50,399 --> 00:42:51,350
guess what you gotta do?

1022
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,659
10,000 copies of the same function.

1023
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,280
Right?
And then you have to operate that,

1024
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,600
and you've gotta go manage that.

1025
00:42:56,919 --> 00:42:57,550
And that is,

1026
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,060
um,

1027
00:42:58,149 --> 00:42:59,179
frankly not very fun.

1028
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:00,139
So,

1029
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,080
what do we wanna do?

1030
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:02,280
We wanna make this much simpler,

1031
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:03,399
so we're pretty excited.

1032
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,300
We're launching lambda tenant isolation.

1033
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:06,790
With this,

1034
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,610
your developer stays where they wanna live,

1035
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,469
they're in the code.

1036
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,879
All they have to do is pass us a tenant ID.

1037
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:16,120
Tell us you wanna be in the tenant isolation mode,

1038
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:17,850
pass the tenant ID

1039
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:19,770
we will take care of the rest under the cover.

1040
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,550
So lambda will make sure

1041
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:24,770
that you get the hard security boundary around your tenants that you want.

1042
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,429
We will log and provide information about the tenants

1043
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:28,669
and where they've run.

1044
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:32,000
So this way you stay in the abstraction that you wanna be in.

1045
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,199
You're still working in the world of lambda,

1046
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,320
you're just telling us,

1047
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,489
hey,
this is multi-tenant,

1048
00:43:36,649 --> 00:43:37,969
and here's the ID for this tenant.

1049
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,159
And then we will manage the infrastructures so that you don't have to worry about it,

1050
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,820
and we'll give you the logging and reporting on how that's working.

1051
00:43:46,479 --> 00:43:48,909
Another area in lambda that we're pretty excited about.

1052
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:51,520
These days,

1053
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,810
agents are everywhere,

1054
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:54,820
so you have these emerging new workload patterns,

1055
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:55,659
one of which is,

1056
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,939
I need to call out to an agent,

1057
00:43:56,979 --> 00:43:58,300
but then I gotta wait for something.

1058
00:43:58,659 --> 00:43:59,139
Um,

1059
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:00,449
maybe I'm doing payment processing,

1060
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,719
I need to go do some fraud checks before I do the next step in my process.

1061
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:06,060
And you can create these multiple lambdas,

1062
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,169
and you're waiting,

1063
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,080
and you're building your own retry logic,

1064
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,080
right?

1065
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,260
You're having to deal with the fact that now I've gotta

1066
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,899
go replay some portion of a transaction when it comes back.

1067
00:44:14,979 --> 00:44:16,649
You've got long waits that you've got to deal with,

1068
00:44:16,689 --> 00:44:19,320
you're creating boilerplate code for all of these things.

1069
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,820
What you really wanna do is have a way to orchestrate this

1070
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,540
and have lambda help you go down that path.

1071
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:28,820
So we're super excited to launch durable functions.

1072
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,570
With durable functions,

1073
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,260
you basically can get in there,

1074
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:34,600
focus on the code,

1075
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:36,439
tell us it's gonna be done with durable functions,

1076
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,629
set your steps up.

1077
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,750
I even have a cute little weight in there while you hang out for 5 seconds,

1078
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,550
just to point out that we're not gonna charge you while you're hanging out waiting,

1079
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,979
right,
you're only charged for the CPU you use.

1080
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,080
So,

1081
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:47,939
with this.

1082
00:44:48,469 --> 00:44:49,830
You're not writing the boilerplate,

1083
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:51,540
we're gonna make sure it's item potent.

1084
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:55,260
We're gonna store off the checkpoint between steps in your process.

1085
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,110
We're gonna restore all of that for you so

1086
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,100
you don't have to deal with those scenarios.

1087
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:01,209
We're gonna deal with retry logic.

1088
00:45:01,629 --> 00:45:03,629
So we're gonna create a system where you focus

1089
00:45:03,629 --> 00:45:06,429
on your problem and your problem was payment processing.

1090
00:45:06,729 --> 00:45:09,370
Or maybe your problem is that you've got a manual process and

1091
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:11,850
like your VP of IT needs to go approve something in email,

1092
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:13,929
and so welcome to the world of like waiting 4

1093
00:45:13,929 --> 00:45:15,409
weeks for them to get back from their golf trip,

1094
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:16,090
right?

1095
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,120
Not a problem,

1096
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:17,790
we'll wait

1097
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:18,560
1 year,

1098
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:19,760
if that's how long you need.

1099
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:22,810
So you can wait up to 1 year with these and then continue execution.

1100
00:45:23,129 --> 00:45:24,889
So it creates a really nice environment

1101
00:45:25,209 --> 00:45:26,909
for you to be able to go step through

1102
00:45:27,129 --> 00:45:29,250
and build a different type of application than

1103
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,590
you've traditionally done with lambda in the past.

1104
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,199
Another area,

1105
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:36,739
and this one's gonna be fun.

1106
00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:39,260
In the world of lambda,

1107
00:45:39,479 --> 00:45:40,750
I talked about no cul-de-sacs,

1108
00:45:40,919 --> 00:45:42,260
right,
we really don't want that.

1109
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:43,679
So something to keep in mind,

1110
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:44,580
dirty little secret,

1111
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,280
and it's not actually a secret.

1112
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,919
Guess where all your serverless functions run?

1113
00:45:49,899 --> 00:45:50,739
On a server somewhere,

1114
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:52,709
right?
There are servers under the cover in lambda.

1115
00:45:53,739 --> 00:45:56,379
As what one of the things we've discovered in talking with customers.

1116
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,550
They have loved

1117
00:45:58,689 --> 00:45:59,330
the lambda model,

1118
00:45:59,409 --> 00:46:02,270
they've grown massively in scale and lambda.

1119
00:46:02,649 --> 00:46:06,229
And they've gotten to the point where they want to be able to take advantage

1120
00:46:06,649 --> 00:46:09,510
of individual tweaks for performance reasons,

1121
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,629
right,
for cost reasons,

1122
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:13,030
a number of different things.

1123
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,560
And lambda doesn't let you do that,

1124
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,760
right?
It's a very high level abstraction.

1125
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,330
We're doing everything behind the scenes,

1126
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,649
you have no visibility into it and you don't get to touch anything.

1127
00:46:21,429 --> 00:46:23,929
One of the things we realized was that's not gonna work for everyone.

1128
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,429
And I don't want you in a cul-de-sac.

1129
00:46:25,469 --> 00:46:26,790
I don't want you to back out of lambda

1130
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:29,370
and try to implement on some other service only because

1131
00:46:29,669 --> 00:46:32,250
your workload has changed over time and grown to the point

1132
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,030
where you have these economies of scale.

1133
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,699
So we're really excited now to roll out lambda managed instances.

1134
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:41,459
Some of you would have seen this about a year ago this week,

1135
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:43,479
we launched EKS Auto mode.

1136
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:46,239
EKS Auto mode takes advantage of the same concept,

1137
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,159
managed instances.

1138
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:48,439
We're gonna take care of the instance,

1139
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,199
we're gonna patch,

1140
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:50,300
so nobody has to patch,

1141
00:46:50,669 --> 00:46:51,169
right?

1142
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,129
So now with lambda,

1143
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:54,929
you have that same capability.

1144
00:46:55,209 --> 00:46:56,209
Your developer,

1145
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:57,729
unchanged experience.

1146
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,530
They're still just writing lambda functions,

1147
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,610
they're still focused on the same problem that they've been focused on,

1148
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,310
which is their business logic.

1149
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,790
But what this allows you to do at scale

1150
00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:10,330
is to give us the decisions that you want us to implement with

1151
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:14,189
respect to the actual underlying hardware that we use to run those functions.

1152
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,090
And there's a number of really good benefits for this,

1153
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:17,850
that's an example I've got on the slide.

1154
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,050
Dylan was just talking about it.

1155
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,719
Maybe you wanna go use graviton

1156
00:47:21,929 --> 00:47:24,209
and take advantage of the things you can do with graviton.

1157
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:25,169
Now you can tell us,

1158
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,550
go give me a graviton instances for these,

1159
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:28,350
right?

1160
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:30,090
Maybe you have an IO heavy workload.

1161
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:30,610
In the past,

1162
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:31,639
you couldn't tell us that.

1163
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,770
There was nothing you could do to get lambda to recognize your IO patterns.

1164
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,409
Now you can pick out IO intensive instances,

1165
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:38,629
and we will use those,

1166
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,189
and we'll execute on those.

1167
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,030
Another thing that's super useful here

1168
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:44,050
is that this is multi-concurrent.

1169
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,520
So if you are going to go write

1170
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,179
thread-sa code,

1171
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,760
we will run your functions multi-concurrently.

1172
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:52,080
It's a huge benefit.

1173
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,979
We're seeing customers who've been playing with this,

1174
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,090
getting 40+% improvements.

1175
00:47:56,659 --> 00:47:58,479
Uh,
it can really both save you a lot of money

1176
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:00,639
and dramatically improve your performance.

1177
00:48:01,919 --> 00:48:02,959
So we think this one is,

1178
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:04,530
is gonna be super useful

1179
00:48:04,959 --> 00:48:06,909
because it doesn't disrupt your developer experience,

1180
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:10,340
but it does allow large scale customers with large scale workloads

1181
00:48:10,479 --> 00:48:11,500
to take full advantage

1182
00:48:11,909 --> 00:48:13,860
of the EC2 concepts and fleet

1183
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,800
and the different kinds of patterns that we have there.

1184
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:17,370
Now,

1185
00:48:17,389 --> 00:48:20,149
as we've looked at the simplicity and we've said how do we keep things simple,

1186
00:48:20,229 --> 00:48:21,399
how do we move things forward,

1187
00:48:21,669 --> 00:48:23,310
we didn't just do things in lambda this year,

1188
00:48:23,389 --> 00:48:25,189
we've done a number of things in other spaces.

1189
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,149
Not surprisingly,

1190
00:48:27,439 --> 00:48:30,399
ECS is now also gonna roll into managed instances.

1191
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:33,600
So traditionally in ECS you had kind of these two spectrums.

1192
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:34,899
I could sit on one side,

1193
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,179
and on that side I had Fargate.

1194
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,780
Fully abstracting,

1195
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,739
right,
I'm telling you about CPU memory.

1196
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:43,320
And on the other side I had ECS EC2.

1197
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:47,639
I get to go on and drive and patch and deal with a bunch of issues.

1198
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,300
Now with managed instances,

1199
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,399
we're gonna meet you in the middle,

1200
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:52,199
maybe it's the Goldilocks zone.

1201
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,800
We're gonna let you go and take,

1202
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:54,590
uh,

1203
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:55,600
full control

1204
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,399
and run those instances.

1205
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,060
We'll still do all the patching,

1206
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,239
all the other components.

1207
00:49:01,989 --> 00:49:03,540
The next space I want to touch on,

1208
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,270
still in the world of ECS.

1209
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,699
Deployments tend to be hard.

1210
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,520
People write lots of code to handle their deployments.

1211
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,959
They're trying to get a

1212
00:49:12,459 --> 00:49:15,199
sort of scenario laid out where they're testing and safe,

1213
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:15,739
right?

1214
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:16,620
We wanna do things,

1215
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,780
step it into production.

1216
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,340
I talked earlier about how we're trying to make things easier.

1217
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,560
We're also trying to leverage our own expertise.

1218
00:49:22,899 --> 00:49:26,320
We do a lot of deployments at AWS as you can imagine with our scale.

1219
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:30,199
And what we wanna be able to do is put some of that expertise into ECS.

1220
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:32,379
We wanna allow you to take full advantage of

1221
00:49:32,379 --> 00:49:34,040
the things that we've learned over the years.

1222
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,520
Um,

1223
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:39,540
so we're super excited today to roll out ECS native deployments.

1224
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:41,540
With native deployments,

1225
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,540
you can do blue-green.

1226
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:45,080
You can do uh canaries.

1227
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,679
Our best practices are built into these.

1228
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,020
We will auto roll back,

1229
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,919
right?
So you get these capabilities,

1230
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:53,750
the same sorts of things that we do

1231
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,500
day in and day out in our regions as we roll out updates to our services.

1232
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,739
You can now do

1233
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,540
built-in

1234
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,120
as part of ECS.

1235
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,840
Another space that we've talked about quite a bit.

1236
00:50:07,459 --> 00:50:09,280
Containers as a concept aren't

1237
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:10,500
terribly complicated,

1238
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,389
they're fairly straightforward,

1239
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:12,439
lots of developers

1240
00:50:12,699 --> 00:50:13,770
uh have wrapped their heads around them.

1241
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:16,000
Container orchestration is a complicated

1242
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,510
set of tooling,

1243
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,169
right,
like we just talked about deployments,

1244
00:50:19,179 --> 00:50:19,679
for example.

1245
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:21,179
So

1246
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,020
it's not always easy for people to get started who are new to this space.

1247
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:27,000
One of the things that we've recognized is it's,

1248
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,399
it frankly takes a lot of time in terms of learning curve for folks,

1249
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,459
and we wanna see if we can shorten that.

1250
00:50:32,959 --> 00:50:33,280
Um,

1251
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,959
and so today we're rolling out a new change in ECS,

1252
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,719
it's called ECS express mode.

1253
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,399
And the idea with ECS express mode was,

1254
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:42,860
can I get it down to one create call

1255
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,560
to go create my application?

1256
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,520
And the answer is yes,

1257
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:46,600
cause we just did it.

1258
00:50:48,229 --> 00:50:51,219
Can I do this in a way that is easier for me to consume?

1259
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,129
Yes.

1260
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:53,399
So,

1261
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:55,699
when you would do this in ECS in the past,

1262
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:00,159
you had about 300 parameters you would be setting and telling us about

1263
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,760
in order to roll a new app out.

1264
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,379
We've got that down to 30.

1265
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,620
We dropped it by 10,

1266
00:51:04,899 --> 00:51:05,679
factor of 10.

1267
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:06,600
So,

1268
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:10,120
now you can go set a relatively small set of parameters.

1269
00:51:10,459 --> 00:51:12,100
Um,
I like to call this the George Foreman grill,

1270
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:13,419
but I'm dating myself slightly with that.

1271
00:51:13,459 --> 00:51:14,739
You wanna set it and forget it.

1272
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:18,040
You want us to manage as much of that complexity as possible.

1273
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,580
And that's what ECS express mode is all about.

1274
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,159
And I think,

1275
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,860
uh,
it's been such a busy year for ECS

1276
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:28,340
that I wanted to kind of walk you through how we've approached this pattern.

1277
00:51:28,429 --> 00:51:29,840
What does it look like that we've done?

1278
00:51:30,669 --> 00:51:33,129
And,
and so if you look at the bottom of this slide,

1279
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:37,310
you can see what we've typically managed in the ECS world when you're on ECS EC2.

1280
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,979
And you can see what you've owned and what you've had to manage

1281
00:51:39,979 --> 00:51:42,850
and what you've had to control and think about and wrap your head around

1282
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,510
to run things in ECS.

1283
00:51:45,889 --> 00:51:47,860
As we've rolled forward over the course of this year,

1284
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:50,409
when we add in ECS managed instances,

1285
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,899
we take a lot of burden off of folks' plate.

1286
00:51:53,899 --> 00:51:56,139
All of a sudden you're letting us take care of a

1287
00:51:56,139 --> 00:51:58,679
slew of things that have been your problem in the past.

1288
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,929
When we rolled in deployments,

1289
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:03,179
now we're handling that aspect of things for you.

1290
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:04,560
Right?

1291
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,060
As we roll in and we say,

1292
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:08,040
hey,
we're gonna do ECS Express,

1293
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:12,360
we've rolled another set of things that we're gonna go and manage on your behalf.

1294
00:52:12,939 --> 00:52:14,860
And what this leaves you with is a few

1295
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,199
security permissions that you're gonna own and set,

1296
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:19,300
and your actual container app.

1297
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,899
The thing you actually care about,

1298
00:52:20,979 --> 00:52:23,040
the thing you're trying to deliver to your customers.

1299
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,479
And we can take care of these other pieces.

1300
00:52:25,899 --> 00:52:26,780
Now,
I mentioned before,

1301
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,169
we don't want cul-de-sacs.

1302
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,219
And we definitely do not want to create cul-de-sacs with ECS.

1303
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:32,590
So,

1304
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:38,129
do I have to revert to ECS EC2 if I find that some decision we're making in here,

1305
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:40,479
let's say on the load balancer is making you unhappy?

1306
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:43,219
Cause we are making decisions on your behalf if we're managing it.

1307
00:52:43,649 --> 00:52:45,649
Um,
we want you to be able to peel the cover back.

1308
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:49,239
We want you to be able to take on management responsibility for these components.

1309
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,850
Things like that load balancer,

1310
00:52:50,889 --> 00:52:54,050
maybe you wanna change those settings and you wanna own the load balancer piece,

1311
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,570
but you don't wanna revert everything.

1312
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,120
So we're gonna support letting you peel that cover back,

1313
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,979
letting you go in and take over management capabilities

1314
00:53:00,979 --> 00:53:02,320
for some of the things that we're managing.

1315
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,739
It gives you more flexibility,

1316
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,520
uh,
lets you kind of dive in and do things in your own way.

1317
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:08,229
Now,

1318
00:53:08,229 --> 00:53:10,090
ECS is not our only container orchestrator.

1319
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,110
It is not the only place that we've been trying to focus on building

1320
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:16,090
things out that will help our customers and manage more of their components.

1321
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:18,629
We have a lot of folks with open source first policies,

1322
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:20,340
a lot of folks who love Kubernetes.

1323
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:22,320
And,
in the Kuberneti space,

1324
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,729
we have iterated over time,

1325
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,189
we've been adding more and more management capabilities.

1326
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,090
Um,

1327
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,830
that's what our customers have asked us to do.

1328
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,830
As you go through and you try to scale up

1329
00:53:32,169 --> 00:53:32,870
and manage

1330
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:36,370
dozens or hundreds of clusters across regions,

1331
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,229
it starts to get pretty complicated.

1332
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,050
People have lots of tooling that they want to use for these things,

1333
00:53:41,209 --> 00:53:43,310
and now you're managing tooling and the clusters.

1334
00:53:43,729 --> 00:53:45,750
And so it can create a pretty challenging environment

1335
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:47,090
in terms of your headspace.

1336
00:53:48,129 --> 00:53:51,189
So what we've rolled out is Amazon EKS capabilities.

1337
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:54,169
Similar to what I showed in the ECS model,

1338
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:56,560
we're taking on more management responsibility for you.

1339
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,510
We're gonna try to make things a little easier,

1340
00:53:58,889 --> 00:54:00,469
especially when operating at scale.

1341
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:01,929
So in this case,

1342
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:03,689
the first thing that we're gonna roll out,

1343
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,729
Argo CD.

1344
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:07,600
Super popular open source framework,

1345
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:09,020
most of our customers were using.

1346
00:54:09,959 --> 00:54:10,870
I didn't meet a single one,

1347
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,260
including people who were maintainers of Argo CD who enjoyed managing the thing.

1348
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,909
Right?
So we will manage Argo CD on your behalf,

1349
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,020
make it significantly easier for you to step in and get

1350
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:22,040
your deployments done the way you want

1351
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,760
without all of the management overhead.

1352
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,120
Uh,

1353
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:28,500
a couple of other things that are rolling out immediately in this is also crow.

1354
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:32,449
The Cube Resource Orchestrator that we rolled out as an open source component,

1355
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:32,939
uh,

1356
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:34,510
delivered by our team here at AWS,

1357
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:35,419
ACK,

1358
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:35,939
another,

1359
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:36,570
uh,

1360
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,209
controller for,

1361
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:38,719
uh,
Kubernetes from Amazon.

1362
00:54:39,169 --> 00:54:41,449
These will all be managed components inside the stack,

1363
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,479
so you don't have to go and take on the management responsibility for those.

1364
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:45,979
If you remember last year,

1365
00:54:46,459 --> 00:54:47,120
Carpenter

1366
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:49,120
in auto mode became a managed component

1367
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,100
in the ECS,

1368
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:51,179
uh,
EKS stack.

1369
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:52,679
So we continue to kind of

1370
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,540
build out that framework and get more and more of those capabilities built in.

1371
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,129
Have feedback,

1372
00:54:58,239 --> 00:54:59,090
have favorite ones,

1373
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:00,090
want something else,

1374
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:01,050
let us know.

1375
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:03,020
We're super excited about this framework.

1376
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,199
This is not the last of our capabilities.

1377
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:09,270
We want to continue to add them as customers ask us for new and additional things.

1378
00:55:10,669 --> 00:55:12,820
Now as we talk about running clusters at scale,

1379
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:18,030
one of the focus areas that we had this year was uh around scaling for AI workloads.

1380
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:22,669
So 1.6 million trinium clusters in a single EKS cluster.

1381
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,489
That's a lot of trainium power.

1382
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,379
Uh,
this is one of the ones that's being used by Anthropic.

1383
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,719
We worked directly with the team

1384
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:30,719
in Anthropic,

1385
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,810
worked with the community in Kubernetes,

1386
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:34,929
worked on our own backend components,

1387
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:37,239
and we're able to support the scale needs

1388
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,040
for cloud

1389
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:39,639
and future training on cloud.

1390
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:42,459
We did the same with the Nova team here at Amazon.

1391
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:45,709
And now we're working with customers who are not in the AI space,

1392
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,159
who also have clusters of,

1393
00:55:47,189 --> 00:55:48,020
of huge scale,

1394
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:51,260
would like to have uniform single clusters for various reasons,

1395
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:54,550
and we're working to unlock those capabilities next.

1396
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:57,409
Now as you look at the clusters and you start thinking,

1397
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:58,320
man,

1398
00:55:58,389 --> 00:55:59,889
this is 100,000 nodes,

1399
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:03,580
you run into a really interesting problem when you hit these kinds of scales.

1400
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,780
And that problem is math and statistics.

1401
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:07,290
Right,

1402
00:56:07,389 --> 00:56:09,169
when you start running things at this scale,

1403
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:10,750
something's gonna break,

1404
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:11,949
I guarantee it.

1405
00:56:12,229 --> 00:56:14,310
Every single day something's gonna break.

1406
00:56:14,989 --> 00:56:18,159
And that is a huge time sink for customers.

1407
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:19,750
So in Sagemaker.

1408
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:21,610
We have observed this,

1409
00:56:21,689 --> 00:56:24,399
we've worked closely with a lot of customers who are doing training,

1410
00:56:24,929 --> 00:56:27,070
and we wanted to get your good put numbers up.

1411
00:56:28,229 --> 00:56:31,949
We're super excited to say that we are now going to do checkpointless training.

1412
00:56:32,669 --> 00:56:33,070
So,

1413
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:33,870
we started this year,

1414
00:56:33,949 --> 00:56:35,060
we focused on checkpoints,

1415
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:36,189
we've put them in memory,

1416
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:37,949
we tried to make them faster to load,

1417
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:39,169
faster to save.

1418
00:56:39,469 --> 00:56:40,310
And at some point we said,

1419
00:56:40,399 --> 00:56:42,100
why do we need checkpoints in the first place?

1420
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:44,010
Like why can't we recover your cluster

1421
00:56:44,389 --> 00:56:48,409
with the right mechanisms built into the core of how Sagemaker operates?

1422
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:51,840
And that's what you will get with restart list checkpoint,

1423
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:52,310
or sorry,

1424
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:53,370
restart list training.

1425
00:56:53,709 --> 00:56:54,389
Checkpoint list.

1426
00:56:54,669 --> 00:56:55,169
Um.

1427
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:57,439
The great thing about this,

1428
00:56:57,979 --> 00:57:00,600
you don't have to do anything other than turn it on.

1429
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,340
We will manage this for you.

1430
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,360
We will automatically handle these things.

1431
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,760
We're seeing good put numbers north of 95%

1432
00:57:07,169 --> 00:57:08,699
from customers who've been using this in,

1433
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:09,850
in anger at this point.

1434
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:11,919
So it can dramatically change

1435
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:14,000
in a completely hands-off way

1436
00:57:14,379 --> 00:57:15,459
how you recover from faults.

1437
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:16,580
The faults are still happening.

1438
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:18,909
But you don't have to worry about them.

1439
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:21,780
Your data science team doesn't have to restart a giant cluster,

1440
00:57:22,149 --> 00:57:22,949
reorganize things,

1441
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:24,540
load that snapshot back,

1442
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:26,550
right?
None of that stuff has to happen.

1443
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:29,260
And so it's a huge move forward for us,

1444
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:31,399
uh,
with respect to training on Sagemaker.

1445
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,550
Another place that we've struggled with Sagemaker

1446
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:36,469
has been.

1447
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,540
People build the cluster out.

1448
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:41,350
They have multiple things they want to run on that cluster.

1449
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,050
Invariably,

1450
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:43,929
you have conflict,

1451
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,080
usually business priorities is your conflict,

1452
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,100
um,
and starting and stopping training is super painful.

1453
00:57:49,169 --> 00:57:50,459
It takes too much time,

1454
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,120
it's hard for people to do.

1455
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,080
So,

1456
00:57:53,419 --> 00:57:54,679
what are we gonna do about it?

1457
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,820
We decided to introduce elastic training.

1458
00:57:57,629 --> 00:57:59,729
So with elastic training on hyperpod,

1459
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,729
based on your priorities,

1460
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:03,110
we can allocate.

1461
00:58:03,709 --> 00:58:05,090
Additional CPU

1462
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,590
and additional GPU

1463
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:08,159
to the nodes that are,

1464
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,409
that are needed for the higher priority task,

1465
00:58:10,669 --> 00:58:13,969
automatically reallocate them back for the lower prior ones in the future.

1466
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:18,100
So it allows you to very quickly and flexibly move forward with your training,

1467
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:18,590
again,

1468
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:19,969
without having to deal with

1469
00:58:20,149 --> 00:58:22,020
all of the pain points on your side of the,

1470
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,429
of the responsibility line.

1471
00:58:26,429 --> 00:58:29,750
So the next challenge we've seen with customers is customizing models.

1472
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,330
Right?
Models are fun,

1473
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,030
but they're not really that great unless you can get them

1474
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:36,370
to do what you need them to do in your shop.

1475
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,250
And using your data

1476
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,229
is requiring a lot of skill,

1477
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,459
a lot of time,

1478
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:43,310
a lot of experimentation.

1479
00:58:43,909 --> 00:58:45,350
And with Sagemaker now,

1480
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,209
we're gonna change the game again.

1481
00:58:47,709 --> 00:58:49,429
With AI model customization,

1482
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:50,570
you will get

1483
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:51,489
clean,

1484
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:52,860
simple workflows,

1485
00:58:53,149 --> 00:58:57,139
so that non-experts can actually come in and do those training runs,

1486
00:58:57,389 --> 00:58:59,110
get the customization in place.

1487
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:00,409
And this model,

1488
00:59:00,429 --> 00:59:00,979
uh,

1489
00:59:00,989 --> 00:59:01,610
includes

1490
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:04,659
an AI backend that will help you select,

1491
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:05,409
like,

1492
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:06,830
if you're not super familiar.

1493
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,830
Which model should I even customize in the first place?

1494
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:11,520
What if you don't have your own data,

1495
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,699
you just want some additional data in a partic of a particular type.

1496
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,189
We can now start to help you with each of these core problems.

1497
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,600
We can generate data sets,

1498
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,800
we can evaluate your model for success,

1499
00:59:21,879 --> 00:59:23,840
we can look for bias introduced by the new

1500
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,979
data that you just rolled into an existing model.

1501
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:27,340
And we can help you iterate

1502
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:29,179
to get to a successful outcome

1503
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:30,600
for your customers.

1504
00:59:33,439 --> 00:59:34,979
We thought about that for a while.

1505
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,149
And kind of like the one on Checkpoint,

1506
00:59:37,229 --> 00:59:37,639
we said,

1507
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:38,139
well,

1508
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,679
so we're gonna let you customize models,

1509
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:43,000
but one of the challenges with AI models is that you train them and they go,

1510
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,620
they're kind of like an old dog,

1511
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,909
right?
They get old fast.

1512
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,479
They don't learn new tricks really well.

1513
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,409
And the biggest challenge we've seen with training models has been.

1514
00:59:51,479 --> 00:59:52,909
Once you get into

1515
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:55,860
going and customize a model that's already gone through its full pre-training.

1516
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,199
You,
you're not gonna get the kind of results you might want.

1517
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:00,459
What you really wanted

1518
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,969
was your own model.

1519
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,719
And you couldn't figure out how to build one.

1520
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:04,820
It's too hard.

1521
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,350
So now,

1522
01:00:06,379 --> 01:00:08,659
what we've decided to do is NovaForge.

1523
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,760
So you can use Sagemaker.

1524
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:12,780
Open the hood,

1525
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:16,179
grab an intermediate checkpoint for our training

1526
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,820
of a Nova model,

1527
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,750
and then modify it and continue the pre-training.

1528
01:00:20,949 --> 01:00:25,260
At that stage in pre-training is the best time to introduce new data to a model.

1529
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,449
So this will allow you to go in.

1530
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:29,580
Change the data mix,

1531
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,300
we'll give you full capability to look at exactly what data

1532
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,850
set we were using and how we were doing it,

1533
01:00:33,899 --> 01:00:34,780
you can change the mix.

1534
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:38,500
You want more scientific data and less data on other aspects of language?

1535
01:00:38,899 --> 01:00:39,399
Great,

1536
01:00:39,459 --> 01:00:40,169
change it around.

1537
01:00:40,419 --> 01:00:43,810
You've got custom physics modeling and stuff that you want to put in the model,

1538
01:00:44,179 --> 01:00:45,250
you can add that data.

1539
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:48,939
It
allows you to come out the other side with your very own model,

1540
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,070
fully customized.

1541
01:00:50,149 --> 01:00:53,929
It's your way to get to a model that is your proprietary capabilities

1542
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,929
built into a frontier model.

1543
01:00:56,229 --> 01:00:57,469
So we're super excited about that,

1544
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:59,889
we've got that working and a number of customers have seen

1545
01:01:00,429 --> 01:01:01,469
amazing results with this,

1546
01:01:01,629 --> 01:01:02,229
including Reddit.

1547
01:01:04,629 --> 01:01:05,219
So

1548
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:08,179
We talked about a whole bunch of things here with respect

1549
01:01:08,179 --> 01:01:10,360
to how we're kind of trying to move the ball forward.

1550
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,340
And I think that one of the things to keep in mind

1551
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,040
as we go forward is you can get anyone,

1552
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,060
any app,

1553
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,659
anywhere at any scale.

1554
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:20,709
And before I bring Villain back out,

1555
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,689
cause he's gonna come back up here for a second,

1556
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:23,879
I wanted to highlight,

1557
01:01:23,919 --> 01:01:25,399
he had that really cool Zooks

1558
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:27,250
customer experience demo.

1559
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,979
I'm super competitive,

1560
01:01:30,149 --> 01:01:31,250
so I called a friend.

1561
01:01:31,709 --> 01:01:33,610
We've been working really closely with Aurora.

1562
01:01:33,909 --> 01:01:34,989
Aurora does self-driving trucks,

1563
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:36,770
they're much bigger than the Zook's cars.

1564
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:37,989
I was going for size.

1565
01:01:38,979 --> 01:01:40,139
These are off and running.

1566
01:01:40,379 --> 01:01:40,739
They're,

1567
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,649
they've been working across our systems.

1568
01:01:42,979 --> 01:01:45,449
They're doing runs in Texas today on the interstates.

1569
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,250
You'll see them,

1570
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:47,489
uh,
give them a wave.

1571
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:48,719
They won't wave back.

1572
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,620
They're expanding to the US.

1573
01:01:50,729 --> 01:01:51,830
They're gonna run coast to coast,

1574
01:01:52,139 --> 01:01:53,120
California to Florida

1575
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,560
in the near future.

1576
01:01:54,979 --> 01:01:55,780
Uh,
and with that villain,

1577
01:01:55,899 --> 01:01:57,780
why don't you come on back up here and tell folks about it.

1578
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:01,760
That's right,

1579
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:03,179
and you?

1580
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:06,389
All right.

1581
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:07,050
Um,

1582
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:07,790
like I said,

1583
01:02:07,909 --> 01:02:09,889
the cool kid that snaps,

1584
01:02:09,899 --> 01:02:10,219
uh,

1585
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:13,429
all of my Lego blocks together and then walks away with a spaceship and the prize.

1586
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:14,600
Um,

1587
01:02:14,629 --> 01:02:15,129
so

1588
01:02:15,629 --> 01:02:17,110
to put this into perspective,

1589
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:18,739
every single day,

1590
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:24,590
Aurora processes more than 5 million transactions and about 17 petabytes

1591
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:27,530
of information that it needs to process every single day.

1592
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:30,699
So this is another example of rapid

1593
01:02:30,699 --> 01:02:34,489
innovations complementing our longer-term engineering investments.

1594
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:37,770
But the real power of these investments come alive

1595
01:02:37,909 --> 01:02:39,590
in how our customers are using this.

1596
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,229
So from Intercom,

1597
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:43,270
pushing the boundaries of AI agents to

1598
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:47,010
Amazon Leo building those cloud architecture and space

1599
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:50,510
to Zos processing real-time autonomous vehicle data to

1600
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:53,669
new bank transforming financial services for millions,

1601
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:57,629
each of these customers represents how AWS

1602
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:58,510
innovates

1603
01:02:58,709 --> 01:03:00,370
and enables transformation

1604
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,110
at scale.

1605
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:06,030
And so I want to emphasize that everything that

1606
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:09,090
we've discussed today began with a customer conversation,

1607
01:03:09,449 --> 01:03:11,270
a challenge that needed to solve

1608
01:03:11,469 --> 01:03:13,649
or a possibility waiting to be unlocked.

1609
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:17,229
And whether you're optimizing current workloads like Mercedes-Benz

1610
01:03:17,229 --> 01:03:19,229
that we spoke about that SAP workload,

1611
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,290
or scaling globally with your

1612
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:24,729
expanded regional presence and enhanced capacity management.

1613
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:27,729
Or transforming your business with the latest

1614
01:03:27,969 --> 01:03:30,189
GPU and custom silicon innovations,

1615
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,850
AWS Compute

1616
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:34,530
provides the foundation you need to succeed.

1617
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:37,030
And today we've seen that transformation happens,

1618
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:37,870
how it happens,

1619
01:03:38,229 --> 01:03:39,780
not just through technology,

1620
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,139
but through that partnerships that we spoke about,

1621
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:44,570
the innovation and the relentless focus

1622
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:45,629
on your needs.

1623
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,500
