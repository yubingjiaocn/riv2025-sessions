  "abstract": "In complex distributed systems, resilience degrades between periodic tests. This session details how Capital One transformed from point-in-time testing to continuous verification by equipping engineers with a framework for automated experiments within safety guardrails. Learn how Capital One leverages AWS Fault Injection Simulator to proactively validate system failure modes while pairing chaos experiments with Service Level Objectives to measure outcomes. This approach enables Capital One to identify and resolve issues while automatically gathering evidence for operational safety and compliance.",
  "abstract_cn": "在复杂的分布式系统中，弹性会在定期测试之间退化。本次会议详细介绍了Capital One如何从时间点测试转变为持续验证，通过为工程师提供一个在安全护栏内进行自动化实验的框架来实现这一目标。了解Capital One如何利用AWS Fault Injection Simulator主动验证系统故障模式，同时将混沌实验与服务级别目标相结合来衡量结果。这种方法使Capital One能够识别和解决问题，同时自动收集运营安全和合规性的证据。",
