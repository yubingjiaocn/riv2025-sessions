1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,000
- All right, thank you for coming.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So who here has intended
to build a Frankenstack?

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,970
None of us.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,600
None of us say, you know
what sounds like fun?

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,560
Six databases, three
caches, a message bus,

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,340
two streaming platforms,
a homemade ETL pipeline

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,400
that runs only on full moons.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,580
It just happens, like
when you forget about

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,610
that Halloween pumpkin
and it suddenly collapses

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,823
into an orange pile of goo on your porch.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,610
So again, quick show of hands,

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,670
how many people here
maintain more than five

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,143
data stores right now?

14
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:49,890
And how many of you suspect
there are even more than that,

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,803
that have not been touched
since the year 2020?

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,450
All right, so you're in the right place.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,850
This talk is really for all of us.

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,280
We're gonna explore how
Frankenstacks happen

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,670
and why AI agents make them worse,

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,540
and how to then, and how
we avoid ending our careers

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,540
managing something that
looks like it escaped

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,433
from a haunted data center.

23
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,003
So teams tell me the same
story over and over again.

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,910
The demo's easy.

25
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,973
Production, that's where the real work is.

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,430
And not just like a little
work, like a village of work,

27
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,790
with like guilds and
blacksmiths and stuff.

28
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,930
Complexity doesn't grow
linearly with systems

29
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,970
or even exponentially.

30
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,460
With data stores, it grows factorially

31
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,433
and nobody wants a system
that scales factorially.

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,350
It's like adopting a kitten
and waking up with a herd

33
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,980
of blood-hungry lions.

34
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,810
So let me ask you,

35
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,510
how many of you feel like
your system works great

36
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,553
until suddenly it falls apart?

37
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,723
That's, at the end of the
day, the Frankenstack effect.

38
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,240
And here's the twist.

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,640
AI agents are actually gonna amplify

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,853
this effect significantly.

41
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,773
So let's dive in.

42
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,520
So of course this is how it starts.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,280
You have hope, you have ambition,

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,180
you have a clean architecture diagram.

45
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:35,280
In this case, we have an AI agent stack.

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,000
They're a web/mobile app, an OLTP system,

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,413
a vector data store.

48
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,750
It's good enough to win a hackathon.

49
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,670
It's good enough to get your
boss to give you an applause.

50
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,739
And it's good enough to
maybe even win a trophy,

51
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,583
at very least get yourself a free T-shirt.

52
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,653
We are in the honeymoon
phase at this point.

53
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,390
You've wowed the team, your POC works.

54
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,960
Maybe even you have a demo
video with some upbeat music.

55
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,390
Someone in the back
shouts from rags to riches

56
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,640
and you don't even groan at that dad joke

57
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,280
'cause you're so proud
of what you've made.

58
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,710
Your architecture feels extensible.

59
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,000
You need search?

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No problem, bolt on another store.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,470
Need recommendation engine?

62
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,080
No problem, bolt on another store.

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,980
Need analytics?

64
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,790
No problem, bolt on
yet another data store.

65
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,340
And of course this is the
point at which we all say,

66
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,880
we'll clean it up later,
but we all know the truth.

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,520
We've all built these systems before.

68
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,953
We're not cleaning anything up ever.

69
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,763
So a monster starts.

70
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,080
The complexity doesn't start very loudly,

71
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,490
doesn't start with a bang,

72
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,040
it starts with little whispers.

73
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,760
Grows at the seam with every
new data store, every sync job,

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,260
every environmental variable

75
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,753
someone adds just for the time being.

76
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,100
Frankenstacking is not one bad decision,

77
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,073
happens because of 50 reasonable ones.

78
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,260
And once the symptoms appear,

79
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,690
the creepy crawlies have
made home in your system

80
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,950
and the symptoms come out.

81
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,950
Latency, cache inconsistency,
schema drifts, surprise cost.

82
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,460
A debugging process that
takes three Slack channels,

83
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,130
a seance, and goat's blood sprinkled

84
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,740
three times over your left shoulder.

85
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,990
They're aren't big traumatic failures.

86
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,830
They're annoying, creepy crawly
ones like the little beetles

87
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,380
that get inside your pumpkin
and turn it into mush.

88
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,320
So let's move from the
theoretical to a customer story.

89
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,960
A high scale E-Commerce platform

90
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,540
running a pricing optimization engine.

91
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,453
Here's where all of these
little decisions have added up.

92
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,563
So we're gonna start with a
user who's clicking Buy Now on,

93
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,163
I don't know, maybe a
Frankenstein costume, let's say.

94
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,770
We wanna personalize a discount

95
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,130
based on their intent and live inventory.

96
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,470
Very normal, very normal.

97
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,623
At this moment, your
system springs into action.

98
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,800
It's gonna hit the inventory system,

99
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,790
your OLTP database, event
stream's gonna work,

100
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,100
all very classic patterns.

101
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,830
We're about to see like
a tiny spark hitting

102
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,790
those dry fall leaves when
an agent comes into play,

103
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,981
and the request fans out,

104
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:46,140
all the different systems
that we're going to touch.

105
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,240
And each of these different
systems is gonna operate

106
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,773
independently with its own
SLAs and its own quirks.

107
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,350
So the next step, our
agent springs in action.

108
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,851
It's gonna be in orchestrating by pulling

109
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:05,701
cache profiles from your key value store,

110
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:09,240
recent behavioral trend from
your time series database,

111
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,693
and blending that together
with the pricing engine.

112
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,950
Next we're gonna add search and discovery.

113
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,890
So agent's gonna queries your search DB

114
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,460
for similar products, queries
your vector DB for embeddings

115
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,090
and similarity matches, going
back to your product catalog

116
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,330
and your inventory levels,
pulling all of that.

117
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,650
And of course, we're hoping

118
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,983
that this returns in
under 50 milliseconds.

119
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,900
But of course, we're not even done yet.

120
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,733
There's more.

121
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,173
You wanna improve your models.

122
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,890
So you're adding in your lakehouse,

123
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,193
you're adding in your analytics
warehouse, reporting tables,

124
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,400
model training orchestration.

125
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,700
All of that data is now
exported, transformed,

126
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,540
reingested, versioned,
stitched back together

127
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,390
to be put into their online system.

128
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,240
Not only that, we essentially
have two parallel stacks.

129
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,240
One for our real-time
and one for our batch.

130
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,730
Our architecture is now
basically a giant spiderweb

131
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,113
of interdependencies.

132
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,040
In our POC, our life was simple.

133
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,070
We had maybe three systems, a web app,

134
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,473
OLTP database, a vector store.

135
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,770
Fast forward to production.

136
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,143
We now have a small village of systems.

137
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,700
So quick show of hands, how many of you

138
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,320
have an architecture diagram

139
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,473
more like the one on the left
than the one on the right?

140
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,483
It's okay, guys.

141
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:52,320
This is a safe space.

142
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,280
You can raise your hands.

143
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,420
I see some.

144
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,983
I see some pained smiles.

145
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,510
The one on the left, right?

146
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,963
So it's okay, this here
is your support group.

147
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:15,420
Instead of going with the
clean architecture diagram,

148
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,590
we have an architecture diagram

149
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,930
that looks like we've
disemboweled a martian,

150
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,770
put it on a slide and
said, yeah, sure, ship it.

151
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,603
It's perfect.

152
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,150
And the worst part here is those of us

153
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,230
with experience know that over time,

154
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,230
supporting the architecture
diagram on the left

155
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,243
is even worse than building it.

156
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Right, because like.

157
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,990
Let's look at some zombie
pipelines over here

158
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,330
that should have died years ago.

159
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,130
We have a skeleton crew for support

160
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,045
that isn't even pictured here.

161
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:59,192
With the the real human
cost and a web of connection

162
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:02,673
that feels like the world's
saddest haunted house.

163
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,920
And the whole thing works
because you have an entire team

164
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,750
of people who are living

165
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,400
and breathing every day just
to keep this propped up.

166
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,860
So let's go ahead and
enumerate some of these costs.

167
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,683
Latency, which spikes unpredictably,

168
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,453
embeddings that drift,
caches that are stale,

169
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,480
and complexity that ramps up.

170
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,260
Suddenly everyone, instead of
getting a good recommendation,

171
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,060
is getting a recommendation

172
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,043
based on your interest in clown shoes.

173
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,860
You fix one problem

174
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,740
and there's more problems
decomposing over in the corner.

175
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,260
In a week or two, you know
you're gonna have a whole field

176
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,790
of rotting pumpkins.

177
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,080
But don't worry,

178
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,410
you know that you have
a new project upcoming,

179
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,730
a new job offer.

180
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,500
And we're gonna get over to that new one

181
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,150
before anyone notices that
field of rotting pumpkins.

182
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,850
And of course the hiring burden
for this, just keep it up.

183
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,440
We haven't even talked about that.

184
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,910
'Cause you need experts in each

185
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,710
of these different data stores
in order to operate them.

186
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,150
Our agents aren't dashboards
at the end of the day.

187
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:23,100
They aren't batch jobs, they're
interactive stateful systems

188
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,080
that need real-time access

189
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,430
to structured, unstructured,
vector and event data.

190
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,460
If even one of these pieces is slow,

191
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,010
the entire system collapses faster

192
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,653
than a rotting pumpkin on December 4th.

193
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,593
So let's flip the problem around,

194
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,130
and let's start from the agent's needs

195
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,353
instead of the systems
that we've inherited.

196
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,940
Things are about to get simpler.

197
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,350
First, agent needs one system

198
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,540
that reads their enterprise data

199
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,965
and runs common functions like vector,

200
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:05,040
nearest neighbors, with
minimal data movement

201
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,843
and ultimately minimal overhead.

202
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,690
Needs faster development
patterns, fewer lines of code,

203
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,643
fewer dependencies to babysit.

204
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,000
Ultimately that's also
fewer tokens going in

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,250
and out of the models
that are building them.

206
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,550
Every external system you remove
is one less SDK to upgrade.

207
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,850
One less client library
to patch and one less,

208
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,460
why is this suddenly failing
in production message

209
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,833
that you're getting at Slack at 2:00 AM.

210
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,230
Of course, agents need
fewer processes to monitor.

211
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,050
Every background job, every sync task,

212
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,845
every streaming consumer you
bolt on becomes one more ghost

213
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:50,643
haunting your on-call rotation.

214
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,300
We want fewer demons involved.

215
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,353
And of course that's both the
technical and Halloween sense.

216
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,800
So when you start with the agent's needs,

217
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,680
architecture looks less
like a haunted house.

218
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,070
It starts looking like something
you can actually support

219
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,363
on Monday mornings.

220
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,340
So our customers won't let us play

221
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,690
with their production code,

222
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,960
but I can recreate something,
recreated a demo of

223
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,440
what it is they did
just to get some metrics

224
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,963
behind the Frankenstack effect.

225
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:29,490
Huge differences.

226
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,800
These are measurable differences.

227
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,763
Measurable cost, measurable
differences in velocities.

228
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,400
Just look at lines of code,

229
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,860
3x difference between single store

230
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,783
versus a bolted on system.

231
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,813
Database connections.

232
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,090
With each database connection,

233
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,243
again, that's more maintenance
that has to be done.

234
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,910
One versus two.

235
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,203
Failure points, only one
to manage instead of three.

236
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,611
Just, you can, with
each different addition

237
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:09,611
of databases, data stores,
that's more room for gremlins

238
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,493
to hide in your stack.

239
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,980
So let's talk about the part

240
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,023
every engineer in this room feels,

241
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,610
why a single database
makes production feel sane.

242
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,290
With everything living in one place,

243
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,260
your production stops
being a haunted house,

244
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,200
maze of pipelines, caches of sync jobs.

245
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,711
And why is this table only updated

246
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:45,273
at three-quarter moon cycles?

247
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,850
Your debugging is predictable.

248
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,370
CI/CD much easier with one system.

249
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,370
On-call is quieter, significantly quieter.

250
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,513
Many fewer people involved,
much faster incident resolution.

251
00:14:11,382 --> 00:14:13,200
Not to mention scaling.

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,460
Scaling gets easier as well
with one system to scale up.

253
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,720
One system that's billing,
one graph to watch,

254
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,750
one team of experts who
can do all the hard work

255
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,793
to debug your one system.

256
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,380
So we've gone from a house
full of spooky corners,

257
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,950
dangling cables, forgotten cron jobs,

258
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,460
to a clean, predictable, well-lit system

259
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,003
that your agents can use
and your teams trust.

260
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,910
All right, so let's go ahead
and we'll bring this home now.

261
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,920
When your team moves from a Frankenstack

262
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,810
to a unified database,

263
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,653
the very first thing you
will notice is speed.

264
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,943
Not theoretical speed, but human speed,

265
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,053
team speed, feature speed.

266
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,140
Because everything is now
working on a single data store.

267
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,394
You can ship updates without having

268
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:18,720
those three team meetings
or that one meeting

269
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,242
that really should just be an email.

270
00:15:21,242 --> 00:15:26,100
Product managers like me can
get features out in just weeks

271
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,730
rather than months of wrangling all

272
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,230
of the different engineering
teams to get it done.

273
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,403
Nobody has to maintain that
one mysterious ETL job.

274
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,240
We know that ETL job,

275
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,780
the one that only runs on full moons

276
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,383
the day after February 29th.

277
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,273
So here's the big message that I want

278
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:01,800
to leave everybody here with.

279
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,063
Your Frankenstack doesn't happen
because of a bad decision.

280
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:09,720
It happens because our architectures

281
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,130
are built for dashboards,
and now we're asking them

282
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:19,130
to power real-time multimodal AI agents.

283
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,490
AI agents that need real-time state,

284
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,580
they need low latency access,

285
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,520
they need consistent vector,

286
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,513
structured and unstructured
data and no surprises.

287
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:38,460
So I want to go ahead and
thank you all for joining us.

288
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,660
Thank you for being here.

289
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,700
Thank you for putting up with
all of my bad Halloween jokes

290
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:47,130
and I hope you have a great
rest of your re:Invent.

291
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,200
By the way, if you wanna
learn more about single store,

292
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,133
we are at Booth 1559

293
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:55,920
or ask the guys in the back
over there with their hands up.

294
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,020
Thank you all very, very much.

295
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,314
Have a great re:Invent.

296
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:03,397
(audience cheering and clapping)
