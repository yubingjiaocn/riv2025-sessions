  "abstract": "The rise of AI coding and autonomous agents is transforming how developers work - enhancing productivity, improving flow state, and making development more intuitive. While simple code completion tools have existed for years, today's agentic capabilities act as collaborative partners throughout the entire development lifecycle. Through real-world examples, we'll show how these AI tools and autonomous agents bring structure and engineering maturity to development, turning prototypes into production-ready applications while keeping developers in control. You'll learn how leading teams are using these capabilities to accelerate development cycles, reduce cognitive overhead, and focus on solving meaningful problems - fundamentally changing how we build software.",
  "abstract_cn": "AI 编码和自主代理的兴起正在改变开发人员的工作方式——提高生产力、改善心流状态并使开发更加直观。虽然简单的代码补全工具已经存在多年，但当今的代理能力在整个开发生命周期中充当协作伙伴。通过实际案例，我们将展示这些 AI 工具和自主代理如何为开发带来结构化和工程成熟度，将原型转变为生产就绪的应用程序，同时让开发人员保持控制权。您将了解领先团队如何使用这些能力来加速开发周期、减少认知负担并专注于解决有意义的问题——从根本上改变我们构建软件的方式。",
