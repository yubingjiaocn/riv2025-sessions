1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,910
- Welcome.
(crowd applauding)

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,710
It's really hard to
see everybody out there

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,470
with the lights on, but
I hear you out there.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,300
So thank you for coming.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,090
We appreciate your
attendance and attention.

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,350
My name is Ben Schreiner.

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,150
I'm the head of AI

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,330
and Modern Data Strategy
Business Development at AWS,

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,610
and I welcome you to our session.

10
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,890
I'll ask my good friend
Michael to introduce himself.

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,390
- Hello, everybody, and
thanks for being here.

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,350
Michael Bachman.

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,180
I run research at Boomi.

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,040
This is market, technical,

15
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,620
and all things geopolitical
research as well.

16
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,763
It's a lot of fun,

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,000
and I've been doing that for quite a bit.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,080
- My name is Barry Gerdsen.

19
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,730
I'm the channel CTO for Boomi.

20
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,530
I've been with Boomi for eight years now

21
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,560
and really excited to be
here before you all today.

22
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,000
- All right, let's start

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,710
with a little audience participation

24
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,920
and make sure you're
all alive and well here.

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,320
So if we could pull up the first question,

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,270
and we'll do a raise hand queue here

27
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,693
to see if any of you have
an executive mandate.

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,633
Anyone?

29
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:02,610
Okay, that's probably half.

30
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,380
We'll call it half, all right.
- Half, yeah.

31
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,050
- We're trying to gauge the
audience so that we can tailor

32
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,120
the messaging at the right
altitude for the audience.

33
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,640
So bear with us.

34
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,613
We've got a couple more questions for you.

35
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:17,280
Any of you deliberately
actually on purpose

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,123
using AI or agentic systems at work?

37
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,243
Okay, awesome.

38
00:01:23,243 --> 00:01:24,720
Anybody that has an agent

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,093
doing their whole job for them right now?

40
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,033
Not yet.

41
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:29,948
All right, good to see.

42
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:31,980
Thank you for laughing, whoever did.

43
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,584
That was a joke.

44
00:01:33,584 --> 00:01:35,782
And lastly here, if you could,

45
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:40,110
let's raise our hands way up
if you're super concerned.

46
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,316
Halfway up if you're kind of concerned.

47
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:43,976
And if you're not concerned at all,

48
00:01:43,976 --> 00:01:45,723
just keep your hands down.

49
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,740
All right, we have a level of concern.

50
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,930
All right, there we go.

51
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,180
All right, that definitely helps us gauge

52
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,810
the rest of this talk with
our esteemed guest here.

53
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,512
All right, I think we can advance.

54
00:01:59,512 --> 00:02:01,860
- Oh, yeah, let's advance this way.

55
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,780
- Yeah, or forward backwards.

56
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,540
- Ah, whatever.
- Chacha here at the...

57
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,980
Here's our agenda, if we will.

58
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,190
We're gonna walk through we
all five of these pillars.

59
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,720
The first half of the conversation

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,073
will be between myself and Michael,

61
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:19,178
and then we'll pivot to Barry's
content to bring us home.

62
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:21,451
And gentlemen, please feel free to augment

63
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:24,120
each other's answers as you see fit.

64
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,953
- Thank you.

65
00:02:24,953 --> 00:02:27,660
- All right, so without further ado,

66
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,590
if you could, Michael,
what is an agent, really?

67
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,390
- Yeah, so...

68
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,640
Okay, so we all have a general definition

69
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,170
of an agent, right?

70
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,470
In the before times, we
called it a computer program.

71
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,320
And so I like to think
of it as nothing more

72
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,430
than a computer program

73
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,060
with a different layer of
computation, access to tools,

74
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,190
and also something in the environment

75
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,840
that's it's going to learn from.

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,881
And so before we can even
talk about what an agent is,

77
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:57,557
I like to talk about agency in general,

78
00:02:57,557 --> 00:02:59,970
and that's what these five pillars are.

79
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,340
So there's some level of autonomy

80
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,770
that this computer
program is going to have.

81
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,281
And there's a neat slide that
we'll show in just a minute

82
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:14,190
talking about our trust
versus autonomy as well.

83
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,660
But planning and reasoning

84
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,660
is something that an
agentic system will do.

85
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,430
And predominantly, that's going to be

86
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,060
with the kind of computational
architecture that we have,

87
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,490
as you all know, with generative AI.

88
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,150
But this could also be discriminative AI

89
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,080
in the mix as tooling.

90
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,300
But realistically, planning and reasoning

91
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,250
seems to be largely offloaded

92
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,525
to these types of generative systems

93
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:41,039
that are sort of the
brains of these agents.

94
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,008
Humans are agents, of course,

95
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:45,873
and we plan and reason on our own as well,

96
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:49,314
in maybe a different way than the model

97
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:52,860
that we use in the box is,

98
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,930
but that's one area.

99
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,260
Another area is being
reactive and proactive

100
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,210
in a particular environment.

101
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,460
So being reactive to
something like a prompt

102
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,400
versus proactive, like taking a prompt,

103
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,670
inferring what's meant and
going and finding extra answers.

104
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,852
Just as an example,
learning and adaptation

105
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:16,226
is also part of a part
of what it means to be

106
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:19,710
an agentic system of
some kind or have agency.

107
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,430
And so this learning and
adaptation changes over time.

108
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,410
How we learn what intelligence is.

109
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,504
These are all open
questions now in research,

110
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:30,000
in academic research and otherwise,

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,230
but this is important to know

112
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,390
because these agents and agentic systems

113
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,900
that we're creating, if we
want them to emulate humans

114
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,910
and what it means to be human,

115
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,070
we have to think about
how we learn and adapt

116
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,560
before we can truly accept and trust

117
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,220
how a non-human based
agentic system will act.

118
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,300
And that all is boiled down
to how oriented to a goal

119
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,470
the agent really is.

120
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,660
And so this question of alignment

121
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,940
is something that we
need to be thinking about

122
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,780
in the audience.

123
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,250
I do have another polling question.

124
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,420
- Yeah, please fire away, yeah.

125
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,000
So, of you all, how many of you work

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,740
on fine-tuning models or
creating models for agents,

127
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,263
or not even agents, just generative AI?

128
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,073
Do I have any data scientists in the room?

129
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,093
- All right.
- Okay.

130
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:17,250
- I got one.
- Yeah.

131
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,500
- Who here is using an agent right now?

132
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,670
Like, actively.

133
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,503
All right, couple.

134
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:22,503
Good, good, good.

135
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,290
Who here wants to use an agent,

136
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,600
and that's why you showed
up to this session?

137
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,460
Excellent, lots of more hands going up.

138
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,010
All right, so we're on the learning curve

139
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,967
for most of the audience.

140
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:37,110
So that helps us set the right altitude

141
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,520
for the rest of the talk.

142
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,680
And so the next question
I have for you, Michael,

143
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,250
if I could, is, what are important factors

144
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,770
one needs to consider when using an agent?

145
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,090
So most of us aren't in
the audience, but want to,

146
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,340
so what should they be considering

147
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,050
as they go down this path?

148
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,160
- Okay, so there was a slide

149
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,993
that was out of order,

150
00:05:56,993 --> 00:05:58,770
so forgive me for going back.

151
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,330
This one right here.
- There we go.

152
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,070
- So there was an MIT survey

153
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,750
that was conducted,

154
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,880
and you probably have seen
something similar to this,

155
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,022
where 19 out of 20 projects fail,

156
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:11,283
and failed to make it out of pilot.

157
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,622
So I was at MIT a couple of weeks ago,

158
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:18,780
working with some
scientists and stuff there.

159
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,195
And while I was there, it was
with the scissor researchers,

160
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:26,820
not the same people who
conducted this particular survey.

161
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,720
However, the survey really
boils down to a couple of things

162
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,870
that are of concern if
we want to use agents.

163
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,680
And one of them is,
integration is a big problem.

164
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,468
So giving any type of
software system access to data

165
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,796
or information that could be used in a way

166
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:50,610
that is not deterministic is one barrier,

167
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,870
but not being able to integrate

168
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,030
with those data sources is one big issue.

169
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,488
The second big issue

170
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:58,546
with this particular
survey and others as well,

171
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:03,171
is that, culturally, two things.

172
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:06,870
One, there has to be ROI attached

173
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,660
to what these agentic
systems are going to do.

174
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,540
If there's no value, it
becomes a science project.

175
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,150
And right now, a lot of
pressure is being put on boards,

176
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,740
it's being put on executives,

177
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,710
and it's being put on people like us

178
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,180
who are operators within our business,

179
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,400
trying to bring these things to light.

180
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,400
The second thing of, you
know, the cultural shift

181
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,680
is we have to think about new
ways to employ these systems.

182
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,870
Up until now, all of the
software that we've been building

183
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,850
has been largely deterministic.

184
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,760
And because of that, we have rules.

185
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,400
If this condition exists, then do this.

186
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,470
Otherwise, do this other thing, right?

187
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,370
And so with that code,
we can be very, you know,

188
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,734
very logical and targeted.
- Explicit.

189
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:55,650
- Yep, and very explicit on
what the outcome is going to be.

190
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,480
We also have to have a margin of error

191
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,030
when we think of these
non-deterministic systems.

192
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,890
And so if we're going to introduce

193
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,710
a generative type of computational model

194
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,660
into a software program,

195
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,870
we have to be comfortable
with some level of risk

196
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,890
and also some level of variance
for what our expectation is.

197
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,500
And so what that also means is,

198
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,100
the way that we have
done things in the past

199
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,100
might not be the best
way to solve something.

200
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,933
- To go forward.

201
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:26,670
- And so if we're going
to use an agentic system,

202
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,110
we also have to be comfortable

203
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,080
with our deterministic answers,

204
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,421
not necessarily being the right way

205
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:36,930
to go about solving a
problem in a novel way.

206
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,256
And so the last thing I'll say

207
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:41,943
just on this one topic as well,

208
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,065
the really, really cool
thing I think that agents

209
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:51,060
and generative AI brings us
is the ability to fail fast.

210
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,040
And when we think about failing,

211
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,710
to me, that is a feedback
loop of learning.

212
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,750
And I tell my kids that all of the time.

213
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,010
Failure is learning.

214
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,750
So as long as you learn from your,

215
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,550
you know, whatever happened before

216
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,110
and you update the weights in your head,

217
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,510
I don't necessarily say that
to them exactly like that,

218
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,400
but this is essentially

219
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,830
how we're going to learn
and adapt in our world.

220
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,950
The great thing I think
about generative systems

221
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,750
is that we can fail fast and
prototype quickly and move on.

222
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,972
The downside is, we can fail fast.

223
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:23,534
And if we're putting a lot of weight

224
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:27,150
on what these agents and
agentic systems are doing,

225
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,940
it can also cause side
effects that we don't expect

226
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,590
in the business as well.

227
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,586
So, don't go into production right away.

228
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:34,419
- Yeah, Barry, something to add?

229
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:36,330
- So is it fair to say then, Mike,

230
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,242
that maybe within this 95% statistic,

231
00:09:39,242 --> 00:09:44,010
these 19 out of 20 that
aren't, or failing, let's say,

232
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,690
that there's room for AI agents

233
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,480
that might do analysis of the failures

234
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,710
to be able to make some of those

235
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,820
or to be able to rectify,
maybe even autonomously,

236
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,410
some of the failures that happen to have

237
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,900
within that 19 or 20 that you find?

238
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,130
- Sounds like you're leading the witness,

239
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,560
but, yeah, I think so.
(Barry laughs)

240
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,060
Yeah, so we can use our agents

241
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,215
to be able to assess and evaluate,

242
00:10:05,215 --> 00:10:08,943
you know, failure
conditions, risk conditions,

243
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,833
anything that's going to
potentially be deleterious

244
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,218
you know, to an objective.

245
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:17,520
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

246
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,290
- All right.
- Cool.

247
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,760
- Our next question,
"Why Boomi for agents?"

248
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,593
- Right.

249
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:28,410
So, for those of you who
have built agents so far,

250
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,870
have you used open source systems

251
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,820
like open source agent builders?

252
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,840
Has anybody used like
Salesforce to build an agent?

253
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,141
It's okay, I know we're
at an AWS conference.

254
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:40,558
(Barry laughs)
It's okay.

255
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:41,670
How about AWS?

256
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,520
Have you built agents
in AWS at this point?

257
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,123
It's a pretty good
platform, I'll say that.

258
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:49,581
And one thing about Boomi,

259
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:52,371
we're built on top of AWS as well.

260
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:56,820
The idea though is that Boomi

261
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,120
is really focused not
only on agent builds,

262
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,090
but on observability and
governance of agents.

263
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,830
And so a lot of the things that we can do

264
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:10,260
or when you make agents,
we can give you oversight.

265
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,030
And Barry's gonna talk a a little bit more

266
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,400
about this in a bit.

267
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,600
But think of it as like, when
we go to McCarran Airport,

268
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,650
or what used to be McCarran,

269
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,330
I think it's something else now.

270
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,580
But whatever, the airport
here in Las Vegas,

271
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,900
there's a control tower there

272
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,120
and it's monitoring all
of the flight traffic

273
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,390
regardless to which airlines
we're talking about.

274
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,500
In the same way,

275
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,381
our control tower monitors
agents of different types,

276
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:38,220
tailing logs, looking
at how different agents

277
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,540
interact with each other.

278
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,450
These are just examples of
one thing that we need to do

279
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,730
in order to help our customers govern

280
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,730
their agentic landscape, whatever
that's going to look like.

281
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,870
- Gotcha.
- Yeah, Barry.

282
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,930
- Yeah, I mean if even thinking
about autonomous agents

283
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,716
and things that will
execute, well, autonomously,

284
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:57,360
you start to think about, if
you didn't have governance,

285
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,212
what the implications would be?

286
00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:02,971
And, you know, anyone who's
seen an autonomous process

287
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,410
or, let's say, something

288
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,931
that didn't have a human
in the loop happen,

289
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:08,670
where that can go wrong.

290
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,570
Just start to think about,

291
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,747
well, what happens now if
we have some of these agents

292
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:16,110
which, you know, can have
a degree of variability?

293
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,680
You introduce that into this,
you know, agent calling,

294
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,530
another agent calling,
another agent making choices,

295
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,910
how that could potentially go wrong.

296
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,010
You really start to understand
how a human in the loop

297
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,990
is kind of necessary just to make sure

298
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,690
or mitigate the risk involved.

299
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,720
- So for the audience, help
us understand how Boomi

300
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,370
is differentiated in this space.

301
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,260
So you mentioned a bunch
of different providers

302
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,492
providing agents in a
different ways to do it.

303
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,000
What's unique about Boomi's approach?

304
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,380
- Yeah, so several different things.

305
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,272
One is being able to
observe agentic behavior

306
00:12:46,272 --> 00:12:50,190
and providing governance
guardrails, that sort of thing.

307
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,810
That's at the agent layer.

308
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,550
But the tooling layer is also something

309
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,082
that's very interesting as well.

310
00:12:55,082 --> 00:12:55,915
- How so?
- And so...

311
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:58,260
Well, like creating processes.

312
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,280
A business process,

313
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,010
like, for those of you who are familiar

314
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,560
with hire to retire, order-to-cash

315
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,640
or any type of back office
workflow, just as an example,

316
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,120
that can be built by whatever
integration platform you use,

317
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,020
within our framework, we
can turn those into tools.

318
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,940
We can turn those into
tools via RAG pipeline, MCP.

319
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,270
We can do a lot of different techniques

320
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,490
to make sure that whatever processes,

321
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,066
whatever access to data,
whether they're file data,

322
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:31,626
database data, endpoints for APIs,

323
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:34,588
those all get exposed,
created, abstracted,

324
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:38,580
whatever the case is, we
can make that all useful.

325
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,720
The other thing that we can do as well

326
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,430
is really separate out what it means

327
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,240
to integrate applications and also data.

328
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,350
And so what I mean by
that is we can validate

329
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,780
how different agentic systems

330
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,733
are performing their task and compare that

331
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:01,110
with what we think they
should do deterministically

332
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,420
and bring the human in the
loop like you're talking about.

333
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,639
And what this does is it allows our users

334
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,610
to gain trust from the overall platform.

335
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,690
And there's much, much more.

336
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,100
And the the last thing I'll bring up

337
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,750
and I think is a real, real big separator

338
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,710
from us and others,

339
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,920
that is, with Boomi,
you create in the cloud

340
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,380
and you run wherever you want to.

341
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,410
If security is important to you,

342
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,350
if privacy is important to you

343
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,443
and your integrations need to,

344
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:35,100
and your tooling needs to
abide by whatever processes

345
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,420
and whatever policies that
you have for your enterprise,

346
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,270
with Boomi, you can do the sorts of things

347
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:47,270
to keep your data path separate
from the actual design time.

348
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,490
Runtime is separate from the design time.

349
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,550
So if you're about
things like sovereignty,

350
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,600
especially as we move

351
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,120
into a different geopolitical situation,

352
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,219
if you do business internationally

353
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:02,820
outside of the United States in any way,

354
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,300
you can install your runtimes
anywhere you want to,

355
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,490
as many or as few of them as necessary

356
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,320
to execute whatever tasks.

357
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,510
So those agents ingenix
systems would be able

358
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,790
to take advantage of
the integration features

359
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,623
that we have there.

360
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,070
- Really allows that flexibility.

361
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,810
- Huge flexibility and
complete differentiator.

362
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,918
- Great, Barry something to add?

363
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:23,647
- I have that come up
a lot in terms of GDPR.

364
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,760
You know, a lot of people
have GDPR regulations

365
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,750
that they're concerned with,

366
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,658
you know, where the data exists.

367
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:33,453
You know, maybe by penalty
of, you know, local law,

368
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,880
you have a mandate that says

369
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,650
your data must exist and must run

370
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,752
and must execute and stay
within the logical boundaries

371
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:43,332
of that geographic region.

372
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:46,740
So, a lot of times, Boomi's
runtime the separation

373
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,510
between our runtime and our platform.

374
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,610
The fact that the
runtime can live anywhere

375
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,290
really plays nicely into that concern.

376
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,930
So a lot of business comes
our way for that reason.

377
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,840
The other kind of one thing
I'll kind of chime in on

378
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,570
is Boomi's vendor agnostic approach.

379
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,940
You know, like, there's a lot
of folks out in the market

380
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,010
that kind of do what we do,

381
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,862
and they might be tied to a larger company

382
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:10,830
that wants to sell you larger objectives.

383
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,250
So not necessarily that the
product really is all that bad

384
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,320
'cause there's a lot of
good competitors out there,

385
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,274
but their roadmaps will be in service

386
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:21,690
to those larger objectives,

387
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,860
the things that they want sell you.

388
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,124
So the things that their
roadmap will express

389
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,120
is not so vendor agnostic,

390
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,433
whereas Boomi tends to
be a very even play field

391
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:32,640
among all of our vendors
that we deal with.

392
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,740
- Yep.
- Awesome, great.

393
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,020
So I've got some history with Boomi,

394
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,007
and what I remember is it being an amazing

395
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:42,060
integration platform, right?

396
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,010
Best in the business.

397
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,140
And now that we have agents and MCP

398
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,430
and all these other techniques,

399
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,280
is integration still important?

400
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,570
- Yeah.

401
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,750
Like, this shows integration
is one of the reasons

402
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,740
why going from prototype to production

403
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,560
is very difficult to do.

404
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,457
And without having the proper
integration steps, it's hard.

405
00:17:06,457 --> 00:17:10,080
I wanna redefine what integration
actually means though.

406
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,940
There was a time when it meant

407
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,170
to take two or more disparate systems,

408
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,530
expose APIs or expose away an interface

409
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,040
to be able to have those
systems connect with each other,

410
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,920
transform and move data accordingly

411
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,130
relative to a process of
service or something like this.

412
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,060
And when I say process,

413
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,933
I mean like a business process
in in our nomenclature.

414
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,010
The way that I would
define integration now

415
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,020
includes a couple of other elements.

416
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,750
It does include automation with it.

417
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,594
The ability to not only
take a manual process

418
00:17:46,594 --> 00:17:49,110
and, you know, automate pieces of it,

419
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,480
but create end-to-end automations,

420
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,580
and then also orchestration.

421
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,400
So orchestration becomes the element

422
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,690
where you can create your
programs, your services,

423
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,120
your agents, whatever it is,

424
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,630
and have full and utter
control over the governance

425
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,060
of those created assets.

426
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,680
And so with that,

427
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,413
we need things like the
ability to do simple things

428
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:17,333
like ETL or virtual ETL

429
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,520
or the ability to capture changes in data

430
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,620
as it flows from a transaction system

431
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,398
to an analytical system, and back again.

432
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:31,398
The ability to connect in
real-time or near real-time

433
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,230
how different systems are
interacting with each other

434
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,690
and updating the metadata accordingly,

435
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,080
and all of the data needs to
be where it it needs to go.

436
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,910
The other thing is APIs.

437
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,732
Making sure that you can not
only expose or create them

438
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:48,038
but also manage them as well.

439
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:50,970
Regardless to, you know,
what type of API gateway

440
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,640
or however many API gateways you have

441
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,170
of different flavors and varieties.

442
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,129
And the last thing is
to adapt to the changes

443
00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:00,570
in the AI landscape as they come.

444
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,985
So, for instance, we were
talking about RAG pipelines.

445
00:19:03,985 --> 00:19:05,580
Everybody familiar with RAG,

446
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,140
Retrieval-Augmented Generation?

447
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,973
A lot of head nods.

448
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:09,210
Okay, good.

449
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,080
And if you're not,

450
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,690
this is something that's
been really in the market

451
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,030
with 19 different architectural types,

452
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,280
really, in the last couple of years.

453
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,280
Well, this new technology,
MCP, has come along

454
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:25,020
and provided a different way

455
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,920
to turn tools into very
accessible resources

456
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,570
for agents specifically.

457
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,118
So Model Context Protocol and
context engineering in general

458
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:36,210
has changed and adapted,

459
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,810
but we have to, because we're
an integration platform,

460
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,056
we're not stuck in older paradigms.

461
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:46,590
We can change and adapt to new
technologies that come out.

462
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,180
So when we're talking about A2A

463
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,790
or any type of agent to agent protocol

464
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,740
or any type of north-south protocol,

465
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,400
like MCP as an example, we're there.

466
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,807
And for people like me

467
00:19:57,807 --> 00:20:00,960
who are looking five to
10 years down the road,

468
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,020
trying to figure out
what that future world

469
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,218
is gonna look like and make
sure that we stay consistent

470
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:09,916
with what we have now to the
builds, then that's what we do.

471
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,810
So an integration platform
needs to be modern,

472
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,520
flexible, and adaptive.

473
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,353
- Yeah, I think...

474
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:16,186
I mean, that's a great point,

475
00:20:16,186 --> 00:20:18,901
and Boomi's obviously illustrated
an ability over the years,

476
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:22,342
I've known you, to continue
to evolve the platform,

477
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:25,526
to be able to incorporate and adopt

478
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:28,401
the different changing
in protocols or access

479
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:32,000
or governance or whatever
happens to be what's next.

480
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,990
- Exactly.
- Which is great.

481
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,548
Barry, you have something to add?

482
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:36,381
- Yeah, it also speaks to,

483
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:37,357
I mentioned before, vendor agnostic.

484
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:40,710
You know, we can be the MCP tools

485
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,840
that you use in your agents,

486
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,360
even if it was developed
on another framework,

487
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,680
or, you know, we support MCP
so you could develop tools

488
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,350
on another platform, and
we'll accept those tools

489
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,660
to be able to be used by the AI agents

490
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,360
that you could create using Boomi.

491
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,040
The other thing that's worth noting is,

492
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,890
you know, I know, Ben, you go
way back with the platform,

493
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,819
but Boomi was actually,
it's been around since 2006.

494
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:07,726
So, you know, by reference,
this would be around the time

495
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,530
that we were using flip
phones and Blackberries.

496
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,060
Mike probably had a goatee.

497
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,820
I had an embarrassing boy band
haircut with frosted tips.

498
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,530
It was really very tragic.

499
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,030
But it was around that time

500
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,910
that Boomi came up with
this process canvas idea,

501
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,480
and it's been very resilient
over the last two decades.

502
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,000
And the reason for it is,
is it's so darn easy to use.

503
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,510
Like, it is this, you know, drag and drop

504
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,480
wizard-driven thing that you
don't necessarily have to be,

505
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,120
or you know, be a full
scale developer to use.

506
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,721
But we've managed to model
that approach over the years

507
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:40,110
to be able to do things now

508
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,080
like to have an agent step
to be able to support RAG,

509
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,570
to be able to do things with MCP.

510
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,710
So in that way, Boomi has
evolved to be what it is today.

511
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,240
- All right, so we're gonna have...

512
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,890
- I have one thing I do wanna add.

513
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,723
- Add away.

514
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:55,500
- So this is about human agency.

515
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,430
Right?
- Yes.

516
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,770
- So I wanna bring it back
to the human for a second.

517
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,540
- Let's do that 'cause
we're all human, right?

518
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,408
- So, well, maybe most
of you are, I don't know.

519
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:05,250
- You're dicey.
- I'm dicey.

520
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,510
Like, honestly, human
agency is important to me.

521
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,490
So every morning...

522
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,983
This might sound trite, but it's true.

523
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,894
When I am researching
something for the future,

524
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:20,880
I think about how this technology

525
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,450
is going to impact the way I work,

526
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,000
the way my kids are gonna work,

527
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,250
if they're gonna have jobs, you know?

528
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,390
Are we all worried about that?

529
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,350
Maybe a little bit.

530
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,183
You know?

531
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:33,120
It's concerning.

532
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,190
These are human concerns, right?

533
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,070
How is our society
ultimately going to change

534
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,860
and how is the technology
that we're going to implement

535
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,360
going to be indicative of that?

536
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,370
And what I think needs to happen there

537
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,820
and what platforms like ours
do, and now many others,

538
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,618
is we've talked about these
democratic transformations

539
00:22:51,618 --> 00:22:54,480
in technology for a long time.

540
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,910
And when we democratize technology,

541
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:01,910
we make it accessible for
people to use and use well.

542
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,517
And the really neat thing about this tech

543
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:09,857
and where we're at in this
moment in time is we don't know

544
00:23:09,857 --> 00:23:12,150
where the jobs of the
future are going to be

545
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,670
or where society is going to be.

546
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,220
And the accessibility

547
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,630
of what agentic types of systems provide

548
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,350
is it allows everybody to
have access to be a builder.

549
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,880
Everybody in here speaks

550
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,920
some human language, I would assume.

551
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,450
- I would hope so.
- Yeah.

552
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,200
And any of your colleagues
who is a non-programmer

553
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,110
that speaks the language that
you do is now a developer,

554
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,370
just like you are.

555
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,190
And whether you're a vibe coder,

556
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,440
which is popular in today's parlance,

557
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,512
or whether you are a seasoned veteran

558
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:48,930
who's been coding for
all of her or his life,

559
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,540
or their life, it's...

560
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,400
These are...

561
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,380
You know, these worlds are converging

562
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,300
in interesting and unique ways.

563
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,320
And so platforms like ours make
it accessible for the human

564
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,540
to actually create a sense of agency

565
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,010
within the platform itself.

566
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,080
And what's really neat
about that, you know,

567
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,947
as I'm looking out, I'm thinking,

568
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,770
"What is your digital twin

569
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,380
or digital twins that
you're going to be creating

570
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,690
as an agent to augment what you do,

571
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,850
to change the way you behave,

572
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,600
to act on your behalf, knowing
what your constraints are?"

573
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,100
These are all things that are accessible

574
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,450
in platforms like ours

575
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,200
because we're giving everybody
the kind of agency necessary

576
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,640
to be able to build the tools

577
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,620
that are gonna model a future world.

578
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,570
So it's up to us to
figure out what that is.

579
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,850
Right now, super early days, for sure.

580
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,683
- It is.

581
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,700
And I'll ask a another polling question

582
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,680
just to get some audience participation.

583
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,430
Does anybody here have a part of their job

584
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,480
that's not their favorite?

585
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,760
(Michael and Barry laughing)

586
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,530
Pretty much all of us, right?

587
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,850
- I love expense reports.

588
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,780
- Yeah, well there you go.

589
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,133
Perfect one, right?

590
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,370
Where I see this technology,

591
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,170
and especially Boomi's platform,

592
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,607
helping us as human beings is
finding ways to use the tools,

593
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:05,070
create agents to do the parts of our job

594
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,290
that we don't particularly,
that are repetitive,

595
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,670
that could be automated

596
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,980
or have a workflow associated with them

597
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,950
to make our lives genuinely better, right?

598
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,388
So freeing up time for all of you

599
00:25:16,388 --> 00:25:19,080
to do the parts of your job you do enjoy,

600
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,598
that probably add more value
both to you personally,

601
00:25:21,598 --> 00:25:25,080
back to the human, but also
to your organization, right?

602
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,255
Solving the next problem, being creative,

603
00:25:27,255 --> 00:25:30,180
really tapping into what we're great at,

604
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,420
which is complex critical
thinking as a human being

605
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,910
and being creative, solving problems.

606
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,780
- Well, I hope you're right

607
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,580
about the complex critical thinking bit.

608
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,510
- Yeah.

609
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,070
- You might have seen some reports lately

610
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,145
that we're getting dumber over time.

611
00:25:44,145 --> 00:25:45,286
- Depends on who you ask.

612
00:25:45,286 --> 00:25:46,290
- It depends on who you ask.

613
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:51,270
But if we seed our critical
thinking to another system,

614
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,300
this is going to create
interesting new challenges

615
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,133
that will emerge,

616
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,870
that we're gonna have to solve
for those problems as well.

617
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:01,023
My kids, for instance, who
are both at university,

618
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:04,170
one very much uses AI,

619
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,973
the other one very much does not.

620
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,373
I notice a difference in how
they think about their world.

621
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,980
Not that the one who uses
AI doesn't think critically.

622
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,960
This person might...

623
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,720
That child actually does
think very critically.

624
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,940
My hope is that we all remember this

625
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,390
as we're governing what
we're doing in our jobs

626
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,360
or whatever we're going
to introduce agents into

627
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,590
in our day-to-day lives.

628
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,910
- And I'll add this.

629
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,380
The World Economic Forum did
a jobs report last January.

630
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,260
I encourage those...

631
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,730
I see a nod, so good.

632
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,410
If you haven't seen it, highly recommend.

633
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,370
It's free download.

634
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,537
But it has a chart of the skills

635
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:46,620
that are gonna be in high demand in 2030,

636
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,583
which isn't that far along.

637
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,289
But it makes logical sense,

638
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:52,138
a lot of the skills are human skills.

639
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:55,230
Critical thinking, learning,
influence, communicating,

640
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,460
these kinds of things.

641
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,293
If you think about it,

642
00:26:57,293 --> 00:26:59,550
if we have agents doing the mundane things

643
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,290
that we don't want to do,

644
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,870
it frees us up to do the
things that are uniquely human,

645
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,910
and therefore will be more valuable.

646
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,144
So I encourage your sons and daughters

647
00:27:08,144 --> 00:27:10,956
to go review the skills that, as parents,

648
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:13,020
we want to recommend them seeking.

649
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,750
And all of you, as you continue
your career development,

650
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,628
look at those 'cause you'll see, again,

651
00:27:17,628 --> 00:27:20,100
a demand for those human skills

652
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,363
are gonna come at a
higher, you know, value,

653
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:25,620
I think, in due course.

654
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,460
- Yeah, there's the other thing.

655
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,960
I do want a polling question here.

656
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,793
- Please.
- How many...

657
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:31,050
Do I have any liberal arts people?

658
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,820
With a liberal arts
background in the room?

659
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,810
- Not a one.

660
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,643
No one.
- Not one?

661
00:27:34,643 --> 00:27:35,476
- Oh, there's one.
- Oh, we got one.

662
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:36,510
- Excellent, there's always one.

663
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,500
- Outstanding.

664
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,320
So I was at Cornell giving
a lecture to grad students

665
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,080
and undergrads about a month ago.

666
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,970
And in the grad student
session, room full of engineers.

667
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,383
Awesome stuff.

668
00:27:49,383 --> 00:27:52,650
Different kinds of
engineers, top bright people,

669
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,580
all of that sort of thing.

670
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,370
We had one lone liberal arts person.

671
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,410
And I turned to that person and said,

672
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:03,360
you are going to be doing
very well in this new economy.

673
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,810
And the reason why is
because liberal arts people,

674
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,630
I know firsthand 'cause
my undergraduate degree

675
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,370
is in liberal arts as well

676
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,330
with German linguistics
and international affairs,

677
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,670
and then later, computer science.

678
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:21,450
But those...

679
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,370
In liberal arts, you're
taught to think critically,

680
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,370
be creative, have novel
approaches to things.

681
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,390
So, it's good.

682
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,910
So if your kids are
interested in liberal arts.

683
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,620
- Encourage, encourage.
- Yeah, encourage them

684
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,580
to go down that path.

685
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,830
- It's kind of interesting
how we used to place,

686
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,830
you know, like, an onus
on being an idea person

687
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,138
'cause it kind of made what you could do.

688
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:43,140
You couldn't do the implementation of it,

689
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,700
you just come up with the idea.

690
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,248
Now, what you're saying,

691
00:28:46,248 --> 00:28:49,230
there's greater value placed
on that versus implementation

692
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,110
because now implementation
has gotten that much easier.

693
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,360
- Well, and from an
engineering perspective too,

694
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,370
all the engineers that I've
worked with, you know, at Penn

695
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,593
and like everywhere else that I've been,

696
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,199
they're all super creative too.

697
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:04,770
Creativity is going to have
a changing and adapting role.

698
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,630
It's the critical
thinking that we all have

699
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,478
where going to be able to
govern how these agents work.

700
00:29:10,478 --> 00:29:13,500
But those are elements of human growth

701
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,290
and where agents are gonna get
better and better over time

702
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,420
or have a chance to get
better and better over time.

703
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,890
- All right, you just mentioned it,

704
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,140
and we're gonna ask you
to dig in a little deeper

705
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,527
to how important is governance.

706
00:29:24,527 --> 00:29:29,460
And most importantly, how does
Boomi help with governance?

707
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,509
- Yeah, so governance means
a lot of different things.

708
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:32,970
We talked about autonomy,

709
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,466
we talked about an agent and what that is.

710
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:37,710
What I really want to get into,

711
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,130
and, sorry, I'm flipping
around here, is this.

712
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,250
So there's a newer version of this slide,

713
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,720
but this is a two by two
where I think governance

714
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,100
really comes into trust versus autonomy.

715
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,140
The more we trust a system,

716
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,700
the more we're going to
give that system ability

717
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,520
to act in the world.

718
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,250
And if we just think about us as humans

719
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,960
and how we interact with each other,

720
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,135
and I don't mean to
anthropomorphize agents in general

721
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:11,935
that we are talking about,
you know, in this conference,

722
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,950
but I'm gonna in a little bit just

723
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,380
to give us a mental model to work off of.

724
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,380
If we think about how we
trust a coworker, ourselves,

725
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:25,620
you know, somebody else, our
children to do something,

726
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,740
we'll give them more
freedom to do that thing.

727
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,130
And so at this conference
I was at a couple,

728
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,490
about a month ago, we
came up with this matrix,

729
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,710
which we have a human in the loop

730
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,740
where we've got high
trust but low autonomy.

731
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,670
We have human on the loop,
which is high autonomy

732
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,280
but not necessarily high
trust at this point.

733
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,650
And then the polar opposites.

734
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,290
In the upper right-hand
corner, this is full autonomy.

735
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,453
When we think of like autonomous vehicles,

736
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,960
you know, operating here
in the Las Vegas area,

737
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,205
that would be an example of
something that's a trusted agent

738
00:31:00,205 --> 00:31:03,510
or an expert system on
a manufacturing line.

739
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,980
Those are examples of that.

740
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,110
In the lower left-hand corner though,

741
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,940
where we refuse as humans

742
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,480
to give agency to an agentic system

743
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,480
in either context or in
production or in processing,

744
00:31:21,578 --> 00:31:24,270
this is ripe for disruption.

745
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,528
So, in other words, if
one has manual processes

746
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:31,890
that they're going to do and
not willing to seed autonomy,

747
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:36,030
this is going to create a disruptive case.

748
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,101
And so what I think will
happen at this particular point

749
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:45,390
is that if companies that
you are competing against

750
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,985
or organizations where you are
stifled by not using agents

751
00:31:48,985 --> 00:31:51,848
or not moving fast enough to,

752
00:31:51,848 --> 00:31:53,994
those types of companies

753
00:31:53,994 --> 00:31:57,450
are opening themselves up to disruption.

754
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:01,230
Conversely, we're
probably not going to just

755
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:05,103
give the keys of the
kingdom to an agent full on

756
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:07,680
for a very, very long time,

757
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,230
until such time that
trust has been established

758
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,690
with those agents to
do that sort of thing.

759
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,410
So the goal is to move from
this lower left-hand box

760
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,670
into the upper left-hand, or
the lower right-hand at least,

761
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,730
so that we can have the human
involved in the governance

762
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:28,730
and processing context provision
for that particular agent.

763
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,130
And so where we have
this today, for instance,

764
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:35,340
is something simple like
a human in the loop.

765
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,460
Human provides the context,
the agent processes.

766
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,200
This would be an example of using,

767
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,600
say, a chat system of some kind.

768
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,748
You're providing a prompt, it
goes out and does the work.

769
00:32:45,748 --> 00:32:47,400
You're not doing the work,

770
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,390
but largely that is a real
thing that we can do today.

771
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,000
Human on the loop is something like,

772
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,130
the agents going out and finding something

773
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,220
and checking in with you
to see if that's okay.

774
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,270
In our platform,

775
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,930
and one of the differentiators
is this validation step.

776
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,150
So, for instance, if you have systems

777
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,390
where you've got two
different addresses for you,

778
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,450
one in your old house
that you just lived in

779
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,580
and maybe the new house that you moved to,

780
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,500
that needs to be updated by a human.

781
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,570
Today we can do this deterministically.

782
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:22,050
But at scale, if agents
are going to be determining

783
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,900
whether or not there's
an A case or a B case

784
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,810
or a red case or a blue
case or a green case

785
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,990
and needs a human to act
as the final arbitrary

786
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,370
of what's going to happen,

787
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,650
that is the case where
the human is on the loop

788
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,030
in that particular point.

789
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,764
So, the way that Boomi handles that

790
00:33:38,764 --> 00:33:39,597
is we provide all of the tools

791
00:33:39,597 --> 00:33:42,360
to be able, you know, to
govern this sort of approach.

792
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,370
Giving humans more trust,

793
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,490
allowing humans to see
what the agents are doing,

794
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,610
and giving more trust in the
process for the human to move

795
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:53,909
from this lower left
to the other quadrants.

796
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:54,750
- Yeah, Barry.

797
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,010
- [Barry] I think that's
particularly valuable

798
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,020
when you're talking
about anomaly detection.

799
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,660
You know, like, let's say that
there happens to be an agent

800
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,910
that is existing and that you've created

801
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,920
and you wanna make sure
that you've established

802
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,390
a baseline of executions

803
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,280
so that any spikes or
abnormalities that should occur,

804
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,790
that you're detecting and
then providing governance

805
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,580
and, like Mike was saying,
being that human in the loop

806
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,413
that can determine

807
00:34:15,413 --> 00:34:17,760
whether either I need to
adjust those thresholds

808
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,770
or something has legitimately gone wrong

809
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,600
and I need to be able
to either kill the agent

810
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,653
or act responsibility to alter the agent

811
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:27,030
to make this work better.

812
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,863
- [Ben] You know what?

813
00:34:27,863 --> 00:34:30,480
I really like this focus
on trust and autonomy.

814
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,240
Has everybody used an
assistant of some kind

815
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,430
and had a hallucination of some kind?

816
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,780
Everybody?

817
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,760
Like, that is...

818
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,664
It happens, and that can
erode trust with the humans

819
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,780
or the people who are trying
to adopt these systems.

820
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,580
And so as practitioners,

821
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,730
we've gotta find ways to
validate and make sure

822
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,160
that we're reducing the hallucinations

823
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,160
or the times where the
system gets it wrong.

824
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,307
Otherwise, the adoption of said system

825
00:34:58,307 --> 00:35:00,661
is gonna not be where we need it to be,

826
00:35:00,661 --> 00:35:03,301
to solve whatever problem
we intended to solve.

827
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,570
So I really like how you've laid this out

828
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,000
because it is a sliding scale,

829
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,190
and you're on it somewhere.
- Somewhere.

830
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,300
- [Ben] And some processes

831
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,670
may be in different parts over time,

832
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:18,750
but ideally, this gives you
a roadmap on how to proceed.

833
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,680
- Yeah, and they could move

834
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,720
in and out of these stages as well.

835
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,553
The other thing,

836
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,327
just on the point that
you mentioned about trust,

837
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:26,327
and I know Barry's got a lot to say too.

838
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,780
The more we trust and the
more we seed authority,

839
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,180
we also run a risk as well.
- Indeed.

840
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,820
- 'Cause if these agents
are performing at,

841
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,740
you talked about hallucination,

842
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,610
let's say we get to a stage
where an agent is hallucinating

843
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,560
less than 1% of the time.

844
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,660
That could lull us into submission.

845
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,780
- Yeah.
- And when that happens,

846
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,610
this is exactly where we need to go.

847
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,960
Forced autonomy, all right,

848
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,360
the agent's gonna do all
of the automated work,

849
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,740
but we're gonna need to do some auditing

850
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,420
and spot checking and this sort of thing.

851
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,130
And so that's important.

852
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,020
- And kind of thinking
back to that original stat

853
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,700
that you have about the 95%,

854
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,780
it's probably fair to say

855
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,690
that there's a fair percentage in that 95%

856
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,970
where AI agents were being
asked to do something

857
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,550
that probably an AI agent
shouldn't be asked to do,

858
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,390
maybe was just best left
as a deterministic process.

859
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,620
- Indeed.
- All right.

860
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,050
We're gonna pivot now to Boomi's AI story.

861
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,858
Barry, if you would, give us a feel for,

862
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:24,333
at a high level, what that has been.

863
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,350
- So, Boomi's AI stories
is really interesting

864
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,940
in that you can kind of break it out

865
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,850
into three different ways, really,

866
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,220
that we've incorporated AI.

867
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,060
One is the way in which
we enable you to do

868
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,170
kind of, let's say,
AI-related things using Boomi.

869
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,940
Like we said that Boomi
has a process canvas

870
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,250
that allows you to be able to
have an orchestration layer,

871
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,430
allows you to be able to
accomplish your AI objectives

872
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,600
within your organization,

873
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,250
and even to be able to create agents

874
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,170
that could call other agents
and could call other agents

875
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,150
and do things like that.

876
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:01,170
That's fairly, you know,
rudimentary within Boomi right now.

877
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,660
There is the AI that
we've built into the tool

878
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,399
to make using Boomi a more
natural language process thing.

879
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:10,243
So as to democratize innovation,

880
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:12,450
like you were mentioning before, Mike.

881
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,283
But then, of course,

882
00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:15,150
the thing that's really most interesting

883
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,180
for the purposes of this
conversation is Agent Studio.

884
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,390
In Agent Studio, we provide
you with an agent designer

885
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,580
so that you can build AI agents

886
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,500
using natural language processing.

887
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,277
So you could literally come in and say,

888
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:28,590
"I'd like to create an agent

889
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,910
that does this, this and this."

890
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:34,110
And then Boomi will use AI to create AI

891
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,041
and it will actually allow a business user

892
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:38,340
to come in and create their own AI agents.

893
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,278
It will actually create the
disposition of the chat,

894
00:37:41,278 --> 00:37:44,949
you know, the ChatGPT that you can use,

895
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:48,139
it will go in, create all
the tasks, the instructions,

896
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:49,890
you can assign it tooling,

897
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,750
you know, so that if that AI agent

898
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,480
needs to be able to reference
other sources of information,

899
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,450
other data sources, other APIs,

900
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,124
it will easily enable you to do so.

901
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:01,800
And we also offer you a test harness

902
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,526
for being able to test out
the AI agents that you create

903
00:38:04,526 --> 00:38:06,570
prior to deployment.

904
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,940
Now, the other thing that's
pretty exciting about that

905
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,890
is that from a governance perspective,

906
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,860
we provide you with Agent Control Tower.

907
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,980
Agent Control Tower
allows you a complete look

908
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,460
at all of the agents inside
of your entire environment.

909
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,450
And I said before,

910
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,940
Boomi specializes in
being vendor agnostic.

911
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,500
We don't let you just track agents

912
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,820
that are created in Boomi,

913
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,830
we also allow you to be able to create

914
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,080
and use agents in other systems

915
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,720
and have them be tracked
in Agent Control Tower.

916
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,840
So you get this full ecosystem
view and, you know, this...

917
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,100
A little demo here goes.

918
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,710
Moves pretty quick, but if
you see the first screen,

919
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,720
it has a bunch of little bubbles on it.

920
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,890
Those are agents that are all,

921
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,733
each different color
represents a different vendor.

922
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:48,000
Whether it be ServiceNow,
whether it be AWS,

923
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,470
whether it be Boomi,

924
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,670
we can connect to the frameworks

925
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,640
and pull in all of the agents
that you happen to create.

926
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,218
So it gives you the ability
to be able to have monitoring

927
00:38:56,218 --> 00:38:58,230
and compliance dashboards.

928
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,983
It gives you the ability
to be able to kind of see

929
00:39:00,983 --> 00:39:04,212
and flag anomalies and even
set thresholds for anomalies.

930
00:39:04,212 --> 00:39:06,390
So that if anything should go wrong

931
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,453
with any agent in your entire ecosystem,

932
00:39:08,453 --> 00:39:09,900
you could drill down,

933
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,940
you could actually get
an introspective look

934
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,580
at all of the agents and what they do,

935
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,530
and then you can make
adjustments as needed.

936
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,060
Maybe you need to kill the agent,

937
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,310
maybe you need to adjust the thresholds.

938
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,560
It gives you a full look
at all of the agents

939
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,500
and it could help you
eliminate sprawl, agent sprawl,

940
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,020
and shadow IT in your organization

941
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,490
because it'll bring to light agents

942
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,320
you might not have even known existed.

943
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,670
- [Michael] Yeah, and
it's a really good way

944
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,348
to get IT and the
business aligned as well.

945
00:39:35,348 --> 00:39:37,440
Just on that note.

946
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,639
- [Ben] That's not important.

947
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:39,739
(group laughing)

948
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:40,572
Just kidding.

949
00:39:40,572 --> 00:39:41,460
Just kidding.

950
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,430
Barry can you dive a little
deeper into how Boomi

951
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,918
helps customers operationalize their data?

952
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:49,140
The AI is only gonna be as good

953
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,150
as the data it has access to.

954
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,800
So how's Boomi helping there?

955
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,670
- Yeah, 100%.

956
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:57,300
So Boomi, actually, if
I could go back here,

957
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,524
but you see that we have four core tenets

958
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:03,660
within our Boomi enterprise platform.

959
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,980
There's integration and automation,

960
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,840
which we've talked about exhaustively.

961
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,460
There's data management as well.

962
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,720
And data management allows you

963
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,850
to be able to cleanse and enrich your data

964
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,700
in essence to be able to
make that data AI-ready.

965
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,840
So it gives you the ability

966
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,790
to be able to take a look at data

967
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,440
coming from various different sources

968
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,863
to be able to establish this
within a hub and spoke model.

969
00:40:22,863 --> 00:40:24,810
The middle of which can establish

970
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,910
golden records within Boomi

971
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,100
that has the data cleanse stage,

972
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,430
de-duped using fuzzy
logic matches if need be,

973
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,023
and provide AI-ready
data that can feed models

974
00:40:36,023 --> 00:40:39,630
or can be used in contextualized
prompts and queries

975
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,853
to be able to enrich those
queries via something like RAG

976
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,740
that you mentioned earlier.

977
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,590
RAG being Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

978
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,850
But the other thing too is that, you know,

979
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,140
within those four pillars,

980
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,810
we have integration,
automation, data management,

981
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,670
and we also have API management.

982
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,799
'Cause, of course, we
understand the importance

983
00:40:55,799 --> 00:40:58,874
of being able to use APIs and access APIs

984
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:01,140
in the agents that you create as well.

985
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,810
So Boomi has made significant investment

986
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:06,570
in being able to bring to light

987
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:10,500
basically an enterprise-grade
API management platform

988
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,810
that is now in the Gartner Magic Quadrant

989
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,890
for API management.

990
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,990
So, I think we're the only vendor actually

991
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,823
that can make that claim

992
00:41:16,823 --> 00:41:18,660
where we're in the Magic
Quadrant for Gartner,

993
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,630
for both integration and API management.

994
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,463
- Great.

995
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:25,140
All right, so Michael mentioned governance

996
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,330
and you mentioned anomalies.

997
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,220
So touch on, Barry, if you would,

998
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,500
how Boomi helps both identify anomalies,

999
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,140
what kind of anomalies,
and then importantly,

1000
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,000
like, what should we be concerned about?

1001
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,350
Why would these...

1002
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,060
Why would there be an anomaly?

1003
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,680
- Yeah, I mean there's a
lot of different anomalies

1004
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,950
that can exist within, you
know, what you're doing.

1005
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,060
You know, like we have,

1006
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,473
I think I thought I had a slide here.

1007
00:41:47,473 --> 00:41:48,420
Nope, I didn't.

1008
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,998
Okay, so as it turns out,

1009
00:41:49,998 --> 00:41:51,930
when we're talking about things

1010
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,550
that can potentially go wrong, you know,

1011
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,370
it could be a total number of invocations.

1012
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,755
So anything that could
alert you as the human

1013
00:41:58,755 --> 00:42:01,620
to something that could be
going wrong with an agent

1014
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,055
or a set of agents that might be,

1015
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:05,040
you know, one agent calling another

1016
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,920
or making some deterministic
path of execution

1017
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,030
that it shouldn't.

1018
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,620
And a lot of times within booming,

1019
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,810
even with an Agent Control
Tower, we can do things like,

1020
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:15,895
we can flag total invocations,
we can flag errors,

1021
00:42:15,895 --> 00:42:19,854
we can flag hops, you
know, along the route

1022
00:42:19,854 --> 00:42:23,280
that would indicate that, you
know, maybe there's something

1023
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,500
that has happened, that hasn't happened,

1024
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,180
or doesn't usually happen.

1025
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,730
And in that way, we could
do monitoring and reporting,

1026
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:30,720
we could do logging.

1027
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,320
We can even set up Boomi
processes that can fix

1028
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,392
or address those issues,
be it either autonomously

1029
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:39,600
or with a human in the loop to do so.

1030
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,660
- Yeah, there's some other
stuff I will add too.

1031
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,253
Also following the prompt
and sequence of executions

1032
00:42:45,253 --> 00:42:47,340
for a reasoning model.

1033
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,905
So, you know, inside of the designer,

1034
00:42:50,905 --> 00:42:52,710
you know, we're using a Claude

1035
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,989
or an Anthropic family of models.

1036
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:59,264
Pretty soon, it's going to
be bring your own as well.

1037
00:42:59,264 --> 00:43:02,580
That's for next year, which will be great.

1038
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,648
The key here is the prompts
that we as humans use

1039
00:43:05,648 --> 00:43:09,960
to govern or to create
or kick off a process,

1040
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,250
those need to be followed,

1041
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:14,280
and all of the steps
that an agent is doing

1042
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,280
to being able to grab data,
what the source data is,

1043
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,020
all of that is logged.

1044
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,800
And so when you can see all
of the actions of the agent

1045
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,874
and if it is commensurate
to the governance guardrails

1046
00:43:26,874 --> 00:43:29,970
that you put in to your framework,

1047
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,190
this is how you're going to know

1048
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,080
when everything is going right.

1049
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,985
And when it's not, then there
are flags that are sent out

1050
00:43:36,985 --> 00:43:38,670
or stoppages that will happen

1051
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:39,870
so the agent can't move forward.

1052
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,700
- Yeah, I've seen IT operations,

1053
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,890
actually, agents that have been made

1054
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,260
to basically examine logs for anomalies,

1055
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,100
just for that purpose.

1056
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,810
Just to be able to flag

1057
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:51,505
just anomalous sets of execution in logs.

1058
00:43:51,505 --> 00:43:53,790
So you can use AI agents

1059
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,373
to basically keep AI agents in line.

1060
00:43:57,825 --> 00:44:00,840
- All right, so we all work for companies.

1061
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,520
And so why don't we make this real

1062
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,230
and give some real world examples.

1063
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,640
You just touched on one of the logs,

1064
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,850
but let's explore some of
the real world examples

1065
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:12,330
and business outcomes that
agents are are impacting.

1066
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,040
- Yeah, so I was looking actually

1067
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,570
at this slide in particular.

1068
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,550
We kind of glossed over this one.

1069
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:18,383
But here, you see...

1070
00:44:18,383 --> 00:44:19,410
This is kind of a busy slide,

1071
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:21,810
but you get to see all the
different kind of things

1072
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:23,430
that you can use and create agents

1073
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,380
and what people have used agents for,

1074
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,850
whether they be personal assistance,

1075
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:29,145
coding assistance, ChatBot summaries.

1076
00:44:29,145 --> 00:44:32,580
You know, as far as how
I've seen customers use

1077
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,648
Boomi AI agents, like, I've
seen financial reporting.

1078
00:44:36,648 --> 00:44:37,860
That's a big one.

1079
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,350
You know, where people, if
you're doing expense reports,

1080
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,003
you wanna be able to flag-
- There you go.

1081
00:44:42,003 --> 00:44:45,480
- What should be thresholds
in expense reporting.

1082
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,450
Even in Boomi, we happen to
use something called ChatB,

1083
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:51,807
which actually allows us
to be able to make queries,

1084
00:44:51,807 --> 00:44:56,160
you know, for internal folks within Boomi

1085
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,690
so that they're not going out
to ChatGPT to query things,

1086
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:01,680
but they wanna get
Boomi-specific knowledge

1087
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,800
and drill down very deep within
Boomi to be able to get it.

1088
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,361
We use our own personal RAG
implementation within that

1089
00:45:07,361 --> 00:45:11,170
for our own internal GPT
operations that we're using.

1090
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,215
Did you have?
- Yeah, I definitely did.

1091
00:45:13,215 --> 00:45:15,990
So we also do these agentic workshops

1092
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,880
for enterprises as well.

1093
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,600
And in there, as you
see down in the bottom,

1094
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,339
we go from the knowledge
base type of use case

1095
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:26,550
that Barry was just talking about

1096
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,077
to something that's very focused

1097
00:45:29,077 --> 00:45:30,360
on certain industries as well.

1098
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,103
One of them is in accounting.

1099
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,640
One of the projects that
we're working on now

1100
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,937
is saving 27,000 hours of human time

1101
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:44,580
in order to do reconciliation
between invoices and payments.

1102
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,627
Every company has this problem.

1103
00:45:47,627 --> 00:45:49,834
The degree to which manual processes

1104
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:53,610
are involved in that in
most companies is high.

1105
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:54,443
- Yep.

1106
00:45:54,443 --> 00:45:57,682
- And so one of the areas
that this could be a quick

1107
00:45:57,682 --> 00:46:01,740
and big win for with very minimal risk,

1108
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,180
which is what I would advise

1109
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,666
any first agent out the
door to do, is that one.

1110
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:10,603
That reconciliation process can be tricky,

1111
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:13,432
depending on how many child companies

1112
00:46:13,432 --> 00:46:15,827
your parent might have.

1113
00:46:15,827 --> 00:46:18,914
But in general, if you're
looking for a quick win

1114
00:46:18,914 --> 00:46:21,990
with a lot of payout, that's a big one.

1115
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,900
- What are some other areas
that you guys have seen,

1116
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,260
you know, quick realization of value?

1117
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,880
- Actually one thing
I wanted to kind of do

1118
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,882
before we even answer that

1119
00:46:31,882 --> 00:46:33,420
is I wanted to show for
Mike's group for a minute

1120
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,030
because they offer like one-day workshops

1121
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,160
where literally Boomi will come in,

1122
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,300
take a look at your business,

1123
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,120
be able to offer you
complete one-day workshops

1124
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,460
where you can get hands-on using Boomi,

1125
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,680
creating agents, solving your problems,

1126
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,795
and then creating what would be a roadmap

1127
00:46:48,795 --> 00:46:51,420
for how you can use AI
agents in your business

1128
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,220
and how Boomi can help you get there.

1129
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,840
So if you happen to be one of those people

1130
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,000
that happened to raise your hand earlier

1131
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,580
and was looking for,
you know, some guidance

1132
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,560
in regards to ideas you may have,

1133
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,450
but you really don't know
where to go to get there,

1134
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:04,950
this is a great one day workshop.

1135
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,050
You know, put that down on
your list of things to do.

1136
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:10,740
Reach out to, you know,
either Mike Bachman or myself.

1137
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,020
I'm Barry.Gerdsen@Boomi.com.

1138
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,370
And request one of these workshops,

1139
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,840
and we'd be happy to
set you up and come in.

1140
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,690
They're completely free,
and we have a mandate

1141
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:21,240
to be able to do quite
a bit of them, so...

1142
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,530
- Excellent.

1143
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:24,300
Any other, you know, quick hits

1144
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,411
or, Michael, from these
workshops that are notable,

1145
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:31,563
that have that light bulb
moment for for a customer?

1146
00:47:31,563 --> 00:47:35,070
- Yeah, so the quick wins,

1147
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,878
you know, are something that's gonna be

1148
00:47:37,878 --> 00:47:40,282
a knowledge base type of win as well.

1149
00:47:40,282 --> 00:47:44,130
We implemented, we went
from prototype to production

1150
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:49,130
inside of Boomi using ChatB
within several months.

1151
00:47:49,164 --> 00:47:53,160
But the prototype was literally two days

1152
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,270
to be able to create that.

1153
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,980
And going through security,

1154
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,300
going through governance checks,

1155
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,420
going through validation of
different models that were used,

1156
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,860
updates on RAG pipelines,

1157
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,060
that's what takes the time,

1158
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,569
and it's just making sure
that you get enough eyes

1159
00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:11,281
on the particular problem early on.

1160
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:15,089
But these types of knowledge base systems

1161
00:48:15,089 --> 00:48:19,800
are really good ones
for good wholesome wins.

1162
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,800
The problem is the ROI
is hard to define there.

1163
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,860
Whereas in these other
types of reconciliations,

1164
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:29,400
if we go to finance and
we go to accounting,

1165
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,430
these are where we can start
to pick up some real wins.

1166
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:33,990
And so in these workshops,

1167
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,090
we're not just bringing in IT folks,

1168
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:39,870
we're bringing in line of
business operators and executives.

1169
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:43,470
And if an executive can build an agent

1170
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,969
and then start to think about her problem

1171
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:48,270
as it pertains to her day to day-

1172
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,100
- Broadly, yeah.
- All of a sudden,

1173
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,150
doors open up.

1174
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:54,270
And now it's not about determining

1175
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:56,010
how to build a piece of software,

1176
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:57,200
it's like, how do I solve

1177
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,120
this particular persnickety problem

1178
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,430
that has been elusive for so long?

1179
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,140
Can an agent help me solve that?

1180
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,960
Let's go and fail fast if it can't,

1181
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,870
but let's iterate on this
and see how well it can work.

1182
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,760
And that has been going over really well.

1183
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,320
- I like that a lot.

1184
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,500
All right, so a lot of
our attendees at re:Invent

1185
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,968
are part of a company
that has some software

1186
00:49:18,968 --> 00:49:21,147
that faces out to customers.

1187
00:49:21,147 --> 00:49:26,010
And so how is AI and agents
being incorporated into the UI

1188
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:27,510
to make their software,

1189
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,270
their service more
effective and efficient?

1190
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,594
- So, within Boomi,

1191
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:34,320
one of the things that
we have done in the past

1192
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,940
and that we're actually expanding,

1193
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,160
and I'll tell you how we're
expanding in a moment.

1194
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,510
But one of the things that we offer,

1195
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,370
and I do a lot of work on the OEM side.

1196
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,770
That's the reason why you see
my sample application here.

1197
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:47,340
It's called OEM+, but
it's called EmbedKit.

1198
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,130
And what it allows you to do
is it allows you to be able

1199
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,338
to create your integrations
in Boomi and then be able to,

1200
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:56,400
if you had one to many customers,

1201
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,400
you can actually give
them a curated marketplace

1202
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,520
of the integrations
that you intend for them

1203
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,832
by easily just dropping
in either Vanilla JS

1204
00:50:04,832 --> 00:50:08,250
or React components that we give you

1205
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,288
that allow you to be able
to just surface an interface

1206
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:12,750
kind of like you see here.

1207
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,490
So imagine your application

1208
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:17,430
with these JS components inputted into it

1209
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:19,603
that allow you to be able
to give people easy ways,

1210
00:50:19,603 --> 00:50:22,980
and this would be tailored
toward business users,

1211
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,380
to be able to self-service
their own integrations.

1212
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,180
So you just basically give them

1213
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,010
last mile configuration details

1214
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:31,290
to be able to provide integrations.

1215
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:32,544
Now, that's something

1216
00:50:32,544 --> 00:50:35,580
that we've been providing
people the ability to do.

1217
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,810
It's highly popular.

1218
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,290
But we've since expanded it
to also include AI agents.

1219
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,940
So you see an example here where,

1220
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,760
if what you want to do is you
have an idea for an agent,

1221
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,329
once again you can use
Boomi's Agent Studio

1222
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:50,490
to be able to, you know,
use natural language

1223
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,200
to create the AI agent,

1224
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,699
and then to be able to just drop

1225
00:50:53,699 --> 00:50:57,480
these React or JS components
into your application,

1226
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,809
and it gives your users
an easy way to consume

1227
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:04,080
the AI agent that you've created
inside of your application.

1228
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,030
So you can get up and
running inside of a week

1229
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,080
doing something like this,

1230
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,010
and it gives you an easy way
to offer AI to your customers.

1231
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:12,600
So if this is something
that's interesting,

1232
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,270
again, it's barry.gerdsen@boomi.com

1233
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:17,490
- And those are governed
agents too, right?

1234
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:18,930
- Yes, absolutely.

1235
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:20,460
Yeah, the nice thing about one part

1236
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,080
of that agent creation process

1237
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,640
is that we include guardrails,

1238
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,650
you know, so that it is secure.

1239
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,690
You know, like, we can actually make sure,

1240
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:30,522
you know, during the wizard
that we guide you through

1241
00:51:30,522 --> 00:51:32,910
to be able to create AI agents,

1242
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:35,277
that you can go through and
you can say things like,

1243
00:51:35,277 --> 00:51:36,896
you know, use a RegX expression

1244
00:51:36,896 --> 00:51:39,210
that would be a social security number,

1245
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:40,740
so that the agent knows not to put

1246
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,191
any, you know, sensitive
information to the screen.

1247
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:45,833
You can also warn on content.

1248
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:48,615
You can warn on subject
so as to keep your agents

1249
00:51:48,615 --> 00:51:51,240
from doing things that they
really shouldn't be doing.

1250
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,830
Or to be misappropriated

1251
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:55,233
to do something they shouldn't be doing.

1252
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,424
- All right, Barry, can
you tell us a bit about MCP

1253
00:51:58,424 --> 00:52:02,481
and what it is and how
Boomi, you know, enables it

1254
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:05,310
or how Boomi interacts with MCP?

1255
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:08,250
- Sure, so MCP stands for
Model Context Protocol,

1256
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,894
and it is a way for you
to be able to converse

1257
00:52:11,894 --> 00:52:16,470
and to be able to reach out
to tools in a standard way.

1258
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,960
So, let's say, that you
were creating an AI agent,

1259
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,850
and you needed an AI agent

1260
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,580
to have the proper
information that it needed,

1261
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,580
but that information comes
from some external system.

1262
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,110
And you didn't necessarily know

1263
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:30,240
how to be able to get that information,

1264
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,940
what that external information
can be offered up as

1265
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,164
is an MCP tool.

1266
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:36,605
And Boomi supports both the ability

1267
00:52:36,605 --> 00:52:39,960
to act as a gateway for these MCP tools.

1268
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,000
So anything within Boomi
that you saw before,

1269
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,740
whether it happens to be an integration,

1270
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,300
whether it happens to be an API,

1271
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,300
whether it happens to be a data record,

1272
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,387
any of those things can be
offered up as an MCP tool

1273
00:52:50,387 --> 00:52:53,760
because within our API management tool,

1274
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,990
you can literally flick a switch,

1275
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:56,547
and it becomes an MCP server

1276
00:52:56,547 --> 00:53:01,230
that allows you to serve
out Boomi capabilities

1277
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:03,810
for your AI agents that may be created

1278
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:05,790
either in Boomi or not in Boomi.

1279
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,460
Again, we are very vendor agnostic.

1280
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,830
Nice thing about this is
it gives you a standard way

1281
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:13,020
to be able to offer your AI agents

1282
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,333
the information that it
needs to be effective.

1283
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,123
- Outstanding.

1284
00:53:17,123 --> 00:53:18,240
All right, so as we wrap things up,

1285
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,810
we've got five minutes left,
I wanna go start with Michael,

1286
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,340
and then we'll end with Barry.

1287
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,200
Just words of advice to our audience

1288
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,513
on how to get started,
if they haven't started,

1289
00:53:27,513 --> 00:53:31,290
and any best practices to be successful.

1290
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:34,590
- Yeah, the first thing
is, you know, build in,

1291
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,750
like, time to failure for yourself.

1292
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,085
Really play around with agents,

1293
00:53:38,085 --> 00:53:41,340
really understand whatever ecosystem

1294
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,600
that you're using today.

1295
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,210
It's super helpful to get hands on

1296
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,216
and really not be afraid of the tech.

1297
00:53:47,216 --> 00:53:50,598
And this room is probably not that...

1298
00:53:50,598 --> 00:53:52,680
So you're probably out there

1299
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,020
and doing all sorts of
things aggressively.

1300
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,390
One thing that I can say is this.

1301
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,220
This is a fast moving market,

1302
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,340
and things are changing pretty readily.

1303
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,210
- Today.
- We have...

1304
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:06,180
Today, like, things already changed today.

1305
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,624
You know, they're approaching,

1306
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:13,290
I think we might be close
to 5 million models,

1307
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,873
actual generative AI models out there.

1308
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:18,744
Everybody, all databases

1309
00:54:18,744 --> 00:54:20,857
or many databases now offer the ability

1310
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:24,693
to accept vector
embeddings and store those

1311
00:54:24,693 --> 00:54:27,351
and have those retrievable.

1312
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:30,090
MCP and other agentic protocols

1313
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,730
are springing up all over the place.

1314
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,400
And the important thing is
to stay ahead of all of this.

1315
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,062
But adopt the platforms
or consider platforms,

1316
00:54:38,062 --> 00:54:40,350
whether it's ours or somebody else's,

1317
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:43,070
that are adaptive to the
changes that are coming.

1318
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:45,816
And so get the hands dirty.

1319
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:47,548
Come over and see us at the booth.

1320
00:54:47,548 --> 00:54:49,536
We're at the Venetian.

1321
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:53,700
And learn more is a good first step.

1322
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,920
And I'm also gonna bring
in the human element again-

1323
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,023
- Good.
- Because this is critical.

1324
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:02,142
When we're thinking about
the future of the systems

1325
00:55:02,142 --> 00:55:05,400
that we wanna create to make
our lives better at work

1326
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,142
or make society better truly,

1327
00:55:08,142 --> 00:55:09,870
it's important to understand

1328
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:12,998
what the limits of these
particular tools are.

1329
00:55:12,998 --> 00:55:14,739
There are camps which say

1330
00:55:14,739 --> 00:55:17,338
that you can do everything with agents,

1331
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:20,400
and, you know, just dive in.

1332
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,648
I caution that if that's your approach.

1333
00:55:23,648 --> 00:55:25,950
I would say, from a human perspective,

1334
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:29,042
what I would want is to engage

1335
00:55:29,042 --> 00:55:31,609
as your level of understanding increases

1336
00:55:31,609 --> 00:55:36,609
and knowing what the limits
of agents are or systems are,

1337
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,870
what the limits of these models are,

1338
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,341
how to use these models in
conjunction with each other

1339
00:55:42,341 --> 00:55:45,090
in order to achieve outcomes,

1340
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:48,240
how to ensure and
guaranteed structured output

1341
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,670
so that you can have better overall

1342
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,540
goal resolution at the end.

1343
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,890
These are the types of things

1344
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,050
that we need to do as practitioners.

1345
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:02,241
And for those of you who are
model creators in the room,

1346
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:04,974
there's gonna be wild
changes coming there,

1347
00:56:04,974 --> 00:56:06,480
you know, in a keynote-

1348
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,618
- Yeah, we're gonna help.

1349
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:08,451
- Yeah.

1350
00:56:08,451 --> 00:56:10,140
Yeah, AWS is doing a lot with that,

1351
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,828
like, neuromorphic systems in general.

1352
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:16,350
Abstractions the way that humans

1353
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:19,620
visualize information and context.

1354
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,930
This is not available in LLMs today.

1355
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,821
So getting to AGI probably,

1356
00:56:23,821 --> 00:56:25,380
I don't know where you stand on that.

1357
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,690
But from my point of view,

1358
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,437
probably not gonna get to this supermodel

1359
00:56:29,437 --> 00:56:33,540
with a super world view
at our current state.

1360
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,868
And so what that means is
there's going to be changing

1361
00:56:35,868 --> 00:56:37,950
and adaptive technology.

1362
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:40,346
And if those things can have APIs

1363
00:56:40,346 --> 00:56:43,800
that we can expose or automate,

1364
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,349
we can also govern them with
the right tools as well.

1365
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:49,480
So, as we as humans try
to emulate what we do,

1366
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,720
the processes that we have,

1367
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,720
the biases that we wanna
remove from all of our systems,

1368
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,960
all of those sorts of things
require heavy governance

1369
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,550
and a good platform that's adaptive.

1370
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,980
So what I would say is, come check us out.

1371
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,813
- Love it.

1372
00:57:02,813 --> 00:57:03,646
Barry.
- Yeah.

1373
00:57:03,646 --> 00:57:05,400
I mean, you said a lot of
good things in there, Mike,

1374
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,160
but I'll also add, choose a framework.

1375
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,330
I think, like, a lot of times,

1376
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:12,037
a framework will just provide
you with the ease of use,

1377
00:57:12,037 --> 00:57:14,130
all of the kind of capabilities

1378
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,210
and the things that you should look for

1379
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:16,890
that we've talked about
over the last hour.

1380
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:18,090
A lot of that stuff's gonna be built in.

1381
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:19,890
And it doesn't have to be Boomi.

1382
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:21,270
We very much like it if it was,

1383
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,640
but if it's not, you could
choose something like AWS,

1384
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,650
you could choose one of the
other vendors out there.

1385
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:26,910
But I think you'll find,

1386
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,493
you know, the ability
to fail fast will happen

1387
00:57:29,493 --> 00:57:32,730
better and easier, you
know, with a framework

1388
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:34,650
if you're going that route with it.

1389
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,720
The other thing I would once
again encourage you to do

1390
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,700
is to seek out one of
those kind of workshops

1391
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,770
that I was talking about to
get your hands dirty with it.

1392
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:43,230
If you haven't so far,
it's a great way to start.

1393
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:48,230
Like, it will kind of take
down your learning time

1394
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:51,810
to what would be, you know, by
a factor of 10, I would say,

1395
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:53,220
just by devoting one day to it

1396
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,410
'cause you'll just get
all the tips, the tricks.

1397
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:56,940
All the things that we've learned

1398
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,950
over the benefit of
the last several years,

1399
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,567
we'll be able to impart
that knowledge upon you.

1400
00:58:00,567 --> 00:58:02,528
- And get the business and IT

1401
00:58:02,528 --> 00:58:04,920
all better aligns around this as well.

1402
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,753
- Yep, all right.

1403
00:58:05,753 --> 00:58:06,930
- Gentlemen, thank you so very much.

1404
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:08,790
Everyone, if you would
give a round of applause

1405
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:10,128
for my esteemed guests.

1406
00:58:10,128 --> 00:58:11,348
Thank you.

1407
00:58:11,348 --> 00:58:12,181
(crowd applauding)

1408
00:58:12,181 --> 00:58:13,680
Thanks so much.
- Thank you.

1409
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,130
Thanks to all of you as well.
