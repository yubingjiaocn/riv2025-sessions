1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,943
- Thanks, guys.
- Appreciate it.

2
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:05,447
- Good afternoon, everyone.

3
00:00:05,447 --> 00:00:07,410
And in the next 20 minutes,

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,410
we are going to talk about

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,260
how to

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,860
change the future of business,

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,610
how we do through the autonomous
enterprise operations?

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,593
The way we are structured,

9
00:00:18,593 --> 00:00:21,150
the discussion for next 20 minutes

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,200
is then Todd will come and
talk about as a partnership

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,273
what we are doing together with AWS.

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,150
Just before we start the presentation,

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,740
I want to thank one of my
customers here from Kenvue.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,260
He's the vice president from Kenvue,

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,060
and they are a user of Ignio.

16
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,640
Thank you very much
for being our customer.

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,560
Pravin has been a great help.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,300
And any one of you who
wants to discuss with him

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,360
post the event, he would be
happy to spend some time.

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,380
This morning, today also,

21
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,680
we announced a partnership with Control-M,

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,230
which is the first inaugural
launch, along with AWS,

23
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,440
on their marketplace
as a multiproduct SaaS,

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,000
which we launched today.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,110
Go and check it out.

26
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,400
But coming to this presentation,

27
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,710
we'll just talk about three stories,

28
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,543
what we are doing.

29
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:06,450
That will give you a sense

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,060
of how the customers are using those.

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,220
And then, we will tell you
what the product is about,

32
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,253
then we'll sum up the story
and then hand it over to Todd.

33
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,350
I'm sure somebody can recognize:

34
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,563
it's a premium retail company, Tapestry.

35
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,480
The bags, which some of you
might have seen, used it.

36
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,720
They had a issue where some of the orders

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,210
are not reaching on time,
not being processed,

38
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,760
not being fulfilled,
not delivered on time.

39
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,913
It's a loss of revenue,
loss of experience.

40
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,980
Another example we'll
talk about is this company

41
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,410
which is in the med-tech space.

42
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,860
They manufacturer prosthetic limbs.

43
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,760
And if those limbs, the commit
date to the surgery room

44
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,830
in the hospital is not confirmed,

45
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,030
the surgery may not happen

46
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,100
and the patient may not get their limbs.

47
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,790
And the third example is,
let's say in Bangalore,

48
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,483
there's a cricket match going on,

49
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:09,180
a T20 cricket match,

50
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,780
and a lot of the retailers
nearby are stocking

51
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,160
so that they feel that they will have

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,870
a lot of sales going on.

53
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,560
And that sales, the stock is not fulfilled

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,080
because there's some certain glitch,

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,600
because the intended CPG company

56
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,040
is not able to fulfill those

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,170
because of certain
order processing issues.

58
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,720
In all these three examples,

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,120
there is something common
as a business problem.

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,330
Underneath somewhere,
the IT did not perform

61
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,490
the way it was designed to perform.

62
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,910
And that's the challenge we
see, we all know and cross

63
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,383
when the business calls you,

64
00:02:43,383 --> 00:02:45,240
that look, something did not work.

65
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,770
My order did not get processed,

66
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,510
and you see IT problem has happened.

67
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,220
So majority of the business problem today,

68
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,830
what you see is a technology issue.

69
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,240
And that's what we are trying to solve

70
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,433
and make it autonomous in the industry.

71
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,690
If you look at the example of Tapestry,

72
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,740
which I talked about,

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,600
their challenge was they have
37 different storefronts.

74
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,700
They operate globally.

75
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,560
Orders comes to those storefronts,

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,960
they have a order management system,

77
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,130
they have a fulfillment process,

78
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,960
they have a financial
transaction to close,

79
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,610
and then the shipping happens.

80
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,510
And in the whole journey,

81
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,830
if you look at, there are different hubs

82
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,530
where the data flow
through different systems,

83
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,060
and as a technology layer

84
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,620
and within some of the application itself,

85
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,050
for example, SAP systems
and other systems.

86
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,030
And in that journey of the data flow,

87
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,220
we have deployed identified observability

88
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,100
to ensure that every hop

89
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,610
the business knows exactly
how the order is processing.

90
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,460
And if something goes wrong
at the layer of technology,

91
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,080
the technology team also knows

92
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,060
which component of technology has failed

93
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,130
or not performed to the expectation,

94
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,560
and that's why that problem
has been creeped in.

95
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,873
And in all this area, if you see,

96
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,930
this problem has resulted
and we have, you know,

97
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,730
some data, which I'll
share to you this morning,

98
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,350
which came from the last week itself,

99
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,630
because last week was a
very heightened activity

100
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,097
because of Black Friday sales

101
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:05,190
and what was going on
everywhere in the world.

102
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,170
In last one week, they processed
more than a million orders.

103
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,033
And if Ignio was not there,

104
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,420
almost worth $3 million
worth of their order

105
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,220
either would not have been processed,

106
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,230
they might have been delayed,

107
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,470
or they might have been
canceled by the consumers

108
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,840
because they might not have
made the promised date.

109
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,980
So that's the value.

110
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,750
What we are bringing in this situation,

111
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,700
we are bringing the unified observability

112
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,490
across the process flow
from order to cash,

113
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,230
and underlying technology vertically

114
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,730
from the tech as perspective,

115
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,670
to ensure the operational autonomy

116
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,390
is involved and delivered
to them every day,

117
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,940
every time order comes through.

118
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,270
The second example, which I talked about,

119
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,280
the challenge was this company

120
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,950
grew through acquisition several years.

121
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,080
It's a longstanding brand.

122
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,570
They build, as I said, prosthetic limbs.

123
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,860
They're across the supply chain,

124
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,543
and demand planning specifically.

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,500
They have to confirm a promise date

126
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,980
for a specific limb to a
patient and to the surgeon.

127
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,100
And if you look at that
area, it's very, you know,

128
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,190
humble to speak about that
because you need four things:

129
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,410
you need a doctor, you need a hospital,

130
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,870
you need a patient, and you need the limb.

131
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,970
All three are available,
the limb is not available,

132
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,740
the promise date is not there.

133
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,960
That's the challenge that customer had

134
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,990
where this order flow of
data was happening through,

135
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,730
there were 70 different interfaces

136
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,380
because they have grown
through acquisition,

137
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,270
different applications, different kinds,

138
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,680
SaaS, on-premise,

139
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,990
antiquated, you know, legacy application,

140
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,640
all running through those systems,

141
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,530
that's what we have solved for them.

142
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,360
Where the data flow happens,

143
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,730
the demand planning process for them

144
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,790
has been reduced from weeks to now hours,

145
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,850
and they're able to promise
the date to the hospitals

146
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,650
so that the surgery can happen.

147
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,780
And that's what is a big help,

148
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,910
not only to my customer here,

149
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,680
but it's also to the end user,

150
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,530
because that's very
important for their life.

151
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,800
The third example

152
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,340
I talked about, you know,

153
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,173
it's an example where,

154
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:07,440
I know, and some of you

155
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,570
who work in the retail or CPG industry,

156
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,190
the direct store delivery

157
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,840
is a very, very critical process

158
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,916
for some of the CPC companies.

159
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,300
And in that process, typically,

160
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,610
route sales would go take the orders,

161
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,200
see the stock on the shelf,

162
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,460
understand what is required,

163
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,720
how it's selling,

164
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,800
punch in some orders there;

165
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,600
that order flows through
different systems,

166
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,480
comes to the CPC company, to
their manufacturing units,

167
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,040
and ship through the truck, goes,

168
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,860
and it directly stock on the shelf.

169
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,410
That is a very high-frequency process

170
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,860
where if you miss or
order is not delivered,

171
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,950
as simple as a manifest
has not been generated,

172
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,980
and your truck may not fill
the full orders and move.

173
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,320
You have lost two parts in that process.

174
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,230
First of all, the shelf
is empty for the retailer.

175
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,790
The retailer has not only lost the revenue

176
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,980
and the CPG company-associated revenue,

177
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,180
but you also lose the
brand and the market share.

178
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,030
And it's a very, very competitive market.

179
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,670
So on that journey, on the business value,

180
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,080
what we are monitoring, what we call it,

181
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,110
on the whole journey of
right from the order taker

182
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,790
to the manufacturing plant,

183
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,800
to the shipping fulfillment,

184
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,060
and us really stocking.

185
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,121
The whole journey we have mapped on Ignio,

186
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:18,630
which is the platform from this state

187
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,750
to ensure on a weekly basis we process

188
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,030
couple of hundred
million dollars of orders

189
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,320
on this platform,

190
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,280
to ensure it moves
autonomously in the journey.

191
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,630
Now, these three stories

192
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,257
are from different kind I talked about.

193
00:07:32,257 --> 00:07:34,770
You know, it matters as a business.

194
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,980
Underneath all this real solution,

195
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,920
real-life solution is the
technology was the problem.

196
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,030
And I'll come to the next part,

197
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,310
how we are solving this problem today.

198
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,820
So as I said, autonomous
is the new operating model,

199
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,800
how we are delivering that value.

200
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,250
And I'm sure some of you who
comes from the IT background,

201
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,520
you all want to eliminate
business disruption

202
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,085
which happens because of IT.

203
00:07:58,085 --> 00:07:59,647
A lot of business folks call you and say,

204
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,680
"Look, I gave you all t?he tools.

205
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,930
Why this happened again?"

206
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,760
The second party want to still do.

207
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,830
If we can't fix those problem proactively,

208
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,450
that I should know first as an IT

209
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,950
before business partner knows.

210
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,830
And I can tell them in
advance that I know it,

211
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,550
we are fixing it.

212
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,960
If you can't do that,

213
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,550
the last and the least part you can do

214
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,790
is if I know somebody called
me a problem has been there,

215
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,100
can I recover as fast as possible

216
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,290
that the problem feels like a blip?

217
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,480
And to achieve these three elements

218
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,430
in the order of priority,

219
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,160
we have built a platform called Ignio

220
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,900
which has three broad things.

221
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,400
One is the identified observability

222
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,710
which I talked about from
the horizontal observability

223
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,900
to understand the layer of data processing

224
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,700
which happens through
different applications.

225
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,710
And then identifying
vertical stack observability

226
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,230
to understand how the problem occurs

227
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,630
and proactively create the visibility

228
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,720
and avoid those problems from
happening at the first place.

229
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,730
We also hook up on the second part,

230
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,860
which he talked about,
the AI-driven insight.

231
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,830
We hook up with lot of telemetry data,

232
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,670
log data and other elements
which comes from the environment

233
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,170
through your monitoring tools,

234
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,650
to understand what can happen.

235
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,870
And we can predict what's going to fail.

236
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,330
For example, this application,

237
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,090
the way the usage is
increasing six weeks from now,

238
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,250
the performance of this
service is going to degrade.

239
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,510
It gives you some latitude

240
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,110
to understand what's
going on, a bad job cycle.

241
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,097
It can tell you 3:00 AM
in the morning and say,

242
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,360
"Look, by 6:00 AM your
sales reconciliation report

243
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,470
is not going to come.

244
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,180
It will miss that KPI."

245
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,790
That's what this AI-driven
insight gives you the time

246
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,620
so that you can recover
from those situation

247
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,110
before the problem has already hit you.

248
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,020
And the third part is problem will do,

249
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,520
occur we recognize.

250
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,010
And that's where the
closed-loop automation comes,

251
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,680
where a problem has resurfaced,

252
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,480
Ignio understands the context,

253
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,070
it understands the whole hierarchy model

254
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,170
of your enterprise as IT blueprint,

255
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,870
and it can recover and isolate the problem

256
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,100
at a machine speed,

257
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,920
which typically today,
lot of environment today,

258
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,630
all the enterprise customers,

259
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,060
they put teams which are siloed in nature,

260
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,590
they come together;

261
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,120
typically, first time they will say,

262
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,620
the network guys, they're the fault.

263
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,937
Eventually they come down to
some database guy and say,

264
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:12,090
"Look, the-long-running
query is the problem.

265
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,923
Then fix it."

266
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:15,750
It takes maybe an hour to
two hour to four hours.

267
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,580
That's where it runs at a machine speed,

268
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,380
isolate the problem.

269
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,280
And then we have built almost
10,000 automated actions

270
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,830
to take action to fix this
problem within minutes.

271
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,650
So that situation, which
takes maybe an hour, two hour,

272
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,230
five hour to fix, can be
solved in couple of minutes,

273
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,600
maybe sometimes three
minutes, sometimes 10 minutes.

274
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,910
All these three elements
of the capability,

275
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,780
what we have built on this platform

276
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,850
is applied to your cloud operations,

277
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,520
your typical data center,

278
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,830
if you have a data center
in your environment,

279
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,223
custom application, SAP systems, bad jobs,

280
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:53,490
and devices like laptops and desktops.

281
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,430
And that pretty much covers
your 80 to 90% of operations.

282
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,050
And that's what our vision has been,

283
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,880
to go behind this and make
all the journey autonomous

284
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,170
so that the business can perform

285
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,540
the way it's supposed to perform.

286
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,440
And to deliver all this, what
we have is this five agents,

287
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,360
the whole architecture agentic,

288
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,330
if you look at some of the personas

289
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,280
which we deal in the enterprise today,

290
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,100
the SRS persona, the
CXO personas, you know,

291
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,230
a lot of cloud operation which goes on,

292
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,450
a lot of IT operations team handles.

293
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,460
And their objectives,
which I've touched about,

294
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,100
is very clear, move as fast as you could,

295
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,230
avoid, eliminate the incidents.

296
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,070
And these five agents works
in a very simple principle

297
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,290
that they can work on their own.

298
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,253
And these agents are made
through six subagents.

299
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:45,300
All agents are through a perception agent,

300
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,140
a reasoning agent, an action
agent, and a learning agent.

301
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,420
And we also have built a control agent

302
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,490
and a LLM-based model agent,

303
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,740
so that it augment some of the teams.

304
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,370
Because maybe Ignio does
not have the full knowledge,

305
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,400
100% knowledge of everything
goes into the enterprise.

306
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,630
So what we have built here

307
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,130
from the agentic platform perspective,

308
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,050
not only a deterministic model

309
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,970
where it can go and fix certain problems

310
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,890
from the logical reasoning perspective,

311
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,313
but it can also take
something analytical model

312
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:14,970
through your LLMs.

313
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,803
We use

314
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,670
one of the other platform
from an LLM today,

315
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,500
and that we can bring it together

316
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,260
from the logical and logical
model to fix the problems,

317
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,860
what goes on in your enterprise.

318
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,680
So on that note, just to give
you some data points today,

319
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,220
we are very focused on
the global 2000 customer.

320
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,670
We believe enterprise is the
segment where we thrive well.

321
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,033
The impact of the value of
this platform is much higher.

322
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,080
The value was there
derived, it's much bigger.

323
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,740
We are almost managing
34,200 workload globally

324
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,480
in 20 different region.

325
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,210
We process almost 1.2 billion
events on this platform

326
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,130
with almost 87% noise reduction.

327
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,650
Just imagine the help it gives

328
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,690
to the command center team everywhere.

329
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,790
We almost have 300
million-plus automation,

330
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,100
which is working today on
the platform every year.

331
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,900
And of course we are compliant
to certain standards,

332
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,660
global standards with any
enterprise needed today:

333
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,670
SOC 2, Type 2 and others.

334
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,631
Of course, on that journey,

335
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:16,940
AWS has been a great
partner, as I talked about.

336
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,280
We have launched today
morning with BMC Control-M.

337
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,970
But I'll ask Todd to talk
about some of the partnership,

338
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,070
what we have gone through
in last several years.

339
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,390
- Sure. Thanks.

340
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,920
Thanks, Rajiv. Great stuff.

341
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,170
So good afternoon. My name is Todd Carey.

342
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,960
I lead our GSP sales teams worldwide.

343
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,300
And really, that's two main areas,

344
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,640
is looking at our biggest partners

345
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,680
and strategic partners as customers,

346
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,960
and then also as investors and sellers

347
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,280
and how we go to market together.

348
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,780
And that really is responding

349
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,760
to a lot of the market signals,

350
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,780
the things that we see,

351
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,460
things that customers demand.

352
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,690
So it's amazing to hook up
with partners like Digitate,

353
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,370
where they're looking at things,

354
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,270
they're building things,

355
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,853
but most importantly
they're delivering things.

356
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:02,370
And when we are like delivering
things like outcomes,

357
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,220
and we start talking
about on-time deliveries,

358
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,580
weeks to hours, full trucks,

359
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,810
you know, these are use cases

360
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,990
that end customers really
want to hear about.

361
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,220
And in fact, just as important,

362
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,770
is our field sales teams
want to hear about it.

363
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,570
So when you're an end customer

364
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,240
or you're an AWS or
you're another partner,

365
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,720
what good looks like
definitely is Digitate.

366
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,660
And these are the partners
that we really lean in with

367
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,120
and support from a
go-to-market standpoint,

368
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,040
from a solution-building standpoint.

369
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,350
And we figure out how
we can scale together.

370
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,960
So it's a great success story.

371
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,665
And Digitate and Ignio
leveraging the marketplace,

372
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:44,610
BMC, leveraging AWS Marketplace.

373
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,180
This is really the next
generation of sales platform.

374
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,700
So if anyone got to hear Matt Wise,

375
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,400
Matt Yintinson's keynote on Marketplace,

376
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,400
and all of the new
announcements that we're making.

377
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,890
You know, from a next-generation sales

378
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,500
and a next-generation
experience and engagement,

379
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,070
you take an Ignio and you
take a Digitate and an AWS,

380
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,100
and it's an extremely
powerful combination.

381
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,470
And delivering value on time,

382
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,900
and most importantly, delivering outcomes.

383
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,260
So we look at the type of
partner that we want to look for

384
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,577
and we want to invest in,

385
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:20,010
and Digitate certainly represents that.

386
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,850
And so we're always exploring
how we unlock value,

387
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,650
how we accelerate time to value,

388
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,450
and we accelerate time to market.

389
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,450
And as a complete package of
partnership and relationship,

390
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,810
super excited to be supportive of Digitate

391
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,280
and all that they're doing in the market.

392
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,320
So just as a quick say hi.

393
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,020
And a huge endorsement of all the things

394
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,160
that we're doing with Digitate.

395
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,240
So very excited.

396
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,920
And I think we're gonna
open up to some Q&A,

397
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,060
right?
- Sure.

398
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,170
If you have a question,
we can answer them.

399
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,940
- There's some questions.

400
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,623
Happy to field all of those.

401
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,840
Was it that thorough?

402
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,860
Ah.
- Maybe.

403
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,497
- Rajiv, good stuff.

404
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:06,455
To be able to deliver
that with no questions.

405
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:09,175
- Okay.

406
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:10,410
- Okay.

407
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,243
- Thank you very much.

408
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:12,076
- [Todd] I think that's a wrap.

409
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:13,096
Thank you.
- Thank you.

410
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:14,471
(attendees applauding)

411
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:16,171
- Alright. Good job.
- Thank you.
