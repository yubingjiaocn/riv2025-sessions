1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,943
- Hello, everyone, how many of
you here first time in Vegas?

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,283
- Okay.

3
00:00:07,283 --> 00:00:09,090
- Wow, and how many of you here

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,713
first time in re:Invent?

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,600
Amazing, just one advice,

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,330
always keep in walking shoes.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,250
Don't wear the heels or anything

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,130
because there's a lot
of things to walk here.

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,383
Wish you all the best if you're here

10
00:00:24,383 --> 00:00:25,860
for the first time,

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,230
and I'm sure you will learn

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,693
a lot of things end of the week.

13
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,420
Thank you for coming.

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,553
- Yeah, let's get started.

15
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:39,990
Good morning.

16
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:42,420
- [Attendee] Good morning.

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,340
- That sounds right.

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,773
Welcome to MAM334.

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,800
And first of all, thank you.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,060
Thank you for attending
our session on how to scale

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,500
modernization with the help
of agent TKI capabilities.

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,250
I plan to start this
session with three questions

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,380
and a little bit of exercise together.

24
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,143
Are you all ready?

25
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:06,976
- [Attendee] Yeah.

26
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:08,130
- Okay, let's do it.

27
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,460
Raise your hand if you are working

28
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,603
or worked on one or more
modernization projects.

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,260
Okay, that's lots of hands

30
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,910
and that's also tells me

31
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,610
that you are in the right session.

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,630
Now raise your hand if you have mandate

33
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,810
to increase AI adoption.

34
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,360
To reduce total cost of ownership,

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,820
increase return of investment

36
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,413
for your line of business.

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,793
Good, good.

38
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:43,380
Thanks for sharing that
information with us.

39
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,490
Now raise your both hands if you have a

40
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,843
goal to do more with less, that means.

41
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,010
- [Yogi] God saving.

42
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,600
- Reducing operating cost

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,700
or reduced total cost of ownership.

44
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,810
No, keep the hand raised.

45
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,250
Keep the hand raised.

46
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,220
Let's do a little bit
of stretching from here.

47
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,903
From left to right, from right to left.

48
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,780
Let the blood flow.

49
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,220
Take a deep breath.

50
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,530
Now we think we are ready for the session.

51
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,957
My name is Pratip Bagchi

52
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:23,190
I'm an enterprise solution
architect with AWS.

53
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,473
Today I have with me Lalit Kumar.

54
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,410
Oh, today I have with me Lalit Kumar.

55
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,210
He's an AI solutions architect

56
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,360
with Thomson Reuters and Yogi Barot.

57
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,840
She's a tech lead Microsoft
worklead with AWS.

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,230
Three of us, we are going to share

59
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,830
how you can supercharge
your modernization project

60
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,520
with the help of agent TKI capabilities.

61
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,893
Now let's look into our agenda today.

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,500
First I'll start with the challenges,

63
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,410
I mean transformation challenges,

64
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,410
what we are hearing from our customers,

65
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,210
what's the voice of the field.

66
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,970
I'll also share what are the motivations

67
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,610
behind these modernization projects.

68
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,870
Then Lalit is going to share

69
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,750
his journey on how he is scaling

70
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,020
modernization goals for
hundreds of application

71
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,000
for his organization.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,330
And finally, Yogi is
going to wrap the session

73
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,040
with best practices and how
you can use AWS services

74
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,103
and capabilities to scale
your modernization goal.

75
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,050
Now let's start with the
transformation challenges.

76
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,360
But before I start talking

77
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,610
about transformation challenges,

78
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,527
I think it makes sense for me

79
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:47,640
to define the term
application modernization

80
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,100
in the context of today's session.

81
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,530
In the context of today's session,

82
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,100
we'll be talking on
taking your application

83
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,520
and infrastructure to a higher value one.

84
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,160
We'll be focusing on taking

85
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,830
your Legacy .NET framework application

86
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,530
to a .NET core platform

87
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,680
and we'll be doubling
down on three outcomes.

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,050
Number one, unlocking innovation

89
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,120
potential for your application.

90
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,930
Number two, reduce take
date of your application.

91
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,530
And number three, reduce
total cost of ownership.

92
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,770
Now come back to the challenges.

93
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,050
The first is the speed.

94
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,283
This process is slow.

95
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,040
This Legacy .NET framework

96
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,040
applications running on windows

97
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,090
are often monolithic and complex in nature

98
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,473
and that makes the modernization process

99
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:42,753
a challenging endeavor.

100
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,150
The traditional labor
intensive works that works,

101
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,740
but it takes years

102
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,220
before you realize the
true value of the cloud

103
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,020
and unlock the innovation
potential for your application

104
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,400
and its process is sequential.

105
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,360
Your entire team has to
wait for all the step

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,700
to be completed before

107
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,680
they can move to the next step.

108
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,350
And that also creates
collaboration challenges

109
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,880
for a large organizations

110
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,730
with a geographically distributed team

111
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,223
that also delays decision
making process as well.

112
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,550
And the last thing is these
applications are built

113
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,263
with old guard technologies.

114
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,840
As we discussed before,

115
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,030
organizations are seeing
increased pressure

116
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,710
to do more with less.

117
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,890
So the customers are
facing scaling challenges,

118
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,450
they're looking for ways

119
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,550
to accelerate their modernization journey.

120
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,373
But what about the motivations?

121
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,700
No one does modernization for the sake

122
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,890
of doing modernization.

123
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,013
I'm going to talk about
two motivation, first,

124
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,223
technology motivation and the
second business motivations.

125
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,290
So when it comes to technology motivation,

126
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,253
the first thing is the performance.

127
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:05,460
Performance, performance

128
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,120
and performance is the key
differentiator why developers

129
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,120
should focus on upgrading
their application

130
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,070
to .NET core platform.

131
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,440
The garbage collection is way better.

132
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,110
The just in time compiler is way superior.

133
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,740
And according to the case
study published by Microsoft,

134
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,750
it can be 600 times faster

135
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,423
than Legacy .NET framework 4.7.

136
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,770
Second is the supportability
and the security.

137
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,880
They are way superior in
the cross-platform world.

138
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,790
The Legacy .NET framework,
they're still supported,

139
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,900
but the innovations

140
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,220
and the development,

141
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,073
they are far better in
the cross-platform world.

142
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,450
And the third, which
is the biggest reason,

143
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,880
is the cross-platform support.

144
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,120
Your developer can start
working on the Windows PC

145
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,400
as well as they can use Mac OS.

146
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,280
But not only that, you
can take those application

147
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,340
and deploy them to a Linux container

148
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,460
and you can take your
modernization journey further

149
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,220
by deploying them to a Graviton instances

150
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,953
to get a superior price point performance.

151
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,880
And last but not the least, you get

152
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,223
to access the large pool of developers.

153
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,320
These new team members

154
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,440
are getting onboarded to your team.

155
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,960
It is very likely that they are familiar

156
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,850
with the new technologies.

157
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,310
So for all the technology managers,

158
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,230
it is becoming a risky

159
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,060
to run these applications

160
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,760
with the older guard technologies.

161
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,550
Now let's look into
the business motivation

162
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,910
because you as a technology partner has

163
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,570
to work hand in hand with
your business partners

164
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,783
to make this modernization
goal a successful one.

165
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,050
And for business team members,

166
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,600
cost is always a conversation, right?

167
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,080
So you can tell them by
modernizing this application,

168
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,190
you can save up to 40%
of total operating cost.

169
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,150
You can not only eliminate

170
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:07,983
the costly commercial licenses,

171
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,630
but also you can leverage
lightweight containers

172
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,050
to reduce the storage
as well as compute cost.

173
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,220
You can also get the scale

174
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,470
and the performance of the cloud.

175
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,840
As your customer base is growing,

176
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,370
as your organic revenue

177
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,770
target is actually increasing,

178
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,810
this application has to scale

179
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,200
and you can scale using
lightweight containers

180
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,530
or you can deploy them to
a serverless architecture

181
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,753
by leveraging AWS Lambda.

182
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,403
So what about upgrading
and porting process?

183
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,400
So we started this journey
couple of years back

184
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,250
with Thomson Reuters with the tools

185
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,440
and the capabilities that we had

186
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,230
with us at that point of time.

187
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,080
So the typical process looks like this.

188
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,900
It always starts with
the discovery, isn't it?

189
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,450
So after the discovery is done,

190
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,340
you start analyzing the code

191
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,470
and during the analysis
process you find out

192
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,130
the compatibilities as well
as the incompatibilities

193
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,843
before you start quoting the code.

194
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,320
And then once the
quoting is done, you need

195
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,210
to also validate the code.

196
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,463
Like if you have any unit test cases,

197
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,704
you also need to convert them

198
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:21,900
to the .NET core platform.

199
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,310
If you do not have,

200
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,410
then you need to write it from scratch

201
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,590
and then you eventually
deploy your application.

202
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,010
And if you find any
post-deployment issue, you go back

203
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,070
to the discovery and the
analysis phase again.

204
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,280
And this entire process is labor intensive

205
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,560
because it's a combination of a manual

206
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,130
and a semi-automated work together.

207
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,953
And because of that,
it's error prone as well.

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,520
And for company like Thomson Reuters

209
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,700
who has a geographically distributed team,

210
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,210
they also are facing
collaboration bottleneck.

211
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,400
So they wanted a way

212
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,130
to turbocharge their modernization project

213
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,290
and they also wanted
to establish a synergy

214
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,910
between the application team,

215
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,860
which is their product engineering team

216
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,930
and platform engineering team so

217
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,870
that they can run this project together.

218
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,380
To share their story, let me welcome Lalit

219
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,760
and he is going to share

220
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,550
how he scaled modernization
projects for hundreds

221
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,190
of application within his organization.

222
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,237
Please welcome Lalit.

223
00:10:25,237 --> 00:10:28,404
(audience applauding)

224
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,330
- Thanks Pratip. (clears throat)

225
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,230
Hello everyone.

226
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,030
Thank you for joining today's session.

227
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,070
My name is Lalit, I'm working

228
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,350
with platform engineering enablement team

229
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,720
as an AI solutions architect.

230
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,860
In today's session,

231
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,660
I'm going to share the story

232
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,350
of how Thomson Reuters has
leveraged agent tech AI

233
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,023
to transform the Legacy .NET applications.

234
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,570
At Thomson Reuters, we
have made a bold commitment

235
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,000
to become the world's
leading content driven

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,040
AI technology company.

237
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,920
This transformation is most visible

238
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,000
in the tools we deliver

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,700
to our customers, like CoCounsel,

240
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,890
our Agentic AI platform

241
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,730
for tax, legal, compliance

242
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,113
and advisory professionals.

243
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,570
Now we are also transforming

244
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,820
internally in how we build,

245
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,970
modernize and scale
the very infrastructure

246
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,190
that powers everything we do.

247
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,360
Behind the scenes,

248
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,850
we are evolving our engineering culture,

249
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,980
accelerating the development cycles

250
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,533
and embedding AI into the way we work.

251
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,750
And there's a reason for this

252
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,700
because to deliver professional

253
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,680
grade technology externally,

254
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,743
we must operate like a modern
tech company internally.

255
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,380
And that's exactly what we are

256
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,063
doing in platform engineering.

257
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,113
Empowering development,
enabling transformation.

258
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:01,430
Now one of our DR values
is act fast, learn fast,

259
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,200
our principle we put into practice

260
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,880
when we partnered with AWS

261
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,193
as early adopters during the better phase.

262
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,680
Over the next few minutes I'm going

263
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,970
to share our transformation

264
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,440
journey powered by agentic AI.

265
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,500
At Thomson Reuters we are
working across decades

266
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,137
of tech evolution,
monoliths, microservices,

267
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:25,440
.NET, Java and more.

268
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,063
All of it mission critical.

269
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,960
Now managing this environment takes time

270
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,770
and for every hour our
developers are applying patches,

271
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,270
upgrading libraries,

272
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,370
or managing the infrastructure.

273
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,690
Now that's the time

274
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,580
we are not spending delivering new

275
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,873
value to our customers.

276
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,220
One of our major accomplishments is

277
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,164
that recently we completed 95%

278
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:52,923
of our migrations into the cloud.

279
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,310
Now this move gave us a cleaner

280
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,060
and more agile foundation
to innovate on it.

281
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,533
It actually gave our teams,

282
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,990
you know, the ability

283
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,503
to spend more time on AI capabilities.

284
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,380
Now, however, we were still carrying

285
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,780
around a lot of Legacy .NET code

286
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,890
and that legacy was slowing us down

287
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,600
and it wasn't just old,

288
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,760
it was competing with innovation.

289
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,450
Our developers were stuck
maintaining unfamiliar legacy

290
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,720
frameworks that couldn't
be replaced overnight.

291
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,430
So we had to modernize,

292
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,720
but we still had

293
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,430
to remain fully operational

294
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,603
and that was retention.

295
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,590
- [Pratip] I see you said like you

296
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,720
have 40% of your workload,

297
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,140
which are .NET, like how many lines

298
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,190
of code you're talking about,

299
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,866
how many application you're talking about?

300
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:49,699
- Yeah.

301
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:51,060
So that brings me to this slide.

302
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,290
So let's take a look

303
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,900
at our .NET application landscape.

304
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,430
So currently we are operating

305
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,380
over 400 .NET applications

306
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,900
that are running on Windows servers.

307
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,350
And that results in substantial costs due

308
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,180
to Windows licenses.

309
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,390
Now based on our 2024
cloud consumption report,

310
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,950
we have estimated potential

311
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,810
savings of millions of dollars

312
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,060
by migrating from Windows to Linux,

313
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,590
adopting Graviton servers
and containerization.

314
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,530
Now these applications, they are complex

315
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,940
and they are mission critical

316
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,650
comprising over 500 million

317
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,270
lines of code that keeps

318
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,970
our developers engaged every hour.

319
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,243
Now let's take a look

320
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:35,310
at an example of a highly complex web

321
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:39,000
of dependencies between
the various .NET components

322
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,980
and the package dependencies.

323
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,660
Now on a lighter note,

324
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,190
this looks like our walking path

325
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,720
this week at Vegas from our

326
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,640
hotels to different venues.

327
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,290
And this also reminds me of

328
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,390
of my morning path from all way

329
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,780
to Mandalay Bay from the
opposite side of the strip.

330
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,810
But trust me, this is just
a small screenshot of one

331
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,843
of our .NET applications
package dependencies.

332
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,100
Now migrating Legacy .NET application

333
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,030
from the Legacy .NET
framework to .NET core

334
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,160
is not just a version upgrade.

335
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,580
It requires re-architecting
the application to align

336
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,333
with modern frameworks and
the runtime constraints.

337
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,670
And this image, this shows
an intricate layer of,

338
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,980
you know, interconnected dependencies each

339
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,473
with its own compatibility considerations.

340
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,340
Now this is another screenshot

341
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,860
from another .NET application.

342
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,255
You can see the dependency map

343
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:39,090
between the various microservices

344
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,480
and the package dependencies.

345
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,210
Now manually analyzing
these dependencies is a very

346
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,950
challenging task because
these dependencies are

347
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,720
deeply nested.

348
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,510
Most of these legacy APIs are deprecated

349
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,180
or they just behave
differently in .NET core.

350
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,690
So manually mapping these
dependencies is labor

351
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,883
intensive and it is prone to errors.

352
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,770
So we started exploring AI technologies

353
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,540
to address these challenges

354
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,440
and we ended up choosing
AWS Transform for .NET.

355
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,890
Now you might be wondering
why AWS Transform for .NET

356
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,383
because for us it came
down to three things,

357
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,223
reliability, intelligence, and velocity.

358
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,180
Now as I mentioned about the beta phase,

359
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,150
since that time we have been

360
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,560
like we have progressed

361
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,480
from transforming a single .NET

362
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,760
solution in Visual Studio

363
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,860
to now running transformations at scale

364
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,243
using the web experience.

365
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,420
Now before AWS Transform,

366
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,510
we explored various .NET porting tools

367
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,523
and it took us a lot of time and effort.

368
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,980
Now the project planning

369
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,900
itself used to take a few months

370
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,550
and we faced various hurdles

371
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,410
during the implementation.

372
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,413
However, with AWS Transform,
everything changed.

373
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,530
Now the screenshot

374
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,140
that you see on the screen is a job plan

375
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,180
from the web experience.

376
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,660
The AI agent helps us create
this job plan, you know,

377
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,970
the end-to-end job plan along

378
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,460
with all the background
resources using a simple

379
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,843
chat experience.

380
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,330
The unified web experience

381
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,610
provides a centralized management

382
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,910
and it enables the cross
team collaboration.

383
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,380
I can clearly define the roles

384
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,730
and responsibilities

385
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,590
of the team members who are working

386
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,570
with me on the migration projects.

387
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,870
I can assign them the
appropriate roles like approver

388
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,660
or admin or collaborator, et cetera.

389
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,400
And there's also a work log

390
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,070
that provides a verbose log

391
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,740
with a timestamp for future reference.

392
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,360
And there is a nice dashboard

393
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,860
which provides a complete

394
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,180
transformation summary

395
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,290
that includes important

396
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,390
details like the lines of code,

397
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,680
the number of projects

398
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,243
and the transformation status.

399
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,560
- So I understand that
you used AWS Transform

400
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,970
to transform your code.

401
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,280
Do you have any example
that you can show like

402
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,714
how it looks like before and how it looks

403
00:18:06,714 --> 00:18:08,850
after the transformation?

404
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,810
- Sure.

405
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,350
So what you see on the
screen right now is,

406
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,580
let me show you a couple of scenarios.

407
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,980
So this is scenario number one.

408
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,290
So you see like before the transformation,

409
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,120
it's a Legacy .NET code.

410
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,240
It's a XML based web dot config file.

411
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,880
And what we see here is it is in the code

412
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,160
we are configuring the
authentication settings.

413
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,610
For example, the 30 minutes
timeout XML attribute.

414
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,493
Now let's see what AWS
Transform for .NET did.

415
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,370
Now AWS Transform has
identified the legacy pattern

416
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,650
and it has converted the XML

417
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,450
based web dot config file

418
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,510
into a code based program dot CS file.

419
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,430
And you can also notice

420
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,530
that the functionality remains same.

421
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,330
You can see the same,

422
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,650
you know, the configuration

423
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,410
and the session timeout settings,

424
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,910
but it has explicitly

425
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,533
configured the cookie security.

426
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,140
Now let's look at another scenario.

427
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,470
It's a similar XML based
web dot config file

428
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,480
and here we are setting
the target framework

429
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,133
to the legacy 4.7.2.

430
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,070
Now AWS Transform intelligently
understood the legacy

431
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,760
pattern and here it did
a little bit differently.

432
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,580
What it did was it has split the code

433
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,080
into two different files.

434
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,980
Why?

435
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,960
Because in the legacy pattern

436
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,950
we had everything in just

437
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,420
one file called web dot config,

438
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,310
which is a XML based file.

439
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,140
But here you can see it has moved

440
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,330
the configuration into an

441
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,920
app settings dot JSON file

442
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,130
and it has moved the logic
into a separate file,

443
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,590
which is a code based program dot CS file.

444
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,930
So the functionality remains same,

445
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,670
but it is now more modern

446
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,053
and secure by default code.

447
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,350
So we are modernizing

448
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,410
for various reasons, speed, security,

449
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,769
cost, but for me most
importantly we are modernizing

450
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:00,363
for customer impact.

451
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,870
Now we are running around

452
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,750
10 .NET modernizations in parallel

453
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,270
and these are like
millions of lines of code,

454
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,520
not just side projects, right?

455
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,180
And AWS Transform as a force multiplier,

456
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,310
it is helping us to move safely

457
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,780
into production without

458
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,820
shutting down or starting over

459
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,410
because company like ours,

460
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,330
we don't get a greenfield reset

461
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,160
and these transformations,

462
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,723
they don't run in isolation.

463
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,290
Now having said that,

464
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,420
let's talk about some challenges.

465
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,110
AI is not doing 100% job for us.

466
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,030
There is still a lot to do.

467
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,710
And that brings me

468
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,490
to this slide about post
transformation challenges.

469
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,393
Now one of the biggest
challenges that we face

470
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:50,129
with running these
transformations at scale

471
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:52,260
is maintaining the compatibility

472
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,970
of the C# code

473
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,153
with the external or the
third party dependencies.

474
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,660
Now let me give you an example.

475
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,930
A lot of components have
been developed internally,

476
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,570
which are not written in C#, for example,

477
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,400
some of our graphical components,

478
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,130
they are written in C++ code.

479
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,200
There could be other scenarios like Web

480
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,270
forms or Windows forms.

481
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,560
There could also be unsupported

482
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,193
libraries like Windows
WIN32DLLSs or VB.NET.

483
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,460
So this is why we need human

484
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,503
in the address these challenges.

485
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,130
Now, as I said, being an early adopter,

486
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,420
it gave us an opportunity

487
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,700
to act fast and learn fast

488
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,620
and it also helped our consumers

489
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,150
to do a better planning

490
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,403
to transform their production workloads.

491
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,340
Now these transformations, trust me,

492
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,443
they are never 100% success.

493
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,290
A partially successful transformation

494
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:51,290
could mean 50%, 70%, or maybe 90%.

495
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,230
So this is exactly why
we work very closely

496
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,850
with the product engineering teams

497
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,090
to ensure end-to-end
successful transformation.

498
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,830
- [Pratip] So I have a question Lalit.

499
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,290
So how did you bridge the gap?

500
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,760
- Right.

501
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,180
So whenever we complete a transformation

502
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,500
and when we are ready to hand it over

503
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,153
to the product engineering teams,

504
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,570
basically AWS Transform commits

505
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,950
the transform code

506
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,230
into a new branch in the GitHub repository

507
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,910
and it creates a new pr.

508
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,210
So what we do is we pull
that transform code locally

509
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,510
and then on id we use

510
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,660
AI assisted tool like Amazon Q Developer

511
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,550
to you know, transform the delta.

512
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,530
So there's always a delta that's remaining

513
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,970
because of the various factors I was just

514
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,530
talking about, right?

515
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,540
And the transformation log that

516
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,440
and the summary that I was

517
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,630
talking about using the web experience,

518
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,180
it acts as a guide for the next set

519
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,250
of transformations, right?

520
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,480
So once we address all these
issues then we are good

521
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,970
to proceed with the next
set of transformations

522
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,520
and help our product engineering teams.

523
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,690
And with that I would like to welcome Yogi

524
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,260
to take us through the deep dive.

525
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,690
- Thanks Lalit.

526
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,923
Good morning everyone.

527
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,770
As Lalit showcased
modern applications with

528
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:15,720
thousands of dependency,
makes it difficult

529
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,410
to do a traditional manual
transformation approach.

530
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,940
Now with AWS Transform,

531
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,910
we can use an AI powered automation

532
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,670
to address that complex dependency.

533
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,470
So now I'm gonna showcase

534
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,060
how AWS Transform actually works.

535
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,970
Where is that magic coming

536
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,110
and what it is doing to help

537
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,353
customers modernize
this legacy application?

538
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,080
Let's look at the benefits.

539
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,850
So number one benefits

540
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,010
is it help accelerate transformation

541
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,850
of .NET application by
up to four times faster.

542
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,090
Whether it's an analysis
phase or dependency mapping

543
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,240
or you have to do compatibility assessment

544
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,890
or refactoring the code.

545
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:03,450
All of this times reduce
as what Lalit showcase

546
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,250
for Thomson Reuters use case

547
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,290
from months of plannings

548
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,210
to weeks of execution, right?

549
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,250
So overall you increase

550
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,380
the speed of your migration.

551
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,133
Next is in cost savings, windows license.

552
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:21,150
How many of you knows about
Windows licensing cost, right?

553
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,140
It cost up to 40% more
than the Linux server as

554
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,000
what Pratip mentioned earlier.

555
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,460
So not only licensing with Windows,

556
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,190
it comes like maintenance, upgrades

557
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,900
end of support challenges.

558
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,420
You can eliminate all of this

559
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,920
and on top of this,

560
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,700
if you can also save
the transformation cost,

561
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,380
let me ask you this question Lalit,

562
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,060
how much did you pay off

563
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,160
for using AWS Transform?

564
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,330
- [Lalit] Absolutely nothing.

565
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,163
- Exactly.

566
00:24:49,163 --> 00:24:50,640
It's free of cost, right?

567
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,830
So you save the cost required

568
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,920
for all this modern transformation tools

569
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,900
that you are using for planning,

570
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,630
for resources, for analysis

571
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,774
and for conversing converters,

572
00:25:02,774 --> 00:25:05,160
remediating for refactoring,

573
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,000
all these things is handled
using AWS Transform.

574
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,160
And third thing is about quality

575
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,200
because you can do manual transformation,

576
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,750
but how do you ensure that your quality

577
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,520
is as best, right?

578
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,465
So we use generative AI LLM, we have a

579
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:23,670
.NET expertise deeply induced

580
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,800
into this Amazon bedrock

581
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,410
large language models LLMs.

582
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,480
And that does this transformation.

583
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,300
So because of that you
get the best quality

584
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,360
of the ported code, at the same time,

585
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,640
let me ask you these questions.

586
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,740
How many of you have only one application

587
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,320
in production only?

588
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,210
We don't have only one application, right?

589
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,460
We have hundreds of application

590
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,730
and in Thomson Reuters
use case they had 400 such

591
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,320
application in production.

592
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,450
So to modernize this hundreds

593
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,230
of application at scale in parallel,

594
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,280
that's another benefit

595
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,873
of using AWS Transform.

596
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,013
Now let's deep dive into how it works.

597
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,560
It comes with two experience,

598
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,660
one of them is web experience

599
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,270
and I'm looking at the time

600
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,760
to see if I can talk about this.

601
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,440
Okay, let me just wait

602
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,390
for a couple of more minutes

603
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,190
and I will talk more about it.

604
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,450
So with web experience,

605
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,450
the way it's an react based spa front end

606
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,420
where you can port your repository

607
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,561
and then remind me again
what was your repository?

608
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:32,394
- [Lalit] GitHub.

609
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:33,227
- GitHub, yeah.

610
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:36,803
So if you are using GitHub

611
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,820
Bitbucket, GitLab

612
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,410
or Azure DevOps,

613
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,590
you can point your
repository to bad experience.

614
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,270
And once you point your repository

615
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,060
you can select the projects
within the repository

616
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,450
and once that's finalized
you can give an approval

617
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,810
to AWS Transform to start
working on the transformation.

618
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,710
And it uses like 300 different
customized parameters

619
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,590
that you can do to customize
your transformation.

620
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,570
If you have your custom negate

621
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,100
packages that you are using,

622
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,540
you can even upload that

623
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,060
and ask AWS Transform to use that.

624
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,540
So it generates a real time transformation

625
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,340
summary on the dashboard.

626
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,100
And one more important

627
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,080
is if you have multiple projects,

628
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,960
it uses a batch of 50
application in a batch

629
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,603
and it does the transformation
using that batch.

630
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,290
Another thing is if you
have a multiple projects

631
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,560
and multiple teams, so now I think I can,

632
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,040
looking at the time, I think I can say

633
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,780
great news we are releasing

634
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,000
is we are gonna have a multiuser

635
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,640
collaboration including
your partners as well.

636
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,610
So before you can only
have a workspace with a job

637
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,891
that only one person works

638
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:48,870
or now you can have multiple

639
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,370
teams whether you are an IT

640
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,830
administrator, whether you are a developer

641
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,900
or you are a DBA or a program manager,

642
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,170
you can now collaborate
together on the same AWS

643
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,370
transform workspace.

644
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,760
Not only that, if you
are a partner working

645
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,190
with a modernization with a customer,

646
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,220
then you can also collaborate
on the same workspace.

647
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,690
That's all available
from now 11:00 AM today.

648
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,850
So that's another great exciting features.

649
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,800
It just got released.

650
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,363
That's about web experience.

651
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,840
Next is an IDE experience.

652
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,153
How many of you are a developer?

653
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,490
Lots of developers here.

654
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,700
Yeah, so except for me,
I didn't start my career

655
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,620
as a developer so,

656
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,843
but anyway, if you are a developer,

657
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:36,330
you are used to with a
Visual Studio, IDE, right?

658
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,700
So we give you the same experience

659
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,350
using Visual Studio IDE so

660
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,600
that you can open your solution file

661
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,600
and port to using AWS
Transform to a newer version.

662
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,100
What you can see here with
the developer experience,

663
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,500
there isn't side by side comparison.

664
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,170
So the intelligent code differential,

665
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,430
it highlights the difference

666
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,630
between the two versions,

667
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,910
the one which is .NET framework,

668
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,590
another which is .NET core.

669
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,920
So now you can see that
what's been changed

670
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,860
so you can easily understand
the transformation.

671
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,680
With IDE version another thing is you can

672
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,200
also generate the documentation

673
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,510
it's gonna point to the .NET documentation

674
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,820
as well so that you can learn it

675
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,130
as you are doing the
transformation as well.

676
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,200
Now, which experience is good?

677
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,250
Which one is bad?

678
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,380
There is no good or bad experience.

679
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,150
It depends on your personality.

680
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,770
So you are, you said you are

681
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,120
developer so you must have start.

682
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,470
Let me ask you this question,

683
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,640
which one you started

684
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,710
for Thomson Reuters use case?

685
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,490
- So we started with the IDE experience

686
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,620
because we started small

687
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,479
and then started scaling out
using the web experience.

688
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:44,312
- Nice.

689
00:29:44,312 --> 00:29:45,510
So if you are a developer,

690
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,343
if you just want

691
00:29:46,343 --> 00:29:48,090
to do a POC for one application,

692
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,010
you start with an IDE experience.

693
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,080
Or if you are a DevOps personality,

694
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,030
you can start within web experience.

695
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,670
I have seen customers
started with a web experience

696
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,843
and then they want to do
sometimes, you know what,

697
00:29:58,843 --> 00:30:01,688
they don't even know how many applications

698
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:03,270
are .NET framework

699
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,230
because we have hundreds

700
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,000
of application in the repository.

701
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,060
If you want to just do a
full scan of your repository,

702
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,470
find out how many of them are .NET

703
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,760
framework application,

704
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,530
what does the overall transformation

705
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,770
summary looks like for all the projects.

706
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,533
And you can create a business case,

707
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:23,520
take it to your management

708
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,600
and showcase that hey,

709
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,640
this is what we have, we got like

710
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,680
so much of cost savings opportunity,

711
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,300
let's modernize them.

712
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,480
So that will help you to make a decision

713
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,040
and then take one application

714
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,570
and go to the IDE version

715
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:41,370
and try to port it, try
to transform it using IDE

716
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,410
and if there is any failures you can go

717
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,733
back and forth as well.

718
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,150
Now let's see how it works.

719
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,530
So on the left here is

720
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,390
in your .NET application framework

721
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,610
application with a solution file

722
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,736
with multiple projects,

723
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:57,480
the traditional .NET web config file,

724
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,070
business logic and unit test.

725
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,220
When you feed that into AWS Transform,

726
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,110
it goes into this tri-state
loop, analyze, validate,

727
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,790
analyze, transform, validate,

728
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,800
we call it as a tri-state loop

729
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,070
because it has to do the porting

730
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,990
until it finds the best fit.

731
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,410
So it converts your .NET
framework applications,

732
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,570
web dot config to the program.cas,

733
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,870
the business logic it's been
converted using thousands

734
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:29,430
of predefined code conversion
patterns that we have.

735
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,950
It goes through that and
it does the conversation.

736
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,330
And in the validated phase

737
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,250
it does the validation as well.

738
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,230
Your unit tests are executed

739
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:42,060
and one more thing is to
also check for the approval.

740
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,980
There is always human in the loop

741
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,709
because you want to make sure that

742
00:31:45,709 --> 00:31:47,970
before even you get
started, you need a human

743
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,770
to approve the repository.

744
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,000
You need human to approve

745
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,310
how many projects you are selecting

746
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,870
and you need approval

747
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,760
to make sure your transformation

748
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,383
is okay to deploy that.

749
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,250
Now let's see the deep
transformation stages.

750
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,380
The first stage is a discovery stage.

751
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,100
This is where AWS Transforms
determines the number

752
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,430
of line code, what type
of application it is.

753
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,440
Is it a Windows form application,

754
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,090
web form application,

755
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,520
WPF application, MBC application.

756
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,090
What it is in my portfolio,

757
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,890
it identifies the number

758
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,740
of lines of code as well as

759
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,090
what's required for doing
an overall assessment.

760
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,790
The next phase is an analysis phase.

761
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:36,091
This is where the
dependency mappings happens.

762
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:38,310
It's whether it's an internal dependency

763
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,020
or an external dependency.

764
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,490
So your solution can depend

765
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,650
on multiple projects in within

766
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,930
or you can have one solution file

767
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,530
depends on other solution in folder

768
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,720
or you can even have external dependency

769
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,210
with another repository.

770
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,910
Everything is identified at this stage.

771
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,560
How many of you are familiar

772
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,433
with nugget packages, right?

773
00:33:00,433 --> 00:33:04,230
AWS Transform supports 250
nugget packages, right?

774
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,440
So it does that third
party library assessment,

775
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,920
identify the DLLs, identify the APIs calls

776
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,110
and do all analysis and generates

777
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:16,830
and detail assessment
report end of this stage.

778
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,230
And the next stage is a planning phase.

779
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,270
So this stage it does create

780
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:24,543
an actual transformation
strategic creation.

781
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,120
What's the timeline required?

782
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,980
How many resources are required?

783
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,440
You know, taking the actual PM's job

784
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,273
is done in this

785
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:34,500
planning phase by AWS Transform

786
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,460
and at the end you get an AWS Transform

787
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,593
to do an administrator approval.

788
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,210
Last phase, the fourth
phase is an execution phase.

789
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,240
So with this phase, actual magic happens,

790
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,460
actual work happens in this phase,

791
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,610
this is where the automatic
code conversation happens.

792
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,280
We have like pre-train thousands

793
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,120
of different .NET
transformation code patterns.

794
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,080
It goes through them until
it finds the best solution.

795
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,730
And at the same time,

796
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,890
if you have any unit tests supplied

797
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,290
with your project, it does execution of

798
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,300
that unit test as well.

799
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,613
And the lastly, the validation phase.

800
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,890
How many of you have

801
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:20,250
a performance problem in
your .NET application?

802
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,020
Legacy framework application has a

803
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,430
performance problem, right?

804
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,780
So you want to make sure

805
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,830
the ported code also meets
the performance requirement.

806
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:32,220
At least it's same or better, right?

807
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,530
So with the performance metrics

808
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,660
evaluation before and after,

809
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:41,660
it makes sure that it it
does an proper checking

810
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,180
before you do the transformation,

811
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,860
then it creates the transformation

812
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,840
assessment summary report

813
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,410
and lastly it creates the
Linux readiness report.

814
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,810
Now let me ask you this question Lalit,

815
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,720
what is your end state goal

816
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,436
for deploying this application
which you modernized?

817
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:02,477
- [Lalit] Yeah, so we definitely want

818
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,500
to run these on Linux containers.

819
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,640
- Linux containers, right?

820
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,650
So but then how do you know if your

821
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,270
application is Linux ready?

822
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,103
Right?

823
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:12,390
So AWS Transformation
will give you a Linux

824
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,680
readiness report.

825
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,100
So it makes sure that the
imported code is now ready

826
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,360
to run on Linux

827
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,790
and if it's missing any
gaps it's gonna list

828
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,300
out and it's gonna give you
remediation steps as well.

829
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,390
What you can do to remediate those issues.

830
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,750
So that's all about the transformation.

831
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,620
Now let's talk about
security of this service.

832
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,500
Security is job zero at AWS.

833
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,110
A lot of customer asked
me, I'm from Canada,

834
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,960
so when AWS Transform first started,

835
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,098
it was only available in US east

836
00:35:46,098 --> 00:35:48,630
and Frankfurt region, right?

837
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,430
So customer asked me, "Hey Yogi,

838
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,320
when it is coming in Canada central

839
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,153
like I really want

840
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:54,030
to use because you know

841
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,462
some government standard they don't

842
00:35:55,462 --> 00:35:56,910
want to send your code

843
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,810
outside your your region," and I'm happy

844
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,820
to announce that today

845
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,550
as of now we started supporting

846
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,373
to six more region AWS Transform

847
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:11,490
for .NET is gonna be
available in six more region

848
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,470
including Canada Central as well.

849
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,840
So all my Canadian customers can take

850
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,580
an advantage right now.

851
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,980
Now let's look at the
security point of view.

852
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,540
How does this service works right?

853
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,010
So when a user sends

854
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,760
an authenticated users,
again this has to be

855
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,360
identity manager, I am
authenticated user only.

856
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,810
When it goes request to
then AWS Transform it go

857
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,166
through an API gateway

858
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:39,990
and this first request
itself is TLS 1.3 encrypted.

859
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,060
So this connection is encrypted,

860
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,650
then it goes to API gateway.

861
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,510
This is where AWS web application

862
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,030
firewall handles the red

863
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,250
limit and request filtering.

864
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,020
At the same time,

865
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,270
now when it goes further,

866
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,850
it uses and temporary processing

867
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,010
for doing all this transformation.

868
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,040
So if you are using an IDE experience,

869
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,070
it does the work locally
on your environment

870
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,230
and if you are using a web experience,

871
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,780
what it does, it creates
a temporary EC2 instance

872
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:14,490
into the VPC.

873
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,650
And this has been destroyed

874
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,750
after the transformation is done.

875
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,810
So it's all data is being purged

876
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:25,260
and we don't keep this data in forever.

877
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,150
It's like a temporary processing.

878
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,320
And during this all,

879
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,570
if you need to put a temporary storage,

880
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,940
it used an Amazon S3 for storage

881
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,950
and that is being encrypted

882
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,440
with AWS K management service,

883
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,870
AWS Key, KMS.

884
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,090
And now if you said, hey I want

885
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,790
to do my custom keys, can you do that?

886
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,270
Yes, you can also do a
custom key encryption on top

887
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,093
of AWS key management service as well.

888
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,363
Another thing is authentication.

889
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,450
Another great exciting news.

890
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,520
Until now it was only supporting

891
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,670
an IMM authentication in identity center.

892
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,990
But as of today,

893
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,280
now AWS Transform supports Okta as well

894
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,570
as Microsoft Entra ID as
an authentication method.

895
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:17,190
So now you can also have
a broader collaboration

896
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,700
between different
authentication IDP provider

897
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,293
to use AWS Transform.

898
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,370
Next is an AWS CloudTrail
where all the API

899
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,380
and audit things are getting logged

900
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,810
and we also have Amazon CloudWatch

901
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,450
that you can have your detail monitoring.

902
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,783
Now how many of you have
tried AWS transform before?

903
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,380
Because it released in May of this year.

904
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,213
Yeah.

905
00:38:41,213 --> 00:38:43,470
So when you tried this,
it did not allow you

906
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,170
to continue from the fail job, right?

907
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,970
If you have to redo the stuff.

908
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,980
But again, another good news

909
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,590
today from now on you can

910
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,060
restart your fail job.

911
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,860
You can continue from where it end,

912
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,850
you can collaborate

913
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:57,900
with multiple teams,

914
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,180
you can collaborate with multiple roles

915
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,450
and you can have like
administrator, contributor

916
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,310
read only this kind of different roles

917
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,410
in within AWS Transform

918
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,640
and it stores everything
into AWS CloudWatch,

919
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,610
which you have access,
before it was still storing

920
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,020
but you did not have access.

921
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,330
But now we make it more transparent.

922
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,040
We listen to your request,

923
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,840
we listen to customer requirement

924
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,830
and make it available

925
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,540
for you so you can understand

926
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,730
what actually it's doing.

927
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,270
So CloudWatch monitoring

928
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,863
will be there for you as well.

929
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,550
Now every customer I
talk about AWS Transform,

930
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,860
they ask me this question, tell me Yogi,

931
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,390
if my application is an Windows

932
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,200
Web Forms, is it supported?

933
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,410
If my application is an MVC application,

934
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,360
my application is WCF application.

935
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,490
Is it supported vault
supported, vault's not

936
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,570
supported, right?

937
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,387
So you can see here the source

938
00:39:53,387 --> 00:39:55,590
.NET version supported if

939
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,780
you have .NET framework 3.5

940
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:02,780
and up, .NET core 3.1, .NET standard two,

941
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,370
just now we started supporting

942
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,990
that at 11:00 AM as well.

943
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,000
The .NET standard two is also now

944
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,860
supported if you have that.

945
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:14,160
And what is a destination
is in .NET eight.

946
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,170
So probably Lalit your destination

947
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,610
also .NET eight, right?

948
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,763
Right now?

949
00:40:18,763 --> 00:40:19,596
- [Lalit] Currently, yes.

950
00:40:19,596 --> 00:40:21,150
- But we are happy to announce today

951
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,680
that if you are looking forward,

952
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,070
we can also support your
application on .NET 10 now

953
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,260
because that's the newest long term

954
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,430
supportability version

955
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,680
Microsoft released earlier this month

956
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,330
and we are now supporting

957
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,830
that as a destination as well.

958
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,053
So .NET 10 is also supported.

959
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,870
So, and one of the things

960
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,730
you mentioned in your presentation

961
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,280
as a post transformation limitation

962
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,920
that you had in Web Forms, right?

963
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,190
So those Web Forms now we can have

964
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,740
that converted into Blazor as well.

965
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,210
So you can also maybe plan

966
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,770
that for your future project

967
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:59,010
to convert those ASP .NET
Web Forms into ASP .NET

968
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,690
Core Blazor as well.

969
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,080
If you have MVC Razor ASP .NET pages,

970
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,240
that can be also converted
into ASP .NET core

971
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:10,950
and here comes the excitement.

972
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,480
Actually I'm gonna,

973
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,850
before I click on next slide, I just want

974
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:19,710
to make sure I got the
permission from my, good.

975
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,137
All right, so tell me about

976
00:41:22,137 --> 00:41:23,550
what database you are using Lalit,

977
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,230
for your .NET application.

978
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,344
- Mostly SQL server.

979
00:41:26,344 --> 00:41:27,330
- SQL Server, okay.

980
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:30,330
So we are happy to announce today

981
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,330
that we will be starting
the Windows full stack

982
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,780
modernization, which
includes your .NET as well

983
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,150
as SQL Server database.

984
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,640
So now if your application has a SQL

985
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,860
and .NET together,

986
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,380
your SQL will be modernized too.

987
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,750
Amazon Aurora for PostgreSQL.

988
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,760
So AWS transfer will help

989
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,710
you do a Windows full stack
end-to-end modernization.

990
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,990
And this is a big news for me

991
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,630
because I've been DBA in my whole life

992
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,880
and I know how difficult

993
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,810
it to convert from SQL Server

994
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,610
to Aurora PostgreSQL

995
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,130
because both of them are different engine,

996
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:11,309
the schema converses in
itself is challenging,

997
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:14,430
T-SQL to PL/pgSQL conversion,

998
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,860
transactions cementings are different.

999
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,610
Even the optimizer query tuning

1000
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,200
everything works differently.

1001
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,180
Indexes, indexes are also working

1002
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,150
differently as well as the security.

1003
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,160
And trust me, AWS Transform

1004
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,070
for Windows full strike
modernization handles

1005
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,660
everything in the backend.

1006
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,617
So it removes all manual intervention

1007
00:42:36,617 --> 00:42:39,157
and it it does the schema conversation

1008
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:41,720
to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL.

1009
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,060
Now you may ask how about my data?

1010
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,790
So you can also convert your data

1011
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,980
to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL.

1012
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,860
So as first step it converts the schema.

1013
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,200
Second step, it does the data migration.

1014
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,750
And you will ask me a question, "Hey Yogi,

1015
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,880
how about my application?"

1016
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,790
It also modernize the application

1017
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,140
which has a SQL server

1018
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,330
code written within the application.

1019
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:10,200
It converts that as an Amazon
Aurora PostgreSQL code.

1020
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,040
So it's a full stack
end-to-end modernization

1021
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,010
and we are so proud to announce today

1022
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,860
that it's gonna be
available for all of you

1023
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:24,390
to start using in all
the total eight region

1024
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,330
that we are supporting AWS Transform.

1025
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,310
So that's a big news

1026
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,320
you can get hear more in the keynote

1027
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,400
tomorrow about that.

1028
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,840
More details as well.

1029
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,810
And if you want to learn more about it,

1030
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,730
we have lot of sessions,

1031
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,530
embargo sessions will be available

1032
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,330
for you in your catalog as well.

1033
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:45,150
Check out the re:Invent
catalog for this topic

1034
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,840
and you can mark that in
your calendar as well.

1035
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,590
There are more resources
to learn more about it.

1036
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,720
But before I go that stage,

1037
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,180
I would like to ask Lalit to say,

1038
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,820
can you tell about
what's an overall outcome

1039
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,860
of your modernization?

1040
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:04,580
- Sure, happy to talk about it.

1041
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,410
So we have come down from you know,

1042
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,730
running transformations

1043
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,940
for a few months to just a few sprints.

1044
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,420
Currently we are
modernizing over 1.5 million

1045
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,220
lines of code per month.

1046
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,510
And this is possible

1047
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:21,270
because we are working
closely, you know, in synergy

1048
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,620
with the product engineering teams

1049
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:28,020
and you know, all the
initial POCs that we did.

1050
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,410
It helped a lot to do a proper planning

1051
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:35,280
and ensure, you know, our consumers

1052
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,830
to do a complete end-to-end
transformation using

1053
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,750
AWS Transform four.net.

1054
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,090
So one important thing I
would like to say here is

1055
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,430
that it gives our developers

1056
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,320
the time to build the future

1057
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,673
and not maintain the past.

1058
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,120
- That's exactly what you said it.

1059
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,580
And since as I understand,

1060
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,830
you are still transforming, right?

1061
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,663
- We are, yeah.

1062
00:44:56,663 --> 00:44:57,780
And it's just the beginning.

1063
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,100
- It's something is still running

1064
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,340
for in the Thomson Reuters
workspace right now.

1065
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,560
They are still transforming the code.

1066
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,860
So they have started,
now it's about your turn.

1067
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,110
Like what the message that I would like

1068
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,120
to give is free of cost.

1069
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,820
So identify your simple application

1070
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:18,900
and I want you to understand
and experience yourself.

1071
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,780
Try it out firsthand for
your simple application

1072
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,700
and see how it looks for you.

1073
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,150
If you do more help, do a POC reach out

1074
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,050
to your account team

1075
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:29,730
and then maybe reach out to us

1076
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,710
and we can help you do the POC

1077
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,930
and find out the cost savings

1078
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:37,860
you can get, estimates
the, or do an estimation

1079
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,150
and then present the business case

1080
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,500
to your management to see

1081
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,630
how much it can help you save cost.

1082
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,360
And lastly, AWS Transform

1083
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,700
will help your modernization

1084
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,350
to take to the next level, right?

1085
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:53,640
So instead of running it a slow, steady

1086
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,620
and manual modernization,

1087
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,700
now you can have a fast

1088
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,060
AI based and parallel modernization

1089
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,470
for your application.

1090
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,390
We have created a case study

1091
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,070
working with Thomson Reuters.

1092
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,880
So here is an QR code to
link to that case study.

1093
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,760
There are more resources for AWS Transform

1094
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,270
and we have more sessions
hands-on workshop.

1095
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,160
So please check out this QR code

1096
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,570
because this has the workshop

1097
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,230
for this new Windows
full stack modernization.

1098
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,880
If you want to see how it is

1099
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,860
like builder session workshop.

1100
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,150
And there are also workshop

1101
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,820
on using AWS Transform for .NET as well.

1102
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,440
So check out all the resources

1103
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,940
that you have available.

1104
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,140
And you know what, looking at the time,

1105
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:44,700
I'm gonna now ask Lalit a question

1106
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,750
before I hand it over

1107
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,280
to you guys for question answer.

1108
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,030
Can you tell me a best
tips that you have it

1109
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,323
for this audience?

1110
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,920
- Well, I can think a
couple of them right now.

1111
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,360
I think the first one would be start small

1112
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,300
and then you can scale out
using the web experience.

1113
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,190
So you don't have to worry about,

1114
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,150
even if you want to start

1115
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:10,200
with a POC and most importantly be ready

1116
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,000
to face some challenges,

1117
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,490
there will be failures for sure

1118
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:17,580
because as I said, these transformations,

1119
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,650
these are never 100% success.

1120
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,900
So you can use AI assisted tools

1121
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,190
to transform the delta

1122
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,990
and there's always human in the loop.

1123
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:26,850
So that's what I can-

1124
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,950
- Thank you very much
for sharing those tips.

1125
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:31,050
And we are here so if you have

1126
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,210
any questions we can ask.

1127
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:36,900
We purposely kept this some
time for question answers

1128
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:37,733
because you know,

1129
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:38,880
we know that you might have a lot

1130
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,796
of questions about how
about AD .NET support.

1131
00:47:42,796 --> 00:47:44,970
It's supported right now.

1132
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:46,800
How about Entity framework support?

1133
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,690
It is supported from Entity framework

1134
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,220
to Entity framework core.

1135
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,170
How about VB .NET?

1136
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,580
That's coming up right?

1137
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,980
So any other questions
that you might have it,

1138
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,480
we are here to help.

1139
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,980
So having said that,

1140
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,480
we are gonna wrap up this session.

1141
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,430
