1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,260
- Hello.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,093
Hello you all.

3
00:00:02,093 --> 00:00:04,620
Welcome to this presentation.

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,130
I'm going to be talking
about the AI offering

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,340
that we have at Heroku.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,830
Before we start, I'm
going to introduce myself.

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,880
My name is Julian Duque.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,280
I'm the principal developer
advocate for Heroku,

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,710
which is a Salesforce company.

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,240
And being a Salesforce company,

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,430
we are publicly traded company,

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,680
so please don't make
any purchase decisions

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,030
based out of things that are
not yet publicly available.

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,693
I might be mentioning things
that are not yet fully GA.

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,230
So Heroku is a platform as a service.

16
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,800
We have been in business since 2010, 2011.

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,040
We were the first platform as a service

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,020
for Ruby on Rails applications

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,140
and now we support more than
nine programming languages

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,930
and some other managed services.

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,930
We are renowned for offering
a great developer experience

22
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,600
and our developer experience is that good

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,390
that a lot of companies,
open source products

24
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,740
have created the Heroku of X.

25
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,800
They try to mimic our experience

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,400
and create something out of what we do.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,840
So a couple years ago we asked
ourselves these questions.

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,590
Who is going to build the Heroku of AI?

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,380
Who is going to bring
the developer experience

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,380
of building AI applications
that offers Heroku?

31
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,170
And of course the answer was ourselves.

32
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,403
We are going to be
building the Heroku of AI.

33
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,510
So basically building AI applications

34
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,550
and agents is challenging.

35
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,440
You'll need to make a lot of decisions

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,690
and take care of things
that are not usually

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,140
pretty much obvious.

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,340
For example, we need to
select the right models,

39
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,890
the large language models
we are going to be using

40
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,060
for our application.

41
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,660
If it is like a text-to-text
model, emails generation model,

42
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,390
if we are going to do
embeddings, we need to make sure

43
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,390
that we are using the
right model for our app.

44
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,370
Also, how are we going to integrate

45
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,040
with the other applications and services?

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,680
How are we going to allow the LLM

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,680
or the model to access data securely

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,420
'cause right now one of the risks

49
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,930
about building AI application
is that data leakage.

50
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,710
We are giving access to
our data to a third party

51
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,477
that can access that it
might be like vulnerable

52
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:34,950
to certain security issues.

53
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,040
And also how are we going to operate

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,110
the infrastructure behind AI?

55
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,630
Like a lot of hidden
things that we don't know,

56
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,660
like managing GPUs, being able to maintain

57
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,710
the models running.

58
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,320
There is a lot of complexity behind.

59
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,320
Also, it's hard to make
things easy for developers,

60
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,200
easy for the company
to operate and manage.

61
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,010
Heroku has been working
in a platform for a while,

62
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,010
so we already have an integrated
platform where you can use

63
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,440
and deploy your applications and agents.

64
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,020
We have great developer experience

65
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,870
and operational experience.

66
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,250
We already selected a
list of curated AI models

67
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,690
that we know are used in the industry

68
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,260
and that are working for these
new type of applications.

69
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,480
And we also added extensibility

70
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,420
through the model context
protocol, which is this protocol

71
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,890
that allows the LLMs to
have access to more context

72
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,090
through prompt resources and tools

73
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,290
and getting to production is hard.

74
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,620
We need to make a lot of
decisions that are complex.

75
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,770
For example, when we want to
take an application on an agent

76
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,410
to production, we need to
choose where are we going

77
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,790
to deploy this application?

78
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,610
What is going to be the
underlying operating system

79
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,150
and the working configuration
that we will use for our app?

80
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,090
How is the CPU and memory
going to be distributed

81
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,200
for our application?

82
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,600
What is going to be the
data store, the logging,

83
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,100
the observability?

84
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,630
So there is a lot of moving
pieces that are related

85
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,053
to deploying an application to production.

86
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,430
With Heroku we simplify all of this choice

87
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,280
and we are giving you
an opinionated platform

88
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,460
so you can focus on
building the application

89
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,160
using our developer tools to deploy

90
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,100
and then operating your application

91
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,160
by using the tools we are
giving you to scale your app,

92
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,590
to monitor your app,
to do the observability

93
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,210
and we take care of the rest,

94
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,250
we take care of the observability,

95
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,120
we take care of the metric,

96
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,170
we take care of the support,

97
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,360
and we give you the tools for you to scale

98
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,220
and maintain the application.

99
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,700
And this is increasing
developer productivity.

100
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,237
This is reducing the money
that you are spending on DevOps

101
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:56,220
and infrastructure operation

102
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,620
and it is increasing
the return of investment

103
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,183
of your application.

104
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,020
So lemme tell you about
the different AI offerings

105
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,657
that we announced and released this year

106
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:10,740
and this is why we became
the AI platform as a service.

107
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,830
First we have managed
inference and agents.

108
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,420
So we allow you to provision
AI models to an app

109
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,180
just with one click or with one command.

110
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,570
You can select from a
list of curated AI models

111
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,200
that allows you to do text
generation, image generation

112
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,320
or embeddings with just one click.

113
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,180
This is something that
is available right now.

114
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,180
We recently launched support
for Claude 4.5 Sonnet,

115
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,680
for Claude 4.5 Haiku, Amazon Nova Lite

116
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,370
Amazon Nova Pro, gpt-oss-120b.

117
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,870
We also added support for MCP,

118
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,310
the model context protocol

119
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,530
and this support this in two ways.

120
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,237
We have an Heroku MCP server
that allows developers

121
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:04,200
and DevOps people to use our MCP

122
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,660
that knows how to manage Heroku resources.

123
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,400
So this is for builders

124
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,250
but we also have a platform for you

125
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,900
to securely deploy MCP
servers that you are building.

126
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,178
So you can deploy and
host your MCP on Heroku

127
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:24,060
and access that MCP remotely
through an HTTP interface

128
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,410
or directly from within the
agent endpoint that we give you

129
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,663
with the managed inference and agents.

130
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,614
We also have support for vector
database through pgvector,

131
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:38,227
which is an extension of PostgreSQL

132
00:06:38,227 --> 00:06:43,110
to create vector databases
to perform similarity search

133
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,650
and create retrieval augmented
generation pipelines.

134
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,760
And we also, back in October
we released the pilot

135
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,300
of Heroku Vibes which is a
tool that that allows you

136
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,870
to build web applications
using natural language

137
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,160
from the web.

138
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,780
And this tool lets you build the app

139
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,390
and deploy the app automatically Heroku.

140
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,690
So you don't even need to worry about

141
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,600
the infrastructure behind we
are taking care of everything

142
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,240
and just with one prompt
and a couple of adjustments

143
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,040
if you want to iterate over it,

144
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,070
you can have an application from an idea

145
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,323
to production in minutes.

146
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,780
Let me show you a couple
of demos that I have here

147
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,620
that shows you first the Heroku
manage inference and agents

148
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,390
and how I built an application
that uses our Heroku AI

149
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,160
to get access to data

150
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,220
and to be able to perform smart actions

151
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,690
within an application.

152
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,210
And another example of Heroku Vibes

153
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,333
which can let you build
applications using natural language.

154
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,893
Cool.

155
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,050
So I built this application
which is a dashboard

156
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,880
for a solar energy company.

157
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,540
Let's say you have a solar
insulation in your house

158
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,240
or in your business
and you want to monitor

159
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,220
how much energy are you producing,

160
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,059
how much energy are you consuming,

161
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:12,450
what are going to be your savings

162
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,420
and get some insights
about the application.

163
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,360
So this dashboard already gone

164
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,937
and access my PostgreSQL database
that is deployed on Heroku

165
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:24,870
and creates the dashboard.

166
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,060
But this is your typical web application.

167
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,320
I want to also ask questions using AI

168
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,130
to get access to insights from my data.

169
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,360
So how can I do this?

170
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,010
Usually people build

171
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,350
retrieval augmented generation pipelines.

172
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,830
So you get data from the
database, you pass that data

173
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,570
to the inference model

174
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,900
and then you perform some
inference on top of that data.

175
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,660
What we did here is that
we are using agents,

176
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,470
we have an agent using the
Heroku endpoint and tools.

177
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,910
Tools that we maintain,
which are pretty much MCPs

178
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,890
that are hosted and brought in on Heroku

179
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,400
to give my agent access to the database.

180
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,560
I am not giving my database credentials,

181
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,560
I am just giving a read
only access to a follower

182
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,890
of my database so I can
safely retrieve data

183
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,960
and analyze that data.

184
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,913
So let me open the agent here.

185
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,710
I already have two queries that I did,

186
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,110
but I'm going to be doing
something here live.

187
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,600
The first one I ask about

188
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,723
what was my lowest
production date this month.

189
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,860
So I want to know from all
this month what was the date

190
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,230
that I had the lowest production.

191
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,270
So it is performing a tool execution,

192
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,460
which is the database query.

193
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,710
It's generating this query.

194
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,280
So my agent already knows
the shape of my database,

195
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,650
but we also have tools
to retrieve the schema

196
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,740
of the database so it doesn't hallucinate

197
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,990
the shape of your data.

198
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,500
It's generating the query,
it's running the query

199
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,180
and giving me the response

200
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,200
and then the inference is
taking care of the answer.

201
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,390
So pretty much we are feeding the context

202
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,720
of my prompt with tools.

203
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,900
For the other question I want to chart

204
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,180
or to create an image

205
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,503
of the hourly production data of today.

206
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,720
So it's gonna be pretty much the same.

207
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,060
I need to go to the database

208
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,090
but then how can I create that image?

209
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,260
So for that I'm using another
tool which is code execution.

210
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,330
In this case I'm using Python

211
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,030
and the Python dependencies
to generate images

212
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,290
like matplotlib, pandas, numpy, et cetera

213
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,180
to create the image on the fly.

214
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,780
And I'm uploading this image to Amazon S3

215
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,900
and then returning a predesigned URL.

216
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,770
So we can see here that we
have the database query.

217
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,140
This is fetching the data
hour by hour of today

218
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,540
and then it's passing that data
to a Python execution tool.

219
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,880
Since you can run any
application on Heroku,

220
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,400
what we are doing here is
we are generating this code.

221
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,680
The LLM is generating this code.

222
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,040
It is spinning a dine on
Heroku a built-on machine

223
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,640
running the code sandbox salesly on Heroku

224
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,990
and getting the return.

225
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,710
So you are just only consuming the seconds

226
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,410
that that application was running.

227
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,480
I get the return which
is the pre-signed URL

228
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,710
on Amazon S3 and now I have
the answer which is the report

229
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,690
and the analysis.

230
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,003
So let me trigger another prompt here.

231
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,630
So what was the peak production
in the past seven days?

232
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,400
So the same, I need to use
a tool to get this data.

233
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,893
In this case I am expecting that my agent

234
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:59,403
that I configured is going
to perform a database query,

235
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,030
getting that data from the database

236
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,270
and then doing an analysis over that data.

237
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,650
So this is the query, it failed.

238
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,483
Amazing.

239
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:13,593
So now it is trying another query.

240
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,260
Now we got the response.

241
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,560
So you saw that it has like
a self-healing capability

242
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,080
and this is not a scripted,
this is a live demo.

243
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,860
It failed and now it got the data

244
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,670
and created the report that
I just asked on the fly.

245
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,220
So how this work, how
I provision this model

246
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,140
to my application?

247
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,080
So this is an application
that is deployed on Heroku.

248
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,063
It's an OJS application,

249
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,750
an API that access the Heroku AI services.

250
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,480
So how can I provision this AI services?

251
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,090
As any other service on Heroku.

252
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,190
I am on the Heroku dashboard,
I'm on the resources

253
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:59,670
and I will search for Heroku
manage inference and agents.

254
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,333
It'll provide a list of the
supported models that we have.

255
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,420
I can select the model.

256
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,120
Let's say we want Claude 4.5.

257
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,983
I click on the order form, provision,

258
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,480
and now I have the model
available to my application.

259
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,393
How can I access from my
application to that model?

260
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,610
Basically this is giving me
an API URL and an API key.

261
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,770
And now I can use an SDK

262
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,950
or directly performing an HTTP request

263
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,880
to the inference endpoint
and get the response.

264
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,880
This is everything working
on Heroku infrastructure.

265
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,120
So your data is not going
out to a third party,

266
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,191
everything is within
the same infrastructure

267
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:53,910
is staying safe and is trusted

268
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,683
getting access to the database.

269
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,213
If I go to the settings of my application,

270
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,693
I reveal the configuration variables.

271
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,220
You might see here the different API keys

272
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,270
and API URLs for the
models I have provisioned.

273
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,113
So what I have to do on my
app, I will show you the code.

274
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,240
This is my agent.

275
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,190
I have a system prompt,

276
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,490
in the system prompt
that I just specifying

277
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,540
this is what you do.

278
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,430
You are a solar energy agent.

279
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,420
This is the type of tools and
libraries you have access to.

280
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,780
As I mentioned, I'm giving
access to the library to upload

281
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,780
to S3 to do matplotlib and
the charting on Python.

282
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,133
I'm specifying everything here
being very, very specific.

283
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,360
And after defining the
prompt and the tools,

284
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,270
you can see we have Heroku tools.

285
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,820
So these are tools that runs on Heroku,

286
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,623
not tools that I have to write.

287
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,433
I'm giving access to the
database to those tools.

288
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:03,670
And then what I'm doing

289
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,780
is an HTTP request, just call it an API

290
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,700
and I'm using the same OpenAI API shape.

291
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:20,181
So if you are using an SDK
that talks that specific API

292
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,950
like for example LangChain
or the Vercel AI SDK

293
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,120
or Pydantic, LlamaIndex.

294
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,180
Depending on the technology
of your choice to agents

295
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,733
you can use Heroku AI for that.

296
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,120
So now let me switch to the other AI tool

297
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,190
that we are offering our people.

298
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,740
This is more like pro
development for developers,

299
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,140
for builders that can use the services.

300
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,840
This other is more for business user,

301
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,090
people that is not a
hundred percent technical

302
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,220
that they want to also build applications

303
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,377
and deploy to Heroku
which is Heroku Vibes.

304
00:15:55,718 --> 00:16:00,090
So here on Heroku Vibes
I start from a prompt.

305
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,730
I need to define the
prompt of the application

306
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,860
that I want this to build.

307
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,860
So for this example,
I'm going to be building

308
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,190
an agenda builder for AWS re:Invent 2025.

309
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,400
So I'm asking create this
agenda builder application.

310
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,070
So I want to track my sessions,

311
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,650
store the information on local storage,

312
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,650
but I can also store it on a
PostgreSQL database on Heroku.

313
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,660
It will take care of the backend.

314
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,770
And I'm giving a data source,
get the data from this CSV

315
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,070
that lives on the internet

316
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,280
and now I'm going to
create that application.

317
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,600
So there are like a couple of things

318
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,770
that are going to happen here.

319
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,520
First it's going to enter into plan mode.

320
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,470
It's going to create a
plan, a step by step plan

321
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,030
of how the agent is going
to build this application.

322
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,840
You can approve the plan

323
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,300
or suggest changes to that plan

324
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,670
and once you have that plan approved,

325
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,710
it's going to start building.

326
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,670
Since I just have two
minutes in my presentation,

327
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,910
I'm going to show you exactly this prompt

328
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,190
and the whole process and
a couple of iterations

329
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,243
that I did changing this
prompt and the final result.

330
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,490
So here you can see that I
have like a long conversation

331
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,640
with the agent but it decided

332
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,040
with the same exact prompt.

333
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,080
I want my agenda builder,

334
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,343
this is how I want it.

335
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:37,680
This is where you are going
to be storing the data

336
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,830
and this is where you
are getting the data.

337
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,870
It provides a plan, I approve the plan

338
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,423
and then it went and
implement the application.

339
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,480
And since we are using Heroku here,

340
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,927
it is deploying application
directly to Heroku.

341
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,520
So the application that I
have here is the final result

342
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,477
is leaving on Heroku.

343
00:18:00,477 --> 00:18:02,490
You can see the Heroku app domain.

344
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,253
It is live and I can just use it.

345
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,303
I can just add sessions to my agenda,

346
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,010
go check the agenda.

347
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,680
And that's exactly what I asked for.

348
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,465
I then asked for some changes.

349
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:21,510
For example, I want to have
like dark and light theme

350
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,390
or I want to change this color
to be something different

351
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,970
or I want you to have like a backend

352
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,360
and I sort information
