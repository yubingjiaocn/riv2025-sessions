1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,709
Good Morning everyone. Thank you for being here.

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,129
Really appreciate everyone showing up and having, uh, some

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:07,429
great interest in, uh, what we're here to talk about today.

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:10,210
My name is Michael Barris. I'm a product manager with OCI

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,089
MulticCloud,

6
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,648
and I'm gonna be joined in a little bit by Pat Bangalore and Jeremy

7
00:00:13,648 --> 00:00:16,228
Shearer from our, our Oracle Alliance team at AWS

8
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,048
and Avinash Singh from our, uh, one of our customers,

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,030
Equifax.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,798
So we're gonna be talking today about Oracle

11
00:00:23,798 --> 00:00:25,359
database at AWS.

12
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:29,109
It's been a little bit over a year since we announced limited

13
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:31,579
preview at AWS Reinvent 2024

14
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,039
with one featured, one service in one

15
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:36,039
region, and we've been pretty busy since

16
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,259
then working with our launch customers and partners

17
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,658
to get the service built out, robust, tested,

18
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:42,098
and ready for all of our customers.

19
00:00:42,529 --> 00:00:44,950
We launched generally available this summer in July

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,590
with two major service offerings in 2 regions,

21
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:49,240
each with 2 availability zones,

22
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:51,668
and we've continued to be busy ever since then. So we've

23
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:53,130
launched support for terraform,

24
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,810
autonomous recovery service, AWS

25
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,368
key management service integration,

26
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:00,000
channel partner private offers to, to allow you to

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,250
purchase through your partners,

28
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:03,889
and a whole lot more coming, including 20 more regions

29
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:05,969
that we've announced. They're gonna be coming in the next year

30
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,250
or so with some even sooner.

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,040
So what is Oracle Database and AWS?

32
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,219
Well, this partnership

33
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:14,028
between Oracle and AWS

34
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,019
brings Oracle database services

35
00:01:17,588 --> 00:01:19,099
running on Oracle hardware,

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,500
managed by Oracle Cloud infrastructure,

37
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:24,168
sitting in AWS data centers

38
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:26,620
and available to connect to your. Applications

39
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,528
and services

40
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,049
running in AWS.

41
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,629
You purchase it through the AWS marketplace.

42
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:33,769
You connect it to your Amazon VPC,

43
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:36,370
and you get great low latency connectivity between

44
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,058
exitat hardware running in AWS data centers.

45
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,888
Really great revolutionary thing that we're doing

46
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,448
and a really wonderful partnership between our two companies.

47
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:46,040
So why did we do this? Well,

48
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,329
our joint customers came to both of us over the

49
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:48,989
years and they said,

50
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:50,230
we really

51
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:52,569
need a few things from you. We're, we're bringing

52
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:54,689
our workloads to the cloud. We're really excited about

53
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,219
the benefits and the capabilities that we get in AWS,

54
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:59,730
but there's some workloads that we just can't bring yet. There's

55
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,430
some workloads that we can't migrate.

56
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,269
What do we need to, to,

57
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,650
to accomplish that? Well, we need the full

58
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,829
features and capabilities of Oracle Exadata

59
00:02:08,088 --> 00:02:09,929
and Oracle real application clusters.

60
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,907
We need low latency connectivity because we can,

61
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:15,247
we can do that on premises. We can do that in another

62
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:17,328
cloud and connect across interconnects, but

63
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,768
these applications need to be very close to the databases

64
00:02:19,768 --> 00:02:20,399
they talk to,

65
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:22,729
especially for chatty mission critical applications

66
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:24,907
where every microsecond matters. And so

67
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:27,278
running them within AWS data centers allows

68
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:29,308
them to connect really easily and closely

69
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:31,467
to your AWS application services.

70
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:34,207
They told us they wanted a seamless experience, so they didn't

71
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:36,207
went to some IP address to some black box

72
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:37,088
that they can connect to.

73
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,610
They wanted an integrated experience where they're purchasing

74
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,990
through AWS Marketplace.

75
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:44,129
They're provisioning using AWS APIs

76
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,639
and and CLIs and console and tools,

77
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:49,020
and they're integrating directly with things like identity

78
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,990
and access management,

79
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:52,629
um, cloud trail, cloud watch, and that sort of thing.

80
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:55,308
And most importantly, they wanted to be able

81
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,689
to bring their enterprise data

82
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,330
to native AWS services and allow

83
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:01,669
their workloads running on EC2 and ECS

84
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:04,028
and EKS and Sagemaker Sagemaker

85
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:05,210
and all these great services

86
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:06,368
allowed to access

87
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:08,909
their Oracle database workloads and so that's what

88
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,588
we've been working on for the last year.

89
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,270
So I'm gonna use a customer journey as sort of an example

90
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,460
of, of, uh, to talk through some of the capabilities

91
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,909
of the service and how it works. And

92
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:20,008
so let's say a customer like Equifax

93
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,629
is moving to the cloud, they've got workloads that they

94
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:25,088
need to migrate, and they've got these mission critical databases

95
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,788
that they haven't been able to move to the cloud. And now with the Oracle

96
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:29,868
database at AWS they're able to.

97
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:32,569
There's kind of 3 big steps in this journey for them.

98
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:35,389
First, they're gonna work with us through the AWS marketplace

99
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,490
to purchase and subscribe to the service.

100
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,429
Second, once they've got that subscription up and running, they're

101
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,710
gonna actually provision A Oracle

102
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,750
AI database resources into their

103
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,770
AWS account.

104
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:48,308
And then once those services are up and running, they're gonna

105
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:50,409
bring their data and unify it with their

106
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:52,550
services running in AWS. So let's kind of walk

107
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,210
through that

108
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:54,729
and see how this works.

109
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,629
So first of all, they're gonna subscribe to the AWS

110
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,490
marketplace. This works through a private offer.

111
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:02,909
So you're still gonna work with your Oracle account team

112
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,389
to put together an offer based on your commitment

113
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:07,469
and consumption and estimated usage over

114
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:08,528
the next year or so.

115
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,020
They'll help you work and put that private offer together and then you'll

116
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,729
purchase it through the AWS marketplace.

117
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,250
And you can purchase it either directly

118
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,750
or as a channel partner private offer through one of our great

119
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,970
software integrators or ISP partners

120
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,608
that are really key

121
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:23,488
in a lot of customer migrations.

122
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:26,588
You'll pay AWS if you have spending commitments

123
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:28,420
with AWS this will count against that.

124
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:31,629
And you'll get great flexible licensing options.

125
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:34,329
If you want the best elasticity, you can use license

126
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:36,369
included and just pay hourly for the license fees

127
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:38,559
and get all the bells and whistles and capabilities of Oracle

128
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,088
Database.

129
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,649
If you've already made that on-premises licensing

130
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,689
investment, you can use bring your own licensing with great

131
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,119
license portability options

132
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:47,608
and optimal licensing metrics. So,

133
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:50,069
you get the same licensing metrics

134
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:52,119
that you have in OCI or on premises.

135
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,670
That's half the license requirement

136
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,850
of running on VCPU-based licensing and authorized

137
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,389
cloud environments. So there's already some great opportunities

138
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:00,829
for cost savings.

139
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,920
And you'll get access to OCI and Oracle database

140
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,928
services running in these AWS data

141
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:08,028
centers. So, so let's look at what some of those.

142
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,949
Oracle database services are and it's all built on

143
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,028
Oracle Exitata.

144
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:14,608
Exitata is the hardware and software platform

145
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:16,928
that Oracle has built over the last 12 or so years

146
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,379
to be the best place to run Oracle database. You

147
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:21,178
can run Oracle database on your own servers,

148
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,629
you run on virtual machines. There's a lot of ways you can do

149
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,709
it, but the people that built the software said,

150
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:28,798
what can we really do with hardware after the Sun Microsystems

151
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,069
acquisition to really be the best place

152
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:32,528
to run Oracle database? And so

153
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:35,369
we've built. Data intelligence software and hardware

154
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,858
where the the hardware knows what a database is,

155
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:39,988
it knows what a database extent is, it knows what your

156
00:05:39,988 --> 00:05:42,189
data is, and it can work seamlessly

157
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:44,428
together with CPUs and storage and

158
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,869
CPUs on compute nodes

159
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:48,389
to give you some of the best performance, the best availability,

160
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:49,449
the best scalability

161
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:50,970
in the industry. And of course

162
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,428
it's the exact same exitatta hardware

163
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:55,509
that runs anywhere else you wanna run it, so you can run it

164
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:57,798
on premises with cloud at customer

165
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:58,730
or an OCI

166
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:00,889
or in our multi-cloud environments.

167
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,500
On top of that Exitata hardware, we built the Exitata

168
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,528
database service on dedicated infrastructure. So this

169
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:09,790
is one of the key services in this offering.

170
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,769
With Exitata database service,

171
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:14,290
you're gonna subscribe to physical

172
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,189
hardware dedicated to your use,

173
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,048
starting at 2 compute nodes, 3 storage

174
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:21,250
nodes, that's about 400 CPU

175
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,329
cores and 240 terabytes of storage.

176
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:25,649
You need more than that, just add more compute nodes, or

177
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:27,428
storage nodes, 80 terabytes at a time.

178
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:29,250
Build out a cluster how big you need.

179
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,920
So Oracle is gonna own and manage the infrastructure

180
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,108
itself. So this is again Oracle X data hardware

181
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:36,238
sitting in AWS data centers managed

182
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:36,980
by Oracle,

183
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,459
managed by Oracle personnel.

184
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,119
We're gonna manage the hypervisor, set everything up, configure

185
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:42,559
all the networking, all the RDMA,

186
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:44,369
all the hard parts of running rack,

187
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:46,678
and, and getting everything configured and put

188
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:47,399
together for you.

189
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:50,420
Customers are gonna subscribe at the VM cluster level,

190
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:52,629
so you'll, you'll deploy VM clusters that

191
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:54,829
divide up your dedicated infrastructure, however

192
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:56,850
works for you and whatever suits your need. You could have

193
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,309
one big VM on each server that contains

194
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:01,309
all the CPUs and memory. You can divide them up between your

195
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:03,389
prod, dev test workloads. You'd have

196
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:05,738
a bunch of different workloads running in there. And then

197
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:07,829
within each VM cluster, you run your container databases,

198
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,588
within those your plugable databases.

199
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:12,350
Once you're inside the database,

200
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,798
the customer owns everything. It's your data, it's your schema,

201
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,129
your encryption keys, everything inside the database is yours.

202
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,649
Oracle personnel can't access it, AWS can't

203
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,720
access it. Great security model here.

204
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:23,750
Everything is managed by you inside the database.

205
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,559
Our second major service offering here is built on top

206
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:29,939
of exitata. This is the autonomous database service.

207
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:32,480
An autonomous database on dedicated infrastructure, one

208
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
of the really cool things here is that you get the flexibility

209
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,019
to run both

210
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:38,019
exitata VM clusters and autonomous VM clusters

211
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:40,319
on the same dedicated infrastructure. So you get

212
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,399
to decide how to divide it up and what services

213
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,500
you want to run on top of it.

214
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:46,319
Autonomous database gives you a fully managed database

215
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,358
experience where we've taken care of all the,

216
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,759
the, the infrastructure as well as the

217
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,358
performance tuning, the configuration.

218
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,559
Um, in the operation of the database, and, and

219
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:57,100
Avinash is gonna be talking a little bit about how Equifax

220
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,278
has chosen and benefited from autonomous database

221
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,579
and the capabilities that it brings. So you just

222
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,939
tell us what kind of workload you're running, whether it's OLTP

223
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:06,019
or data warehouse and how many CPUs you wanna run

224
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,059
it on. We'll take care of tuning, set

225
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:09,139
the SGA PGA,

226
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,119
configure the database to work for your workload.

227
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,819
As your workload shifts, we'll adjust tuning parameters

228
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:14,720
to accommodate that,

229
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:17,358
and we'll grow the database for you and manage that configuration,

230
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,459
patching everything else under the covers for

231
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,278
you. And

232
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:24,420
then the third major service that we have as part of this offering

233
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,259
from OCI today

234
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,819
is the Zero Data loss Autonomous Recovery Service, which

235
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:30,059
is a bit of a mouthful, but if you've used

236
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,788
the zero data loss recovery appliance on premises,

237
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,158
this is again where we've sat down and figured

238
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:37,308
out what's the best way to back up an Oracle

239
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,979
database to provide you the best protection,

240
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,558
the lowest impact during backups, and

241
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:43,320
the greatest recovery options. And so,

242
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:45,967
Um, this again runs in AWS

243
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:48,577
data centers, allows you to keep your data in AWS

244
00:08:48,888 --> 00:08:50,957
and backup using the greatest capabilities. It's

245
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:53,168
a really, really neat capability here where, where we take one

246
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:55,447
full backup when you start and then everything is incremental

247
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:56,067
from there.

248
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:58,808
When you do a point in time restore, it's, you're

249
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:01,129
not worrying about, you know, layers of, of, of incremental

250
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:03,288
apply on top of each other. You just tell us when you want to

251
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:05,288
restore to, and the service is gonna take care

252
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:06,428
of synthesizing whatever

253
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:09,028
state the blocks all need to be in to get you back

254
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:09,729
up and running.

255
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,048
All right, so those are the capabilities that we have that

256
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:16,048
you, you'll subscribe to through the AWC

257
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:16,710
marketplace.

258
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:17,830
How do you actually

259
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:20,308
make use of it? Well, you're gonna provision it

260
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:22,109
using the AWS management console,

261
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:24,090
APIs, CLIs.

262
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,129
Cloud formation, terraform.

263
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:29,788
You're gonna integrate with the capabilities of identity

264
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:31,009
and access management,

265
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,048
connect it to your VPC,

266
00:09:33,788 --> 00:09:35,889
monitor host metrics and cloudWatch.

267
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,119
Send audit to cloud trail when you perform service

268
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:39,690
operations.

269
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:42,590
Encrypt data using transparent data encryption.

270
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:44,889
It now supporting AWS KMS

271
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,570
and you can even back it up to Amazon S3. So

272
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:50,190
again, this isn't just some IP address or a black box

273
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,500
at the end of a of an interconnect. This is a service

274
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,330
deeply integrated

275
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,590
with our, with our partners at AWS.

276
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,739
Now you'll,

277
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,229
again, provision X data infrastructure and VM

278
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:01,979
clusters into your AWS account. And I,

279
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:04,048
this is a really simplified architecture,

280
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:06,548
but I, I, I think this, this diagram, uh, there's

281
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:08,369
4 things I like to call out about this.

282
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:10,529
First of all, right in the middle

283
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,950
is your Oracle AI database services.

284
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,149
So exit data database service and, and autonomous

285
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,210
database. Living again

286
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:19,070
in an AWS data center in

287
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,349
an availability zone. We'll tell you the zone IDs

288
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,259
where these are located and you can provision those into your AZs.

289
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,840
The second is that this connection back to OCI

290
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,000
region. So this is a managed service operated

291
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
by Oracle Cloud infrastructure and so our control

292
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,219
plane in a nearby region using high availability,

293
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,250
redundant links

294
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:37,590
is gonna connect to the, the services running in

295
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,500
AWS and operate the service for you.

296
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:43,149
The third major thing to call it is the ODB

297
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,369
network here. This is a new AWS construct

298
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:46,690
that allows you to contain

299
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,389
logical settings for networking for your databases.

300
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:50,889
It's a lot like a VPC,

301
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:53,428
but it can only contain Oracle database and AWS

302
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:55,849
resources, and it can't contain an internet gateway.

303
00:10:56,308 --> 00:10:59,029
You'll access services by peering it to a VPC,

304
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,869
and that VPC can of course contain things like transit gateways

305
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:02,408
or cloud WAN

306
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,649
so that you can fan out to broader networks.

307
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:06,558
And then the 4th thing is

308
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,178
the applications. That's the whole point of being here is to run

309
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:10,359
these database workloads

310
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,879
against AWS services and applications.

311
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:15,469
And of course, that's a simplified diagram.

312
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,340
We can get really complicated with this.

313
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:18,359
We support

314
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:20,859
maximum availability architecture, gold certified

315
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:21,798
configurations.

316
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:24,168
This is an example of a cross-region replication,

317
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,259
but you can set up cross AZ replication. We're

318
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:28,639
gonna be two AZ's everywhere we operate.

319
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:31,279
You can be cross AZ and cross-region.

320
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,820
Um, and all this replication is just a matter of clicking

321
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,940
a few buttons in the OCI console to enable data

322
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,019
guard, data guard replication. You can also

323
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:40,058
manage, uh, a fast start failover if

324
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:42,219
you want the highest levels of availability.

325
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,070
Now how do you get your data into this? Well, it's an Oracle

326
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,690
database.

327
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,308
So the, my favorite answer to this is however

328
00:11:51,308 --> 00:11:53,349
you move data today. If you're already, a

329
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:55,428
lot of you know, DBAs already have practices built

330
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:57,529
around data pump or export or

331
00:11:57,668 --> 00:11:59,710
you know, logical migrations, you're already moving data

332
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,529
around in your infrastructure a lot today. So,

333
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,869
the first answer is move data however you're

334
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:05,869
already moving data if that's what, what's already working

335
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:07,869
for you. The second answer is gonna be Oracle zero

336
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:08,849
downtime migration.

337
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:11,408
This is a utility that, that we offer that wraps

338
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:13,710
around a lot of those capabilities like data

339
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,889
pump and export, and RMA and

340
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:17,450
Dataguard, and even Golden Gate,

341
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,129
which you can use Golden Gate for logical replication into

342
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:22,250
OCI database services license-free for 6

343
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,769
months. So a great capability there.

344
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,308
We can connect to just about any source database,

345
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:27,869
just about any source platform,

346
00:12:28,408 --> 00:12:29,830
and migrate those workloads

347
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,389
to Oracle Database and AWS services.

348
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,149
It's essentially just a binary that you download.

349
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,849
Again, it's gonna wrap all those capabilities. You'll

350
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:39,889
tell it what kind of migration you want based

351
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:42,009
on your criteria. So do I need an

352
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:44,479
online or an offline migration? Is, is downtime

353
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,529
really sensitive to me or can I do this

354
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:47,190
over a weekend?

355
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,710
Is this gonna be a physical migration or a logical

356
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,739
migration? Now with exit data database

357
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:54,340
service, you have access to the host, you have sys

358
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,629
DBA access, so you can do RMA and, and

359
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:58,529
data guard-based physical migrations.

360
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,229
With autonomous database, you don't have host

361
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:03,149
access and you don't have sys and sys DBA access.

362
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,869
So you're gonna do a logical migration which can integrate

363
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,950
data pump and Golden Gate to still get, get

364
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,979
you a really low, close to zero downtime

365
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:10,548
migration.

366
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:14,750
And then 3,

367
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:17,428
you've got these database services up and running. You're now,

368
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,779
you have databases in AWS

369
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,869
running on exit data, running on the autonomous

370
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:22,840
database. Your,

371
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,788
your business data has been migrated,

372
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:27,440
and now you've got the best of both worlds. You've got your, your,

373
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:28,649
your world class

374
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,908
exitat database services. You've got

375
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:33,029
your business data, you've got the capabilities

376
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,349
of AWS, and you can bring those all together

377
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:38,149
to get deeper insights, build more scalable, reliable

378
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:38,729
applications,

379
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,149
and reduce your management overhead. You know, the great thing

380
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:42,308
about managed services.

381
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:44,960
Is you, especially in this AI

382
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,599
era,

383
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:48,080
your data is the most important asset you have and

384
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,239
increasing in important value every day. Your

385
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:51,178
DBAs

386
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,719
know where your data is, where it's moving, who's

387
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,500
accessing it, how it needs to be secured.

388
00:13:56,158 --> 00:13:58,599
They really should be working on, on things like managing

389
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:00,599
that data and integrating it with, with your

390
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,639
new AI capabilities and services

391
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,158
and other applications rather than troubleshooting backups

392
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:07,210
or patching operating systems or figuring

393
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,178
out why, you know, a, a failover didn't happen.

394
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,139
Now, you also get access to the

395
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,479
latest version of Oracle AI database

396
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,798
because this is essentially Oracle cloud infrastructure

397
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:20,000
under the covers. These are OCI managed database services.

398
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:22,558
So as we come out with new versions of Oracle Database,

399
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:24,960
it's gonna be available immediately in Oracle

400
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,139
database and AWS.

401
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,719
It's a whole lot of new features that I'd love to talk about, but I

402
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,619
don't have time for that. So there's, there's one

403
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,389
example that I like and, and uh I, I know y'all haven't

404
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:35,788
heard enough about AI this week, so I thought I would use an AI

405
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:38,259
example. So, with 26

406
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:40,440
AI we've added a new vector data type.

407
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:43,019
As we start working with AI a lot, one of the

408
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,099
things that becomes really useful is vectorizing

409
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:47,580
our data. A vector is essentially a mathematical

410
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,519
representation

411
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,158
of complex attributes

412
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:52,080
of data

413
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:54,668
that can be generated by an LLM

414
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:56,700
and then stored natively in the database.

415
00:14:57,158 --> 00:14:59,609
Once we have data represented mathematically,

416
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,090
we can now really easily

417
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:03,428
do operations. The, the database compute engine really

418
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:05,029
loves math, it's very easy to do.

419
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:07,389
And we don't have to worry about more complex things than that.

420
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:09,428
So you can add a vector data type.

421
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,979
You can generate embeddings, store those in the database,

422
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:14,558
and now you can get the benefits of LLMs,

423
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:17,139
um, just using SQL. So, so

424
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:17,928
here's an example.

425
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:20,340
So let's say you've got a database that contains a

426
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,619
bunch of rows of data that describe houses for sale,

427
00:15:22,658 --> 00:15:24,940
and there's all these sorts of attributes. There's a number of bedrooms

428
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,139
and bathrooms and construction type and build

429
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:27,739
time and

430
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:30,340
what school district it's located in, how much your HOA

431
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:30,918
fees are.

432
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,119
If I'm looking for a house with 2 bedrooms in a

433
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:36,729
particular school district that's kind of new construction

434
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:37,418
and maybe I want,

435
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:38,889
you know, a certain kind of roof.

436
00:15:39,658 --> 00:15:41,700
Building that query can be really difficult. I can search for

437
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,690
all those attributes,

438
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:45,369
but I'm probably gonna leave on the table things that are similar

439
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:47,500
to those houses, but maybe don't meet all my

440
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,969
checkboxes. Maybe it's, you know,

441
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,500
right next to a really great school district, but it's, it's,

442
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:53,658
you know, 1.5 bedrooms or a bedroom

443
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:55,820
in a den, or, or maybe it's a, it's an older

444
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,869
house and I want a new construction, but it meets a lot of my

445
00:15:57,869 --> 00:15:58,879
other checkboxes as well.

446
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:01,460
I can take all those attributes from those rows of data. I

447
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,548
can embed an LLM

448
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:05,428
inside the database with 26 AI if I'd like to, or

449
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:07,710
I can use a service like Amazon Bedrock and call

450
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,489
a Titan model

451
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,190
and have it generate vector embeddings, and my

452
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,269
application can just store those in vector columns in

453
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:15,629
my database next to the, the, the, the

454
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:17,808
existing product data all in the same place.

455
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,308
And now doing that query is just a matter of, of a

456
00:16:20,308 --> 00:16:22,509
vector distance order by. So select rows

457
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:23,090
from this table,

458
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,210
order by vector distance.

459
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:27,879
Of an embedding vector for my search

460
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:28,418
terms

461
00:16:28,678 --> 00:16:30,168
and this column of vectorized data.

462
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,570
And now we can use the benefits of LLMs to and

463
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,639
natural language processing to find the

464
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,940
closest matches really, really simply

465
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:39,239
without having to replicate my data elsewhere, without having

466
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,139
to have a separate vector store, without

467
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:43,719
taking on the headache, the security pain,

468
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,000
the, the governance overhead of

469
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,259
maintaining multiple data stores for the same data.

470
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,759
Of course, there's a lot of other capabilities of Oracle Database

471
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,580
26A.

472
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:54,840
26 AI. I'd love to talk about them all,

473
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:57,239
um, but hopefully that gives you a sense of what you

474
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,940
get when you get access to the latest

475
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:00,460
features of Oracle Database

476
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:03,320
running on Oracle hardware managed by OCI

477
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,880
sitting in AWS data centers. We'll have some resources

478
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,779
to link to at the end and of course,

479
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,318
um, our, our documentation and product pages

480
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:12,140
can get you going and a lot more information,

481
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,539
um, and we're, we're always happy to talk more.

482
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,449
So now I'd like to turn it over to um Jeremy

483
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:19,368
Shear and uh our AWS partners.

484
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:21,430
Hello. So

485
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,289
Jeremy Shearer, I'm a partner solution architect

486
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:26,559
here at AWS in the Oracle

487
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,789
Alliance team. I'm joined by Pat.

488
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:31,489
Yeah, I'm Pat Bangalore. I'm the, uh, partner development

489
00:17:31,489 --> 00:17:33,529
manager, uh, looking out for the alliance

490
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:35,650
with, uh, Oracle. Uh, I'm

491
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,759
an AWS alliances manager as well.

492
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,930
Yeah, OK.

493
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:42,670
So to recap something that we just

494
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,189
talked about is this offering

495
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,588
has been rolled out to two regions already,

496
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:49,750
Northern Virginia and Oregon, and

497
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,868
we've announced 20 additional

498
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:53,868
regions around the globe. Some of them are going

499
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:55,180
to be coming very soon,

500
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,549
some of them may be a year or

501
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:58,709
so out with that.

502
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,489
These regions are being deployed with multiple

503
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:04,630
availability zones. So in Northern

504
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,130
Virginia and Oregon, we've both deployed

505
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,150
with two availability zones, and you're going

506
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,809
to see that pattern continue

507
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:13,150
as we're rolling out the service globally.

508
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:16,489
So from a foundation perspective, just

509
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:18,848
to come back, which a lot of the people in this room

510
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,930
already know about, is the definition of an

511
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,039
AWS region is a bit unique to

512
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:23,789
Amazon,

513
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:26,328
where we define a region as

514
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:28,400
having multiple availability

515
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,809
zones, and that is the basis for

516
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,670
how we approach high availability

517
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:33,969
at Amazon.

518
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:35,568
So

519
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:38,568
these availability zones are

520
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:40,719
geographically separated from each other

521
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,930
and meaningful distance, so if an

522
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,049
event happens in one availability

523
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:47,719
zone, it's unlikely to

524
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:49,519
impact the other availability zones,

525
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:51,848
but they're close enough together that

526
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:53,979
latency is often not a,

527
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:55,088
a, a problem,

528
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,809
you know, across them.

529
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,838
So, now how do we apply that

530
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,150
with Oracle database at AWS?

531
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,660
And how do we do high availability using

532
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,078
the Amazon concept of high availability?

533
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,799
The way we approach that is we deploy

534
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,039
NEA data into the first availability

535
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,289
zone. And then we use data guard

536
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:16,318
replication to synchronously

537
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:18,939
replicate the database either with maximum

538
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:21,348
protection mode or maximum availability mode

539
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,368
to replicate that database

540
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,660
to a second availability zone.

541
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,279
So that gives us a no data loss

542
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,250
configuration.

543
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:32,289
Some applications are a bit more

544
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:33,368
latency sensitive.

545
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,130
They they can't even handle that level of replication,

546
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:38,410
that sub 2 millisecond replication.

547
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:40,848
They may change into a maximum performance

548
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,170
mode and replicate asynchronously, but

549
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,239
the preferred pattern is to do synchronous

550
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:47,479
replication between these two availability

551
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,130
zones.

552
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,759
We'll then deploy a 3rd

553
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,769
in the 3rd availability zone, a

554
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:54,848
data guard observer to

555
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:56,489
support fast start failover,

556
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,209
to monitor those exits

557
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:01,868
in the other availability zones, detect problems,

558
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,930
and help arbitrate and manage

559
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,029
an automatic failover between

560
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:07,509
the two exits

561
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:08,689
if it's needed.

562
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:11,299
But this bottom part of the, the chart

563
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:13,750
here is just half the picture. That's the database

564
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,170
part of the picture, the MAA Gold architecture

565
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,750
that we talked about earlier.

566
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:20,209
When you move up the stack, you need to make sure

567
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:23,068
the top side of the stack is equally configured,

568
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,160
highly available.

569
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,670
So in this configuration, we would deploy

570
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,250
the application tier

571
00:20:28,588 --> 00:20:30,719
across multiple. availability zones

572
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:32,818
and we'll typically use an AWS

573
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:34,858
application load balancer to distribute

574
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,868
the load among the application tier,

575
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:39,180
you know, detect if there's an anomaly in

576
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,299
one of the availability zones and redirect

577
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:43,729
the traffic to the remaining availability

578
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:45,318
zones to give you a complete

579
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,578
application and database high availability

580
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:49,140
pattern.

581
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:52,189
One of the reactions to this

582
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:54,250
is, hey, that looks expensive. You're

583
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,660
telling me I need an exit data in the 1st availability

584
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,979
zone, an exit data in the 2nd availability zone,

585
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:01,420
and oh, maybe another exitat for disaster

586
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,160
recovery.

587
00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:04,969
Well, there, there's a lot of capabilities to

588
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:07,059
control cost in this solution. One of the key

589
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,000
capabilities

590
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:10,739
is we can run that 2nd exitata

591
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:12,739
in a pilot light configuration

592
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:15,098
where we only turn on the CPUs

593
00:21:15,098 --> 00:21:17,219
that we need to manage that replication.

594
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,949
These Oracle databases support

595
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:21,989
online scaling, so you can turn up

596
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,469
the CPUs when you need them during a failover

597
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:26,469
event or during a DR event to

598
00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:27,739
help manage that calls.

599
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:30,539
You can also deploy in a rack

600
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,630
single node configuration. You don't have

601
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,828
to do multi-node rack on these exaat.

602
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:37,029
You can deploy on a single

603
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,049
instance, and that is another way to manage

604
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:39,618
the calls.

605
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:42,618
So the takeaway from this is this is a robust

606
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:44,630
architecture and it doesn't

607
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,588
have to break the bank to deploy it.

608
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,630
Once you have this, the

609
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,739
Oracle database of AWS deployed,

610
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:54,229
you can actually take advantage of our over

611
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,509
200 services that integrate

612
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:58,509
with it. Up on the screen here, we, we

613
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:00,809
have several of the services that tightly integrate

614
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:02,969
with ODB at AWS that we use often.

615
00:22:03,828 --> 00:22:05,828
S3 backups is on here. You can do the,

616
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:08,539
you know, the automated backups of ODB at AWS

617
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:10,549
2 S3. That is an option. You,

618
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,719
you see terraform and cloud formation on here.

619
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,880
Those are completely baked into the solution

620
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,459
for automated provisioning and configuration

621
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:17,979
management.

622
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,140
I'm gonna dig more into

623
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:22,588
the AWS Resource access

624
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:24,868
Manager. I'll be talking about

625
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:26,299
our observability,

626
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:29,000
and I'll be talking about KMS

627
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,380
on the upcoming slides. I'll dig more into those.

628
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,959
So. So

629
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:36,199
again, when we talk about, hey, we're going to deploy

630
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:38,279
this architecture in an MAA gold pattern,

631
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,519
we have all of these exitats, that is a

632
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,479
lot of horsepower we're deploying.

633
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:45,039
You know, each one of these exitatas has 240

634
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,160
terabytes of storage, 380

635
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,640
cores, 2 2.7 terabytes

636
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,219
of RAM.

637
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,739
Not all of your business units need that

638
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:53,959
much horsepower to run.

639
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,719
So with AWS Resource

640
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:59,009
Access Manager we can actually share

641
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,509
this Exadata infrastructure

642
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:04,828
across multiple AWS

643
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:06,479
accounts in our organization.

644
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:09,150
So you can have your manufacturing

645
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,739
organization running their own exadata

646
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:14,130
instance on that underlying hardware

647
00:23:14,469 --> 00:23:17,229
and that underlying hardware is then shared with the retail

648
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,348
operation running, you know, customer databases and your

649
00:23:19,348 --> 00:23:21,588
logistics operation managing

650
00:23:21,588 --> 00:23:22,890
the truck deployments.

651
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:26,920
Most customers are going to have some segregation

652
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,959
between production and non-production. Different

653
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:31,348
AWS accounts to do that. That's also

654
00:23:31,348 --> 00:23:33,358
supported here where you can mix and match

655
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:35,559
those, particularly when you're looking into

656
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,640
that multi AZ configuration. A

657
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,660
very common pattern we see

658
00:23:39,838 --> 00:23:42,078
is that people deploy the non-production

659
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:44,479
on that MAZ, the the secondary

660
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:45,059
AZ

661
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:47,640
node or the secondary AZ exitatus.

662
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:53,108
So once you have this scaled out

663
00:23:53,108 --> 00:23:55,108
to your organization, you need to

664
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:57,108
think about securing it. And how do you secure

665
00:23:57,108 --> 00:23:59,108
this at scale with all of these

666
00:23:59,108 --> 00:24:01,229
database clusters across all

667
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:03,259
these different AWS accounts? And the

668
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:05,509
answer to that is AWS KMS,

669
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:07,170
the key Management Service.

670
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,130
So with AWS KMS we can manage.

671
00:24:10,755 --> 00:24:13,114
Oracle TDE keys, transparent

672
00:24:13,114 --> 00:24:15,743
database encryption keys directly

673
00:24:15,743 --> 00:24:16,934
inside of KMS.

674
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:19,674
So no longer do you have to have a separate solution

675
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:21,795
to manage your application encryption keys from your

676
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,875
database keys. You have a

677
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,973
single consolidated solution

678
00:24:26,344 --> 00:24:28,713
to manage all of your encryption in

679
00:24:28,713 --> 00:24:29,614
one place.

680
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,979
So you, you now have it deployed

681
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:35,959
highly available across your organization.

682
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,019
You've, you know, shared it with resource

683
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,338
access managers, so different entities

684
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:43,779
within your organization can leverage it. You've secured

685
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:44,769
it with KMS.

686
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,059
Now you're running and operating it

687
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,420
with AWS CloudWatch. You

688
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,818
can actually see the metrics

689
00:24:51,818 --> 00:24:53,858
inside of the exa data in your. Cloud

690
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,029
watch dashboards, you can see the CPU

691
00:24:56,358 --> 00:24:58,400
and the disk IO and the different

692
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,519
performance characteristics right

693
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:03,118
alongside all of the metrics that are emitted

694
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:05,189
from your application tier and,

695
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:05,818
and

696
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,759
reduce your your mean time to recovery

697
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,920
when you have an event to actually see

698
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,979
what is happening

699
00:25:12,358 --> 00:25:14,519
within your system all within the

700
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,459
same dashboard.

701
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:18,348
So, I was given just a few minutes here to

702
00:25:18,348 --> 00:25:20,469
talk about some of the, the services that

703
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:22,608
really excite me. I'm gonna hand it over

704
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:24,709
now to Pat Bangalore to talk a little bit

705
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:27,219
more about the AWS and Oracle relationship.

706
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:29,630
Pat. Thank you, Jeremy.

707
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,939
So Michael Barris during the

708
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:35,380
initial slides talked about the partnership

709
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,598
and the alliance,

710
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,439
and the reason why

711
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,420
Larry Ellison and Matt Gartman stood on

712
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,900
stage and had this partnership alliance stitched

713
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,559
together

714
00:25:44,858 --> 00:25:47,059
is because of these reasons.

715
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:49,699
And if you look at this alliance, this was born

716
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:50,358
out of

717
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,098
clear customer need. When you look

718
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:55,259
at 90% of the Fortune 100

719
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:57,400
companies are running AWS.

720
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:00,328
And then close to 87%

721
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:02,608
of customers are running.

722
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,130
Exit datas, whether they are on premises

723
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,400
or clouded customer or in some way, shape

724
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,068
or form,

725
00:26:09,449 --> 00:26:11,670
exit datas are ingrained.

726
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,559
Within customers for various

727
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,209
workloads,

728
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,880
whether it is application workloads or analytical

729
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,920
workloads, data warehouse workloads, and so

730
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,809
on and so forth.

731
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,979
So what we are seeing here is

732
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:25,358
customers have got

733
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,939
Applications deployed on AWS

734
00:26:28,939 --> 00:26:31,219
they've got large databases

735
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:33,858
running on exit data on premises,

736
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,400
and they reached out to us saying that

737
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,818
how do we get this together? We want

738
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:40,519
these applications

739
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,868
closer to the databases,

740
00:26:43,338 --> 00:26:44,199
and we want them

741
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:46,858
within the AWS data centers,

742
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:49,000
and that's exactly what we did

743
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:51,380
and that's where this partnership and alliance

744
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,160
took place

745
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,088
where we're able to roll in.

746
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:56,900
Exit data racks inside

747
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,939
AWS data centers to offer low

748
00:26:58,939 --> 00:27:00,519
latency, high throughput

749
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,140
for the chatty applications that you all have.

750
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:09,959
I want to quickly talk about.

751
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,140
Support

752
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:14,809
On the support side

753
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,348
this is a collaborative support so the

754
00:27:17,348 --> 00:27:19,489
partnership does not end

755
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,568
just with

756
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,489
feature functionalities

757
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,969
co-engineering innovations,

758
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,549
and you know some of the other aspects

759
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:30,170
or features that we wanna bring to our customers.

760
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,309
One of the key aspects of this collaborative

761
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:36,029
support is to start looking at what are some of

762
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,309
the technical limits,

763
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:39,588
what are some of the billing limits, and

764
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:41,689
then how we help our customers.

765
00:27:42,588 --> 00:27:44,279
From a technical standpoint,

766
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,130
if you have an issue with ODB and

767
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,578
AWS or anything related to

768
00:27:49,578 --> 00:27:51,660
the connectivity of the applications within

769
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,598
AWS,

770
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,219
the first point of contact would

771
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:57,559
be my Oracle support.

772
00:27:57,818 --> 00:27:59,818
So you open up a service request with

773
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:00,578
Oracle

774
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,640
or

775
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:04,299
have our AWS technical

776
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:05,279
account manager

777
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:07,699
call Oracle's duty manager

778
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,400
to open up a support request.

779
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,549
OK,

780
00:28:12,078 --> 00:28:14,410
and make sure that you have

781
00:28:14,598 --> 00:28:16,640
customers have the OCI tenancy will have

782
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,039
a customer support identifier. You'll have the CSI

783
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,140
and all those jazz, so you should be able to get that.

784
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,439
So on the billing side,

785
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,890
customers start in AWS support right

786
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,568
from a billing because this is being transacted

787
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:33,068
as a SAS private offer

788
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:35,229
through AWS Marketplace,

789
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,250
so the billing occurs on AWS.

790
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:41,439
So make sure that if you have

791
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:43,509
got any issues with AWS

792
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:45,719
billing, the first line of

793
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:47,719
contact would be our customer

794
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:49,920
solutions manager or technical account manager

795
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,078
from AWS side.

796
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,299
Helping you out on the billing constructs.

797
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,729
OK, now if it is something on the

798
00:28:57,729 --> 00:28:59,769
OCI side, if you're not able to

799
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:02,170
look at it, you wanted to get some details

800
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,189
done, then certainly our

801
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:06,509
technical account managers would contact

802
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:09,209
the duty managers from Oracle to open up

803
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:11,250
a service request and then start

804
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,469
triaging the uh uh the problem.

805
00:29:14,318 --> 00:29:16,250
So that is how we uh

806
00:29:16,828 --> 00:29:19,769
try to segregate between a technical

807
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:21,529
limit and the billing limit

808
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:24,239
process. On the

809
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:26,279
issues of onboarding, obviously when you get

810
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,318
into an onboarding of AA data, you're

811
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:30,838
going to go through the private offer. Michael uh

812
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:32,920
explained to you how the private offer scenario goes

813
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,299
through and all that.

814
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:36,719
You won't have a CSI number assigned

815
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:38,880
to it. So at that point in

816
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,118
time you would use the toll-free

817
00:29:41,118 --> 00:29:42,779
1-800 number to contact

818
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:43,900
Oracle

819
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,719
to help with a customer support identifier

820
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:47,299
or

821
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,559
maybe have a duty manager help you through

822
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,539
this process,

823
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,199
bringing in Oracle experts to resolve that

824
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:55,529
issue. OK,

825
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:58,318
so it's not just from a technical

826
00:29:58,318 --> 00:30:00,489
aspect of co-innovation, but

827
00:30:00,489 --> 00:30:02,469
we also have collaborative support.

828
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,390
And on the next side I want to talk about

829
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:06,930
business.

830
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:09,309
So I know Michael and Jeremy really

831
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:11,469
touched upon a lot of things on the technical

832
00:30:11,469 --> 00:30:13,068
features and innovations.

833
00:30:13,469 --> 00:30:15,549
Let's talk business. Let's talk dollars

834
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:17,189
here for a second, OK?

835
00:30:17,588 --> 00:30:19,588
So a lot of folks here might know that you're

836
00:30:19,588 --> 00:30:20,930
key influencers

837
00:30:21,348 --> 00:30:23,088
in the procurement process

838
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,660
in understanding, uh,

839
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,890
you know, PPA drawdown and commitments. So

840
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,368
I wanna bring this to you

841
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,328
that.

842
00:30:31,368 --> 00:30:33,449
From an ODB and AWS standpoint, if

843
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:35,489
you're gonna be migrating assets

844
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:37,989
from on-premises to AWS,

845
00:30:38,449 --> 00:30:40,509
we do have the, the famous

846
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:42,608
migration acceleration program

847
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:43,588
funding mechanism.

848
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,608
Where it is not just the funding mechanism

849
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:48,828
for assess, mobilize, migrate, and modernize,

850
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:51,880
we also have tools and technologies

851
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,959
and resources that we have built in as

852
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,979
part of map program to help you

853
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,459
seamlessly migrate your workloads

854
00:30:58,719 --> 00:30:59,920
from on-prem to cloud.

855
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:01,338
OK.

856
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,059
The second aspect is when

857
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:06,160
you have a private pricing agreement

858
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,299
with AWS.

859
00:31:08,209 --> 00:31:10,338
Which is formerly called as the Enterprise

860
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:11,299
Discount Program,

861
00:31:11,618 --> 00:31:13,618
where we provide you with a list of discounts for

862
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:15,170
using AWS services,

863
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:17,618
plus we also provide you with AWS

864
00:31:17,618 --> 00:31:19,098
credits and so on and so forth.

865
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:20,309
In return,

866
00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:23,140
customers like yourselves would have commitments

867
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,160
with AWS.

868
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:26,848
So those commitments can

869
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:29,318
now be fully eligible at 100%

870
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:31,420
for ODB and AWS consumption.

871
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,449
Now, even though this goes through the marketplace,

872
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,500
there is a 25% cap

873
00:31:36,969 --> 00:31:38,809
for ODB and AWS consumption.

874
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,410
That cap does not exist. That's

875
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,930
been removed for ODB and AWS.

876
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:47,009
Again, ODB and AWS consumption

877
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,789
is at 100%

878
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,130
for all your commitments towards your

879
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:51,789
PPA,

880
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:54,348
right? You can draw down your PPA commitments through

881
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:55,088
these consumption.

882
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,630
The second aspect is what we introduced

883
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,828
in October of last, uh, last month

884
00:32:01,828 --> 00:32:03,578
is, uh, the,

885
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:06,170
the channel partner private offer

886
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,670
CPPO. So this is for SIs

887
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,029
and, uh, systems integrators and

888
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,858
ISPs and distributors

889
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,588
who wanna resell

890
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,368
ODB and AWS

891
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,170
to your end customers.

892
00:32:18,618 --> 00:32:20,009
So you own the billing.

893
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,160
Right, the SI owns the billing and

894
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,680
controls the billing and resells ODB

895
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,338
to your end customers, so you can do your migration,

896
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:30,759
you can do your manage services, run

897
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:31,598
and maintain,

898
00:32:31,858 --> 00:32:34,118
plus the billing aspect. So it'll be a single throat

899
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,118
to choke. It'll be one single bill that

900
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:37,750
you want to give to your end customer.

901
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:39,078
So,

902
00:32:39,568 --> 00:32:40,400
partners

903
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:42,779
who have a PPA with AWS

904
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,459
through the channel partner private offer can

905
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:46,118
retire

906
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,930
your quotas at 100%,

907
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,479
similar to what we offer for end customers.

908
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:54,509
So direct customers can retire quota

909
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:56,549
at 100% for ODB and AWS

910
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:58,809
consumption. Channel partner

911
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,969
private offer, systems integrators can retire

912
00:33:00,969 --> 00:33:02,309
coda at 100%

913
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,588
plus you've got the map incentive.

914
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,000
Right? So

915
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,559
we're trying to put everything together from a

916
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,680
business construct for you to make it

917
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,519
easier

918
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,199
technologically, yes, it is much more

919
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:17,439
advanced, but also from a business construct

920
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:19,598
we wanted to make it very simple and easier

921
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:22,299
for you to draw down your consumptions

922
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,180
towards your PPA commitments.

923
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,699
So I want to bring this all back together,

924
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,209
right? We stitched this partnership

925
00:33:32,598 --> 00:33:34,719
we had this for our end customer benefit

926
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:36,059
and for our partners,

927
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,838
you know, we have got the full feature functionalities

928
00:33:38,838 --> 00:33:40,219
of Oracle AXA data

929
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:42,759
you've got the Enterprise edition you've got

930
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,920
all the features of uh uh

931
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,358
the database that you get.

932
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,559
Plus you also get the real application clusters.

933
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:51,930
I know that some of our customers, uh,

934
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:54,568
uh, the joint customers use a lot of these

935
00:33:54,568 --> 00:33:55,118
applications

936
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:57,160
that rely on rack

937
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,618
for workload balancing,

938
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,368
application continuity, transparent application failover,

939
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,578
and things of that nature. So it's great to

940
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:04,170
have,

941
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,739
you know, X data with rack built in

942
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:07,358
for you

943
00:34:07,618 --> 00:34:09,619
and the rich features and functionalities that Michael

944
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:10,510
Barris talks about.

945
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,869
The second is the low latency,

946
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:15,329
right? We are pushing the boundaries here

947
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,969
by bringing exit data racks

948
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:19,969
inside AWS data centers

949
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:21,148
in truckloads

950
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,878
and then offering pink pipe and power,

951
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,969
making sure that it is all being interconnected

952
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:29,250
together in the same, uh, data

953
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:29,909
centers,

954
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:32,289
thereby reducing latency and

955
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:34,309
improving your throughput for your chatty

956
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:34,829
applications.

957
00:34:36,688 --> 00:34:38,427
And then the whole seamless experience,

958
00:34:39,048 --> 00:34:41,367
right, you've got one single bill you've

959
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:43,528
got the app tier and the database tier

960
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:45,608
running together. It is a private

961
00:34:45,608 --> 00:34:47,467
offer through the marketplace,

962
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:49,829
you know, and it is a single management

963
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:51,887
console that you can provision both your

964
00:34:51,887 --> 00:34:54,088
app tiers and your databases

965
00:34:54,088 --> 00:34:55,657
which are residing on AA data.

966
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:58,628
And then finally leverage AWS native

967
00:34:58,628 --> 00:34:59,429
services,

968
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:02,070
especially generative AI, Agent

969
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,050
Core, Amazon Bedrock,

970
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:07,148
everything seamlessly getting integrated with analytical

971
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:09,489
solutions with Oracle's exit data.

972
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:13,239
Now with all being said,

973
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm gonna get this to Equifax

974
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,820
Mr. Avinash Singh, who is gonna

975
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,070
explain to you how

976
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,840
the journey for their

977
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:25,260
organization bringing in Oracle's exit data

978
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,360
into AWS and leveraging

979
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:29,769
their BRM application workloads for their

980
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:30,619
migration,

981
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:33,519
specifically autonomous database constructs

982
00:35:33,688 --> 00:35:34,898
into their organization,

983
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:36,139
Avinash, please.

984
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,168
Thanks, Pat. Uh thanks, Mike and Jeremy.

985
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:41,610
Um, so there are a lot of talk about

986
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,909
the benefits and um

987
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,458
what are the use cases that we can use

988
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,489
ADB. So I'm, I'm gonna go ahead and talk

989
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:50,250
a little bit about Equifacts,

990
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:53,090
what we do and who we are.

991
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:55,708
And also, we'll select one of the

992
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,449
major use cases where we selected the ADB

993
00:35:58,449 --> 00:35:59,429
at AWS.

994
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:02,010
So we are using autonomous database uh

995
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,228
service. Uh, let's talk a little

996
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,269
in the slide, uh what we are gonna go to

997
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:08,208
present and let's talk about who we are.

998
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:10,829
So we are almost 15,000 bright minds

999
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:11,590
across the globe,

1000
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:13,570
supporting 24+ countries,

1001
00:36:14,188 --> 00:36:16,610
uh, providing that consumer services,

1002
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,449
uh, from the credit perspective.

1003
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:20,969
We are one of the, uh, biggest

1004
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:22,409
3 credit bureaus in the US

1005
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,119
and, uh, we take care of

1006
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,648
a lot of consumer needs,

1007
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:29,469
uh, uh, on the financial data perspective.

1008
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,550
So if you see in the slide that we

1009
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,668
have supported almost 29 million

1010
00:36:34,668 --> 00:36:35,628
US consumers

1011
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,289
obtain the loans to buy the car

1012
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:39,320
in 2024.

1013
00:36:39,628 --> 00:36:40,949
So this is the 2024 data.

1014
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:43,329
Uh, 9.2 million,

1015
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,889
almost, uh, almost user consumers,

1016
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:48,500
uh, they applied for home loans and,

1017
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,648
uh, mortgages.

1018
00:36:50,148 --> 00:36:52,628
So they all use that our Equifax services.

1019
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:53,889
Uh,

1020
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:57,128
We also add a lot of value in our

1021
00:36:57,128 --> 00:36:57,708
community.

1022
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:00,188
So we, uh, Equifax

1023
00:37:00,188 --> 00:37:03,438
actually invested around 3.3

1024
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:06,550
million for Equifax Foundation and gives

1025
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,610
to the whole

1026
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,679
community of

1027
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,070
US and global.

1028
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:12,728
Uh,

1029
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,389
we have the verification services, uh,

1030
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,579
quite used by the government agencies

1031
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:19,989
to provide, uh, support

1032
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,099
to the needed people, any assistance

1033
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:23,289
needed from the government.

1034
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:24,809
So, um,

1035
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:27,909
We have done almost 25.5

1036
00:37:27,909 --> 00:37:30,090
million verifications for people seeking government

1037
00:37:30,909 --> 00:37:32,929
support. So there are a few uh

1038
00:37:32,938 --> 00:37:34,869
uh things that Equifax does,

1039
00:37:35,148 --> 00:37:37,429
and all those things are possible through that

1040
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:39,199
underlying Equifax technologies,

1041
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,708
definitely supported by AWS and Oracle.

1042
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:44,949
So why Equifax? We have a

1043
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:46,889
proprietary cloud

1044
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:49,989
built using Equifax proprietary

1045
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:50,789
knowledge base.

1046
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:53,590
Uh, we mainly focus on

1047
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,929
three major principles,

1048
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,369
uh, differentiated data,

1049
00:37:57,889 --> 00:37:59,590
advanced analytic, and global insight.

1050
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:03,128
Uh, differentiated data, uh, basically

1051
00:38:03,128 --> 00:38:05,360
make sure that it provides the quicker and,

1052
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:07,849
uh, uh, and confined

1053
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:10,090
data and uh

1054
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:12,128
uh all those information to the consumer who are

1055
00:38:12,128 --> 00:38:13,199
needed. So,

1056
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:15,969
basically, the data needs to be very confined.

1057
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:18,969
That's why that we see that

1058
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:21,309
uh products like Oracle product or AWS

1059
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:22,739
product where that our data sit,

1060
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:25,228
and then we provide the confined data and and

1061
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:26,829
differentiated data to the consumers.

1062
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,269
Uh, we use advanced analytics.

1063
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:32,269
That advanced analytics, uh, concept

1064
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,969
basically to help consumers

1065
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:37,510
to get that data faster, whatever the

1066
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,728
information they need for their consumer data.

1067
00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:42,648
And then finally, that global insight.

1068
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:45,188
So, the data that has that

1069
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:47,429
various attributes, right? The consumer

1070
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:49,449
requires that different, different attributes

1071
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:51,728
from their consumer reports,

1072
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:53,139
credit reports and all that.

1073
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:55,469
So these are the three major principal Equifaxs

1074
00:38:55,469 --> 00:38:56,708
users to, you know,

1075
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:58,809
provide the services to the consumers.

1076
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:03,139
So, uh, here that, uh, use

1077
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:05,179
case that why we need ADB at AWS.

1078
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,239
So, uh,

1079
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:08,728
I support the global platforms, uh,

1080
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:10,128
for financial services.

1081
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,780
Uh, we are using a whole set of Oracle

1082
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,539
products. You can name it like Oracle EBS, WCI,

1083
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,418
OBIE,

1084
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,898
and one of the major, uh, product is

1085
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:19,739
Oracle BRM,

1086
00:39:20,378 --> 00:39:21,059
which is Oracle,

1087
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:23,619
uh, uh, billing and revenue Management System.

1088
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:26,929
This particular system is very, very highly OLTP.

1089
00:39:27,128 --> 00:39:28,789
We use that system for

1090
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,208
usage, rating, billing, and

1091
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,250
generating the invoices.

1092
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,409
So, um,

1093
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:38,378
There are several fulfillment

1094
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,458
systems in Equifax where

1095
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:41,188
we provide

1096
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,860
several services. All those users need to interface

1097
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,938
with our billing system, and we have

1098
00:39:45,938 --> 00:39:47,280
to rate those

1099
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,898
transactions on time.

1100
00:39:49,378 --> 00:39:50,199
We have to bill,

1101
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,840
and then we have to deliver the invoices on time. Otherwise,

1102
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,978
it would be marked as a very big revenue

1103
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:55,719
loss for us.

1104
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,199
So it's a very critical, critical mission system

1105
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:01,019
where that we need a very high performance

1106
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:02,340
supercharged workload

1107
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:03,550
to be, you know,

1108
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,139
performed, the uh all the analysis,

1109
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:08,260
all the rating,

1110
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,300
billing, and invoicing.

1111
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:12,760
So, um, that is one of the reasons

1112
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,789
that we selected Oracle

1113
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:16,168
ADB at AWS.

1114
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:19,168
So if you see here that uh we have

1115
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:20,030
that, uh,

1116
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:22,869
key considerations for the BRM databases,

1117
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:23,869
why that, uh,

1118
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:26,208
we need, uh, ADB at AWS.

1119
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:28,719
We have been a very uh uh good

1120
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,789
user of RDS. RDS is awesome

1121
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:32,469
product. We are using RDS Oracle.

1122
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,938
But it has certain limitations. So, good

1123
00:40:34,938 --> 00:40:35,938
that it was announced

1124
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,840
yesterday that it is having 256 terabytes,

1125
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,079
now going to be available, but we have been running

1126
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:43,320
uh with this challenge of 64 terabyte.

1127
00:40:43,978 --> 00:40:46,378
So, as I mentioned that we operate on around 24

1128
00:40:46,378 --> 00:40:48,500
countries. So all the 24 countries'

1129
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,659
legacy billing system is migrated to our global

1130
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:51,389
billing system.

1131
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,978
So you can think of the enormous data of the billing

1132
00:40:53,978 --> 00:40:55,219
comes to our billing system.

1133
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:57,418
So we always struggle for the storage.

1134
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,398
So, uh, we had, uh, we,

1135
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:02,648
we have hit off the 64 terabyte limitation

1136
00:41:02,648 --> 00:41:03,369
of RDS.

1137
00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:06,039
So that, uh, we were thinking, what is the

1138
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:08,250
better kind of a service that we can replace with RDS

1139
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,228
because RDS is an awesome service.

1140
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:12,659
And that's what the confusion, if you see the guy

1141
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:14,769
on the left, it's not like that I'm having

1142
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:16,929
a trouble. I'm just thinking, OK, I, how

1143
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:19,168
should I just move from RDS to ADB

1144
00:41:19,168 --> 00:41:21,199
at AWS because RDS is also an awesome

1145
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:23,280
service. But there are

1146
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,280
very key benefits like Michael, Jeremy,

1147
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:27,219
and Pat all talked about that,

1148
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:29,719
what the benefit it is going to give us

1149
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:30,840
when we move to ADB.

1150
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:34,280
So it's the best of both worlds. It's sitting in AWS.

1151
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:35,639
It's one of the best

1152
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,059
Oracle database products sitting

1153
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:38,898
on exactata.

1154
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,539
It's autonomous,

1155
00:41:40,938 --> 00:41:43,179
similar experience like that we are getting with RDS

1156
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,179
because that our DBASs need not to uh

1157
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:48,699
break their heads to maintain the infrastructure,

1158
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,139
then database patching and all that, all

1159
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:52,659
will be covered with ADB.

1160
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,449
Which is the same, same, same experience we have

1161
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:57,688
with RDS. So it's like a, a

1162
00:41:57,688 --> 00:41:59,769
more performance system because of the extra data

1163
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:01,820
power. Uh, sitting with

1164
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,938
AWS, so it's like, as Michael and

1165
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,938
uh Jeremy talked about the seamless integration

1166
00:42:05,938 --> 00:42:07,539
with around 200 services, right?

1167
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,239
So, um,

1168
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:11,969
that we are gonna go to leverage. So, uh,

1169
00:42:11,978 --> 00:42:14,199
certain benefits I uh put here that

1170
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:16,500
with, uh, moving this billing system

1171
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,519
to our,

1172
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,389
uh,

1173
00:42:18,648 --> 00:42:20,148
ADB, what would be the benefits?

1174
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,659
So first is like, uh, definitely performance

1175
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:24,179
and throughput. Exa data power,

1176
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,398
everybody knows that,

1177
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,110
how that performance it is.

1178
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:29,699
You can horizontally scale how many

1179
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:30,820
compute nodes you want,

1180
00:42:31,228 --> 00:42:33,648
a lot of cores and a lot of storage availabilities

1181
00:42:33,648 --> 00:42:35,500
is there. So our storage problem will be resolved.

1182
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:38,829
Uh, currently that we have to purge the

1183
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:40,889
databases every quarter because

1184
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:42,228
of the storage limitation.

1185
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,590
Uh, we have almost 8 terabytes per

1186
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,668
month growth of the database. So you

1187
00:42:46,668 --> 00:42:48,829
think that how we sustain with 64 terabytes,

1188
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:51,510
now that we have a petabytes of storage available

1189
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,789
with the ADB. So, that is one of the major

1190
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:56,208
consideration of moving to uh AXA, uh,

1191
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:58,320
ADB. Uh, then

1192
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,719
that, uh, 26 AI was announced

1193
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:02,070
in Oracle AI World,

1194
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,438
and then 23AI was existed. So

1195
00:43:04,438 --> 00:43:05,860
we were thinking about moving this,

1196
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:08,219
our database to ADB

1197
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:10,579
23AI or 26 AI, harnessing

1198
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:12,719
of AI power that we can utilize.

1199
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,010
So my data, as soon as I migrate my data

1200
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:15,719
to ADB,

1201
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,239
my data will be AI ready.

1202
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:20,530
ADB comes with Apex 24,

1203
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,619
which you can create a lot of

1204
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,728
uh Apex forms and all that to

1205
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:26,099
harness your AI capability,

1206
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:28,648
which data by default setting in AI database.

1207
00:43:29,168 --> 00:43:31,289
So, this, this is like uh making

1208
00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:32,320
your data ready AI.

1209
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:34,898
Right? By just doing this migration.

1210
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:37,239
So those are the uh multiple benefits

1211
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,389
that uh we seek

1212
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,800
from ADB and that's why we started the journey.

1213
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:42,519
We completed all our non-proud.

1214
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,539
We are going live by April,

1215
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:47,579
May some time frame uh with all our databases

1216
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,188
to ADB. So,

1217
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:51,668
so far, it's a very seamless journey, very good journey,

1218
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:53,719
and uh both AWS and Oracle

1219
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:55,239
are supporting us to

1220
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,619
uh make this happen.

1221
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:58,820
So thanks to Oracle and AWS.

1222
00:43:59,438 --> 00:44:01,280
Having said that, uh, Michael,

1223
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,110
You wanna add something?

1224
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,110
Alrighty, well thank you very much Avina. We really

1225
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,188
appreciate that story and thank you all again for being

1226
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:10,269
here. Hopefully we given you a good understanding

1227
00:44:10,269 --> 00:44:12,360
of what Oracle Database at

1228
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,510
AWS is, why we've built it

1229
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,309
and how it can benefit me, so.

1230
00:44:16,628 --> 00:44:18,708
I'd really like to say a really big thank you to our partners at

1231
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:20,090
AWS who made this possible

1232
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,550
and our customers for who we built this. I, I

1233
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,699
don't know if there's a better example of customer obsession

1234
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:26,489
than Oracle and AWS coming together

1235
00:44:26,909 --> 00:44:28,458
to build these workloads for our customers.

1236
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,989
And again, this was really built because our customers

1237
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:31,929
asked for it. So

1238
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:34,750
keep that in mind when you go meet with your Oracle and AWS

1239
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,789
account teams. Let them know what you'd like

1240
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:38,829
from this service, from other services. We really wanna

1241
00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:40,829
hear from you. We wanna hear what we should be doing next,

1242
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:41,889
where we should be going next,

1243
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:44,349
and how we can better help you. We do have some resources

1244
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,405
you can check. Out here

1245
00:44:45,744 --> 00:44:47,744
we do still have one more day of the expo, our booth

1246
00:44:47,744 --> 00:44:49,684
1767 back right corner

1247
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,184
of the expo hall. We've got a lot of experts there that are happy

1248
00:44:52,184 --> 00:44:53,965
to answer any questions you have about the service,

1249
00:44:54,465 --> 00:44:56,844
um, and there's also the AWS database booth in the pavilion,

1250
00:44:57,184 --> 00:44:59,465
and of course I have to please ask you to, to fill out your session

1251
00:44:59,465 --> 00:45:00,804
surveys and let us know how we did.

1252
00:45:01,103 --> 00:45:03,425
They don't actually let us expense our lunch unless you've, we've

1253
00:45:03,425 --> 00:45:05,043
got a certain number of surveys in. So,

1254
00:45:05,543 --> 00:45:07,543
so, uh, please, we really appreciate the feedback and,

1255
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:09,925
and, and it helps us understand what to talk about next. So

1256
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:12,175
thank you all for being here. We do have a few minutes to answer

1257
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:12,965
some questions.
