00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,980
- [Pranjit] Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,920
Welcome to NTA404 and
welcome to re:Invent.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,620
I hope you all are having some fun

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,070
with all the nice sessions just for you.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,170
My name is Pranjit, I'm
a solution architect,

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,540
and I have with me my co-speaker.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,870
- [Marcus] Marcus Mattson,
also a solutions architect.

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,960
And I hope everyone's
having a good day one.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,917
Everyone doing all right,
enjoying its sessions?

10
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:25,750
(audience applauding)

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,360
All right, good deal.
- Nice and thank you, again,

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,280
for spending the next one hour with us.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,730
So today's topic is AI Code to
Production: Context Matters.

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,880
How many of you, like if I have
a quick raise of your hands,

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,440
how many of you are using some kind

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,903
of AI coding assistant to code?

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,050
Quite a few. Okay, nice.

18
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,740
How many of you have started
playing or dabbling around

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,533
with our agentic IDE tool, Kiro?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,890
Okay, not bad. Okay, all right.

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,260
So in today's session,

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,720
what we're gonna cover
is, this is a code talk,

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,930
so we're gonna do a lot of
coding while you are here.

24
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,780
But before that, just
to set the stage today,

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,740
we're gonna talk about some

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,170
of the AI code production problem.

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,360
Like when you build, like
when you do vibe coding

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,340
or you are doing some
kind of prompt engineering

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,120
and creating some nice
code, what is the challenge

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,520
that typically happens
when they go in production

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,180
and how we can like do context engineering

32
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,390
to kind of put those code,

33
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,250
make this code like production ready?

34
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,130
And then, the next thing

35
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,200
that we're gonna cover is
we're gonna talk about some

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,860
of the essential context
layers for your success

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,600
when you are building AI code.

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,750
And then, some of the key takeaways

39
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,030
from today's session,
some of the workshops

40
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,870
that we want to highlight

41
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,160
that you can get started with.

42
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,023
So having said that,

43
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,960
let's quickly talk about a
developer named Sarah, okay?

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,430
She's a senior developer.

45
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,470
She started doing vibe coding,

46
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,670
and she faced some challenges.

47
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,590
Let's see what are the
challenges that she faced

48
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,360
and how she overcomes that.

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,470
- [Narrator] Let's talk about a journey

50
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,170
that I think every
developer knows deep down.

51
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,003
It's the move

52
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:11,070
from that frantic,
adrenaline-fueled, last-minute hack

53
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,540
to the calm confidence you get

54
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,970
from building something
you know is rock solid.

55
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,070
It's really a story
about the hidden dangers

56
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,200
of just making it work.

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,250
You know the feeling, right?

58
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,400
It's Friday afternoon, a huge
deadline is staring you down,

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,960
and the only thing anyone cares

60
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,840
about is getting something,
anything up and running

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,950
for that demo.

62
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,960
That pressure, well, that's exactly

63
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,850
where our story kicks off.

64
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,770
All right, so let's set the scene.

65
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,050
This first part is all about a gamble.

66
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,340
It's about a very tempting

67
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,080
but also very dangerous way

68
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,210
of developing software, especially now

69
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,210
that we've all got these
incredibly powerful AI tools right

70
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,710
at our fingertips.

71
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,150
So let's meet Sarah.

72
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,940
She's a talented developer.
She knows her stuff.

73
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,210
But right now, she's
completely up against the wall.

74
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,850
A really critical demo
is just a few hours away,

75
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,150
and she needs a miracle fast.

76
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,260
So what does she do?

77
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,530
She dives into what we're
gonna call vibe coding.

78
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,210
She's just firing off prompts

79
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,510
to her AI tool, grabbing the
code snippets it spits out,

80
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,510
and stitching them together
based on her gut feeling.

81
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,360
There's no big architectural
plan, no deep thinking.

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,470
It's all about speed,

83
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,490
and that feeling of, "Yeah,
yeah, that looks about right."

84
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,950
And you know what? It totally works.

85
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,140
The demo goes off without a hitch.

86
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,870
The feature is a hit, the
stakeholders are thrilled,

87
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,880
and Sarah's the hero of the hour.

88
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,770
She pulled it off.

89
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,540
But that amazing feeling,

90
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,220
that rush of confidence, well,
it's kinda built on sand.

91
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,720
Of course, that Friday high,
yeah, it doesn't last long.

92
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,150
Because the nice, clean, predictable world

93
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,240
of a demo is nothing
like the absolute chaos

94
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,520
of a live production environment.

95
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,490
And this, this is where
that shortcut comes back

96
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,070
to bite her hard.

97
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,800
This is when reality hits.

98
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,890
Monday morning rolls around,
the code gets pushed live,

99
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,950
and almost instantly,
alarms start going off.

100
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,130
The whole thing, the system
that worked so beautifully

101
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,950
in the demo just completely
falls apart under the weight

102
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,960
of real users and real-world data.

103
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,780
It is an absolute catastrophe.

104
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,000
And look at the kinds of
problems we're talking about.

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,590
These are not simple bugs.

106
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,370
These are the deep, gnarly
architectural nightmares.

107
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,830
You've got race conditions
corrupting data,

108
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,440
massive security holes,
compliance failures,

109
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,560
and memory leaks that are
crashing servers left and right.

110
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,720
These are the huge, invisible icebergs

111
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,660
that vibe coding just sails straight into.

112
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,780
And this is the moment
it all clicks for Sarah.

113
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,420
This is her big aha moment.

114
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,550
The AI wasn't the problem at all.

115
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,740
It did exactly what she told it to do.

116
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,620
The problem was she didn't
know what to ask for.

117
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,270
She asked for a feature, sure,

118
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,810
but what she actually needed
was a production-ready system.

119
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,510
And those are two
completely different things.

120
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,260
So this total disaster, it
becomes a massive turning point.

121
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,110
Sarah realizes she just
can't work like this anymore.

122
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,030
It's time to evolve, to level up

123
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,590
from being a reactive vibe coder

124
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,210
into something way more
intentional, way more powerful,

125
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,550
a context architect.

126
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,900
Now, let's be super clear.

127
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,230
This isn't about her throwing
out her AI tools. No way.

128
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,440
It's about getting way
smarter in how she uses them.

129
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,140
It's a shift from just
asking for a chunk of code

130
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,340
to providing the AI with deep,
rich, structural context,

131
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,860
so it can generate code
that's not just working

132
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,230
but is genuinely robust.

133
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,300
So how does she actually make the shift?

134
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,370
Well, she adopts a new framework.

135
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,710
You can think of it like a
blueprint for success, a way

136
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,660
to feed the AI all the right information

137
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,010
from the very start.

138
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,260
Let's walk through these
four layers of architecture

139
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,750
that pretty much changed
everything for her.

140
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,670
Okay, here's how this blueprint works.

141
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,350
It all starts with requirements.

142
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,990
This is where she thinks through
every possible edge case,

143
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,030
every failure mode, all that security

144
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,500
and compliance stuff.

145
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,880
Next up is design.

146
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,980
Here, she's planning
things like concurrency

147
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,050
to avoid those exact race conditions

148
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,430
that burned her before.

149
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,580
Then, comes implementation,
building the code from day one,

150
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,610
so that it's easy to
observe, scale, and maintain.

151
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,950
And finally, the operational layer.

152
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,900
This is where she's thinking
ahead about monitoring

153
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,250
for things like memory leaks

154
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,770
before it becomes a five-alarm fire.

155
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,140
This table really just lays
it all out, doesn't it?

156
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,640
On one side, you have the vibe coder.

157
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,470
They're reactive, they use vague prompts,

158
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,510
and they get code that's
good enough for a demo.

159
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,340
They're asking, "What do I build?"

160
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,380
But the context architect is systematic.

161
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,400
They use structured prompts

162
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,440
to get genuinely production-ready code.

163
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,857
They're asking the deeper questions,

164
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:36,847
"Why are we building this,

165
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:37,867
"and how will this thing behave

166
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:40,230
"under every possible kind of stress?"

167
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,830
So armed with this whole new
mindset, Sarah gets a shot

168
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,060
at redemption, and the stakes,
they could not be higher.

169
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,780
Another urgent super critical
request lands on her desk,

170
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,280
but this time, it's right

171
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,800
before the biggest,
most intense traffic day

172
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,100
of the entire year, Black Friday.

173
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,960
But this time is different.

174
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,020
There's no panic. There's
no last-minute vibe coding.

175
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,000
She just calmly and methodically works

176
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,270
through her four layers, building
out a comprehensive plan.

177
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,890
She then uses that plan

178
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,340
to create these incredibly
detailed, context-rich prompts

179
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,640
for her AI assistant,
guiding it to build a system

180
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,340
that is resilient right from its core.

181
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,990
So Black Friday hits.

182
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,330
The website gets absolutely slammed

183
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,570
with a flood of traffic unlike
anything they've ever seen.

184
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,000
The entire team is just
holding their breath, glued

185
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,680
to the monitoring dashboards.

186
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,320
And the number of critical
errors, the number of outages,

187
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,280
the amount of downtime,
it's a big, beautiful zero.

188
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,960
A perfect performance.

189
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,880
The system she so carefully designed

190
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,360
as a context architect
scales up perfectly.

191
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,990
It handles the insane load
without a single hiccup.

192
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,850
I mean, if that's not the ultimate proof

193
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,760
that this new approach
works, I don't know what is.

194
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,480
And really, that's the core
lesson of this whole journey.

195
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,960
The magic isn't the fact that
AI can write code for us.

196
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,250
The real skill, the thing

197
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,800
that truly marks the leap
from a good developer

198
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,910
to a great one is knowing what
context you need to feed it.

199
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,010
And so that brings us
to the final question,

200
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,990
and this one's for you to think about.

201
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,000
The next time that deadline is looming

202
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,610
and the pressure is on,
which one are you gonna be?

203
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,830
Are you gonna be the vibe
coder, crossing your fingers

204
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,330
and just hoping for the best?

205
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,460
Or are you gonna be the context architect,

206
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,993
building for reality?

207
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,330
- [Pranjit] Okay, so having
seen that, right, these are some

208
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,030
of the challenges, right,

209
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,370
of why AI code fails in production.

210
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,180
AI models, they're trained
on a lot of code, right?

211
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,520
But they don't know your business.

212
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,060
There are certain AWS
environment-specific information

213
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,130
that you have in your AWS account,

214
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,890
but it is not aware of it, right?

215
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,470
It is not aware of any kind of regulations

216
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,290
or security compliance, and any kind

217
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,510
of other compliance requirements

218
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,747
that you are supposed to take care of

219
00:09:02,747 --> 00:09:03,960
when you are developing code.

220
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,540
It is not aware of the cost implications.

221
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,030
Are there any challenges
in respect to how you want

222
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,950
to architect your AWS environment

223
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,260
for any production-ready
application, right?

224
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,880
So having said that, these
are some of the context

225
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,560
that we're gonna see how we can address,

226
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,100
like how we can layer this
context into our solution,

227
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,950
which is called Kiro, the
agentic IDE from prototype

228
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,370
to production, which gives
you a lot of flexibility

229
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,620
how you can inject context in runtime,

230
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,330
how you can use the long-term memory

231
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,030
within the application itself

232
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,430
to build something which
you can deploy on day one

233
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,660
in production, right?

234
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,980
So some of them are like

235
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,320
how you can create the business context

236
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,890
and feed that, still utilizing
the entire context window.

237
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,380
Because context window is
something that you don't want

238
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,450
to fill with all your
documents jumping into

239
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,870
and filling all the space
to leave nothing for the LLM

240
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,080
to be creative enough to
come up with something useful

241
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,400
for your production application.

242
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,233
So you need to know

243
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,330
how you can utilize your
context window efficiently

244
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,430
for your production-ready application.

245
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,680
Last but not the least is the AWS context.

246
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,410
So you need to make sure the application

247
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,520
that you're building,
which you're planning

248
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,850
to deploy on AWS, are also
following the best practices.

249
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,683
We call it well-architected
framework, right?

250
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:21,150
If you have certain cost-related
constraints, you want

251
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:26,010
to also give that information
to the AI coding assistant

252
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,880
how you can do that.

253
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,120
So all those things, we're
gonna look into the Kiro part

254
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,040
of it and then see how we can use Kiro

255
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,900
and some of the features
that we have in Kiro

256
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,580
to come up with the
production-ready application.

257
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,990
So I'm gonna switch to
my other demo laptop,

258
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,480
and we are gonna talk
about a gaming company.

259
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,200
Let's say Sarah is working
in a gaming company,

260
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,110
and she's supposed to build
a game application, right?

261
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,350
And how she starts introducing context,

262
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,603
how she's utilizing those
contexts to be able to come up

263
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:55,980
with a production application

264
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,440
that is ready to deploy on AWS.

265
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,173
So with that, I'm gonna switch to my-

266
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,140
- [Marcus] Yeah and if you're like me,

267
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,870
you've seen AI coding assistants generate

268
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,340
some really impressive stuff.

269
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,350
And then, you've seen it create some stuff

270
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,230
that lacked a little bit.

271
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,360
And so you're probably
thinking, "Show me."

272
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,373
And that's what Pranjit's gonna do.

273
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,400
- [Pranjit] All right, can anyone confirm?

274
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,193
Like are you able to see
or do I need to zoom more?

275
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,960
You good? Okay, all right.

276
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,730
So this is the Kiro IDE.

277
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,260
There are two flavors to Kiro.

278
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,450
One is the CLI part of it, one is the IDE.

279
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,310
So if anyone is like familiar

280
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,260
with like coding using
Kiro CLI, you can do that.

281
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,240
Folks who are actually like maybe working

282
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,480
on Visual Studio, it's a VSCode for Kiro.

283
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,201
So you can get all your visual
codes settings onboarded

284
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:51,510
to Kiro when you are
deploying like installing it

285
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,730
and you're starting to use it.

286
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,790
So for our session, we are
gonna use the Kiro IDE,

287
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,890
not the Kiro CLI, but
you have two flavors.

288
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,180
So just to let you know.

289
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,300
Now, this is a, I've just set the stage.

290
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,763
So what I've done is, initially, I have,

291
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:10,380
let me, okay,

292
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,680
so I've set a folder called a game app,

293
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,080
and I have placed a Kiro logo over here.

294
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,570
There's just a blank application

295
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,030
with nothing inside it
other than a logo page.

296
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,900
And then, what I'm gonna, if
you see the ghosty icon is

297
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,030
where you would see a lot

298
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:30,420
of additional features like agent hooks,

299
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,800
you have agent steering,

300
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,600
and you have MCP servers, right?

301
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,160
So we're gonna cover all of them.

302
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,320
Now, in the agent steering,

303
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,890
you see there's a global
steering rule called

304
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,950
spec global rules, which is a condition

305
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,730
that I put for all my applications

306
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,800
that I'm gonna build
with Kiro agentic IDE.

307
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,080
So what I want is this is
the global steering rule.

308
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,780
So how do you, when you actually
go into the agent steering

309
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,780
and hit this plus button,

310
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,640
you have like three options over here.

311
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,280
The first one is creating from scratch

312
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:07,280
where if you have any code base
already there in this repo,

313
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,210
if not, it's gonna create
some basic markdown files.

314
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,430
There's one which is called
global agent steering,

315
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,380
and there's one
foundational steering rule.

316
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,990
So for the one that I'm showing here,

317
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,560
it is the global agent steering.

318
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,310
That means it is stored in the home folder

319
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,420
of Kiro under steering.

320
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,970
So that way, this global
rules are applicable

321
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,617
for any application that
I build through Kiro,

322
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:30,513
and I'm gonna show how
it is going to take you.

323
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:33,360
So I have given like a
specific information of that

324
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,110
when I'm gonna use spec-driven
development instead of vibe.

325
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,370
Always create the requirements
markdown document,

326
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,330
and then also list
different personas, right?

327
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,270
When actually the requirements
documents are created,

328
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,455
it doesn't give the personas,

329
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:53,010
but I want that the user stories
and the acceptance criteria

330
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,290
that it creates should have
a persona attached to it.

331
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,860
I also want, like when it is
creating a design document,

332
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,660
it also should include a ER

333
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,790
or entity relationship diagram for me

334
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,417
if there's a database
schema involved, right?

335
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:06,210
And then, the other one is like

336
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,740
when it is creating the task,

337
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,730
it should also organize the
task so that like after each

338
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,470
and every granular task, I should be able

339
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,690
to like demo a unit test.

340
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,300
Like what exactly the
application looks like

341
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,410
after this task, right?

342
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,410
So for our project, what I'm gonna do is

343
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,953
I'll go back to this folder structure.

344
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,960
Bear with me.

345
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,560
So I'm gonna create a
specific steering rule.

346
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,950
Steering rules are
something that is specific

347
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,240
to this application.

348
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,380
It is always going to refer

349
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,450
to the steering rules when
it is trying to come up

350
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,840
with the requirements and
the design and the task.

351
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,993
So let me create it from scratch.

352
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,930
Building rules, so these are my standards

353
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,030
that I always want Kiro

354
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,910
to take care of when it is
building an application.

355
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,710
So it comes with this template.

356
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,080
It has inclusion always on the top.

357
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,070
That means it is always going

358
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,260
to include the specific instructions

359
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,380
that I'm gonna put over here
when it is trying to come up

360
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,380
with the requirements in our design.

361
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,590
So I'm gonna paste it over here.

362
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,640
So what I've done is like I've mentioned,

363
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,770
let's say game-building application rules.

364
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,440
When you are a helpful
game-building agent,

365
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,380
you must always adhere to
like the preferred languages.

366
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,800
So let's say you are like
creating any Python application.

367
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,200
So you can put those
specific information specific

368
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,050
to your scenario, but
you can give any number

369
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,750
of information based on what
your like standards are,

370
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,420
what your company standards
are, what kind of coding rules

371
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,350
that you follow.

372
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,450
So you can give all these over here,

373
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,163
and then I'm gonna save it.

374
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,580
And I'm gonna create
one more markdown file,

375
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,310
which is specific to
the styling part of it.

376
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,270
So what kind of colors that I want

377
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,450
and anything related to design.

378
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,043
So I'm gonna come here.

379
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,303
And then, I'm gonna create one more.

380
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,350
Styling guide, all right.

381
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,350
And then, I'm gonna paste it over here.

382
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,380
So if you see over here,

383
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,277
I've given like specific color schemas

384
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,950
and some of the uses guidelines

385
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,730
and some design guidelines
that I like to adhere

386
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,760
when I'm actually building
this gaming application.

387
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,480
Now, I will switch to vibe.

388
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,090
So as I mentioned, right,
Kiro gives you flexibility.

389
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,190
So there are certain scenarios

390
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,660
where vibe coding is relevant.

391
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,090
Like if you want to
build a quick prototype,

392
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,280
vibe coding is still
the go-to path, right?

393
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,730
If you're building something,
which is production ready,

394
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,040
definitely advise to
use spec-based coding,

395
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,110
which follows the typical SDLC process

396
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,840
of like planning first
rather than just prompting

397
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,340
and praying like vibe coding, right?

398
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,260
So that it gives you the right code.

399
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,850
Because like typically in vibe coding,

400
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,100
what happens is that when
you give a big prompt

401
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,020
with all the information, it starts coding

402
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,920
without even thinking.

403
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,080
And then, the code that it comes out,

404
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,700
you probably have to like revise it.

405
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,040
So you go back and ask,
"Okay, can you add this?"

406
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,020
And then, it goes and tries to address

407
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,800
that specific last chat history,

408
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,110
and then it forgets what
it has created initially.

409
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,790
And then, you go into regression

410
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,470
and you keep on troubleshooting to come up

411
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,100
with like a code that you
can really play with, right?

412
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,750
Whereas in spec-based is more

413
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,580
of like doing all the planning,

414
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,680
making sure they are approved like either

415
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,170
by your product manager
or your architect team,

416
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,030
or even if it is you
are a senior developer

417
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,970
and you have the ownership
to approve all the use cases.

418
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,970
And then, you start
then building the code,

419
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,580
so that the code that is
being built is adhering

420
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,070
to all the requirements and a design

421
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,120
that you have approved, right?

422
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,020
So that's kinda the difference

423
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,670
between vibe and spec-based.

424
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,720
All right, now-

425
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,287
- [Marcus] So just a quick one

426
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:08,970
on these documents you just
created, the steering docs,

427
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,530
the rules basically.

428
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,380
The global are gonna be your
organizational standards.

429
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,520
- Yeah.
- And the others are specific

430
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,190
to this project, and one
of those was marked always.

431
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,780
So that means whether you're using vibe

432
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,590
or spec, it's gonna refer back
to those steering doc rules?

433
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,470
- [Pranjit] Yes, so you
can set certain guidelines

434
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,970
at the global steering level,

435
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,410
and then you have certain guidelines

436
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,020
at the like WorkSpace level, right?

437
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,180
But then, typically, the
WorkSpace-level steering, like

438
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,010
if there's a collision between the global

439
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,540
and the WorkSpace, the
global steering rules are

440
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,010
not getting the precedence.

441
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,620
It's basically the
WorkSpace-specific guidelines

442
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,140
that takes precedence in respect

443
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,580
to what it is going to build, right?

444
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,280
So that's how that
takes precedence, right?

445
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,710
So yeah, good question. Thanks, Marcus.

446
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,740
Okay, now, I just have
an idea of this game

447
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,760
that I want to build.

448
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,400
I want to build a Flappy Kiro game, right?

449
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,740
Now, I can use vibe to just go

450
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,047
and ask like, "Build a very basic version

451
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:07,020
"for my prototype for my ideation," right?

452
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,090
So maybe I can start with vibe instead

453
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,740
of like starting with the spec-based.

454
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,940
So I have an idea and I
paste a prompt over here,

455
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,627
and if you see I just mentioned,

456
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:18,487
"I want to build a Flappy Kiro game.

457
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:21,180
"Please, create a very
basic working version."

458
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,100
I've given some information like

459
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,010
what kind of canvas you
should use for rendering.

460
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:31,010
Kiro character, I mentioned
there is an image over there

461
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,780
in the documents, so it can refer to that.

462
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,100
So I've given some basic information.

463
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,810
I just did vibe coding,

464
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,970
and I told, "Okay, go and do for me."

465
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,150
Now, while it is building that,
like while it is coming up

466
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,470
with the code, if you see over here,

467
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,790
there are certain options.

468
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,320
Like one is the autopilot.

469
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,960
So autopilot in the sense
I've given some autonomy

470
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,803
to this agentic IDE, so
that it can take some like,

471
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,460
it can take some actions
without even asking me

472
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,680
or prompting me, okay,
approve for everything.

473
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,040
If I toggle that off, it's
gonna ask me for everything

474
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,170
that it does on the code base, right?

475
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,160
There are options

476
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,490
of like selecting
different models from here.

477
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,160
Like you can select Opus
model. You can select Claude.

478
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,300
Or you can go in auto mode,

479
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,270
so that like the agentic
IDE can decide based

480
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,700
on what kind of context
and what kind of task

481
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,533
that it is doing.

482
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:21,960
It can toggle between
different models, right?

483
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,610
So for me, I've selected
Claude 4.5, so I stick to that.

484
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,950
And then, the other option
is there's an option

485
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,060
of adding images.

486
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,520
So let's say you are
coming out of a meeting.

487
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,070
You did a whiteboarding
of a gaming application,

488
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,320
and you took a picture
of maybe an ERD diagram

489
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,050
that you have drawn out in the meeting.

490
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,050
Or you might have drawn
an architecture diagram

491
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,400
with your stakeholders, right?

492
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,710
You can take a picture and
you can upload it over here,

493
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,280
and then you can ask Kiro to
kind of come up with a plan.

494
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,710
So it has like a
multimodal feature as well

495
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,820
where you can take some images

496
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,380
and put it into the context to come up

497
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,030
with those requirements for you, right?

498
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,380
So it can do that.

499
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,300
Now, if you see over here, it has,

500
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,800
this is what I wanted to show you.

501
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,620
So when it started like vibe coding,

502
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,300
it included the steering documents.

503
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,190
So the one is the global one,

504
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,090
and then a couple of them

505
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,310
that I mentioned I created specific

506
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,750
to this WorkSpace, right?

507
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,583
And then, it says,

508
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,300
"Okay, let's build the
Flappy game together."

509
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,510
So it went ahead, and
it created some stuff.

510
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,693
So if I go back here in this one, it,

511
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,400
let's see, once you answer this, okay,

512
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,560
so it is asking me to answer.

513
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,590
So I'll create a playable
version and all the games.

514
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,430
So it is asking.

515
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,620
So if you see over here,

516
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,280
what I mentioned over here in
the app building rules, right?

517
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,270
I asked that suggest creative ways,

518
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,430
and then take user's input

519
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,610
and create a user context MD steering file

520
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,420
to store user preferences as
you help the user build a game.

521
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,460
So it just didn't go

522
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,280
and started creating code just
like vibe coding does, right?

523
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,820
So now, it is asking me, okay,
can you address this portion

524
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,930
that I have for you before
even I go and code, right?

525
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,000
So that's why like you are
actually acting as a driver

526
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,610
in the seat, not giving the whole autonomy

527
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,750
to the IDE tool to come
and create the code, right?

528
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,260
So maybe let me give some
instructions over here, right?

529
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,780
So what Visual Studio do you prefer?

530
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,780
So let's say classic Flappy Bird game.

531
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,390
And then, it says obstacle.

532
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,893
What should the obstacles
look like? Traditional.

533
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,820
And then, scoring, how
should scoring work?

534
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,820
Plus one point based on
survival time, all right?

535
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,290
So I've given that information,

536
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,623
and then Kiro goes and starts.

537
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,580
Okay, so now it has started
the HTML page for the game.

538
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,173
And if you see over here,

539
00:23:00,173 --> 00:23:02,040
it has started appearing over here.

540
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,490
And then, it has started
creating the JavaScript.

541
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,710
So once it is created, we're gonna look

542
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,360
into the code itself.

543
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,360
So let me go here, and then
let's see what it is building.

544
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,550
- [Marcus] Yeah, it's starting
to already give us hints

545
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,970
that this could start to become
a more complex application.

546
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,430
It's asking about user preferences,

547
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,610
and you're starting to wonder
maybe vibe coding is not going

548
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,480
to be enough.

549
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,840
So let's see what it's
got put together so far.

550
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,523
- [Pranjit] So it has, yeah. (chuckles)

551
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,700
So it is a very basic one, right?

552
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,960
It just doesn't do anything.

553
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,763
It doesn't have any kind of scoring.

554
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,593
It is not storing any
information over here.

555
00:23:57,593 --> 00:24:00,510
So it's a very basic one
just for ideation, right?

556
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:05,510
Now, once I'm done with
the vibe coding, okay,

557
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,370
I have a plan now.

558
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:11,490
And now, what I want to do is
I want to add some features.

559
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,620
Like I want to store the player's score

560
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,910
and also the high score.

561
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,340
I want to add some visual
effects like some kind

562
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,490
of trail particles, some
kind of explosion effects,

563
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,260
and some sparkles like

564
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,700
when it passes through some obstacles.

565
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,620
So there's like a lot of
like additional features

566
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,340
that I want to add that means
that I'm gonna touch a lot

567
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,280
of like code base, as well
as I'm gonna create a lot

568
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,210
of additional files.

569
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,433
And I want this Kiro to kind of come up

570
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,950
with a plan before even
it starts coding, right?

571
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,600
So that's where like what I'm gonna do is

572
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,563
I'm gonna switch over here.

573
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,903
So I'm gonna open a new context,

574
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,960
and then a new window.

575
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,880
And then, I'm gonna move to spec,

576
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,590
and this is where the fun will start.

577
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,410
So what I have told,
okay, help me add like

578
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,390
saved game history and scores, right?

579
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,580
I told about some of the visual effects,

580
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,000
and then I told create
a minimum viable product

581
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,900
for the above features.

582
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,710
And I wanted it to list
only five tasks rather

583
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,060
than going more granular.

584
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,700
Like if I don't give this
specific information,

585
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,800
it probably will come
up with like nine or 10

586
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,290
or maybe 11 steps, and it's very granular.

587
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,330
That's fine for some developers.

588
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,790
For the sake of today's time,
I just wanted to limit it

589
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,623
to five tasks.

590
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:29,310
So once I have given
that, I'm gonna hit enter.

591
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,640
And then, if you see, it now reads, again,

592
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,470
always like when it
starts doing something,

593
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,770
it always is looking into
the steering documents.

594
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,163
And then, now, it is reading
the existing code base.

595
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,210
And now, it started creating
the requirements document.

596
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,283
Now, if I hover over here,

597
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,710
and then if I go to specs,
it has created a folder.

598
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,180
And then, it has started creating

599
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,070
a requirements document for me.

600
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,180
And as I have shown you
the first time, I mentioned

601
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,960
that I want, so it has created
the requirements document,

602
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,700
and now it is waiting for me to like move

603
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,200
to design phase, which is the next step.

604
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,440
But before even I go
there is the user stories

605
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,550
and the acceptance criteria.

606
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,280
But what I mentioned is
that I mentioned give me

607
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,100
the personas as well, right?

608
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,900
So if you see over here, this is something

609
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,460
that it created based on my
specific global steering rules

610
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,220
where I mentioned introduce the personas

611
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,320
and tell me which user story is related

612
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,910
to which persona, right?

613
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,430
So if you see over here,
it has some user stories

614
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,050
and some of the personas attached

615
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,430
and what is the acceptance criteria?

616
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,950
So is the EIRs notation, right?

617
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,030
Now, if I have validated
everything looks good, I move

618
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,183
to design phase or else I can say, okay,

619
00:26:47,977 --> 00:26:52,343
"Have you taken care
of deploying this code

620
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:04,123
"to AWS using serverless services?"

621
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,480
So if I, I can still chat, right?

622
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,707
Just like vibe coding, but I can ask,

623
00:27:11,707 --> 00:27:13,800
"Okay, have you done that?"

624
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,880
Let's see, now, I haven't moved
into the design phase yet,

625
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,220
but then it says okay, no, the spec.

626
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,200
Okay, so it has come up
with another spec, focuses

627
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,630
on the game enhancement
features you requested,

628
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,540
and it says the current
game runs on HTML5.

629
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,460
If you would like to add AWS deployment

630
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,740
or backend, okay, save.

631
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,570
So it has given me, okay,
would you like to continue

632
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,390
with the spec as is for
visual or add AWS deployment?

633
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:41,390
So let's say I select two as an option.

634
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,450
And then, it goes back

635
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,700
and then updates the same
requirements documents.

636
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,610
So until and unless the
requirements is finalized

637
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,890
and I approve it, it's not gonna move

638
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,420
to the design phase, right?

639
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,850
And so, yeah, so if you see over here,

640
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,840
it has started updating the requirements.

641
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,907
And I can look like I can select here,

642
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:04,290
and you can see the diff.

643
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,860
So what is the additional
information that it is adding

644
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,390
on top of the existing one, right?

645
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,780
So it gets highlighted over here.

646
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,030
- [Marcus] Now, while it
creates those spec docs,

647
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,400
it refers back to the steering docs,

648
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,220
so that it makes sure
that it follows the rules

649
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,090
that you've given it.

650
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,440
And these requirements,

651
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,630
I mean, it's requirements
gathering, right?

652
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,760
That's one of the things that often misses

653
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,470
or gets missed in vibe coding.

654
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,810
And as we get further along, you'll start

655
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:34,260
to see how these specifications
are actually used

656
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,000
in validating the code

657
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,550
that the AI is creating or generating.

658
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,730
- [Pranjit] Yeah, so now, if
everything looks good, okay,

659
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,143
let's move to the design phase.

660
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:46,230
It's where I hit the design phase, right?

661
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,460
And then, I'll say, okay, comments good,

662
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,290
and then it went to the design phase.

663
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,663
All right, so let's go back here.

664
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,320
And then, I move to design.

665
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,090
So it's gonna start building the design,

666
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,190
which is basically the
technical architecture

667
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:06,150
and the Mermaid diagram
for me to validate, right?

668
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,250
Now, while it is doing that, I wanted

669
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,970
to showcase over here, like
when I select the ghosty button,

670
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,760
I have additional like
tools that I've added like

671
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,050
for example some of the existing
AWS-specific MCP servers,

672
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,790
like one for the documentation,

673
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,370
so that I always like
whatever I'm building, I want

674
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,630
to follow the best practices.

675
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,580
So I always want like Kiro to go

676
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,070
and look into the best
practices for that app,

677
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,380
like based on whether it's a server list

678
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,760
or a container-based, right?

679
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,920
So I want to follow that, so it can go

680
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,830
and look into these tools
using the MCP servers.

681
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,560
I want also like, and
I'm gonna do that, okay?

682
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,480
Like create an architecture diagram out

683
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,040
of the entire application that I've built.

684
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,900
So I can use the diagram MCP servers.

685
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,350
So there are additional like
third-party MCP servers,

686
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,550
like for example Fetch.

687
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,430
Like, let's say I'm building
a trading system application,

688
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,263
and there is

689
00:29:54,263 --> 00:29:57,000
some existing trading system
applications out there.

690
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,970
I want to like ask Kiro to go

691
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,700
and check the URL of the trading system

692
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,320
and compare with the one that I'm building

693
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,370
or maybe any application,

694
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,410
and see if there's any additional features

695
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,590
that I want to use in
my application, right?

696
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,970
So it can go and like look
up existing like external URL

697
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,520
to come up with some
comparison and feature set

698
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,930
that I'm missing in my application.

699
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,520
So it can do a lot of like based

700
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,370
on what kind of MCP server
that you want to integrate.

701
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,070
The other thing, which is
important, is the agent hooks.

702
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,420
And this is very interesting,

703
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,280
and I'm gonna show you like

704
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,770
while it is building still
the design document, let me go

705
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:39,180
over here and this is something is built

706
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,910
on the event-driven architecture of AWS.

707
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,097
Whereas, let's say, I want this hook like,

708
00:30:45,097 --> 00:30:50,097
"Whenever any code base
file is updated and saved,

709
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:59,200
"please do the unit testing

710
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:05,157
"to ensure it doesn't break
any existing feature."

711
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,100
So if that is a very basic like hook

712
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,810
that I want to use for an event-driven.

713
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,130
Like whenever a new file

714
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,610
or an existing file is
updated, I wanted the backend

715
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,790
for the agent to go and make
sure like nothing breaks

716
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,800
because of some additional
code that I've introduced

717
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,960
or updated an existing one.

718
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,450
So I can like create a hook.

719
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,380
And what it does is

720
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,040
that you can see like
it has execution queued.

721
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,620
That means the design
is still being created

722
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,080
when the execution is queued.

723
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,930
So I can open the task list,

724
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,070
so I can see like
multiple tasks right now.

725
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,320
So right now, if you see
it is in the design phase,

726
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,130
so it's doing the design document creation

727
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,170
whereas this task
creating the hook is still

728
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,003
in the queue, right?

729
00:31:50,003 --> 00:31:52,260
So once the previous one is completed,

730
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,570
the next task is going to execute.

731
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,880
So you can see the queue
as well, all right?

732
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Now, I'm gonna switch back
into my design, and let's see.

733
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,830
So there's an icon here where you want

734
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,010
to like look in a better one, okay?

735
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,610
So you can like even expand this,

736
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,640
and you can look into the
design in a better view.

737
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,510
Like, let me scroll this part of it,

738
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,940
so that it is much more
visible to all of you

739
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,130
so you can even look.

740
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,630
Okay, this is the high-level architecture

741
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,620
with the client side, server side,

742
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,933
and then the component
interaction flow and everything.

743
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,960
So you can look into the data model.

744
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,800
And then, it's still executing,

745
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,410
so let me wait over here.

746
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,560
Okay, so now, it has, yeah,
so it has now completed,

747
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,170
and it says are we good
with the design, right?

748
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,600
Now, I'm gonna close this one,

749
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,950
and then I'm gonna say,
okay, looks good to me.

750
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,893
Now, if you see over here, it's,

751
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:03,150
okay, so now it says, let
me see what it is doing.

752
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,340
Okay, so it has, perfect,

753
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,530
now, I will create the
implementation plan with task.

754
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,060
So that's the next step.

755
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,420
So until and unless that's
completed, it's still waiting

756
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,950
for the general spec.

757
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,550
That means the entire three
steps that it has to complete

758
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,140
before it creates the hook for me.

759
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,840
So now, if I hover over to the task list,

760
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,710
which is very interesting

761
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,020
where it gives you the granular task,

762
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,120
but if you see over here,
it's gonna create only five

763
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,113
of them for me.

764
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,060
Because I mentioned, okay,

765
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,640
don't create more than five tasks, right?

766
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,970
And if you see there are some
that are not highlighted,

767
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,980
which are like optional tasks.

768
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,000
So here, once a task list is created,

769
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,650
you can see there are a couple of options.

770
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:47,960
One is the keep optional
tasks that is faster MVP

771
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,950
or make all tasks record.

772
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,770
If I select this one, all
the non-highlighted ones

773
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,880
also becomes mandatory.

774
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,600
So all the task has to be like executed

775
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,250
before even I start the application.

776
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,180
But for the time being, I'm
not gonna do all the tasks.

777
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,560
I'm gonna just keep optional tasks.

778
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,850
So I hit that.

779
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,420
And now, it just tells, okay, perfect.

780
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:13,140
So now, it is going to
do only the five steps

781
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,190
that I mentioned, right?

782
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,580
And the optional testers
are marked as star,

783
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,953
so we can like skip them for a faster MVP.

784
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,997
Now, I can hover over here,

785
00:34:23,997 --> 00:34:25,830
and I can look into the first task.

786
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,353
I can select that thunder
button next to the start task.

787
00:34:28,353 --> 00:34:30,930
It's gonna start this task first,

788
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,480
and then it is going to wait for me to,

789
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,700
then once it is completed,
go to the next task.

790
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:40,700
Or else, I can do over here
execute all tasks in sequence.

791
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:53,130
Now, if I do that, you would see, okay,

792
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,800
now it started the first task, right?

793
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,323
And you can like look into view changes,

794
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,100
what it is doing, which,
okay, still not yet.

795
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,100
So you can, once it has
started editing some existing,

796
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,920
okay, so let's see, just executed.

797
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,900
Okay, now, it has executed the hook,

798
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,250
which is the one that I mentioned.

799
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,960
Okay, the hook is running right now.

800
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,940
That means some of the,
if you see over here,

801
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,460
which was interesting, it actually went in

802
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,460
and updated the game dot JavaScript file.

803
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,000
So hence, the auto unit testing
for the hook that I created

804
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,990
that whenever it updates the
existing file is gonna execute

805
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,410
the specific hook to ensure
that nothing breaks, right?

806
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,580
So it's still executing.

807
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,690
I can look into here.

808
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,303
It's waiting for that to execute,

809
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,720
and then it's still doing.

810
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,310
- [Marcus] Yeah, and this
is a good point to point out

811
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:50,520
when you create agent hooks,
this is something we created

812
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,620
that was very basic so that
you could see it in action.

813
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,690
But in a real development mode,

814
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,220
you're gonna choose
something that's meaningful

815
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,840
and impactful that's
going to be appropriate

816
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,970
for the amount of times it gets invoked.

817
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,690
And the second thing

818
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,100
that I was gonna point
out is you'll notice

819
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,870
there's broken up into tasks.

820
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,460
One of the reasons you may not want

821
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,810
to execute all tasks consistently
on a larger effort is

822
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,970
because we talked about a context window.

823
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,620
And these tasks, if you're
going along, you'll find

824
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,467
that Kiro also keeps track
of that context window.

825
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:27,090
And if you're doing a large

826
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:31,020
or a long development effort, it will stop

827
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,410
that session, start a new
context window, summarize it,

828
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:37,380
compact what's in your context memory,

829
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,120
and move it into a new session.

830
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,440
So one of the things you can
do with these tasks is usually

831
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,620
or use them to break up
your work, whether it's

832
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,590
because you've got a large
project that has multiple chunks

833
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:53,190
or because you want to
break up your context window

834
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,980
and have a clean window
for another large task,

835
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,500
so that your context window is clean

836
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,030
and works more efficiently

837
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,560
for you, giving you better answers

838
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,163
and getting faster processes.

839
00:37:04,163 --> 00:37:05,793
- [Audience] Yeah, when it
does that auto compaction,

840
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:09,330
what does it do about agents
here, reinject them after?

841
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,163
- [Marcus] It does.

842
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:11,250
It brings over that summary,

843
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,230
and it brings those steering docs

844
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,060
and the spec docs back
into the new session.

845
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,020
- [Pranjit] Yeah, that's right.

846
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,120
And then, talking about
context window, right?

847
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,690
So I just invoked the Kiro
CLI within the IDE itself,

848
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,690
so you just like run the Kiro
hyphen CLI in the terminal.

849
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,990
And then, as Marcus
mentioned, like you can check

850
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,960
at runtime how much of context
window you are using, right?

851
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,790
So you can just type like slash context,

852
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,720
and you can see, okay,
I'm using like 12.8%

853
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,950
of the entire 100% context window.

854
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,130
And then, what are the
different like areas

855
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,350
that this context window
is filling up, right?

856
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,850
So you can see that on runtime.

857
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,560
And then, like the other thing

858
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,630
that is very important is like, let's say,

859
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,550
the first task is completed, right?

860
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,660
And it's still running the hook

861
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,550
for me doing the unit testing.

862
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,180
The first task, it addresses
these requirements.

863
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,740
So if you go to a requirements document

864
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,810
and see the 1.1, 1.2, right?

865
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,900
All these specific requirements,
it is basically tackling

866
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,760
through one single task, right?

867
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,950
So it also gives you that granularity

868
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,010
of like which requirements we
are actually completing, based

869
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:11,843
on which task.

870
00:38:11,843 --> 00:38:13,110
And then, like the other thing

871
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,330
that is important is
like the checkpointing.

872
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,890
That means like, let's say, right now,

873
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,410
it is doing an execute hook unit testing.

874
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,660
And then, it has updated some of the like,

875
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,850
at the previous step, it
has updated some files.

876
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,037
I want to like, I probably have
done something wrong, okay?

877
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:29,820
Or I want to like revert back,
I have option of restore.

878
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,143
So if I select restore,

879
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,923
like I can just remove those.

880
00:38:36,136 --> 00:38:36,969
I just,

881
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,873
I can just,

882
00:38:41,095 --> 00:38:41,928
okay, it just, okay,

883
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:45,150
it's just like, okay,

884
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,920
so I think it did something wrong.

885
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,770
But what I wanted to say is
the restore option is like

886
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,500
you want to like re-update
the code base, okay,

887
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,340
to the previous state.

888
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,460
You can do that by executing
that restore button, right?

889
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,000
Okay, and let me stop this.

890
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,560
I think, let's see hook
enable for the time being.

891
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,120
But then, let me open the other thing.

892
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:14,120
Okay, so you mentioned
about the context window.

893
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,200
Let me bring that up.

894
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:21,120
So this is, let me show you here.

895
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,320
Okay, here is the thing.

896
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,510
I'm gonna bring this one.

897
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:32,313
So to your question,
and let me enlarge it,

898
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,313
here's the thing.

899
00:39:34,313 --> 00:39:38,040
So I was building a, let's
say, a trading system, right?

900
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,840
And I deployed it on AWS.

901
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,153
Now, if you see over here,

902
00:39:44,155 --> 00:39:45,930
let me go here.

903
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,690
This session was too long, right? For you.

904
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,940
So it did the compaction, right?

905
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,520
It basically went through
all the conversation history,

906
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,670
and then it created a
new session for me, okay?

907
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,020
With all the history for it.

908
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,110
So it has created a new session over here,

909
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,943
and then it did the same thing like,

910
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,460
if I go on the top like it,

911
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,320
again, including the steering documents.

912
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,153
So it came up.

913
00:40:08,153 --> 00:40:09,600
Okay, I understood the previous context

914
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,433
from your conversation.

915
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:13,140
We did the compaction
of the context window,

916
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,640
and then, yeah, so it starts from there.

917
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,990
- [Marcus] And while you're
talking about this one

918
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:19,200
in particular, it's another
interesting call it with Kiro,

919
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,570
those tabs each have their own context.

920
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,730
So let's say you're working on something

921
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,710
that's more in depth in one tab

922
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,360
and you want to open up another tab

923
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,940
but keep that context
as clean as possible.

924
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,560
You can open up another tab,

925
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,630
just use Haiku in it, for example.

926
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,000
Have a conversation about
it, do some more planning,

927
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
maybe create some more
steering docs, some more specs,

928
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,090
more requirements, and then
work them back into the other

929
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,483
but keeping the other
context as clean as you can.

930
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,070
- [Pranjit] Yeah, so while
that is like executing, okay,

931
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,020
this is something that I already like,

932
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,200
for example, built it, right?

933
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,320
The same gaming application, right?

934
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,000
And what I did is that, okay,

935
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,800
the other thing is very important is like

936
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,870
if you are using any
kind of Git repo, right?

937
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,180
You want to commit, so the best practice

938
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,580
that we typically advise is like

939
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,990
whenever you have something,

940
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,680
which is a demo-able solution, right?

941
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,270
Do more Git commits, right?

942
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,010
Okay, connect with your Git repo, okay?

943
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,990
Do a commit, do an alternative, okay?

944
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,210
Anything, okay, this is
right time to commit it,

945
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,590
just commit it, and then come back

946
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,170
and like build on top of that, right?

947
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,610
So that you don't lose the code base

948
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,110
that you think you really like it.

949
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,840
So that's another best practice, right?

950
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,557
Now, if you see over here,
let's see which, okay, so,

951
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,900
here's the one thing, right?

952
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:47,340
So let's see which one is this one?

953
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,460
Okay, so it created a,

954
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,520
so this is an existing
gaming application, okay?

955
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,110
It did all the advanced
features that I mentioned.

956
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,760
And then, if I open the

957
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,453
gaming application with all the updates,

958
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,193
and then if I bring it over
here, I created a Pac-Kiro,

959
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,680
and it has ability to
save the high scoring,

960
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,160
it has those like trailing effects

961
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,780
that I mentioned and all that.

962
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,880
So I created this application

963
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,100
in like maybe less than 20 minutes, right?

964
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,830
Building that, so I can like use vibe,

965
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,410
like spec-based coding,
move from vibe coding,

966
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,630
for like doing proper planning,

967
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,580
approving all the requirements, design,

968
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,720
and task and everything.

969
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,870
And then, that's how like
you build like any kind

970
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,970
of production-ready application, which is,

971
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:44,820
and then the final thing is
like the AWS deployment, right?

972
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,050
So if you see over here in this one,

973
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,610
if I go back here.

974
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,420
Oh, no page. I'm struggling.

975
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,340
Okay, so I did like I told,
okay, even Kiro, right?

976
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,520
I asked, okay, can you
create an AWS cost analysis

977
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,840
because I'm very concerned about cost.

978
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,720
Okay, tell me like if there
are 10,000 users right now,

979
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,350
okay, using this application
when it is deployed on AWS,

980
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,250
how would that look like?

981
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:14,610
So it created an executive
summary for me, right?

982
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,540
Something like this.

983
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,890
So it went in and looked
into all the infrastructure

984
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,890
that it is using for
hosting this application.

985
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:26,100
And then, it did a cost
breakdown by service.

986
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,050
So it created a very detailed analysis

987
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,640
of like cost analysis.

988
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,450
The other thing is I asked him, okay,

989
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,483
can you create, like if I ask here,

990
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,447
can you create an AWS,

991
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,220
I think it is too small, right?

992
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:52,220
So architecture diagram
using AWS diagram server.

993
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,280
So this is something like, okay,

994
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,330
I have built the application,

995
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:02,220
but I want to create an
architecture diagram, right?

996
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,790
So it says, okay, I'll create
an architecture diagram

997
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,890
for you for the Pac-Kiro game.

998
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,590
Now, what it is doing is that
it is using the MCP tool.

999
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,930
So here, you have that diagram MCP server.

1000
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,840
So it is taking all the icons from there,

1001
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,550
and then it's creating an
architecture diagram for me.

1002
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,400
And then, it's gonna wait for me.

1003
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,730
And then, okay, I want to
allow it generate the diagram.

1004
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:27,860
So you can like,

1005
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,700
so this is something
more of a runtime, okay?

1006
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,640
Where you are not like putting
everything into the context,

1007
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,517
but you are like calling on runtime some

1008
00:44:34,517 --> 00:44:37,290
of the additional external tools, right?

1009
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,123
And then, the other thing,

1010
00:44:38,123 --> 00:44:41,730
if you see over here,
there's another option here,

1011
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:44,343
which is the hash button, right?

1012
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:47,943
Okay, there is,

1013
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,850
my screen froze on me for
some, okay, interesting.

1014
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:54,960
My screen froze on me,

1015
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,160
but then let me, so generate,
if you see over here,

1016
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,060
this is a folder, it created
an architecture diagram for me.

1017
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,563
Let me bring to this one.

1018
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:10,460
Okay, that's a nice,
small architecture diagram

1019
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,260
that it has created using
the diagram server, right?

1020
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,133
Now, I don't know, I cannot,

1021
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,283
okay, here is this.

1022
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,960
So if you type hash,

1023
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,840
and then there are like
certain additional contents

1024
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,673
that you can inject.

1025
00:45:25,673 --> 00:45:27,360
Like let's say I have this URL,

1026
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,130
and I can reference the URL like, okay,

1027
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:34,130
I have as external URL
something like example.com.

1028
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,273
And then, look into that,

1029
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:42,210
look into this gaming application

1030
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,970
and come up with a comparison

1031
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,440
of the feature set that I want to utilize.

1032
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,020
So you can like use spec-based coding

1033
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,620
and the conversation with that
using some additional tools

1034
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,290
that is there within the Kiro agentic IDE

1035
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:58,263
to do some kind of
additional analysis use.

1036
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,330
So that's kind of something,

1037
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,980
which is very interesting, right?

1038
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,150
Yeah, I think pretty much that's all.

1039
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,870
Any questions so far based
on the IDE? Yep, go ahead.

1040
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:10,980
- [Audience] I have a
little bit of a question.

1041
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,813
- [Pranjit] Yeah.

1042
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:12,646
- [Audience] Between the specs

1043
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:13,800
and the steering you showed here,

1044
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,830
we had a very fairly simple demo here,

1045
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:18,630
but in a more mature application see

1046
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:20,460
those getting quite longer.

1047
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,460
- So-
- This is our concern

1048
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,040
about the context window.

1049
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,750
- [Marcus] Yeah, so the question is

1050
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,030
pretty simple application, the steering

1051
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,310
and the spec docs here, pretty small.

1052
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,020
What does the context window look like

1053
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,720
when you add a larger project?

1054
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,870
You're doing a significant refactor

1055
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:38,640
of an enterprise
application, what happens?

1056
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,710
So that's when you start talking more

1057
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,350
about you will have multiple phases.

1058
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:47,130
You break the whole project
into phases as one piece,

1059
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:50,550
and I'll come back and bring
it together in more detail.

1060
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:53,100
Pranjit showed how some of these rules

1061
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,220
and these steering docs are listed.

1062
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,410
As always, you've got other options.

1063
00:46:58,410 --> 00:46:59,853
Don't always include them.

1064
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:03,480
And also, so when you've
got multiple phases

1065
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,100
of a project, you can
have different specs.

1066
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:09,150
So I've got one example
that has 10 different specs,

1067
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:10,950
and each spec has its own set

1068
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:15,950
of requirements, design, and tasks.

1069
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:19,890
An example, I could have the,

1070
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:23,130
or I've got a particular enhancement.

1071
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,360
I've got a new feature.

1072
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,630
I got an MVP first that
took, you know, two specs.

1073
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,310
Then, I'm like okay,
this is great for an MVP.

1074
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,180
Everybody loved it.

1075
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,740
Let's do some feature enhancements,

1076
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,840
call it sprint one, sprint
two, whatever you've got.

1077
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,910
And then, so you build that in there

1078
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:37,800
and you create a spec doc for that set

1079
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,760
of feature enhancements.

1080
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,560
So I've got another spec
doc where I added a feature,

1081
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,080
and I really want that feature,
but it broke some stuff.

1082
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:51,000
So now, I've got another
spec and set of design

1083
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,580
and implementation tasks that go back

1084
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:57,390
and help me refactor that piece.

1085
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,370
And so that's how you would do it.

1086
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:02,070
Now, getting back to the context window,

1087
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:06,720
if you haven't found it before
in your AI use as Models.dev,

1088
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,910
it gives you a list of all
of the different models

1089
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,530
that are, I don't know if it's all,

1090
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:12,090
but most of the models that are out there.

1091
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:15,810
You can see approximate
price per million tokens.

1092
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,540
You can see size of the context window.

1093
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,590
And when you look at that,
try to match the model

1094
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,660
with the work that you're doing

1095
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:28,860
because, yeah, could
you do a context show?

1096
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,570
Like back in the Kiro CLI?

1097
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,680
- [Pranjit] Yeah.

1098
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,090
- [Audience] Do you guys have like a,

1099
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,290
is there like a good ratio to shoot for?

1100
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,840
- [Marcus] Yeah, we were
talking about ratios,

1101
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,067
and it's interesting,

1102
00:48:38,067 --> 00:48:39,450
and it may not answer,

1103
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,093
so the question was it
there a ratio we shoot for?

1104
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,520
What I was gonna say is the context show,

1105
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:51,330
you'll notice now I'm not getting just

1106
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,220
how much is used per category.

1107
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,610
I'm actually seeing what
files are being used.

1108
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:58,350
That gives you a better
idea of what's being used

1109
00:48:58,350 --> 00:48:59,183
and what goes into it.

1110
00:48:59,183 --> 00:49:00,450
Do I really need this?

1111
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:05,450
So ratio, the ratio that
we found is it could range,

1112
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:09,030
when you're creating code,

1113
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:13,380
you could have a simple,
you know, generate a spec

1114
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,990
for doing an enterprise billing solution.

1115
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:17,760
It could be 1:100.

1116
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,470
You could do what Pranjit was doing,

1117
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:22,920
which is a little more
detailed and constrain it,

1118
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,020
and it's more of a 1:10, 1:20.

1119
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,200
But one thing you'll find just
in general, context ratios

1120
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,810
or token ratios, input/output,

1121
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,400
is that what you're getting
at is inputs and outputs?

1122
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,880
Okay, so input generating code,

1123
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,050
1:10 to 1:100, depending upon things.

1124
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,450
If you're doing translation, 1:1.

1125
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:44,970
If you're doing something along the lines

1126
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:47,940
of a summarization, it
might be just the opposite.

1127
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,580
I've got 100:1 or 10:1
where I'm giving it this

1128
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:52,260
and say summarize this for me.

1129
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,330
So it's an inverse of that.

1130
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,910
Just general Q and A, 1:3, 1:5.

1131
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,460
I ask a question, you give me some degree

1132
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,560
of concise or verbose answer.

1133
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,670
But for what we're talking

1134
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:05,010
about code development, it could range

1135
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:09,840
from 1:10 to 1:100 ratio, depending

1136
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,210
upon things like steering
docs, constraints,

1137
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,040
and how you prompt it.

1138
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,240
- [Pranjit] Yeah, it's typically like

1139
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,080
if you input like I've seen
like at least for Kiro like

1140
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,580
or some other tools like
it's like 100 input token,

1141
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,110
you get one output token, right?

1142
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,640
So that's the reason, right?

1143
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,820
Like we consider context
window as the real estate

1144
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,380
that you want to utilize it efficiently

1145
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,150
because like you don't
want to dump everything

1146
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:30,983
within the context

1147
00:50:30,983 --> 00:50:32,880
and like think like it's
gonna create something wonder

1148
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,713
for you, right?

1149
00:50:33,713 --> 00:50:35,430
So very like important how you want

1150
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:36,480
to utilize the context window.

1151
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,827
That's all like this Kiro CLI

1152
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:40,560
and the tools that you have
is like showing you those,

1153
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,090
how you're utilizing the context window

1154
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:44,580
and how you can like, are
you nearing to the compaction

1155
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,420
and things like that.

1156
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,980
You can do it even upfront, okay?

1157
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,870
Like using some of the
commands like slash compact

1158
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:49,703
and all that, right?

1159
00:50:49,703 --> 00:50:51,150
So yeah, that's important.

1160
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:54,660
Now, like as I mentioned,
like I was just showing like

1161
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,070
when you guys were having a conversation,

1162
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,540
a trading system that I built, right?

1163
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,510
Okay, so you can build like
this is just for like the time

1164
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,490
of that we have like an hour, okay?

1165
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,170
How we can showcase some of the features

1166
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,310
and some of the tools

1167
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:08,040
that are there within the
Kiro agentic IDE, okay?

1168
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,470
Which will help you from our
context engineering side of it.

1169
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,840
Right now, we have gone through
this like just a summary

1170
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,910
of what we went over.

1171
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:17,730
We used like vibe coding to
start the ideation phase,

1172
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:19,380
then we moved to the spec-based coding,

1173
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,500
and then we like it
created the user stories

1174
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,900
and acceptance criteria,
the requirements phase.

1175
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,600
Just like any SDLC
process, we call it AIDLC

1176
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,360
or artificial intelligence DLC, right?

1177
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,590
And then, the design phase is

1178
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,320
where you are gonna look into
all the architecture diagram,

1179
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,960
the Mermaid flow, the system
architecture and everything.

1180
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,810
And then, once you are
fine with those, you move

1181
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,640
to the task, which can be more granular

1182
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,730
and where you have like
additional optional task as well,

1183
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:47,670
which you can make them
like mandatory, right?

1184
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,460
And there's one very
important thing that was like

1185
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,940
after it went GA just a few weeks back,

1186
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,100
a property-based testing or PBT,

1187
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,380
which is basically not just unit testing

1188
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,570
of just a specific module
that you have developed

1189
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:03,060
with agentic IDE, but making sure like

1190
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,680
if you're doing some code update

1191
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,980
or creating new code, is it gonna go back

1192
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,600
and look into the requirements document

1193
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,400
and see like if it is like aligning

1194
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,530
to what you initially set to build, right?

1195
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,690
So the property-based
testing is something,

1196
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,910
it talks about like correctness property.

1197
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,080
And then, it's basically embedded

1198
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,880
within the design markdown file

1199
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,200
where you go scroll all the way down,

1200
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,060
it shows all the property-based testing.

1201
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,400
Like these are the property
testing that is aligned

1202
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,540
to these requirements,

1203
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,710
and it's gonna check those, okay,

1204
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,680
at certain interval based on
what you are building, right?

1205
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,610
Using some of the tasks.

1206
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:34,110
So those are the important things.

1207
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,030
And then, you come up
with a working product.

1208
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:39,270
Now, some of the advantages
both for developers

1209
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:42,510
and for the organizations
like you reduce time

1210
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:46,050
for fixing some of the code
that you generate through AI.

1211
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:47,670
You build production-ready solutions

1212
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,910
from day one rather
than just like prompting

1213
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:52,350
and praying something good comes out.

1214
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:53,490
You become a context architect,

1215
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:54,990
not just a code reviewer, right?

1216
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:58,080
So you're gonna use your
own knowledge, right?

1217
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,300
That you have acquired
from so long working

1218
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,120
on different tools and
technologies and frameworks, right?

1219
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,610
So that's very important.
That's not gonna go away.

1220
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:07,530
And also, how you can use,
like if you're building

1221
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,810
on AWS, the best practices,
like I've shown some

1222
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,760
of the MCP server there are like more

1223
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,860
like cost-related MCP server.

1224
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,580
There's like cloud formation MCP server

1225
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,413
and all those things.

1226
00:53:18,413 --> 00:53:19,710
Like there's like more than 50

1227
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:21,390
of them already out there, right?

1228
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:23,580
And then, from the organization, okay,

1229
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,160
they're gonna not gonna get
a very big AWS bill just

1230
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,120
because like AI code
didn't even like understand

1231
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,200
the cost implications

1232
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,150
of like is it building something?

1233
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,040
Like is it like spinning up big containers

1234
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,750
or easy instances,
things like that, right?

1235
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:37,950
So very important.

1236
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:38,847
And then, some of the security

1237
00:53:38,847 --> 00:53:41,280
and compliance, like mostly
for financial industry,

1238
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,360
insurance industry,

1239
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,880
how you are dealing with
PHI, PII data, right?

1240
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,710
Are there any other government standards

1241
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:48,270
that it has to adhere to, right?

1242
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:50,850
You can do those vibe coding
and the spec-based coding.

1243
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,260
You can like have that conversation

1244
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,060
and like make sure those are like embedded

1245
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,820
within the markdown
files or add those phases

1246
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,140
before even you start coding.

1247
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,870
So plan before you build,
right? That's kind of the idea.

1248
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,710
And then, faster time to
market and the tech dev, right?

1249
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,870
Like when you do vibe coding,
okay, you gather a lot

1250
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,010
of like technical dev

1251
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,870
because like there's a
lot of unnecessary code

1252
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,340
that is not needed, right?

1253
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,020
So how you can improve that

1254
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,160
and reduce some of the tech dev,

1255
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,250
so those are some of the
benefits for the organizations.

1256
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,170
And this is something that
I wanted to highlight.

1257
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:21,210
Like Andrej Karpathy, you
probably know the founder

1258
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,940
of OpenAI, one of the
co-founders has mentioned in one

1259
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,640
of his session, LLMs are the new CPUs,

1260
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,040
which is more of like
context processing unit.

1261
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,360
So context is very important.

1262
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,340
And how you move from prompt engineering

1263
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,320
to the context engineering is the new era

1264
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,240
that we are gonna go into right next year.

1265
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,840
So as I mentioned, some of the resources,

1266
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,370
these are some of the QR codes.

1267
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,500
Please, take a picture if you want.

1268
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,120
The first one is very interesting,

1269
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,190
which is like the context
engineering versus vibe coding,

1270
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,450
when to use what.

1271
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,460
It's not and or all, it's basically based

1272
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,200
on all your use case, okay?

1273
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,460
If you're building a quick prototype

1274
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,399
for going into a meeting, okay,

1275
00:54:56,399 --> 00:54:57,480
where you want to just show the art

1276
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,060
of the possible, probably
vibe coding is the way to go.

1277
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,900
But if you're planning

1278
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,370
to build a production-ready application,

1279
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,170
it's not the right step, right?

1280
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:06,270
The Kiro website to get
started, how you can download

1281
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,070
and set up your WorkSpaces.

1282
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,080
And then, this is an interesting workshop

1283
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,030
like AI-driven dev with Kiro workshop.

1284
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,040
This takes you to the workshop of the AWS

1285
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,720
where you can like actually do hands-on,

1286
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,951
how you can use vibe coding, spec-based,

1287
00:55:17,951 --> 00:55:19,500
and some of the other additional resources

1288
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,333
that are shared today.

1289
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:22,530
Like some of the additional features.

1290
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:25,290
And with that, I think we
come to the conclusion.

1291
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:28,020
This is our email address
if you want to connect

1292
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,630
or like connect over LinkedIn.

1293
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,820
And please, like feedback is a gift.

1294
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,590
So if there's anything
that we can improve upon,

1295
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:35,423
if there's anything

1296
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:38,280
that we didn't meet your
expectations, based on the sessions

1297
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,330
that we have, please feel free

1298
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:40,890
to give your honest feedback, right?

1299
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:44,434
So yeah, any questions? We have some time.

1300
00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:45,267
- [Audience] I know we talk a lot

1301
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:46,940
about, you know, VOC
that you (indistinct),

1302
00:55:47,933 --> 00:55:49,440
what about legacy code or existing code?

1303
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,311
Can you give some practices?

1304
00:55:51,311 --> 00:55:54,741
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know, microservices

1305
00:55:54,741 --> 00:55:57,450
and you're just getting
started over there.

1306
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:00,360
What are some steps that we should follow

1307
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,480
for existing large applications?

1308
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,420
- [Pranjit] Yeah, so let me
rephrase for the audience,

1309
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,570
for someone who is going
to offline hear this.

1310
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,500
The question is basically

1311
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,120
what are the legacy applications, right?

1312
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,810
Like how do we modernize
or how do you like start,

1313
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,950
or like playing with those?

1314
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:18,870
And like this was the
same question I was having

1315
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:19,703
with someone else.

1316
00:56:19,703 --> 00:56:21,510
Like there's the use case over here.

1317
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,460
Okay, it's just one, like two patterns

1318
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,293
that we have showed here.

1319
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:25,740
There are like a hundred
types of patterns.

1320
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,467
So one of the patterns that we
have seen is like there is a,

1321
00:56:28,467 --> 00:56:29,850
and just to give an example,

1322
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:31,620
a legacy Java application, right?

1323
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,870
That's been running for like 10, 15 years

1324
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,640
with some outdated Java version,

1325
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,040
some of the security challenges, right?

1326
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,450
So there was this use case

1327
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:41,520
where like the stakeholders
are really concerned

1328
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,220
and they want to migrate to
a more modern architecture,

1329
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,860
but it's a lot of significant investment

1330
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,880
for the key resources.

1331
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,440
Probably, the developers
that have built, okay,

1332
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,030
have left the organization, right?

1333
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,340
So how do you like squeeze that timeframe

1334
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,320
and use Kiro, right?

1335
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,900
To give that code base,
like point to the code base,

1336
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,960
and then let it like use the
spec-based coding to come up

1337
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,430
with a modern, cloud native.

1338
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:05,040
Like if it cloud is the right way, come up

1339
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,320
with the discovery and
the analysis part of it,

1340
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,880
and what would be the 2B architecture?

1341
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,010
So you can do all that roadmap analysis

1342
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,957
and come up with that plan
in a detailed fashion, okay,

1343
00:57:13,957 --> 00:57:16,410
which you can use like
once you get approval

1344
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:19,080
from your stakeholders to
kind of then start building

1345
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,900
on like small task or sublevel tasks

1346
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,520
when addressing some of
the specific components

1347
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,720
within the legacy application

1348
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,380
to move to a more modern
cloud-native architecture.

1349
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,600
It's like a crawl, walk,
runs process, right?

1350
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,433
That we typically follow.

1351
00:57:31,433 --> 00:57:32,880
So there's use cases over there.

1352
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,820
Okay, we have workshops
of how you can get started

1353
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,250
on dealing with some of
the legacy applications

1354
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,320
and how we can use that Kiro

1355
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,990
to kind of build modern architecture

1356
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:45,870
and like modernize the legacy application.

1357
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,320
So there are use cases
around that as well, okay?

1358
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:51,450
- [Marcus] If I can
add my two cents, agree

1359
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:53,580
with everything he just
said, but I got two minutes.

1360
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,780
I think I can enhance it.

1361
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,520
- [Audience] So bringing application

1362
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,257
on the cloud, already (indistinct).

1363
00:57:58,257 --> 00:57:59,090
- [Marcus] Yep.

1364
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:00,827
- [Audience] It's just
now continue development

1365
00:58:00,827 --> 00:58:01,887
in that application (indistinct)?

1366
00:58:01,887 --> 00:58:03,960
- [Marcus] Greenfield's
really easy, right?

1367
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,280
It's the brownfield that you gotta do

1368
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,360
a little more work on it.

1369
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,160
So you've got an enterprise
architecture diagram, right?

1370
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,790
Or if not, make one.

1371
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:14,460
Or have Claude, Kiro help you.

1372
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,700
But Claude is multi or Kiro is multimodal.

1373
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,980
So you can take a picture or an image

1374
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:22,770
of that enterprise diagram, feed it in,

1375
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:24,660
and then start at that level.

1376
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,510
And then, you know,
provide anything you want

1377
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:28,920
about your microservices architecture.

1378
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,270
Do you wanna change everything?

1379
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:33,330
Are you updating for versions, et cetera?

1380
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,800
But something you can go back

1381
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,620
to your hotel room tonight,
get the diagram, feed it

1382
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,900
into Kiro as an image and say,

1383
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,540
help me develop a solution

1384
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,510
for updating, upgrading, refactoring,

1385
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,480
whatever you need to do.

1386
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,470
Start from there. Work your
way down into the details.

1387
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:50,880
Break up each one of those microservices

1388
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,473
into its own set of specs.

1389
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:58,350
- [Pranjit] All right, if
there's no any questions,

1390
00:58:58,350 --> 00:58:59,250
we'll wrap up here.

1391
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,350
But thank you, again, for staying with us.

1392
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:03,409
Hopefully, it was helpful.
And yeah, thank you.

1393
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:05,881
