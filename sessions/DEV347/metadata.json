  "abstract": "Builders often form their identity around the things they build and their chosen tools. This is natural, as it reflects how they spend their time and direct their focus. But output and tools should not define the builder's role. When attachment to building becomes too strong, the primary task of problem-solving gets overlooked. A builder's true job is solving problems, which may or may not require building something. Building an outcome-focused mindset requires understanding its challenges and seeing how it reshapes our approach to system design.",
  "abstract_cn": "构建者往往围绕他们构建的事物和所选择的工具来形成自己的身份认同。这很自然，因为这反映了他们如何分配时间和集中精力。但产出和工具不应定义构建者的角色。当对构建的执着过于强烈时，解决问题这一首要任务就会被忽视。构建者的真正工作是解决问题，这可能需要也可能不需要构建某些东西。建立以结果为导向的思维方式需要理解其挑战，并了解它如何重塑我们的系统设计方法。",
