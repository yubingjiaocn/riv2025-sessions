1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,349
Hey everybody.

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,988
My name is Gabriel Dylan. It's a pleasure

3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:07,230
to be here and to be able to speak with you guys

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,390
today about personalization, about

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,050
content, about artificial intelligence.

6
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:14,390
Um, I represent Contentful, which is

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,469
a digital experience platform,

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,750
uh, for building all sorts of different

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,870
kinds of experiences across many different kinds

10
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,649
of channels.

11
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:24,239
I'm very, very honored to speak to

12
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,850
you today, and I wanna thank AWS

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,989
for their amazing partnership. I'll

14
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,309
talk about this later on,

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,819
but Contentful is native

16
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:34,840
to AWS and the trust and

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,060
scalability that we provide to our clients

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,560
is in large part due to the trust

19
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,679
and scalability that AWS provides

20
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,450
to us.

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,399
So, thank you, AWS.

22
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:48,310
for the opportunity and for you guys for

23
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,918
coming and speaking to me today.

24
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:53,060
We're going to talk about supercharging personalized

25
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,750
experiences

26
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:54,929
with contentful

27
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:58,139
NAWS, in particular, Amazon Bedrock.

28
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:02,250
OK, so, one would think

29
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,808
that with the ability to generate an infinite

30
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:07,168
amount of content that marketers would be

31
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:08,510
super happy, right?

32
00:01:08,888 --> 00:01:11,168
Because now suddenly they don't have to do their job

33
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,260
anymore. I would be pretty happy too.

34
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:15,870
But there's actually a huge problem

35
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,019
with being able to deliver

36
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,569
high-quality experiences today in the age

37
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:22,620
of artificial intelligence and the ability

38
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,838
to Generate content with the click

39
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:25,579
of a button.

40
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:28,159
Specifically, it's that so much

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,930
of that generated content

42
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:30,819
is

43
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:31,930
generic.

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
It's dumb, it's generic,

45
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,918
it's boring, it's, it's just not

46
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:39,040
interesting enough to be able to drive the kinds

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,540
of behaviors that we as

48
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:43,879
brands, as organizations want

49
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,519
our clients and customers to do.

50
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,459
And customers know it, when they receive

51
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:50,609
those types of messages from your website or your

52
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:52,909
app, they get bored.

53
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:55,370
We call this the great content collapse.

54
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,620
The analogy that I wanna sort of offer

55
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,620
for you is if you remember like way back

56
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,900
in like 2011, there was a

57
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,939
UI library that was released called

58
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:05,730
Bootstrap.

59
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:07,790
Does anybody remember Bootstrap?

60
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:08,879
Yeah.

61
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,379
And then all of a sudden, all the websites

62
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:13,000
looked exactly the same.

63
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,929
Now we're doing the same thing with the

64
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:18,599
copy, we're doing the same thing with the images.

65
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,308
We sound boring

66
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:21,949
to our clients.

67
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:23,429
And

68
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:25,889
it's happening at the beginning of the funnel, the middle of the funnel,

69
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:27,969
and the end of the funnel. By the way, if it's not

70
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:30,008
clear, this is a marketing talk. It's

71
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:32,088
not an infrastructure talk, but I'll cover

72
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:34,360
some infrastructure topics as well.

73
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:35,729
So

74
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:38,088
this is breaking our marketers. This

75
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:40,409
content collapse is breaking our marketers

76
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:41,169
across the board.

77
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:43,699
They're asked to create more with

78
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:46,189
fewer resources and supposedly

79
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:48,490
artificial intelligence is supposed to

80
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,868
solve the problems that they encounter

81
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,868
along the way.

82
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,189
Down at the bottom of our funnel,

83
00:02:54,528 --> 00:02:55,710
we're supposed to have

84
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,189
really loyal.

85
00:02:58,618 --> 00:03:00,659
Customers who experience

86
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,819
Being spoken to as individuals,

87
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,838
but they're just still served the same generic

88
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:08,838
content that they received when they were at the top

89
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:09,439
of the funnel.

90
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:12,588
The paradox that we talk about here

91
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:15,210
is that we have a whole bunch of speed,

92
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,550
but we've lost relevance, we've lost

93
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,169
the ability

94
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:20,830
to address our users as humans.

95
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,469
In fact,

96
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:25,439
what's happened is that artificial intelligence

97
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,558
has offered this new skill

98
00:03:27,558 --> 00:03:29,758
set that is separate from the

99
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:31,879
content layer that we use to be able to

100
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,110
govern workflows, to be able to

101
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,300
publish content, and distribute really

102
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,219
great stories to our users.

103
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,919
My CMO Elizabeth Maxson

104
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,360
recently collaborated with The Atlantic

105
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,460
on a big think piece. There'll be a webinar

106
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,379
in a week or so,

107
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:50,099
uh, and what we're calling it is this

108
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,740
big sort of, uh, misunderstanding

109
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,099
about what artificial intelligence is. Doing

110
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,099
to marketers,

111
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,538
it should really be making marketers more

112
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,719
human. It should be freeing them up

113
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,360
to

114
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:03,979
be more creative, to be able to

115
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:06,020
think more about their users, and to be able

116
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,719
to publish

117
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,258
content that speaks to individuals based off of what

118
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:10,099
they need.

119
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,399
And instead what we're getting is something

120
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:13,558
much worse.

121
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,858
It's because the artificial intelligence

122
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,108
is at the wrong part of the marketing stack.

123
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,259
It's in this sidebar. You guys have seen

124
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:22,850
the AI sidebar,

125
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:25,519
but why isn't it actually part of the content layer

126
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,759
itself? So,

127
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,699
as I mentioned, my name is Gabriel Dylan. I'm

128
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:34,980
the practice uh lead for our

129
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,100
personalization product. So we're gonna talk

130
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,500
quite a lot about personalization and how it solves

131
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,540
some of the problems associated with

132
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,509
generic content.

133
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,178
But first, let's take a moment and

134
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:47,579
talk about personalization in a more general

135
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,088
sense,

136
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:50,540
because quite frankly, personalization is not new,

137
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,619
it's not an artifact of artificial

138
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:54,759
intelligence. We've been trying to create

139
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:57,259
custom curated, tailored

140
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,500
journeys that are highly relevant for a very

141
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,559
long time,

142
00:05:01,178 --> 00:05:02,559
but it often fails.

143
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,439
It often fails, not because the

144
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,559
technology is bad, it is actually getting much

145
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,720
better these days, but because of the people

146
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,959
and the processes that are used

147
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,178
to be able to create the experiences

148
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,259
that are supposed to be personalized.

149
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,720
And there's a bunch of different ways in

150
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,569
which those sorts of processes fail.

151
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,889
There's siloed content,

152
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,269
which is caused by bas,

153
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:27,449
it causes bad cross-channel experiences,

154
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:29,689
you know, you get a really great email and then you land

155
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:30,949
on the website and it's

156
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,329
completely different.

157
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:33,548
There's super

158
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:36,048
superficial personalization, that's often

159
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:38,199
what gives people the ick factor when you suddenly

160
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:38,709
start using

161
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,290
their name and they're like, you don't know me

162
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,358
website, like I'm, I'm just doing my thing and

163
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:45,129
why are you talking to me like we're friends?

164
00:05:46,028 --> 00:05:48,350
There's inaccurate personalization where you actually

165
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,470
try to leverage some customer data, but

166
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,850
it's out of date or

167
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:53,850
it's not really integrated well.

168
00:05:54,548 --> 00:05:56,889
There's redundant experiences

169
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:57,709
when

170
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,329
maybe a marketer got really clever and created

171
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,178
an aspect that was very powerful,

172
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:04,670
but it's only in one little piece of the

173
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,829
experience, and then they come to another spot and

174
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:08,689
there's some discordant dissonance.

175
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,278
There's also poorly measured experiences

176
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,238
where

177
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:15,720
There's no feedback loop,

178
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,079
so the marketing organization that's trying to create

179
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,119
these experiences doesn't know if

180
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:22,160
it's actually working, if it's actually moving

181
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
the needle and driving behaviors the

182
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,178
way that they would want.

183
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:28,309
And then lastly, there's the dependence on

184
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:29,009
developers.

185
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:30,428
To be able to be

186
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:31,488
fast,

187
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,869
to be able to create content that

188
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:35,540
captures a moment in time,

189
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,988
we need our marketers to be freed

190
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:40,269
from the ticket queue and

191
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:41,970
the requirements of the front end.

192
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,379
In the report in The Atlantic, we talk about

193
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,548
like this optimism optimism

194
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,879
versus expectation gap.

195
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
Like everybody knows that personalization

196
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,189
is the answer. It should make my

197
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:56,738
job really easy to sell personalization

198
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:59,019
technology, and yet the way that we actually

199
00:06:59,019 --> 00:06:59,980
implement it

200
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:01,920
is very, very challenging.

201
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:04,298
The data doesn't match what we

202
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,579
actually hope it to do.

203
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,059
An AI is supposed to fix these

204
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:08,649
problems,

205
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:11,298
but quite often it actually exacerbates

206
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,920
them. When you think about a marketer

207
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,069
with a really powerful AI tool that

208
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,509
lives outside of the content layer, suddenly

209
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,509
using that AI tool to create a bunch of

210
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,449
content, that's when we get that

211
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,949
poor quality content, that's when the content

212
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:25,769
gets worse.

213
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:27,379
So,

214
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,178
how do we actually fix this?

215
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,108
Well,

216
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:32,488
that's the next step of the, the equation.

217
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:35,608
Good personalization,

218
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,790
good AI native

219
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,889
personalization

220
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,379
looks very differently than

221
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:43,660
that past experience.

222
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:46,028
In the first place, it's gonna be based

223
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:47,988
off of structured content.

224
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,250
Content where

225
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:50,410
the

226
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:53,488
definition of what is a hero

227
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,790
is very, very clear, and that it can

228
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,858
be reused across a mobile app,

229
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,709
a website, a kiosk,

230
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:01,278
maybe even a watch.

231
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,750
Second,

232
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:05,350
we want automated guardrails

233
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,509
so that our marketers are able to create

234
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:09,509
safely. When they publish

235
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:11,209
content, they know that it's going to adhere

236
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:13,790
to the brand guidelines, it's gonna fit

237
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:15,048
within the front end.

238
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,509
This is what I think of as like the boring part of

239
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:19,899
like old fashioned content management systems,

240
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:22,189
but it's a critical part of what makes

241
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:24,428
content operations actually successful.

242
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,709
And if you just add AI on the side, it

243
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:27,689
doesn't actually work.

244
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:30,608
The 3rd thing we need to be able to make

245
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:33,168
sure that AI native personalization succeeds

246
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,969
is context-aware

247
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:36,509
content generation,

248
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,149
which means

249
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,479
The AI has an understanding of

250
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,649
the content model.

251
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,099
What is a hero in relation to

252
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:46,440
a landing page?

253
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,139
It has an understanding of the context of the user.

254
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,798
Did they bring with them a UTM parameter?

255
00:08:51,869 --> 00:08:53,440
Did they bring with them a refer?

256
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,080
Have they clicked a link in the last 5 minutes,

257
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:58,239
in the last 5 seconds? Did they just

258
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:00,349
click a link 50 milliseconds

259
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:02,440
ago? And we also need

260
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,619
the context of the marketing

261
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:05,649
organization itself.

262
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,489
What are the brand guidelines?

263
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:09,820
What is the tone and voice that we want to

264
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,058
apply in this particular channel?

265
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,979
Very lastly, we need an API

266
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:18,000
first delivery layer, something that is

267
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,859
going to be able to deliver that content

268
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,250
regardless of where it's gonna be used.

269
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:25,139
We want all of these things to come

270
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:27,139
together in a content layer

271
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,178
that works in tandem with

272
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,950
the AI

273
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:32,558
so that we can personalize the content

274
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:34,950
based off of where it's going to appear,

275
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,279
for whom it's going to appear, and what

276
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,830
they're actually trying to achieve,

277
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,918
what we want them to achieve.

278
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,840
And so that brings us back to that idea of

279
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,428
the content collapse, marketers going kind of nuts

280
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,058
because too much is going on.

281
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:54,320
The truth is that we have

282
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:56,279
content be

283
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,700
the differentiator for how we can

284
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,700
actually build customer experiences.

285
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,479
I'm sure that some of you work in

286
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,149
tech companies

287
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,859
who are marketing your products to

288
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:07,649
prospects.

289
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,298
How do you compete against your competition? How

290
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:12,340
do you actually communicate that your

291
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,500
product is different and that your company

292
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,649
is going to do business differently?

293
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,859
Personalized experiences are the

294
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:22,000
opportunity to target that content

295
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:24,139
and build curated journeys

296
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:26,219
for the prospects that you are targeting.

297
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,759
To do that, we need to collect a lot of

298
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,418
information. We need two

299
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,719
main kinds of context. The

300
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,759
first, let's call them behavioral

301
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,320
signals,

302
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,840
those real-time signals that actually tell

303
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,279
you about what that user is doing in

304
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,399
that very moment when they come to your

305
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:45,190
website. And the second

306
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,450
is all of the other things

307
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,570
that they've done in the context

308
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,960
of your brand before.

309
00:10:51,219 --> 00:10:53,489
Maybe they're part of an email campaign, maybe

310
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:55,769
they've purchased something in the past, maybe

311
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,769
you can actually identify that they work at

312
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:59,629
company X, Y, or Z.

313
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:02,889
So you got your behavioral signals and

314
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:04,940
then known customer characteristics,

315
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:07,178
those sorts of things that we can ascribe to somebody

316
00:11:07,178 --> 00:11:08,298
based off of what we know.

317
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:11,489
The first is a real-time problem.

318
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:14,529
How do we collect that and make it actionable

319
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:15,369
right away?

320
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,639
How can we receive the signal from the front

321
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,908
end, use it to segment that user

322
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:22,279
into an experience, and give that experience

323
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:22,830
to them

324
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,668
without any sort of delay?

325
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:25,830
And in the second,

326
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,288
it's an integration problem. How do we

327
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,408
activate the data that lives

328
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:32,869
inside the CRM or the CDP

329
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:34,469
or the warehouse?

330
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:37,428
When we have both of those,

331
00:11:37,788 --> 00:11:40,070
then we can start combining those to

332
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,229
create the contextual

333
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:44,308
information that's necessary to

334
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:46,769
provide a relevant, high quality,

335
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,109
compelling experience for

336
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:49,849
the user.

337
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,250
And when we do that, we should experience

338
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:54,308
improved conversion rates,

339
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:57,269
improved engagement, we should be able to drive

340
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:59,509
repeat behaviors and improve lifetime

341
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,509
value of our customers, and we should be able

342
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:03,950
to move them through the funnel with less friction.

343
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:05,509
But

344
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,639
all of this breaks down if you don't

345
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:09,119
trust the process,

346
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,928
able to scale it,

347
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,500
or have access to all of that

348
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,479
lovely context.

349
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,859
That's where AWS steps into the

350
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:19,798
contentful equation.

351
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:23,029
We partner, and I mentioned this earlier,

352
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,070
we're built on AWS

353
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,590
because it's the same infrastructure that you

354
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,830
all are trusting with your businesses

355
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,859
today. It's a critical part of

356
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:34,229
our value proposition to our clients

357
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:35,889
that we can be built on a solution

358
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,830
as robust and scalable as AWS

359
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,489
is.

360
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:42,629
But it's actually Amazon Bedrock

361
00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:44,950
that gives us the special artificial

362
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,808
intelligence powers that we offer

363
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:48,190
within Contentfold.

364
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:51,219
Bedrock allows you to use

365
00:12:51,798 --> 00:12:53,918
the generative AI models that

366
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:56,029
you've determined as an

367
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:58,038
organization with all of your governance and

368
00:12:58,038 --> 00:12:59,779
workflows associated with them,

369
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,359
with all of your security applied

370
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:04,739
to them without a whole lot of fuss.

371
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:07,359
And Contentful brings Bedrock

372
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:09,389
directly into that content layer

373
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,379
to rewind. For a second, I said earlier

374
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:14,219
that if you just have AI in a sidebar,

375
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,599
you're just compounding the problem and giving

376
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,599
marketers a bunch of tooling that is a

377
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:20,918
little bit too big for their, their sort of scope.

378
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:23,359
But if you actually build AI using

379
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,399
Bedrock into the tools they use

380
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:27,639
to create, publish, and distribute content,

381
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,080
then you get something much different and

382
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,399
more powerful. Because

383
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:34,639
it's in that content layer that you

384
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,759
already have defined, what is your content model?

385
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,918
What is that hero? How does it play in

386
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,308
your mobile app versus your website? It's

387
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:43,428
already where you're storing your governance, your

388
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:45,639
approval workflows, and it's already

389
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,798
where you have all of that customer-based

390
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,219
data, the context that allows us to segment

391
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,239
the users.

392
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,029
So, let me take

393
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:59,440
a quick second to show you how it actually works.

394
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,729
I just want to add a disclaimer that this reference

395
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:02,590
architecture.

396
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:06,080
Is not for my audience and

397
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,158
maybe it'll be for you more than it's for me.

398
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:10,960
But when we think about, uh, the

399
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,250
way to actually combine bedrock and

400
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,359
contentful, we put contentful at the

401
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:17,489
center. We add a structure

402
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:19,259
around the content, we provide

403
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:21,798
governance and workflows. There's permissions

404
00:14:21,798 --> 00:14:23,840
and roles for who gets to work on

405
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,090
the content and how.

406
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:27,859
And then we flow into that Amazon

407
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:30,379
bedrock, which is the intelligence engine. That's

408
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:32,080
the learning model, that's the way

409
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,029
that we're actually going to activate artificial intelligence.

410
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:37,899
It creates content, it localizes

411
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:39,979
content, it suggests new variants,

412
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,178
and it helps us identify users

413
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:44,379
based off of the confluence of actions

414
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:45,599
that they've taken recently.

415
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:49,259
And then wrapped around both, we have

416
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:51,080
the API first composable

417
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,700
architecture, the surface area

418
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,779
for the website or the app that's

419
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:57,038
going to consume the content

420
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:59,500
and display it for our customers. It's

421
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,460
essentially the front end.

422
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:03,779
Contentful exposes all of the

423
00:15:03,788 --> 00:15:05,918
content and experiences through those APIs, which

424
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,779
means that we can distribute that content

425
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,779
to the channels that are being used.

426
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,298
This gives you three things.

427
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,580
It gives you speed

428
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,119
because content and AI all work

429
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,340
within the same platform.

430
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,769
They are decoupled,

431
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:22,229
so yes, you manage Bedrock separately

432
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:24,048
from Contentful, but they work together.

433
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:26,629
Gives you safety because governance

434
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:28,629
lives in the content layer, so the

435
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,710
same rules that your marketing team

436
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,529
used in the past

437
00:15:31,908 --> 00:15:33,710
to publish content apply,

438
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:36,168
and it gives you scale because of course

439
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:38,009
AWS underpins everything.

440
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:40,649
The scale and infrastructure that it offers

441
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,058
gives us the sort of robustness and

442
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:45,070
assurances that we need to be able to provide

443
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,849
experiences.

444
00:15:46,558 --> 00:15:47,109
So,

445
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,599
Contentful orchestrates the content,

446
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,080
Bedrock is the intelligence layer,

447
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,558
AWS scales, and your

448
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:56,690
experiences are able to adapt in real

449
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,190
time. So

450
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,349
to be able to make this really work, we need

451
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:04,769
to build a program around

452
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:07,558
personalization and testing.

453
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:09,950
The ability to optimize our

454
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,969
experiences and be able to

455
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:14,109
create something that is data-driven and

456
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:16,509
informs future decisions around

457
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,529
content is what we want to achieve.

458
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:20,969
But to get there, it's actually iterative

459
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:23,019
and small. We want to be able to

460
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:25,129
empower marketers to experiment.

461
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,788
And be able to collect data about

462
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:30,229
those experiments we want to be able to

463
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:32,308
measure the impact and align them with

464
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:33,239
business goals

465
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,590
because ultimately what we're trying to do is we're

466
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,690
creating a

467
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,788
program that will get credibility from

468
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:41,989
the rest of the organization to be able to

469
00:16:41,989 --> 00:16:44,048
continue investing efforts into that

470
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:45,335
if you do. Big bang

471
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:47,634
release of something and it doesn't go the way that

472
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:49,715
you want, it's going to be another 2 years

473
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:52,413
before you try again. So if you can do it incrementally

474
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:53,654
and start small,

475
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,354
make an important change that has an impact on

476
00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:56,904
business,

477
00:16:57,234 --> 00:16:58,933
then you're going to have a really great

478
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:01,474
opportunity to create that life cycle and

479
00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:02,815
that sort of flywheel effect.

480
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,817
And we also need governance to

481
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09,817
be an important part of the equation.

482
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:11,198
I've said it a couple of times.

483
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:13,858
From Bedrock's perspective, that means

484
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,038
that you're using your own LLM.

485
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:18,398
It's your own cloud or your own

486
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:19,138
llama.

487
00:17:19,499 --> 00:17:21,499
From Contentful's perspective, it's

488
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,739
the roles and permissions that somebody needs

489
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:25,858
to be able to work on content and publish

490
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:27,038
it to the front end.

491
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,698
It's the audit logs, it's the workflows

492
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:30,597
and approvals.

493
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,459
When you have AI live directly

494
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:34,969
within the content layer,

495
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:37,459
you can access all of that content, context

496
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:39,890
and structure to be able to

497
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,059
make the marketers empowered to publish

498
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,078
content easily and smoothly without

499
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,380
a major deploy.

500
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:50,588
I'm gonna skip this for a second

501
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,348
and talk about an example in the real world.

502
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:55,049
Our client Kraft Heinz

503
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:57,750
has been able to roll out dozens

504
00:17:57,848 --> 00:17:59,939
of experiences using Contentful

505
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,150
and AWS,

506
00:18:01,568 --> 00:18:03,789
and their experience at scale

507
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,170
has been able to drive incredible

508
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,180
business results.

509
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:08,910
Before they worked with us,

510
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,848
they had content scattered across many different systems.

511
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:12,650
They worked with.

512
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:15,358
CMSs, there was inconsistent governance,

513
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:17,630
and there was no way to create consistency

514
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,709
across brands or regions and

515
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:20,719
localizations.

516
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,269
Afterwards, they brought Contentful

517
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,449
in to unify their content portfolio.

518
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:27,989
They have workflows to be able to govern

519
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:30,348
different brand experiences in a unified

520
00:18:30,348 --> 00:18:30,959
way,

521
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,390
and they're able to use real-time

522
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,348
personalization.

523
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:36,920
To be able to target

524
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,459
the experiences that actually drive

525
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,459
business results for each

526
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:43,318
of their brands and portfolio clients.

527
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:44,969
The results speak for themselves.

528
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,759
78% increase in conversion,

529
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:49,939
30% increase in engagement,

530
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,259
over 180 personalized

531
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:54,259
experiences launched across many

532
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,199
different brands

533
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:56,380
across the globe.

534
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:00,890
And so that brings me to the end.

535
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,769
I'm glad the last slide was the one that almost didn't work.

536
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:06,630
Um, I've talked about how to combine

537
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,630
contentful and bedrock and how

538
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,910
bringing the AI closer to the

539
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,549
content layer

540
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:13,828
gives the marketers the ability to get

541
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:15,979
out of that content collapse. It

542
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:18,108
helps them make better decisions

543
00:19:18,118 --> 00:19:20,150
about the content that they're delivering to their

544
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,390
users. It helps them create

545
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,930
speed and trust

546
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,189
within their sort of workflow.

547
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:29,880
Uh, we have a booth over at 1457,

548
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:31,959
where you can see it in action.

549
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:34,739
I'm just the sales guy, but I've got an amazing

550
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:36,900
guy over at the booth who will show you how this

551
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,150
works and how it can work for your organization

552
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,519
today. Thank you very, very

553
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,539
much. If you have any questions, I'll hang out over

554
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:45,539
there. Uh, and I really appreciate

555
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:46,880
your time and attention today.
