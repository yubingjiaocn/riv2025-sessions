1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,180
- In the last year, I've been approached

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,450
by people asking about their AI costs

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,820
that I wasn't prepared to answer.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,450
For some of you in the
audience, this might be a CFO,

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,450
asking about the ROI on model training,

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,533
maybe an engineer asking for
budget approval for GPUs,

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,460
or a board member asking about
the cost of your AI strategy.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,590
Whoever, whatever the question is,

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,260
hopefully you'll be happy
to hear you're not alone

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,710
if you're feeling unprepared.

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,670
My name is Catherine Graham.

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,320
I lead the Optics team.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,820
It's a finops team within AWS.

14
00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:41,820
- Hey everybody, my name's Chris Hennessy

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,300
and I'm on the executive
in residence team.

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,700
I'm really excited to be here today,

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,090
and prior to being on that
team for the last five years,

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,580
I was a technology CFO at
Capital One for 20 years.

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,590
So excited to share insight
from that experience

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,260
and from the content
we created here today.

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,500
- And today we're gonna talk
to you about AI for finops

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,300
and finops for AI in the hopes
to educate and enable you.

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,700
And in preparation for
today's presentation,

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,770
Chris and I spoke with
over a dozen leaders

25
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,180
from different companies about
their AI and finops journeys.

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,780
And in doing so, I
shockingly found parallels

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,460
to my personal life.

28
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,280
So I wanna start with
a quick personal story

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,140
and then we'll get started.

30
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,050
So four years ago, my husband and I

31
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,080
were planning for our second kid.

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,460
And some of you in the audience

33
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,670
may recognize this misplaced confidence,

34
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,620
but we were going in thinking,

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,840
okay, hey, we've done this before.

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,210
How hard can it be?

37
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,203
It can't be that different.

38
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,250
Fast forward about two
weeks after my son was born,

39
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,170
we found out he was deaf.

40
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,260
All of a sudden
information is flying at us

41
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,970
at a rapid speed.

42
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,360
Lots of unknowns, lots of uncertainty.

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,800
To say we were overwhelmed
is an understatement.

44
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,400
But we had people in our
corner, subject matter experts,

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,790
a community helping us with the transition

46
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,593
and helping us make decisions.

47
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,870
Why am I sharing this with you?

48
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,750
And what on earth does
my son being born deaf

49
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,900
have to do with AI or finops?

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,140
It was in the conversations
that we had with these leaders

51
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,180
that we saw not just a parallel

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,210
into expecting the
unexpected or those unknowns

53
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,380
that I mentioned, but in the
advice the leaders we're giving

54
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,540
to people just starting this journey.

55
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,520
So I wanna share four of those with you

56
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,350
and then we'll dive in.

57
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,700
So first, you're not alone.

58
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,833
May feel like you are, you're not.

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,883
Second, focus on the real problem.

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,320
I was focusing on the
fact that my son was deaf.

61
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,910
That wasn't the problem.

62
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,190
The problem was communication.

63
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,990
If you can focus on real problems

64
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,760
that your customers are having

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,420
or real pain points your
teams are experiencing,

66
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,683
you will deliver value.

67
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,490
Don't overcomplicate it.

68
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,660
Finops 101, cloud financial
management basics,

69
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,690
those principles still apply.

70
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,090
The variables are different.

71
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,600
And then last, never stop learning.

72
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,460
I thought we had the proper tools in place

73
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,600
for kid number two and we
had a decent foundation,

74
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,440
but we still had to learn
new and different things.

75
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,990
We had to learn a completely
different language.

76
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,027
And the same thing is true here,

77
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:38,460
and this isn't just parenting advice,

78
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,350
but our hope today after you leave,

79
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,620
if that CFO, board
member, engineer, comes up

80
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,250
and asks you about AI costs,
you'll have a better answer.

81
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,393
So let's get started.

82
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,730
- Great, and as we look at the elements

83
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,740
of what we're gonna cover in
terms of the perfect storm,

84
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,900
there's a convergence
of activity happening.

85
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,960
I think all of us see how much
cloud growth is occurring.

86
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,250
If you look at any cloud provider,

87
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,740
it's in that 20 to 40% per year.

88
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,650
But AI growth is at a much
larger clip that we're seeing

89
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,330
and that's across all of the ecosystems

90
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,010
and all of the players.

91
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,550
The other thing as we see as
we go through this specifics

92
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,390
are there's a lot that's
changing and new nomenclature

93
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,520
and dynamics you need to
learn as you go through this,

94
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,870
specifically on the AI side.

95
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,180
So understanding some of
the terms, the dynamics

96
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,950
and how that fits into the finops practice

97
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,080
is something we're gonna cover here today.

98
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,100
And then lastly,

99
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,260
you need to focus on both
sides of the equation.

100
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,450
This isn't all about cost for cost sake,

101
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,220
it's about the value articulation.

102
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,290
And that's an area that
we see as a blind spot

103
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,330
and came up with a lot of
our customer conversations

104
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,440
that we had.

105
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,940
So today we're gonna look at both sides.

106
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,650
It's almost two sides of the coin.

107
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,160
One is how can you leverage
AI to enable finops?

108
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,010
And then specifically how
do you bring finops into AI

109
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,860
and the capability that exists there.

110
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,270
So as we start out, there's
this convergence that happens

111
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,430
in terms of this and there's
a good overlap that exists.

112
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,990
And there's three key areas we saw

113
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,270
as we had conversations with customers.

114
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,070
The first is on intelligence.

115
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,610
I think a lot of us have
leveraged AI in both your personal

116
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,970
and professional life as a
way to help with interaction

117
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,590
and prompting and engaging.

118
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,670
It's a way to provide answers

119
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,400
and insights to the
information that exists.

120
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,650
Automation is a big deal within finops.

121
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,630
I know most of the
companies that I meet with,

122
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,910
the finops team is usually
one to three people,

123
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,410
even in large enterprises.

124
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,580
It's really trying to scale

125
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,810
through the engineering community

126
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,120
and help them self sustain.

127
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,100
So automation is a key element of that.

128
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,860
And then lastly, it's
all about getting scale

129
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,080
and democratizing this
to the organization.

130
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,490
A lot of the use cases we're gonna share

131
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,760
that we learned from customers,
it's finding ways to scale

132
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,380
and get more reach and benefit

133
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,470
and insight to those who need
it inside of the organization.

134
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,630
- And one thing that's
important to remember

135
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,930
is you don't need all three on day one,

136
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,120
or even in year one to add value.

137
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,470
The importance is remembering

138
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,720
that the value lives in the intersection,

139
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,200
and that's when AI stops
being just an experiment

140
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,270
and starts being a business enabler.

141
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,020
For finops, it stops being
about just cost control

142
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,783
and starts being about
proactive optimization.

143
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,850
So just to set up the next 45 ish minutes,

144
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,130
we're gonna start with AI for finops.

145
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,180
How are we using AI to transform
cloud financial management?

146
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,220
What are the challenges?

147
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,780
How are leaders approaching it?

148
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,550
What's actually working?

149
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,100
Then we're gonna jump to finops for AI.

150
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,040
How do you budget for something
that's constantly changing?

151
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,560
How do you determine
a return on investment

152
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,180
or build a strategy?

153
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,560
Then we'll wrap with
tips, advice from leaders

154
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,080
and some educational recommendations.

155
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,140
But before we do that, can
everybody get out their phone?

156
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,719
I can't believe I'm
actually saying that during-

157
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,950
- We're gonna do a roll
the dice analogy on this.

158
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,240
So you know when you bring a survey out,

159
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,380
it could either go well or not.

160
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,790
So we're hoping it goes well.

161
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,590
So we'd love to get insight for you all

162
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,150
to get perspective from those in the room.

163
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,880
So the first question you'll
hear and you'll see up there

164
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,180
is where is your organization
in the AI journey?

165
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,120
There's four options,
you can only vote once,

166
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,530
but would love to get your insight.

167
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,480
And we're gonna share the
results here in a minute

168
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,070
so everyone can see.

169
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,420
- I'm gonna keep it up
there just for a sec.

170
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,253
And then there's another one.

171
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,440
Where do you think most organizations

172
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,793
are in their AI journey?

173
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,450
And as you're doing this,
I just wanna mention,

174
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,770
several months ago when Chris

175
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,440
and I started planning
for this presentation,

176
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,660
we decided from the
beginning that we wanted this

177
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,120
to not just be cloud agnostic,

178
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,220
but to reflect the reality
of what our customers

179
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,740
are going through and
to include action items

180
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,780
that y'all can take as soon as possible.

181
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,450
And so that's why we
had these conversations,

182
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,600
to check our bias and
hopefully what we learned

183
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,510
and share with you today is helpful.

184
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,410
So let's see if this worked.

185
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,243
- All right, we're gonna see if it works.

186
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:51,990
Before I do, I'd love maybe your estimate

187
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,830
on the first question.

188
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,589
If you could go back, I know
people are taking pictures.

189
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:58,500
What do you think the
predominant answer is?

190
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,710
- I mean, originally before,
not to give the answer away,

191
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,790
not that there's a right answer,

192
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,390
I thought it would be
piloting specific use cases.

193
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,800
Did you think something different?

194
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,940
- I thought it was the same as well.

195
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,950
But we're gonna try the
toggle here the answers,

196
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,123
let's see if it works.

197
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,850
All right, almost 300 of you responded

198
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,610
and it is a little bit
leaning more on the lower end

199
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,940
of the piloting specific use
cases takes the majority there.

200
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,610
- I'm like smart group,
that's what I thought too.

201
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,350
- All right, you wanna go
back to the second question?

202
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,090
If anybody has an answer, feel free to-

203
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,823
- We're in there.
- Answer that.

204
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,140
- The fact that it's been smooth
is nice, the polls so far,

205
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,973
knock on wood.

206
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,570
- Did the second survey work for everyone?

207
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,770
Yes, it did, I see it now.

208
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,270
All right, it wasn't on there.

209
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,530
Little less participation,
maybe the two QR codes.

210
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,550
We only have one back to back.

211
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,000
So on this one, let's
look at the results here.

212
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
Where do you think most are?

213
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,220
And it's in the same wheelhouse,
similar vein in that same-

214
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,663
- Little bit more.
- Phase.

215
00:09:00,663 --> 00:09:02,163
A little bit skew to the left.

216
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,083
- All right.

217
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,473
- Perfect.

218
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:12,390
And is any good CFO,

219
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,220
you'll see throughout the
presentation, I love data,

220
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,200
data to help inform information.

221
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,810
So as you look at this chart,

222
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,360
and again we're
specifically focusing on AI

223
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,580
for finops here on the front
end, what do you all think?

224
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,133
Any guesses on what this
chart may represent?

225
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,703
- Or like anyone?

226
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,140
- How many orgs are doing AI finops.

227
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,140
That's a very good estimate,
good forecast there.

228
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,020
So as you look at it, of all
the companies we talked to,

229
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,010
only about 10% were at scale
of using AI for finops.

230
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:47,940
All the examples

231
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,920
that we're gonna talk
through in the use cases,

232
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,930
it's very early in the journey.

233
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,380
So the you're not alone
analogy you gave earlier,

234
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,910
I think that's where a
lot of customers are.

235
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,070
I know I meet with hundreds
of customers in a year

236
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,280
and a lot of them are looking
for use cases, proof points.

237
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,050
They want to see and understand

238
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,540
where do they actually
see value for AI's sake

239
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,240
versus maybe just having to
feel like you have to do AI

240
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,440
and everything, which is,

241
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,660
I know what a lot of customers feel.

242
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,130
So the first topic I'm gonna talk about

243
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,790
is when not to use AI
and specifically gen AI.

244
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,150
I think, I know there's a lot
of pressure in the ecosystem

245
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,070
of AI, AI everywhere,

246
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,350
but I think when we met with
customers it was very clear

247
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,620
as you think about finops,
there's a lot better solutions

248
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,020
and especially more cost effective
solutions on certain ways

249
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,170
of leveraging capability,
especially in forecasting.

250
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,343
I know many of you have
probably done forecasting

251
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:39,360
in your experience.

252
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,520
And there's better machine
learning capabilities,

253
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,680
other analytical capabilities
that you can balance.

254
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,780
So we thought it was
important to frame out.

255
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,730
One thing that popped in the conversations

256
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,540
is what are some of the use
cases of when not to use AI?

257
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,860
And as you look at this,

258
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,710
especially as you think
about the financial side,

259
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,320
the difference between
probabilistic with generative AI

260
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,240
and deterministic drives a big difference

261
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,640
in terms of what you can
use and when you can use it.

262
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,130
And this decision tree just
gives a little bit of an insight

263
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,140
of what you should use when you need it.

264
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,300
And we're gonna dive a
little bit more specifics

265
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,860
into what some of the customers shared

266
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,290
on this slide as well, the next one.

267
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,760
As you look at some of the capabilities

268
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,760
that are here that exist
in some of the use cases,

269
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,500
forecasting's obviously a great one.

270
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,010
I know I've spent some time
recently trying to leverage AI

271
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,040
on the generative AI side
to help predict patterns.

272
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,780
I think Agentech will
do a better job of this

273
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,740
than generative,

274
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,370
but I know a lot of great
services exist both within Amazon

275
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,100
and within partners that leverage
more traditional analytics

276
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,810
and do a really good job in that.

277
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,490
You also need to balance
as we'll go through,

278
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,310
there's a big balance we
have in putting this together

279
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,170
around what's the value expected

280
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,850
versus the cost that's informed.

281
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,160
So that framing is a
really important framing

282
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,240
as you go through this.

283
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,170
So we just wanted to make sure

284
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,820
and start out the conversation,

285
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,980
the answer for everything isn't AI,

286
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,990
there's different solutions
that can be applied to this

287
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,310
and it's something you
need to keep in mind

288
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,360
as you go through it.

289
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,670
- So the reality is, is
that there are challenges,

290
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,680
and these aren't all encompassing,

291
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,420
but what I wanna do is touch on a few

292
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,850
that made a repeat appearance.

293
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,580
So we've got the data
quality and preparation.

294
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,440
This came up in every single
one of our conversations.

295
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,270
This is the hard part,
not AI, not the tools.

296
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,730
And most customers are doing this,

297
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,170
but they're doing it retroactively,

298
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,053
which can be painful and expensive.

299
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,470
Then we've got multi-cloud.

300
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,930
Most of the organizations
are running multi-cloud.

301
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,920
And if you're doing that,

302
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,890
you've got different billing construct,

303
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,720
different terminology.

304
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,310
And in order for AI to be useful,

305
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,110
you have to normalize that
data into a common framework.

306
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,470
Then we have what I call the
trust gap, hallucinations,

307
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,480
AI reliability.

308
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,680
We had one leader mention to us

309
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,790
that their system recommended
a $12 million savings

310
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,863
by buying document DBRIs.

311
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,063
It sounds good, but those
don't exist currently.

312
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,890
AI has the ability to increase
productivity 10 plus X,

313
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,310
but if we're not careful,
it can make more work

314
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,060
or worse cause distrust for
our customers or our teams.

315
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,100
Skill shortage.

316
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,730
Most people aren't great
at writing prompts,

317
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,010
and this doesn't even begin
to touch on the technical gap

318
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,590
that compounds this challenge.

319
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,120
And then integration,

320
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,120
the people, the processes, the systems,

321
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,690
the operational friction
points that can add up

322
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,610
and demotivate people
from using the systems

323
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,010
that may actually help them.

324
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,500
So I'm sharing these to let you
know that they're universal,

325
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,480
not to discourage,

326
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,390
but let's see how leaders
are approaching it.

327
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,740
We had a lot of conversations,

328
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,250
but these are the four
main themes that came out.

329
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,743
Build the foundation, all about the data.

330
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,703
Buy proven solutions
focused on the tooling.

331
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,210
Enable with guardrails, the culture.

332
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,870
And then the process,
experimentation and iterating.

333
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,653
Let's dive in a little bit
deeper on what these look like.

334
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,740
So build the foundation, data first.

335
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,390
This is fundamental.

336
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,840
This is what I call table stakes.

337
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,200
No amount of AI can compensate
for a poor data foundation.

338
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,813
And you'll hear me say
that multiple times today.

339
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,050
Buy proven solutions.

340
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,400
There was a time when buy
versus build was a real debate,

341
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,500
but it seems that in AI for finops,

342
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,050
it's mostly resolved and it's buy.

343
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,050
The landscape is moving so fast.

344
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,760
One interesting thing
though we did find out

345
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,190
is that customers commitment timelines,

346
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,930
those are changing from annual
to quarterly or even monthly.

347
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,743
So the customers can keep up
with that fast paced change.

348
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,220
- The next one we saw as a trend

349
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,858
was around the culture, around enablement.

350
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:59,430
This notion of experimentation
and freedom to test

351
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,130
and have fun and and see how
you can guide within this.

352
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,920
So ensure there's guardrails that exist.

353
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,110
I know recently I was in Mexico City,

354
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,820
and I meet with a lot of banks

355
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,320
just given my banking background,

356
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,940
and they're obviously very worried

357
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,800
as most are around security and data,

358
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,690
especially their customer information.

359
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,520
They don't want that
being trained on LLMs.

360
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,590
They wanted to make sure
they retain that in-house.

361
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,560
And while they were building
the foundation of the elements

362
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,941
of building out LLMs to be
available for their workforce,

363
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:29,370
they had a lot of pride
of not having access

364
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,750
for their internal associates to LLMs.

365
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,100
And as they went through that, I was like,

366
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,760
oh, okay, have you set that
expectation for your workforce?

367
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,110
And they're like, oh
yeah, it's very clear.

368
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,730
And I literally walk out
of the conference room

369
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,170
and someone's on ChatGPT,

370
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,930
putting company information
into a public ChatGPT,

371
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,010
and I'm like cringing.

372
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,870
So you have to have
the guardrails in place

373
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,070
and the expectations.

374
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,140
That doesn't mean every associate
can do whatever they want.

375
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,760
You have to be clear
around those guardrails

376
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,670
and the culture that you
want to create within that.

377
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,650
And the last one is around learning first,

378
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,190
this notion of experimentation
and starting small.

379
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,610
We get a lot of questions I
know in in the job that we're in

380
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,140
around how do you get started?

381
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,590
How can you even begin to
experiment at using AI for finops?

382
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,870
And I think the whole
mantra we all have heard,

383
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,480
which is start small, think
big is a good mantra here.

384
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,480
I think I always try to focus
on a pain point in an area

385
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,970
where there's an
opportunity, varying ways,

386
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,980
and I'm sure you all
have heard many of these,

387
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,860
of how do you have promptathons
specifically locally

388
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,910
for people to learn about that.

389
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,980
How do you encourage peer-to-peer connects

390
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,290
with maybe someone who's more
advanced and less advanced?

391
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,270
How do you create the
environment and the time?

392
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,710
It's usually about time trade-offs

393
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,080
that come up with customers
of being able to learn

394
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,810
and experiment as a part of using this.

395
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,160
So the first case study,

396
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,960
we're gonna do three or four of these,

397
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,190
was actually in a large bank

398
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,100
and how they were driving
through their AI evolution.

399
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,710
And the challenge they were
having just like many of us

400
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,500
is you needed to have a
little bit of deeper knowledge

401
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,480
to be able to answer the
questions from the product owners

402
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,950
and the engineering community.

403
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,500
And some of the harder questions
took a little bit more time

404
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,050
and there was a very small
level of capacity of analysts

405
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,580
who can actually support this.

406
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,724
So they were looking at a way,
can AI really help build this

407
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:07,890
and solve this?

408
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,050
And they really focused first on one,

409
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,420
could they have a gen AI
kind of chat bot solution

410
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,780
on top of the data to
enable people to self-serve?

411
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,520
They knew they wouldn't
answer every question,

412
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,620
but they were hoping if
they could pair that data

413
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,430
along with historical analysis
they've done using RAG

414
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,710
as a way to bring that insight to bear.

415
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,600
And what they saw when
they started creating it,

416
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,340
it caught on like wildfire.

417
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,380
They had a 20 times increase in reach,

418
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,480
specifically around the
adoption of the tool.

419
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,850
They were able to enable
people to self-serve

420
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,810
as a part of it.

421
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,760
And it was a very small
level of investment

422
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,190
to build this out and be able to see this.

423
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,200
And the customer quote was,

424
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,120
this isn't about just
giving people more data,

425
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,190
it's trying to provide
answers and insights to them

426
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,023
to enable this.

427
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:49,530
So this is one of the use cases

428
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,600
that we saw from a customer interview

429
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,120
that we were really excited to
see it was being put to use,

430
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,270
especially for the
group that was in scale.

431
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,580
- So let's look at the value chain

432
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,290
and what it looks like in real life.

433
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,320
So it starts with the
raw data and metadata.

434
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,140
This is not just your
cost and usage reports.

435
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,350
This is context, business events,

436
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,840
seasonal patterns, org structure.

437
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,850
Then you've got your data
normalization and quality.

438
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,850
This is when you're
translating across clouds.

439
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,360
This is invisible to the
end user but critical.

440
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,340
Then you have AI processing and analysis.

441
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,450
This is when the machine learning

442
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,803
is actually doing the work.

443
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,520
Insights and human review.

444
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,850
Do you wanna be confident in
the decision or the action?

445
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,220
Because if you do, you wanna
get explainability in there

446
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,020
or human review.

447
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,480
If you've got a system
that says, Hey Catherine,

448
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,030
let's right size 500 instances.

449
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,980
Okay, why?

450
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,010
What's the risk if I do,
what's the risk if I don't?

451
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,080
Is confidence high, is it low?

452
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,270
If it's low, let's get a human in there.

453
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,380
If it's high, let's kick it over

454
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,900
to the developer's queue for approval.

455
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,120
Then you have automated
and semi-automated actions.

456
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,590
I say semi-automated

457
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,230
because even the most mature organizations

458
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,480
are keeping humans in the loop.

459
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,750
And then last, outcome,
measurement and learning.

460
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,430
Did the optimization work?

461
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,480
Did it save costs?

462
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,340
Was performance stable?

463
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,280
You wanna feed what you
learned back into the system

464
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,620
so AI gets smarter with time.

465
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,290
And you'll notice it's a
loop and not a straight line

466
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,800
because the actions
should train the system

467
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,673
and the outcomes should
continuously refine the model.

468
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,350
- So there were three
themes that popped out,

469
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,900
I'll go ahead and put 'em
all up, in the conversations,

470
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,230
and it's from most popular to
early stages of development

471
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,760
on the other side.

472
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,250
The no-brainers are the
conversational interfaces.

473
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,180
These are the use cases
probably you've seen grow

474
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,060
in the last year as gen
AI has been fully adopted.

475
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,550
How do I use our internal information

476
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,740
along with leveraging
a large language model

477
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,100
to enable capabilities
and reach that exists.

478
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,930
And there's a lot of good examples

479
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,480
of customer questions that exist there.

480
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,730
The middle is where things are evolving

481
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,610
and it's growing much faster,
which is how can I have,

482
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,830
either potentially an
agent work on my behalf

483
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,250
or escalate and elevate thing exceptions.

484
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,779
There's a lot of great
anomaly detection solutions.

485
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,240
AWS has them.

486
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,073
But this is a way

487
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:18,450
in which you can start
internally leveraging this

488
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,080
on other data sets just beyond
your cloud and usage data.

489
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,730
And then last is everyone's nirvana,

490
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,680
which is how can I automate some of this?

491
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,040
How can I enable
potentially Agentic agents

492
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,570
to do this on my behalf?

493
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,590
I know I've been a little close

494
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,480
to how this is evolving
both in the startup

495
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,550
and the large company ecosystem.

496
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,540
And it's coming quickly.

497
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,430
I think the pace of change is happening.

498
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,230
So this was an area we didn't see a lot of

499
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,610
in the customers we met with,

500
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,230
but there's a lot of
talks of the development

501
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,850
that they're doing as a part of this

502
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,020
and where they're beginning to focus.

503
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,250
So one SaaS company we met
with to do the next case study,

504
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,920
specifically was beginning
to narrow in on this.

505
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,680
And again, slightly
similar to the first one,

506
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,680
not a lot of people, but a
lot of demands on their team.

507
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,690
And I know many of you feel that same way.

508
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,840
And you'll see the last one,
engineers avoided finops.

509
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,360
I led a finops team and sort
of finops team for a long time

510
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,650
and it's a hard team to be on

511
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,810
because not that engineers
don't wanna do the right thing,

512
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,460
but there's a lot on engineers plates.

513
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,440
And when you're trying to
take their capacity away

514
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,200
from developing features
and asking them to optimize,

515
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,840
there has to be really good
incentive for them to do that

516
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,680
to focus on that.

517
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,140
So in this case that was
true for this SaaS company.

518
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,200
The engineers were trying
to avoid the finops team.

519
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,950
So as you think about the
solution that they built...

520
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:31,890
- Is it not coming through?
- It's not going for me,

521
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,790
but maybe for you.

522
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,710
- No, it was going too smoothly.

523
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,420
- Yeah, yeah, the survey I
thought would take us down,

524
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,310
so I didn't think the...

525
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,300
Lemme see there.

526
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,740
I'll just did page down that worked.

527
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,690
All right, the other big thing,

528
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,490
I know I talk to customers a lot,

529
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,290
is you don't want to create
a bunch of dashboards

530
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,880
and expect people to look at them.

531
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,220
You need to bring information
to where engineers work.

532
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,650
And I know for me in the past,

533
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,900
big areas where both GitHub and Slack,

534
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,280
those were areas where a lot of engineers

535
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,113
were spending time.

536
00:22:00,113 --> 00:22:01,680
So how do I bring financial data there?

537
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,420
And this SaaS company did the same.

538
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,800
They integrated with Slack

539
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,630
in terms of notification capabilities

540
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,360
and natural language queries
directly within Slack

541
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,520
that enabled them to
deliver this information.

542
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,040
And the results were incredible.

543
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,470
They had a hundred times
increase in the user community

544
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,960
of relative to what was
being reviewed before

545
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360
to what was then being
accessed and leveraged then.

546
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,040
They could monitor the conversations

547
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,510
and the questions look for key themes

548
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,270
and patterns of those questions,
and they'd elevate FAQs

549
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,347
and other things as a part of it.

550
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,390
And it was really
driving a cultural change

551
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,440
inside of the organization.

552
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,890
And the quote from the customer
as you read through it,

553
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,570
it's take data where engineers are.

554
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,980
That was the big takeaway for them,

555
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,150
which is that was the breakthrough

556
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,300
when they started to see the
change specifically there.

557
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,470
One question we get a lot,

558
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,900
and this is just to give a
timeline for the same company,

559
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,820
they started out in almost like a pilot

560
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,670
kind of agile sprint kind
of construct within this,

561
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,350
this is the timeline they leveraged

562
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,270
in terms of building out the capability.

563
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,850
They focused on 10
development teams as a start

564
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,990
to really work out the kinks

565
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,000
and then scaled it to over 500 users

566
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,140
inside of the organization.

567
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,380
So as you all I know are
experiencing the pace of change

568
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,690
with AI and LLMs is moving quickly,

569
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,940
it's also the true with how
people are leveraging it

570
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,950
inside the company and trying
to bring those mindsets

571
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,773
to kind of fail fast and
move quickly as a part of it.

572
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,460
So next up is another survey question.

573
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,833
So if you pull out your phone again,

574
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,070
would love to hear from you on this one,

575
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,560
which is what's preventing
faster AI adoption

576
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,540
in your finops practice?

577
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,210
There's four options, choose one.

578
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,360
But if you don't mind
sharing your insight,

579
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,560
we don't want to taint the audience-

580
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,490
- I know.
- But I know we talked

581
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,450
a little bit before about what-

582
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,650
- We did.

583
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,300
And I don't wanna give...

584
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,190
I thought it was gonna be one thing.

585
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,080
I was pretty confident.

586
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,320
And through these conversations
I learned I was wrong,

587
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,320
very wrong, but it was humbling to learn.

588
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,220
- Great, got some great results here.

589
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,570
Pull it up.

590
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,793
- There's only one more.
- One more survey.

591
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:03,110
All right.

592
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,320
And the results are, it's
pretty evenly distributed.

593
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,540
Expertise is probably the one-

594
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,070
- That's what I thought it was.

595
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,260
So I'm glad I'm a aligned
to the audience, you know.

596
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,320
Okay, let's see if this works.

597
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,490
Hold on, is mine working again?

598
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,660
It is.

599
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,670
So while we wrap the first section,

600
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,680
if you're gonna remember anything,

601
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,110
let it be these three things.

602
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,000
So data quality over everything.

603
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,550
No amount of AI can compensate

604
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,083
for that poor data foundation.

605
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,690
Trust, but verify, use AI to
do 80% of the heavy lifting

606
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,193
but keep humans in the loop.

607
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,550
And then problems not wishlists.

608
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,890
Focus on something that changes behavior

609
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,523
or saves time, money,
if it doesn't delay it.

610
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,900
All right, so now that we've
talked about how we use AI

611
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,500
to manage costs, let's talk
about managing the cost

612
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,140
of AI itself.

613
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,730
So I wanna start with a quote

614
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,020
from one of the leaders we spoke to

615
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,810
'cause I feel like it
frames up this topic nicely.

616
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:10,143
So I'm just gonna give a
minute for everyone to read.

617
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,040
So I like this for multiple reasons,

618
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,620
but I wanna call out two specific ones.

619
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,450
First it's something that I
mentioned at the beginning,

620
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,640
reminding us to not overcomplicate things.

621
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,840
And then the second thing,

622
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,200
which was our biggest
takeaway in our conversations

623
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,473
is that AI is not that different.

624
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,030
- And as you balance kind of
the notion of traditional cloud

625
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:48,630
and the AI workloads,
there's some differences.

626
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,160
And I know this comes up pretty actively

627
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,723
as we talk to customers,

628
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,840
some may laugh about
predictable patterns with cloud.

629
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,237
I know I get a lot of questions
of how do I forecast cloud,

630
00:25:56,237 --> 00:25:57,630
how do I expect it?

631
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,910
But relative to AI, it's much spikyier

632
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,350
in terms of consumption within AI

633
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,510
than it is within the cloud.

634
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,700
As you read through the rest,
there's a little bit more of,

635
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,140
I think it's just a
little bit more maturity

636
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,270
and knowledge on the
traditional cloud side.

637
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,850
And it's new on the AI side.

638
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,680
I do think you've called
out the one which was,

639
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,320
how do I make common
nomenclature across providers

640
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,153
that I'm leveraging?

641
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:20,040
That definitely has come up
in our customer conversations.

642
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,410
But I think the key is the
principles are the same.

643
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,080
And that was true in every
conversation we had, which is,

644
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,400
although there's different terms,

645
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,100
although there's a different
dynamic, it was clear

646
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,990
that we had the mechanisms in place

647
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,690
between how do we hold
leaders accountable,

648
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,400
how do we plan for these elements?

649
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,230
While it's a little bit different,

650
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,455
it was very similar in terms

651
00:26:39,455 --> 00:26:41,305
of the optimization structure itself.

652
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:44,670
And what better way than
the iceberg analogy.

653
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,828
- Yeah.

654
00:26:45,828 --> 00:26:47,310
And you you don't wanna
miss make the mistake

655
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,680
and only budget for what you can see.

656
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,820
You also wanna plan

657
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,880
and consider everything
below the waterline.

658
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,860
And it's the data preparation
that I've been mentioning,

659
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,263
integration, fine tuning, training.

660
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,880
- Yeah, and the hard thing
about the things on the bottom

661
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,760
is it's taking existing
capacity to do that.

662
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,470
So a lot of times customers are saying,

663
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,600
oh I can plan for the top
because I can point to it,

664
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,830
but if you look at the bottom,

665
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,410
it's around redirecting
your capacity of your teams

666
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,430
to do this work.

667
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,050
So that takes prioritization
and trade off,

668
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,520
which is not an easy thing to do.

669
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,890
And I know a lot of customers
are focusing on that.

670
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,720
So just make sure as you go through this,

671
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,280
you don't ignore that.

672
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,350
Just because it may be
viewed as a sunk cost

673
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,720
of capacity internally, it is capacity

674
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,130
that could be directed elsewhere.

675
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,420
So make sure you're considering that

676
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,793
as you go through the focus.

677
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,290
- And this is a high level
simplified checklist,

678
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,150
but we wanna run through it.

679
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:43,890
So budget for about 30 to
40% for data preparation.

680
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,770
Your finops team capacity,
if you're scaling AI,

681
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,740
you're probably gonna wanna
scale your finops team as well.

682
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,190
Budget and plan for governance,
integration, training,

683
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,030
about 20 to 30% for
experimentation and failure.

684
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,580
And then org change management.

685
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,920
But once you plan for all that, what next?

686
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,090
GPU capacity.

687
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,820
This is something we've all seen

688
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,090
or heard and/or experienced it.

689
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:17,070
And it is a big ticket
item, big light item,

690
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,843
and it's a big challenge to manage.

691
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,460
- So another case study we
did was with a global bank.

692
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,560
They had a pretty good
analysis and a framework

693
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,450
to leverage on making trade-offs

694
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,250
that were necessary around that GPU

695
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,570
we thought we'd share with you.

696
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,600
So the challenge is, as you
know, it's scarce capacity,

697
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,910
at least for in some instances.

698
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:39,030
And a lot of times, even when
you allocate that capacity,

699
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,950
it's unclear of how it's
actually being leveraged,

700
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,320
especially inside of the organization.

701
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,570
In this one, it was a highly
federated organization.

702
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,130
So every business had kind of freedom

703
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,810
and rights to do what they want.

704
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,120
They just allocated
capacity in the aggregate.

705
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,430
And once you do that,
you kind of lose insight

706
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,170
and visibility into how
it's being leveraged.

707
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,240
So they decided to build a framework

708
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,650
and an approach to help solve that.

709
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,750
So this got very detailed,

710
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,830
I know when we were reviewing with them,

711
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,520
they had 19 unique GPU metrics
that they were looking at

712
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,680
around utilization and
the specifics of that.

713
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,510
They were trying to aggregate those

714
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,330
to understand where the
patterns and utilization was.

715
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,480
But the big element was
how do we give visibility

716
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,070
around the usage patterns

717
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,350
and elevate where that was being done

718
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,460
to make sure it was delivering

719
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,440
the most value to the organization.

720
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,560
And they had a really good
two by two, which I loved,

721
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,240
so I wanted to share with you as well.

722
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,280
And there's nothing better
than a good two by two

723
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,300
to frame a conversation.

724
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,510
But if you look at the bottom,
it's usage on the Y axis,

725
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,940
it's criticality, and
there's some no-brainers,

726
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,020
especially on the bottom left,

727
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,240
if it's low utilization of a GPU

728
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,850
and it's providing low
criticality to the business,

729
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,550
get rid of it, redirect
that capacity elsewhere.

730
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:48,600
The top right, it's all about
high value, high criticality.

731
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,370
There could be ways to optimize that.

732
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,920
But I think thinking of
what are the use cases

733
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,850
in your company?

734
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,810
How are you leveraging

735
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,300
this kind of scarce capacity that exists?

736
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,500
And is there some framing

737
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,990
or approach you can put in
place to ensure that you

738
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,970
and your leaders are making
the best decision possible

739
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,933
for your customers.

740
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,580
- So now that we plan for the budget,

741
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,040
let's talk about recognizing ROI.

742
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,023
Get out your phones one last time.

743
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,143
What's preventing you from
measuring your AI ROI today?

744
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,400
This is another one

745
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,910
that I felt like we had differing
point points of view on.

746
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,333
But I'll be curious what the results are.

747
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,380
- The response rate has
dwindled every single question.

748
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,910
- Ouch.

749
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,860
- That's one observation.

750
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,114
- We won't read too much into it.

751
00:30:48,114 --> 00:30:48,947
- Yeah, yeah, we won't read much into it.

752
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,180
Done with the surveys.

753
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,813
All right, now we're back
even over the last question.

754
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,123
Great, and the results are,

755
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,520
scattered costs and no metrics is one,

756
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,260
no metrics number one and two.

757
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,923
But again, fairly evenly
distributed as well there.

758
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,250
Perfect, so I'm gonna dive deep into this

759
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,873
because I know for me,

760
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,470
I feel like I've spent my
career creating business cases,

761
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,120
and I know if any of you have done that,

762
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,950
it's pretty easy to
create a business case.

763
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,580
It is very hard to track it
after you are going live.

764
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,560
It's a mix master of information.

765
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,540
But I think from a framework standpoint,

766
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,680
the nice thing about a kind
of a traditional ROI analysis

767
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,800
on the front end is
there's cost investments

768
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,670
that are necessary,

769
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,710
there's expected benefits
as you go through 'em,

770
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,470
you can tie things back
pretty easily to a cause

771
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,110
and effect for most things,
not everything but most things.

772
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,360
And I think once you
introduce AI into the mix,

773
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,680
things change a little bit

774
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,800
'cause there's a lot of
second and third order impacts

775
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,660
as you go through this.

776
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,910
And I think there was a good example here,

777
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,823
which is an externally facing chat bot.

778
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,300
And I'm not sure many of you probably have

779
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,858
your own experiences
with certain providers

780
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:08,490
and consumer experiences,

781
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,230
when they may be added capability

782
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,150
and you can start getting answers quickly,

783
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,740
you feel like it's better service,

784
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,440
things are improving, that's
awesome, that's really good.

785
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,700
Brand perception's improving,

786
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,500
customer satisfaction's improving.

787
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,197
But as you think back internally,
I meet with a lot of CFOs,

788
00:32:22,197 --> 00:32:25,950
one CFO said to me, I
need numbers, not stories.

789
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,020
This isn't about feel good around this.

790
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,300
I want to know how that
translates to either the P and L

791
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,430
or to performance and
metrics that are there.

792
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,260
So I get a lot of questions specifically

793
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,487
around how to measure this.

794
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:36,990
And I think there's a couple of things

795
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,303
that come as challenges.

796
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,940
One, we mentioned the iceberg,

797
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,920
which is the denominator effect.

798
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,140
There tends to be a lot more cost

799
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,030
that's involved than
you're actually quantifying

800
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,530
as you go through some of this.

801
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,650
On the numerator side, I know
most organizations struggle

802
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,660
with value articulation,

803
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,780
and that can range from
being a private enterprise

804
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,910
where you're for profit,

805
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,220
to a government entity
where it's mission driven.

806
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,040
It's a totally different
conversation of value creation.

807
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,000
And then the last one is,

808
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,170
it's kind of a moving target

809
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,880
in terms of timeline and expectation.

810
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,480
So these are the three
patterns that came up

811
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,190
and have come up in customer conversation.

812
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:17,460
The first one is the productivity paradox.

813
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,320
All of us have experienced this.

814
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,490
When you've leveraged AI

815
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,590
to do something in an everyday task,

816
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,210
it can provide a great experience

817
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,340
and it can do things better
and faster, which is awesome,

818
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,180
that's great.

819
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,670
But, and the example here
is on the queue developer,

820
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,340
just 'cause you can code
faster, what does that mean?

821
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,300
Does that mean better quality?

822
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,410
Does that mean more features?

823
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,880
What does that actually translate to

824
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,410
in terms of customer value?

825
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,840
That's one of the challenges
that customers have.

826
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,240
The second is a baseline absence.

827
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,170
I know I always love to ask
the question to IT leaders,

828
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,040
do you track time?

829
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,600
And I know that's a
thorn in everyone's side

830
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,500
in terms of time tracking,

831
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,120
like I don't need
somebody looking after me

832
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,170
and what's going on.

833
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,180
But baseline creation is really important

834
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,020
as you go into this.

835
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,810
I spend also a lot of time
on total cost of ownership

836
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,460
of cloud or of IT cost.

837
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,570
If you don't know where you're starting,

838
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,480
it's very hard to know what's
changed and how it's evolved.

839
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,950
And as you think about this,

840
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,240
there's a lot of activities we do

841
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,350
that you just don't measure

842
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,290
and it almost doesn't make
sense to measure in this regard.

843
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,330
But that's where some of
the challenges are coming.

844
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,130
What was it before, what is it after

845
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,420
and what do I do with it?

846
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,370
And then lastly is the diffusion of value

847
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,590
that was one of the items
that was called out there,

848
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,800
which is there's almost this
downstream impact of things

849
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,080
that can be unearthed
as you go through this.

850
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,640
But how do you quantify
some of these items?

851
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,090
We've always had struggle, I
know on the qualitative side

852
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,480
of if you're more secure,
how do you translate that

853
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,340
to an articulation of value?

854
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,510
You could say we're more secure,

855
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,980
but what does that actually translate to

856
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,840
in terms of performance?

857
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,670
Obviously a lot of this is reputation risk

858
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,260
and a little things that are softer

859
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,640
'cause they are mitigating events,

860
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,200
but those are the things that come up

861
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,030
as a challenge that's there.

862
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,410
So there's a couple of things

863
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,120
I've seen some patterns of what's working

864
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,710
and what's not working.

865
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,470
A lot of times people say if
you save time, you save money.

866
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,640
And I know for many one of us,

867
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,290
we've probably gotten more
productive in the last year

868
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,520
and a half in certain ways.

869
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,950
Some ways maybe not as
much, but some ways we have.

870
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,170
That doesn't mean you don't need us,

871
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,450
it's still resources that are necessary.

872
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,760
So just because you
save time in the stories

873
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,350
of I saved 1000 hours,

874
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,540
most I know financially minded
people are gonna be like,

875
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,920
that's 1000 hours, that's a lot of money.

876
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,940
Where's that going?

877
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,170
Where's that being redirected to?

878
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,660
So a lot of this is resource reallocation

879
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,100
that exists in companies.

880
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,350
The second is around revenue attribution.

881
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,390
When you roll out a
capability or a service,

882
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,880
I know I work with a lot
of ISV and SaaS companies

883
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,440
that are looking to build AI

884
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,090
into a lot of their solutions now.

885
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,680
So they're thinking
about how do I price it?

886
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,610
How do I assess this?

887
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,740
What's the value that's
expected through this?

888
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,330
So just because you add that,

889
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,633
it's very hard attribute revenue
only to that in isolation.

890
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,620
The third is around cost
avoidance, the age old, which is,

891
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,770
if I didn't have this, I
would've had to hire these people

892
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,280
or I would've had to do this.

893
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,770
While that's a good
storyline in aggregate,

894
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,780
sometimes it can feel like phantom money

895
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,880
when you talk about it,
but it's a real thing.

896
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,860
So I think it's important
as you go through this,

897
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,860
I've used this wisely as you
specifically go through it.

898
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,990
And lastly is around efficiency metrics.

899
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,960
I'm a big believer in metrics and ratios,

900
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,250
but as you go through this,

901
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,100
be careful of the cumulative
effect of all the ratios

902
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,080
'cause if you add up all
these ratios together,

903
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,120
it seems like you don't
need a team or a resource

904
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,140
or something else that's there.

905
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,640
So if that's true, that's great,

906
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,590
but if it's not, be really
mindful of the words you use

907
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,390
and the metrics you use
as you go through it.

908
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,190
So there's three patterns I've seen

909
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,990
to be successful for companies

910
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,090
as they think about value articulation.

911
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,340
One is something called
kind of a value driver,

912
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,960
think of like a value tree,

913
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,560
which is there's primary
measurable items, lower cost,

914
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,360
less losses, more revenue.

915
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,520
That's very clear, that's
a traditional measure.

916
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,320
But the secondary areas

917
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,660
you need to make sure
you're articulating as well.

918
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,220
You may not have numbers
behind all of them,

919
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,410
but you need to have the the
qualitative assessment of that

920
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,053
and not ignore that as
you're talking about returns.

921
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,280
The second around outcome based
metrics, this is something

922
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,200
that came up at a lot of
the conversations we had,

923
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,480
which is how do I think
about what the outcomes

924
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,330
of these activities are so
that we are measuring that.

925
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,610
Sometimes that in
isolation won't tell you,

926
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,520
but this in concert with
the one on the value tree

927
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,870
will definitely help.

928
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,550
But the one that's
probably resonated the most

929
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,170
is this portfolio approach,

930
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,750
which is thinking like a VC firm.

931
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,950
And as you know with a VC firm,

932
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,090
they make a lot of investments.

933
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,370
I know there's always
the soundbite out there,

934
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,050
nine outta 10 businesses fail.

935
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,640
So that means you need
to start 10 businesses

936
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,320
'cause one will be successful.

937
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,610
It's the same construct here,

938
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,290
not that nine will fail with AI,

939
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,350
but it is an element of you
do need multiple avenues

940
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,090
and things stokes in the fire,

941
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,932
'cause some will work out
and some won't work out.

942
00:37:29,932 --> 00:37:32,850
I was at an event two
weeks ago in New York

943
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,440
around AI and finance,

944
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,690
and someone speaking gave an example

945
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:40,290
of where is the value coming
from a lot of the AI projects?

946
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,470
And as you think about it,
it's usually the more obscure,

947
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,570
far reaching elements, not the basics

948
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,980
that are delivering the most value.

949
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,270
So you need to have a wide spectrum

950
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,890
of areas you're investing in this space

951
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,993
as you're going through it in that regard.

952
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,280
- To summarize this section,

953
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,673
if you're gonna remember
anything, let it be these things.

954
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,900
So traditional cloud
cost planning for that,

955
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,760
we'll leave you three to five X short.

956
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,803
So plan for that from the beginning.

957
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,720
You can't control when or
if AI features get adopted,

958
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,860
so instead focus on cost per
user, cost per transaction

959
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,860
or focus on optimizing model
selection or token efficiency.

960
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,330
And then don't let the fact

961
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,970
that you can't measure ROI value stop you

962
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,830
from investing in AI.

963
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,420
Think outside the box.

964
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,770
Think of those proxy metrics,
time reduced, errors reduced,

965
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,883
things that nature.

966
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,940
So now let's talk about
building the strategy,

967
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,040
putting it into action.

968
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,843
I'm gonna start with AI for finops.

969
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,110
So this follows the crawl,

970
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,570
walk, run for anyone who's familiar

971
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,220
with the finops foundation.

972
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,740
So we've got phase one,
it's the base camp,

973
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,720
it's your foundation.

974
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,730
This is when you're building the basics.

975
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,800
You're tagging, your data quality.

976
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,930
What does success look like here?

977
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:03,740
This is when your team
can ask simple questions

978
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,783
in natural language and
get an accurate answer.

979
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,600
Then you have the climb, the enablement.

980
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,910
This is when you're scaling intelligence.

981
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,100
This is when you have more
conversational interfaces

982
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,150
for more teams

983
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,490
and you've got those
auto-generated recommendations

984
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,380
that are actually useful.

985
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,450
Success here is your finops teams

986
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,370
are no longer pulling
reports, but they're doing

987
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:26,883
that strategic proactive optimization.

988
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,360
And in the summit, automation.

989
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,190
This is a mature state.

990
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,800
This is self-healing optimization.

991
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,130
This is when you've got
predictive controls in place

992
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,820
that are preventing waste proactively.

993
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,870
Success here

994
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:45,600
is you've got those
auto-generated recommendations

995
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,000
with autonomous execution.

996
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,170
And those cost surprises

997
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,320
are starting to become
a thing of the past.

998
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:57,210
I'm not gonna spend a
ton of time on this slide

999
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,860
because we don't have a ton of time.

1000
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,810
We've got a pretty good amount of time.

1001
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:04,260
Before I hand it over to
Chris, I just wanna mention,

1002
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,610
you don't have to be at
the summit to get value.

1003
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:12,180
We spoke with a lot of companies
who are recognizing ROI

1004
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,930
at base camp, and if base
camp is where you are,

1005
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,400
you're where you need to be,

1006
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,150
you're where most of the market is.

1007
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,260
- Yep, and as we think a very
similar construct on the path

1008
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,293
for finops for AI, as you
think about the base camp,

1009
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,860
a lot of this is around visibility.

1010
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,530
I know a lot of organizations
are yearning for insight

1011
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,960
to how are we leveraging AI,

1012
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,610
how much are we investing in it?

1013
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,500
Where are the ways we're investing in it?

1014
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,990
It sounds very similar to what
we just talked about before.

1015
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,210
You need to have the
right level of perspective

1016
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,930
and inside of who's consuming
it inside of the organization.

1017
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,040
On the optimization,

1018
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,470
it's obviously all about model selection

1019
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,460
and a lot of choice.

1020
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,160
I know there's a lot of evolution
moving from large language

1021
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,680
to more targeted small language
models that are targeted.

1022
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,460
There's kind of three legs
of the stool around speed,

1023
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,120
accuracy, and cost as you
think about those three legs.

1024
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,800
And not every use case is the same.

1025
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,540
And there's a lot of levers you can pull

1026
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,660
to drive optimization
as you go through this.

1027
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,030
And then lastly on the summit is,

1028
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:18,450
it's around that embedded
governance, predictive elements

1029
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,980
and being able to plan capacity,

1030
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,253
especially on the GPU side in
the right and effective way.

1031
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,880
We did include a bunch
of the details as well.

1032
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,980
And I'll pull those up as you have them,

1033
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,110
as you see them there.

1034
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,960
And it's a evolution you would expect

1035
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,980
as you go through this,

1036
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,190
which is what are the
right metrics to look at

1037
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,360
to assess this?

1038
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,880
How do I then evolve the
right accountability model

1039
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,220
and link this to business outcomes?

1040
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,370
And then ultimately, how do
you have preventative planning

1041
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,110
and levers as you go through it?

1042
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,470
There's a lot of levers that
exist to drive automation,

1043
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,030
I mean cost efficiency of using AI

1044
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,400
and there's a lot of
options that exist there.

1045
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,230
So taking advantage of those options

1046
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,430
is an important element
as we go through it.

1047
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:09,510
- Okay, we're in the final
stretch, so we're gonna do tips,

1048
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,400
then we're gonna do
educational recommendations

1049
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,073
and then advice from
leaders and that'll wrap it.

1050
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,780
So if you're gonna remember
anything from today,

1051
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,343
it's these five things.

1052
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,820
You're not alone, 90% of organizations

1053
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,623
are still in the early phases.

1054
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,550
I know I'm a broken record with this,

1055
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:34,550
but data quality beats AI
sophistication, always.

1056
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,560
No amount of AI magic is gonna compensate

1057
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,583
for that poor data.

1058
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,140
Human judgment still matters.

1059
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,013
Use AI to accelerate, humans to validate.

1060
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,030
Solve for real problems.

1061
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,890
Don't deploy AI because it's cool

1062
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:54,720
or because everybody else is doing it,

1063
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,490
I know you mentioned it at the beginning.

1064
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,860
Deploy it because it solves a painful,

1065
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,933
expensive or repetitive problem.

1066
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,320
And then as I mentioned at the beginning,

1067
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,120
never stop learning.

1068
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,070
And on that topic, from
the leaders we spoke to,

1069
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:14,610
we started to just gather
people that they follow,

1070
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,530
podcasts that they listen to.

1071
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,200
We even got a query, this is
from an individual on my team,

1072
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,160
Adam Richter, that he
does almost every day

1073
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,930
just to kind of stay up with
everything going on in AI.

1074
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,840
So take a look at these follow.

1075
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,220
- I'll call out one of my favorites.

1076
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,330
There's a lot of greats one up there.

1077
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:36,030
But the AI Daily Brief, if
anybody doesn't listen to that,

1078
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,830
they do a really good job as a podcast

1079
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,080
to highlight the five minutes of insight

1080
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,450
that you need to learn of
what's happening in AI that day.

1081
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,160
Then they go into a deeper dive element.

1082
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,080
So I know time is sensitive for everyone.

1083
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,520
So if you could devote five minutes,

1084
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,670
the AI Daily Brief under
listen is a must listen to

1085
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,530
from my vantage point if
you wanna stay informed

1086
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,840
of what's evolving and
happening out there.

1087
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,673
- Awesome.

1088
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,740
- Great.

1089
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,530
So we'll wrap with some
advice that we heard,

1090
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,850
and these are direct quotes from leaders

1091
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,590
that we met with as a part of it

1092
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:05,700
and a part of the conversation.

1093
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,700
So the first one is around the data side.

1094
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,310
And the quote was, we thought
we could kind of skip this

1095
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:15,270
and just go right to it.

1096
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:16,290
I know I get a lot of structured,

1097
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:18,030
unstructured data questions.

1098
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,290
How do I leverage this?

1099
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:22,350
I know the gold inside of
companies is their own data.

1100
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,120
It's not just the large language model.

1101
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,560
It's pairing that with the insights

1102
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,660
and the information you
have in your organization,

1103
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,250
and spending time and integrating
those two together is key.

1104
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,090
The second is around humans in the loop.

1105
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,700
Make sure there's good fact
checking, good frameworks.

1106
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,090
I loved the loop you had,
specifically around the process

1107
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:43,890
that you can integrate on top of it.

1108
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,240
Third is it's all about painful problems

1109
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,620
and repetitive problems.

1110
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,540
Don't just assume a
dashboard solves issues.

1111
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,770
You need to make sure it's integrated

1112
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:53,790
and being shared in a way

1113
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,180
that's actually solving
customer's problems.

1114
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,380
The whole buy versus build.

1115
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,690
I know there's kind of a hybrid answer

1116
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,820
which is you're likely gonna buy an LLM.

1117
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,620
Some companies here,
many large enterprises

1118
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,850
may build a lot of their own.

1119
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,920
Most are buying, but it's integrating that

1120
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,240
with your own data is the key,

1121
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,770
and that's where you can
have an in-house solution

1122
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,120
to integrate that together.

1123
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,800
And this is all about experimentation

1124
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,810
and taking time to do that.

1125
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,810
And then lastly is while
the words are different,

1126
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:21,303
don't overthink it, finops basics exists.

1127
00:45:22,902 --> 00:45:24,480
I don't know what your viewpoint is,

1128
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,820
but I would say finops has matured a lot

1129
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,710
over the last several
years, but I still meet

1130
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,790
with a ton of customers

1131
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,460
that haven't gotten started
yet in this regard as well.

1132
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,380
So I think learning the basics here,

1133
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,640
you're at a really good time,

1134
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,980
especially if you're
maybe in the early stages,

1135
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,260
to be able to leapfrog
and mature your practices

1136
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,830
and finops by using some of
the AI capabilities that exist.

1137
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,740
And just to bring home the summit analogy

1138
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,630
or reading through this, the
base camp's where you prepare,

1139
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:49,767
the climb is where you grow

1140
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:51,600
and the summit's where you see the view,

1141
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,490
but you can't do it standing still.

1142
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,110
So it's an element of really important

1143
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:57,030
to get started in this regard.

1144
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,410
Obviously AWS can help you.

1145
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,390
There's great partners out
there that can help you.

1146
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,070
So if you're interested, I
definitely would reach out

1147
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:04,860
to your account team to engage on this,

1148
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,860
to learn more and to hear more about it.

1149
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,750
- And then I just wanna wrap.

1150
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,580
I was talking about my
son at the beginning.

1151
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,660
And I share this

1152
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,440
because this is from like
two, three weeks ago now.

1153
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,000
And I share it because he's
thriving in my humble opinion.

1154
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,300
And I don't think we could
have gotten him to this state

1155
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,400
without the subject matter experts,

1156
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,770
the community that have really helped us.

1157
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:30,780
And we want to be that for you.

1158
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,090
And as Chris mentioned, reach
out to the account teams,

1159
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,623
engage us, let us help you.

1160
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,210
And then of course this is
our QR codes for our LinkedIn

1161
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,380
if you wanna connect.

1162
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,140
We will also stay outside
for any questions after.

1163
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,330
And then please, please do the survey.

1164
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:48,510
Feedback is a gift and we
wanna continuously get better.

1165
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:53,070
So with that being said, happy re:Invent.

1166
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,295
Thank you.

1167
00:46:54,295 --> 00:46:55,876
(audience applauding)
