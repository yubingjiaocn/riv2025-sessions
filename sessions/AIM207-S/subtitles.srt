1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,270
- Hi, how's everybody doing?

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,850
Exciting. Exciting to be here.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,800
So, this is very ambitious.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,140
Over the next 20 minutes,
this is a lightning talk.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,940
Over the next 20 minutes,

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,410
we're gonna cover roughly a
half century of computing,

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,210
but we'll try to go as fast as possible.

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,220
So, we'll start off and we're
gonna try to end with AI.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,750
So, we'll start and end with AI.

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,910
So, first of all, show of hands,

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,830
anybody recognize any of these logos up

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,540
on the screen right now?

13
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,650
Show of hands, anybody?

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,960
Okay, I mean, this is a
definitely a SaaS conference,

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,220
so I would imagine so.

16
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,250
These are products that have represented

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,100
the best of what SaaS has offered us over

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,110
the last 15, 20 years.

19
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,110
And obviously this is how we
went from spreadsheets sitting

20
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,590
on our local computers to software

21
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,860
that could run in the cloud,
cloud native with the scale,

22
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,030
the safety, the speed of
cloud behind us, right?

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,090
To give us auditability, transparency,

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,280
scalability, security.

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,810
And that's been a great journey.

26
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,303
And what I call that,
I call that SaaS 1.0,

27
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,660
but there's a flip side of it,

28
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,440
and the flip side is that we
have now gotten to a place

29
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,200
where all of these disparate tools

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,370
have created their own
rigid schemas that define

31
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,040
at the department level
what good looks like.

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,010
So, they have these schemas,
whether it's an opportunity,

33
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,830
whether it's a ticket,
whether it's an incident,

34
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,560
perhaps it's an event or a case.

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,020
Each of these respective department tools

36
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,990
have created their own
terminology, their own glossary.

37
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,840
And that glossary comes to really define

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,440
how we use these products
and how we do our daily jobs.

39
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,090
And there's something about that

40
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,480
that actually gives us an
opportunity to think further

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,270
to say, "How would AI revisit this?"

42
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,490
If we were to look at
where we go from here,

43
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,200
from SaaS 1.0 to SaaS 2.0,
what would it look like?

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,240
And so, again, as I promised,

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,310
I wanna start stepping
back and saying, well,

46
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,760
how have the greats over
the generations of computing

47
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,050
that we've come to see,

48
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,400
how have they tackled this problem?

49
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,690
So, a couple of logos up there,

50
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,580
obviously you probably recognize them.

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,030
What have they done so incredibly well?

52
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,830
Well, first thing what they did

53
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,390
was they catered to the builders.

54
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,330
They created the right
separation of concerns

55
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,120
so that there were a lot of problems

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,440
that could be solved at
scale so that developers

57
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,640
and great minds,

58
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,210
entrepreneurs could do great
things on top of the platform

59
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,200
that was built.

60
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,033
And this was great,

61
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:38,460
because if you remember before
the cloud really came to be,

62
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,110
there were a lot of people
that were reading books

63
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,310
about client server
architectures and JSON and APIs

64
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,270
and saying, "You know what?

65
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,490
I can do that. I can do that at home.

66
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,990
I can do that at the workplace,

67
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,400
and I'm gonna start setting that up."

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,860
You set up a Linux server,
before you know it,

69
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,043
you've got an IT closet
full of servers and racks,

70
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,980
and it's serving real use cases.

71
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,841
Maybe you're handling transactions online,

72
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,150
but at some point you realize

73
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,800
that you gotta do security patches

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,080
and you gotta do security updates,

75
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,490
and you've gotta do deployments

76
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,020
and you gotta have zero downtime

77
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,550
and you gotta make sure
that the hard drives

78
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,500
are still working, and
this became a problem.

79
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,420
And that's where a lot
of these tools started

80
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,253
to come together,

81
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:18,240
and they started to create
the right abstractions for us

82
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,860
to do a great job.

83
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,870
And so, it's similar
to what we're starting

84
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,280
to see here as well.

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,560
What we're seeing is the
fact that everything starts

86
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,170
to look really easy to begin with, okay?

87
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,730
So, I wanna start off by saying, look,

88
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,280
I got this LLM at my disposal,

89
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,400
and this LLM is obviously
exceedingly easy to use,

90
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,190
conversationally, and it can
do some really great things.

91
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,510
It can classify, cluster,
prioritize, summarize, synthesize,

92
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,890
it can do all of these things,

93
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,920
and I can put this to work
to solve real problems.

94
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,100
I can solve real problems
towards specific conversations,

95
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,610
specific tickets, and down
the list, and I can do this.

96
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,020
But what happens is you can start

97
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,580
to increasingly get to a place

98
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,550
where you get back to that
really messy IT closet.

99
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,680
And we've started to see
this in the market now.

100
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,090
You're starting to see situations,

101
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,490
you got headlines like this,
I don't know, show of hands,

102
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,880
people who actually saw the
story, maybe heard of the story,

103
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,680
companies that went out
and said, "You know what?

104
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,360
We're gonna stop using humans
to do problem A, problem B,

105
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,610
problem C, we've got this covered.

106
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,590
We're gonna do it using agents.

107
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,490
It's that simple."

108
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,410
But it wasn't really that simple, was it?

109
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,990
And it's six months later,
it's a new headline,

110
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,790
same company, new headline.

111
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,340
No, actually, we're gonna
need those humans again.

112
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,200
And so, a little bit of
this has been happening,

113
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,630
and why is that?

114
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,910
And it's because we have to
really start to understand

115
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,530
what are the right abstractions

116
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,960
and where are the areas of opportunity

117
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,000
and what are those separation of concerns?

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,100
And of course, as we figure that out,

119
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,670
we're starting to see headlines
like this where MIT reports,

120
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,260
and I know many of you
have probably seen this

121
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,360
on your LinkedIn feeds and so on,

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,560
where we talk about 95%
of these pilots failing.

123
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,880
What does that really mean?

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,370
And I think what it
means, among other things,

125
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,730
is the fact that you not only
need a frontier model layer,

126
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,310
but you need to really
think about the data layer.

127
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,750
You need to think about how
the data becomes accessible

128
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,040
and in whose hands?

129
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,200
So, access provisioning makes sense.

130
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,180
You have to start to
think about replication.

131
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,520
You have to start to think
about data sanitization,

132
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,320
and that's just the data layer.

133
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,800
You gotta think on top of
that about provisioning,

134
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,750
auditability, agents and
workflows, repeatability.

135
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,330
You have to start to think
about end to end use cases.

136
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,950
How do you serve real use cases

137
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,820
and customer success,
customer support, field sales,

138
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,920
development productivity,
project management?

139
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,060
These are real problems.

140
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,370
And until and unless you are willing

141
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,860
to not just think about the data layer

142
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,900
and build a prototype on top of it,

143
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,600
when you get ready to actually
look at the data layer

144
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,050
and the operational layer
and the application layer,

145
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,970
that's when you're ready for production.

146
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,110
And so, it's a journey.

147
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,587
So, we have to think about that and say,

148
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:57,930
"Well, where are we headed?"

149
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,690
The reality is there's
such tremendous momentum

150
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,220
because people believe

151
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,740
that there's a huge
opportunity here with AI,

152
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,740
particularly agentic AI,
particularly conversational AI.

153
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,750
And so, money's already being spent.

154
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,610
I'm sure some of you go
back to your workplace

155
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,587
and you see your leadership asking you,

156
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,560
"How are you taking advantage of AI?"

157
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,200
And money's being spent, holdbacks,

158
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,420
budget being shifted from headcount,

159
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,410
perhaps over to making
decisions around buying tools

160
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,827
or AI products and saying,

161
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:31,683
"how are we becoming more productive?

162
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:36,000
How are we reducing customer
effort or employee effort?

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,100
How are we improving
customer satisfaction?"

164
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,200
These are real questions
that are being asked,

165
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,810
and we have to figure
out how we get to answers

166
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,450
that really help us in the long term.

167
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,877
And so, I'm gonna take us
further back from cloud and say,

168
00:06:48,877 --> 00:06:51,690
"Well, how did we get
started with computers

169
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,400
five decades ago, six decades ago

170
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,450
when we had those behemoths
sitting in our workspaces,

171
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,670
workstations, mainframes?

172
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,740
How did we get to where we are today?"

173
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,830
And the reality is we started
off, it was expensive,

174
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,440
it was onerous, and it wasn't
really easy to figure out

175
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,050
how this all makes sense,
but we figured it out.

176
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,680
We decided that to go
big, we had to go small.

177
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,250
We had to create an operational
system, an operating system,

178
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,360
and we had to start to figure out

179
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,450
how to build more programs on
top of it, build work groups,

180
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,250
and make things shareable,

181
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,770
and make things more use case-driven

182
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,540
and create a user experience.

183
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,393
And so, that was our ticket
to the kind of expansion

184
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:33,030
that we saw in the decades to follow.

185
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,687
So, if we start to think
about that and say,

186
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,030
"Well, what does that teach us?"

187
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,540
What it teaches us is that if
we build the right paradigm,

188
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,700
you can have tremendous purpose

189
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,710
by thinking about the hardest problems

190
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,420
by building on top of those paradigms.

191
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,530
And that's what we've done.

192
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,660
We got more productive, more efficient,

193
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,340
we got more creative.

194
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,740
And that's the huge
opportunity that's existed,

195
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,930
not just when the mainframes came

196
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,730
to becoming more workstations for us,

197
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,280
but then when the desktop
came out, when cloud came out,

198
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,780
and again here with AI,

199
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,820
that's the same opportunity that we have.

200
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,970
It's an opportunity for us to
define the operating system

201
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,480
and then to figure out how
we use and develop that

202
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,050
to become more productive,
efficient, and more creative.

203
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,130
And so, how do we bring
that computer mindset to AI?

204
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,550
How do we bring an operating
system to the forefront here?

205
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,177
So, let's just think about it and say,

206
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:23,550
"What would it look like?

207
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,650
What would the dream computer look like?"

208
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,210
The dream computer would be able

209
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,280
to take all your critical data

210
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,500
and all your critical integrations

211
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,350
and bring them to your
most important surfaces.

212
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,930
That would be the
computer that you'd want.

213
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,290
It would be a computer that
did not create false boundaries

214
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,860
between your opportunities
and your incidents,

215
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,750
or your tasks and your sessions,

216
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,780
or your issues and your
cases and your events.

217
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,210
It would really understand
and respect all of it,

218
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,140
and it wouldn't think

219
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,090
that any of this information was foreign.

220
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,070
It's all part of your business.

221
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,600
These are all departments that are serving

222
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,950
the same customer.

223
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,530
They're working towards building
the same set of products.

224
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,230
Am I right? So, that's where we wanna go.

225
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,640
And so, how do we get there?

226
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,150
Well, what we've thought
about is to create a product

227
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,430
that does just that, and we
actually call it a Computer.

228
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,650
It's called Computer, Computer by DevRev.

229
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,390
And so, it's exactly that.

230
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,280
It brings your most critical data,

231
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,660
your most critical integrations

232
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,240
to all your most important surfaces,

233
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,680
whether that's at the
workstation, on the desktop,

234
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,690
in a customer help support center,

235
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,560
in a portal, on your website,
perhaps on the mobile device,

236
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,820
wherever you need it,

237
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,340
Computer is there and it's multiplayer,

238
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,390
so it's not just there for you,

239
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,610
it's there for your team
and your organization,

240
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,190
and it's also there for your customer.

241
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,920
And there's some really hard
problems behind the scenes

242
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,530
that need to be solved to
do this really, really well.

243
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,120
First of all, you need to understand

244
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,650
how to unify information.

245
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,230
And unifying information is
not just about being able

246
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,160
to export data.

247
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,360
That's not what it's about.

248
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,450
It's not about taking
data from here to there.

249
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,100
That's not the problem to solve.

250
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,050
This is about creating
memory for agents and AI,

251
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,520
for computer, really.

252
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,030
And this is about understanding
how to bring information

253
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,250
in a near real time bidirectional way,

254
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,680
because if it's bidirectional
in near real time,

255
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,770
you can actually take
actions on that information

256
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,350
and actually have it
reflect back in the systems

257
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,850
where the information originated,

258
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,190
so you can continue to coexist

259
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,070
with the rest of your infrastructure,

260
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,950
with the rest of your long tail of IT.

261
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,580
It has to coexist.

262
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,810
And for that reason alone,

263
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,170
it needs to be bi-directional
and near real time.

264
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,850
And it can't just bring in the data,

265
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,070
it's gotta bring in all
the metadata, right?

266
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,630
It's gotta understand the metadata

267
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,470
so it knows what the other
options are in the dropdown menu.

268
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,910
And it needs to understand

269
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,330
what the other radio button
selection of possibilities were,

270
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,820
because how else would
you actually take action

271
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,670
if you don't understand
the field dependencies

272
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,140
and the access provisions

273
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,130
and the selection criteria
and the variables at bay?

274
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,420
So, that's where you wanna be.

275
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,440
You wanna be in a place

276
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,750
where you can bidirectionally
sync information

277
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,650
and understand the schema
and the access provisions

278
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,710
so that you can respect all
of that as you create a system

279
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,860
that can search, give you
answers, and of course,

280
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,210
take action on that as well.

281
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,590
And of course, when you
bring it into memory,

282
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,890
memory is gonna have to
handle both long-term

283
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,630
and short-term context.

284
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,720
It's gotta be able to give
you the most fast, accurate,

285
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,670
and hyper-personalized answers.

286
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,920
That's the only way to
create a personal computer.

287
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,830
And of course, you can't just
do that by mimicking the data

288
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,840
as it exists in these disparate systems.

289
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,530
You need to understand how to
connect data between the work

290
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,740
that you do, your persona,
the customers you serve,

291
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,090
and the product you create.

292
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,440
And so, this information,

293
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,383
these inner relationships
need to be understood deeply.

294
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,140
And of course, if you're
gonna do all that,

295
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,780
you're gonna need a series
of foundational services

296
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,710
on top of it.

297
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,710
These are simple but powerful
foundational services.

298
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,330
You gotta be able to search.

299
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,163
And of course,

300
00:11:58,163 --> 00:12:02,610
what we know is that as we
have gone deeper in search,

301
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,480
it's a deep problem.

302
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,220
You've gotta be able to do it at scale.

303
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,410
You need to understand
not just the syntax,

304
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,330
the keywords, but the semantics,

305
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,190
and you gotta enrich this information.

306
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,890
It's gotta be able to
understand the deep annotations,

307
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,590
the links between work and opportunities

308
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,320
and customers and entities and identities.

309
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,240
It's gotta understand
that really, really well.

310
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,810
And it's gotta be fast
at the scale of GPUs.

311
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,130
So, that's where we want to be.

312
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,090
And of course, it has to be able

313
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,390
to contextualize all the
answers based on who you are,

314
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,750
so you're not just giving the
same information to everybody.

315
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,490
It's gotta be unique and personalized.

316
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,860
And of course, it's
gotta have a data layer

317
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,080
that's well suited to agentic AI.

318
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,050
Agentic AI can't be built effectively

319
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,360
on top of the data layer that we use

320
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,250
to build client server architectures

321
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,280
or to build traditional
client or cloud systems.

322
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,732
It has to be a data layer that
is native to conversational

323
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:57,750
as much as it is a more
conventional surface.

324
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,450
And so, SQL, what's old is new again.

325
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,810
SQL is something that's grounded in fact,

326
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,380
it's easy to advocate for,
it's grounded in facts,

327
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,050
so you can actually audit
it, you can trace it,

328
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,630
you can acknowledge it, you can permit it,

329
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,660
and so you can conversationally
access your information

330
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,210
and you know that the answer that you got

331
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,190
was based on real facts

332
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,980
because you have the
understanding of the SQL

333
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,840
that was working behind the scenes

334
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,460
to actually provide that information.

335
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,920
And you can then take that
and in a more traditional way,

336
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,160
access it to create a
graph or a dashboard,

337
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,140
or to share that information
with somebody else

338
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,330
who can do more intelligence on top of it.

339
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,550
And so, this is the most
universal way for you

340
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,220
to communicate with your
information in traditional ways,

341
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,200
but also in more conversational ways.

342
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,730
So, that's what the future looks like.

343
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,140
It's not abandoning SQL,

344
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,500
it's actually embracing it
as a unified data layer.

345
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,570
And of course, you also have to say yes

346
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,040
to not just the data in memory,

347
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,560
but the data outside of memory, right?

348
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,020
So, just like computers
had access to the internet,

349
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,970
so do these agentic computers,

350
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,310
these computers have access to via MCP,

351
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,340
so you can actually access
tools from around the world

352
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,320
and have plans that reflect not just

353
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,850
the information inside your memory,

354
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,040
but all the information
outside it as well.

355
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,960
So, this is what a modern
computer looks like.

356
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,150
It's built on all of these engines,

357
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,090
the powerful engine of search

358
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,980
that is both syntactic and semantic

359
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,800
and powered by LLMs, but also SQL,

360
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,600
the ability to ground facts,

361
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,960
but be conversational as
much as you are conventional.

362
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,840
Dashboards and conversational
at the same time.

363
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,280
Of course, MCP as well.

364
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,940
And that's just on the access
for searches and answers.

365
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,240
But to take actions, you need
to be able to build agents

366
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,380
and upscale agents,

367
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,390
because we're not gonna be
able to create thousands

368
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,410
and hundreds of agents.

369
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,840
Who's gonna name them and
who's gonna address them?

370
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,710
It's too difficult.

371
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,450
You gotta have a thoughtful mechanism

372
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,460
to actually upskill these agents.

373
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,490
And these agents cannot be
put in everybody's hands

374
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,700
to go create and upskill agents
for the rest of the company.

375
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,840
That's not gonna work.

376
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,690
You have to allow for citizen development.

377
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,030
That means the ability for people

378
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,900
to actually upskill an agent,
perhaps just for themselves,

379
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,630
or perhaps for their team,
maybe the department,

380
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,350
and just maybe for the
entire organization.

381
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,870
But it has to work within these scopes.

382
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,660
You have to allow for skills
and agents to manifest

383
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,570
at the personal level so
that people can have autonomy

384
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,330
to create the type of automations
they need for themselves,

385
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,530
perhaps for their teams,

386
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,360
and then maybe for
their companies as well.

387
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,270
And of course, the same reflects
back into the enterprise.

388
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,330
You can't have the same
agents actually advocating

389
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,660
across your customers for everybody.

390
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,300
It could be different and
unique for every brand,

391
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,340
for every region, for every channel.

392
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,960
It's not a one-size-fits-all.

393
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,510
And so, you need to be able
to not only upskill agents

394
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,400
and do this in a way that's scalable,

395
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,470
one that allows you to create skills

396
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,630
or maybe borrow them from a marketplace,

397
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,510
or maybe create them and
define them in a no code way,

398
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,990
but also to deploy them
in really responsible ways

399
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,060
at the brand, at the region,
at the channel level,

400
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,690
or at the team level
or personally perhaps.

401
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,790
And so, that's what we're looking for.

402
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,440
And of course, putting it all together,

403
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,140
computer has to be able
to answer questions

404
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,240
by accessing all of this information.

405
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,580
So, you're able to answer
questions like the one over here,

406
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,280
and it's able to rattle through
all of these tools you use,

407
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,980
whether it's a Jira or a
Notion, it doesn't matter.

408
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,420
It's able to access that information,

409
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,640
provide an answer that's fully cited

410
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,560
so you can continue with your work.

411
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,260
And of course, it not only
synthesizes information,

412
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,690
but it's gotta be able to do
some reasoning on top of it.

413
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,690
And so, not only do you want
it to synthesize information,

414
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,670
but you want it to actually create a plan

415
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,500
and to reason about the information

416
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,060
so you actually get an opinion,

417
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,960
one that leverages the innate
ability for frontier models

418
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,720
to cluster and synthesize, prioritize,

419
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,070
and classify information.

420
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,360
That's super important as well.

421
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,150
So, here you can see that not
only are we getting an answer

422
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,910
that's grounded in the
information across our enterprise,

423
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,340
but it actually gives you some
opinions, of course, again,

424
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,800
grounded in facts that are fully cited.

425
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,750
And of course, you could
follow up those questions

426
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,450
with real questions like,
"What are the action items?"

427
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,220
And it'll actually tell you.

428
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,550
And of course, not only are
you able to unify information,

429
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,560
not only are you able to use planning

430
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,080
and synthesis to get reasonable responses,

431
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,820
you can actually take actions.

432
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,850
So, in this particular case,
not only am I asking questions,

433
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,190
I'm actually asking for a
meeting to be scheduled.

434
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,410
And this is the real sort of synthesis

435
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,610
of where this is going, right?

436
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,100
You're gonna have the ability
to unify your information,

437
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,190
have a teammate that can
actually maybe help you reason

438
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,630
about what needs to happen.

439
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,060
And if you believe it,
if you agree or disagree,

440
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,800
you can ask follow up questions

441
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,540
with the same level of context,

442
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,150
and finally take actions
to maybe create work,

443
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,190
create opportunities, or
perhaps schedule work,

444
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,023
what have you.

445
00:17:42,023 --> 00:17:43,800
So, these are sort of
some of the examples.

446
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,510
And just putting it all together,

447
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,620
ultimately it has to help
you work more productively,

448
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,360
faster than ever before.

449
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,070
And so, that's where we are headed.

450
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,487
We have to be able to ask questions like,

451
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:56,010
"What is our travel policy?"

452
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,650
And not only are we expecting an answer

453
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,380
that is grounded in the
information that exists,

454
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,100
it is the exact information
that makes sense for who I am

455
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,740
and the department that I
belong to, so on and so forth.

456
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,667
And I can ask follow up questions and say,

457
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,220
"What about this other region?"

458
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,060
Not for myself,

459
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,160
but I wanna know what the
travel policy looks like

460
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,360
in that other region.

461
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,470
And it'll actually tell you

462
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,600
because it understands
that that's not the region

463
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,100
that's native to you.

464
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,810
And these are the kinds of experiences

465
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,633
that we will come to expect
from these modern computers.

466
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,990
So, just to kind of recap, again,

467
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,780
these are not systems that are gonna work

468
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,700
at the boundaries of departments.

469
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,410
I mean, they may help
you in your departments,

470
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,470
but they have to be able to
go beyond those departments

471
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,370
to say, "You know what?

472
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,770
I'm not just a computer
for your support team.

473
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,110
I'm a computer that
also works equally well

474
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,030
for the people that are
building the software,

475
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,040
people who are working
closely with the customers,

476
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,950
and people who are creating deep insights

477
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,840
so that we understand where to go next."

478
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,130
It has to work for everybody.

479
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,100
It cannot create false
boundaries between agents

480
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,860
and microservices or applications.

481
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,360
It has to coexist with all of that.

482
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,370
So, just to keep it really
simple a little bit,

483
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,530
you can find us at Booth 1204.

484
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,020
So, if you're excited and
don't know where to go next,

485
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,010
1204, Booth 1204, near Theater
2 is where we're located.

486
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,860
Our founders, Dheeraj Pandey and Manoj,

487
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,380
previously of Nutanix Fame,

488
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,170
left in 2020 to start this company.

489
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,790
So, we've got a forward deploy team,

490
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,830
Applied AI help you with this journey,

491
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,690
and of course, we do a lot of workshops.

492
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,970
And DevRevU helps you with understanding

493
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,340
how to embrace this world
as we make this transition

494
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,189
from SaaS 1.0 to SaaS 2.0.

495
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:33,930
Beyond that, a little bit about customers.

496
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,780
We've got hundreds of
customers, we've got partners.

497
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,180
You see some of those logos,
I'm sure you recognize those.

498
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,030
And of course, fully
compliant, GDPR-ready,

499
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,860
lots of money raised, so on and so forth.

500
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,460
Thank you so much for your time.
