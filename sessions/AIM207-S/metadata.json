  "abstract": "Every leader knows that AI matters, but we're all still learning exactly how. Siloed business data has been the main obstacle - but no more. Learn how DevRev solves this problem, unifying existing structured data like tickets, backlogs, and CRMs with unstructured data like emails, chats, and documents into an AI-native Knowledge Graph, powering integrated AI agents that create, read, update, and delete, not simply summarize. The result? Happier customers, empowered employees, and finally, ROI from AI. This presentation is brought to you by DevRev, an AWS Partner.",
