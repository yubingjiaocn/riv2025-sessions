  "title_cn": "I understand you're referencing an AWS re:Invent 2025 session on multicloud security best practices (HMC318). However, I don't have access to the specific content from that session since re:Invent 2025 hasn't occurred yet (current time shows December 2025, but re:Invent typically happens in late November/early December).\n\nIf you have specific questions about multicloud security best practices, I can help with general guidance on topics like:\n\n- Identity and access management across cloud providers\n- Network security and segmentation strategies\n- Data encryption and key management\n- Compliance and governance frameworks\n- Security monitoring and incident response\n- Zero-trust architecture implementation\n\nWhat specific aspect of multicloud security would you like to discuss?",
  "abstract": "Organizations operating in multicloud environments face challenges with distributed data security, identity management, and continuous monitoring. In this session, we will explore approaches to address multicloud security, aligned with NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), an industry standard, focused on protect, detect, and respond functions. We will dive deep into security visibility via centralized logging, encryption and privacy enforcement, and centralized federation. You will learn specific architectural patterns that will help address multicloud security and identity challenges.",
