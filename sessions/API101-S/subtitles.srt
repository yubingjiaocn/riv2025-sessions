1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:00,969
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:03,258
Hope everyone's reinvent is going, uh,

3
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:04,879
going as well as ours.

4
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,429
Uh, I'm very excited to spend the next 19

5
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:09,060
minutes, uh, with all of you.

6
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:11,470
So, uh, my name is Jared Summers. I'm the

7
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,858
CTO at, at LMI.

8
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:15,509
For those that, uh, don't know LMI, we're

9
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:16,719
a next-generation

10
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,208
solutions and products provider. To the federal government.

11
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:21,699
And so over the next few moments I'm going to talk to you

12
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:24,000
about what really makes LMI

13
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,620
special and what enables us to

14
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,359
move

15
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:30,539
incredibly quickly for our customers, blending

16
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,668
COT's solutions with the federal

17
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:33,819
security requirements.

18
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:35,939
So we're ready on day one for the mission.

19
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,389
And so, so I think, you know, the,

20
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,689
the exciting thing is the administration

21
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:45,950
and the change that has been occurring

22
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,250
in the federal space over the last,

23
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,810
you know, 12 to 18 months. There's been a strong

24
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,009
demand for CT solutions. And

25
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:55,310
why? And that's because

26
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,329
the federal government has realized

27
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,029
that there's a ton of technology

28
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:01,418
available out in the market

29
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,789
that if they could get it securely and in the

30
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:04,709
right format,

31
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,109
they could leverage the investment,

32
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,909
the broader investment outside of

33
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:13,019
the federal space to provide the capabilities

34
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:15,308
to their customers, their individuals

35
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,150
even faster.

36
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,859
And so what they want to do is to leverage

37
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,939
the innovation and the investment made

38
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,239
in the commercial space

39
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,859
on the on the federal side. And so

40
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:27,219
when you think about COs, it's really

41
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:29,159
easy to move fast and to innovate

42
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:31,579
when you don't have a lot of

43
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:33,939
the security requirements that we have on the federal

44
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:36,558
side. So for those that operate

45
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,609
in the federal market space, there's a ton of acronyms

46
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:40,620
whether it's CMM.

47
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,159
FedRAM,

48
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,250
ATO,

49
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,819
NIST, and etc. and the list goes on.

50
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,480
And so how do you bridge and

51
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,099
merge the speed and the innovation

52
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:53,198
while still delivering securely? And that's what we're gonna

53
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:55,010
talk about for, for the next few minutes.

54
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,638
And so, first, a little bit about LMI.

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,439
So LMI has actually been around for 65

56
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,439
years, so we're not a tech native

57
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,150
new company.

58
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,760
However, over the last 3 years. We've changed

59
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,959
really the focus on our delivery

60
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,000
to leverage the business model we're going to talk about here.

61
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,800
So we've pivoted away from

62
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,139
services to solutions and

63
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,599
products driven by our IP

64
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:18,058
and the investments that we've made over the last 3

65
00:02:18,058 --> 00:02:20,520
years of hundreds of millions of dollars

66
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,868
to buy companies and integrate them in a secure way,

67
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,139
so we show up on day one with mission

68
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,199
ready tech that our customers can use

69
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,099
out in the field.

70
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,610
So, so how do you actually bring

71
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,069
and merge the innovation and

72
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:37,389
everything that the customers want with

73
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,788
the security requirements that our customers

74
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:41,868
have? And so I've got 3 examples that I'm

75
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:43,770
gonna walk through here pretty quickly.

76
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:45,288
So the first

77
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,288
is

78
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,069
A lot of problems and challenges have been

79
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,308
solved in the commercial side for decades.

80
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,889
When we think about

81
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,788
IoT enablement, when we think about

82
00:02:55,788 --> 00:02:58,258
tracking inventory, when we think about understanding

83
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,588
where are our assets, where are things in

84
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:01,929
transit, I think

85
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,618
across those three use cases we're

86
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,909
all thinking of companies that do this incredibly well.

87
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:09,080
This technology is not new.

88
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,338
Amazon does this incredibly well in their warehouses.

89
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,069
However, there's still the security side

90
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,129
when you think of federal customers, particularly

91
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:18,008
in the DOD,

92
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:20,729
DHS, and a lot of the other mission units

93
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:21,508
where they don't

94
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:23,449
really want that data exposed everywhere.

95
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,669
So, so what do you do?

96
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:26,669
So this morning we announced

97
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:29,129
Specter, which is our commercial

98
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:31,528
solution that actually solves this problem.

99
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:33,960
And what we've done is we've

100
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,219
acquired the commercial tech and

101
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:37,319
we've hardened it

102
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,588
within our reusable platforms and we'll talk

103
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:42,118
about in a moment that we show up on day one

104
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,429
with all of the infrastructure,

105
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:46,719
the hardware, the data transport,

106
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,419
and the analytics that are all secured

107
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:51,538
by design ready on day one so

108
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:53,538
we can deploy to our customers immediately and

109
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:54,800
they start to see the value

110
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,099
on day one.

111
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,139
And so that's, it's really exciting.

112
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:01,979
The second is adapt and deploy

113
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,409
in a creative environment. So

114
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:06,229
it's very difficult to show up to a

115
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:07,368
government customer

116
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,028
when it's pure straight cop. So if you

117
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:12,270
don't understand the rules of the game, back

118
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,270
to the acronym SOUP that we talked about a few

119
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,849
moments ago,

120
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:17,420
and you don't know the baseline that you're building

121
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,670
for, it's incredibly hard for your

122
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,759
solutions to to get into the target

123
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,528
environments.

124
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,889
So what we've done internally through

125
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:27,994
extensive. R&D

126
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:29,814
funding is we've built

127
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:32,494
and accredited our own platform

128
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:34,915
that is to FedRAM P and

129
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:37,403
to IL 5 standards, so

130
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:38,994
everything that we build internally,

131
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:42,173
all of our solutions, all of our capabilities

132
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:43,494
from day one

133
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:46,144
are built to the security baselines that

134
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,213
our customers need.

135
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:49,858
And so what that really means is when

136
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:51,928
we align on a solution that we

137
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:52,519
have

138
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:55,259
that our customer needs, when we

139
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,238
show up on game day, on day one,

140
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:59,769
the containers and the applications that

141
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:00,559
we bring

142
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:02,858
pass through all of their security

143
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:04,858
checks with a clean bill of health so

144
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:06,139
that we can deploy quickly.

145
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,629
So we can either bring our own environment that

146
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:10,778
we have accredited or we can deploy in

147
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:11,759
their target environment.

148
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:14,369
And so our internal environment is called iron sled.

149
00:05:14,738 --> 00:05:16,778
And so we use that to, to build all

150
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:18,959
of our internal capabilities. A great example,

151
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:19,879
um,

152
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,838
there was a, a customer that we saw

153
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,129
a, a use case that was, that was

154
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:26,028
not being met.

155
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:29,220
We took that information back internally

156
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,459
and started to, to build uh

157
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,660
an application to solve that particular

158
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,238
problem.

159
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,879
Leveraging all of our secure harden

160
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,920
containers and our pipelines and our

161
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,028
co-depositories,

162
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:41,459
we were able to turn

163
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,709
an MVP, which is actual functioning

164
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:45,790
application containerized,

165
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:48,379
and show it to the customer in 72 hours,

166
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,048
get their feedback,

167
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,040
because what we all know is customers

168
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,278
really don't know what they want until they

169
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:55,910
experience it,

170
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:58,399
until they can actually interact with something that's

171
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,540
real and be like this solves my problem,

172
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,540
or actually know I needed to do this.

173
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:05,309
And so we could take that 72

174
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:06,009
hour turn,

175
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:08,108
get that customer feedback,

176
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:10,699
make the improvements and the changes, and

177
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,720
then show up a week later with even a

178
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,949
more robust application.

179
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:16,988
And so we were able to, to go from

180
00:06:16,988 --> 00:06:17,528
idea

181
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:19,988
to. First concept in 72 hours

182
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:21,108
to come back

183
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,608
fully incorporating their first

184
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:24,509
round of feedback

185
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,009
in weeks. And now that is, is live in a

186
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,209
customer environment being used for exercises

187
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:31,209
actually this week uh as uh as

188
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,028
we're here, which is incredibly exciting.

189
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,600
The, the next is

190
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:38,569
extract core components for, for reusability

191
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:39,559
and repeatability.

192
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,040
And so, on the commercial side,

193
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:44,738
they're really good about not recreating

194
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,949
the wheel every time.

195
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,639
And so what that really means is

196
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:50,040
when you're building

197
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:52,889
your applications, when you're building your capability,

198
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,420
built with modularity and reusability

199
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,278
in mind. So a great example,

200
00:06:57,778 --> 00:06:59,778
uh, for, for us is uh a platform

201
00:06:59,778 --> 00:07:00,519
called Raptor.

202
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:03,139
So Raptor has been in use for

203
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,269
over a decade by starting with the Space

204
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:07,790
Force to solve really hard modeling and simulation

205
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,459
challenges,

206
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,988
but the way that it was architected was

207
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:13,069
a toolkit of different solutions

208
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:14,250
and capabilities

209
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:16,629
that we could put together in a modular

210
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:19,028
way to solve a variety of different customer

211
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:19,790
challenges.

212
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,298
And so that means it can not only

213
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:23,000
solve

214
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:24,509
very bespoke,

215
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:26,939
incredibly challenging

216
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,798
space-based comms network

217
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:32,100
solutions, but it can also be used

218
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,338
to optimize for asset

219
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:36,819
availability across a very diverse

220
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:39,040
landscape like Indopeca, for example.

221
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,319
It can be used to solve very

222
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,738
challenging problems around medical logistics

223
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:44,350
and the like,

224
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:46,750
because each of the components themselves

225
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,358
are reusable and modular,

226
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:50,649
that we can bring the right components to

227
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:51,559
solve the problem,

228
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,028
iterate with the customer in near real time,

229
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:55,988
and be able to provide that solution

230
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,108
that they can use.

231
00:07:58,809 --> 00:07:59,428
And so

232
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:02,170
the, the investments that that that

233
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,588
we've made and the strategy that we've taken.

234
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,319
Has enabled us to take all of the

235
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,559
great things that the government wants

236
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:10,500
to leverage

237
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,939
from, from a cop's perspective

238
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,600
and marry that with the

239
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,639
requirements that are just necessary that are part of doing

240
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,259
the business within the federal government.

241
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,838
And so to be great partners

242
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:24,019
and what they were really looking for is

243
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:26,278
they're looking for companies that have demonstrated

244
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:27,480
the behaviors

245
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,920
of co-investing.

246
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:31,369
So when you think about the capabilities

247
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,619
that we use in our daily lives,

248
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,029
we did not like applications on our phone,

249
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:36,849
for example,

250
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,029
we did not

251
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,869
pay for a company to build

252
00:08:40,869 --> 00:08:41,950
that application,

253
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:45,729
and then we wait 1824

254
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,570
months, 3 to 5 years.

255
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:48,908
But unfortunately,

256
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,788
historically, that is how software

257
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:53,729
delivery and capability has been in the federal government.

258
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,558
And it's just not the right answer.

259
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,960
The right answer is demonstrating

260
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,739
the right.

261
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,168
The right partnership attributes,

262
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,320
co-investing

263
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:05,899
and showing up on day one with

264
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:08,158
capabilities that they can use

265
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,489
that are modular, that are reusable, but

266
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:12,798
at the same time are built to the

267
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:14,759
to the incredibly important

268
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:15,759
security

269
00:09:16,178 --> 00:09:18,418
standards that that that you need to deploy

270
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:19,599
in the environments given

271
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,379
sometimes the risks that are associated with emissions in which

272
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:24,918
the technology will be used

273
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,058
and so.

274
00:09:26,788 --> 00:09:28,099
You know, when you think about that,

275
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:30,149
really, that's, that's cots done right.

276
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,538
And when you do that right,

277
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:35,109
you build a tremendous amount of trust

278
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:36,450
with your customers,

279
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:38,808
where when you show up and you're demonstrating

280
00:09:38,808 --> 00:09:40,928
those right behaviors, and when you show

281
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:43,548
up and you can actually deploy your capability,

282
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:46,489
and you, and your, and your tools

283
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:48,639
pass their security scans cleanly,

284
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:51,269
it builds a tremendous amount of trust

285
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,649
that enables,

286
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:53,548
you know, a,

287
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,869
a whole additional,

288
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,389
you know, conversation on, well, what else can you do?

289
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:58,889
Well, what else can you bring?

290
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:01,109
And this has worked really well for EMI.

291
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,469
It's over the last few years,

292
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,200
you know, taking this approach to our customers

293
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,538
has allowed us to grow

294
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:09,308
by 68% KAR.

295
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,019
I mean, that's incredible. For a 65

296
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,440
year old legacy company

297
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:17,119
who's been able to transform itself

298
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:19,739
into a solutions and products,

299
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:22,558
and to experience that type of, type of growth

300
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:24,548
is nothing short of amazing.

301
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,940
And that's because of the model that we're here

302
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,200
talking about today and what we've been able to do.

303
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,779
So, success really isn't, it's not

304
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:33,519
about skipping customization,

305
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:34,820
because,

306
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,279
you know, when you think about it,

307
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:40,269
What they want from Cots is

308
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:41,908
the speed and the capability,

309
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:44,629
but that doesn't mean it, it doesn't have to be customized,

310
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:46,989
and I think that gets lost in the

311
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:49,149
conversation. Because, you know, for

312
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,580
a lot of our customers and probably a lot of your customers

313
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,298
as well, there are some direct dual-use

314
00:10:54,298 --> 00:10:56,558
applications, you know, when it comes to some of the back-end

315
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:59,099
process uh processes, you know, whether that's HR,

316
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,538
you know, processing everything else. But when you're talking about

317
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:03,639
mission-focused, mission-forward

318
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,960
applications, you know, whether that's for CBP,

319
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:08,288
whether that's for the Department of the Army, whether that's for Space

320
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:10,389
Force, whether it's for the Postal Service,

321
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,960
the challenges and the scale

322
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:14,719
at which they face

323
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,340
does require customization.

324
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,009
And so I think it's really important for all of

325
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:20,668
us

326
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:23,099
in the narrative in the conversation,

327
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:26,149
KOs does not mean that there isn't

328
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,798
customization to actually solve the use case,

329
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:31,288
but what KOs really means back

330
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:33,479
to behaviors is that we're showing

331
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,428
up on day one

332
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,408
with secure solutions and we're investing

333
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:38,269
ahead of need

334
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:40,830
to actually, you know, solve their problems.

335
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,710
And so it's really achieved by the balance

336
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,029
of the innovation and the speed.

337
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:48,009
But bringing, you know,

338
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,658
the investment and the behaviors and the security

339
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:52,210
necessary to deploy.

340
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,469
And so with that, actually.

341
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:57,509
It's kind of all I have to say. Does anybody have any

342
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,519
questions? Anyway.

343
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,000
Nobody. No questions?

344
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:06,000
I can keep talking if you want.

345
00:12:08,058 --> 00:12:08,700
What's that?

346
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:10,558
Keep talking. All right.

347
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:12,369
Let's go back one then.

348
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:15,109
I'll give more examples.

349
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:16,408
Um.

350
00:12:18,058 --> 00:12:20,229
Yeah, so I think, you know, let's go back to, to

351
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:21,109
Spector a little bit.

352
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:23,629
Uh, so that was the first one I talked about solving

353
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:26,469
intransit visibility, asset availability,

354
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,889
uh, and really, you know, solving the problem like

355
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,259
where are my things and, and how many things do I

356
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,489
have. And so the announcement

357
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:35,619
that we made this morning uh was

358
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:38,259
around, we went out and acquired um

359
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,820
IP surrounding this.

360
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:42,739
Uh, so now the entire tech

361
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:43,428
stack

362
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:45,320
from tags

363
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,399
to, to Edge compute

364
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:49,340
to transport

365
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,739
all the way up through the, to the Edge

366
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:53,178
data cloud Edge cloud,

367
00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:56,099
Edge to cloud and enterprise is all integrated

368
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:56,979
in one solution.

369
00:12:57,668 --> 00:12:59,830
And so when you think about also cots,

370
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:02,109
something that we're seeing from our customers

371
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:04,190
that you're probably seeing from yours as well, is

372
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,190
they're looking for those integrated solutions

373
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,450
that they can buy commercially

374
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,048
that solve the problem

375
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:10,158
at speed.

376
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:12,548
And so the investments that that we made and

377
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:14,750
announced this morning that we successfully

378
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,489
demonstrated

379
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:18,048
both at a very large use case for the army

380
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:19,349
and for the navy

381
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:21,149
enable us to move even faster.

382
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,229
And so back to being a good partner,

383
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,710
we have gone off and invested our own

384
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,869
money to de-risk that

385
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:29,950
delivery because now we control the entire

386
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,038
stack. So instead of relying

387
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,190
on other third-party providers, whether

388
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,308
it be for hardware or for

389
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:37,250
transport,

390
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:39,489
now they have one integrated solution

391
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:41,029
that is secure end to end.

392
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,940
And so that enables us to, to move with

393
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,000
speed, but then also to, to

394
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,298
come with the commercial business model.

395
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,038
So now they can buy as a service.

396
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,000
So that's something else that you're probably getting from your customers

397
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:52,649
is,

398
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:55,259
you know, I see on the commercial side, I can

399
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:57,219
buy as a service. And so what does that mean?

400
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:59,700
And so what that really means and what we've

401
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,769
found they're asking for, and I'd love to validate with all

402
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:03,080
of you is

403
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:05,558
instead of just buying a thing,

404
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:08,259
they want to buy outcomes and capabilities

405
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:09,460
based upon SLAs.

406
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,080
And that's exactly when you think about when you're

407
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,158
buying commercial tech to

408
00:14:14,158 --> 00:14:16,239
support your, your own development, that's

409
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:18,798
exactly what you're buying. It's what are the SLAs

410
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:20,908
that I am paying for that you are

411
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:23,000
signing up to to deliver that capability. All

412
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,960
right, now we got a question.

413
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,969
Yeah, yep.

414
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,229
Yeah, yeah, so

415
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:33,928
the, so the, so the Navy project,

416
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:36,788
the Navy has a, has a, has an

417
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:38,950
opportunity to increase throughput at all of the naval

418
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,779
shipyards.

419
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:42,529
And so, you know, a big part of that is

420
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:44,489
they are incredibly large,

421
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,149
uh, you know, areas if you've

422
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:48,494
ever been. To a naval shipyard,

423
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:51,514
same use case. So I came from oil and gas. If

424
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:53,634
you've ever been on a refinery or a chemical plant, you

425
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:54,724
know, the exact same thing,

426
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:56,815
very disparate, very large,

427
00:14:57,754 --> 00:14:59,913
but at the same time it's very

428
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:01,625
complex because as you're breaking down

429
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:03,144
a navy vessel,

430
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:05,793
there's all these pieces, parts, and components

431
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:07,134
that have to go off for repair

432
00:15:07,494 --> 00:15:09,514
or for overhaul or that you're replacing.

433
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,418
But then,

434
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:11,629
where do they go?

435
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,989
How do you track them? And some of those

436
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,119
pieces and components

437
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,019
are incredibly important

438
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,619
because, you know, they deal with nuclear propulsion.

439
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,058
And so if, if you lose one of those,

440
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:23,849
and by lose I mean just misplace,

441
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,719
that shuts down the entire yard

442
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,519
until it's found.

443
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,440
So you could lose a day or two

444
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:33,320
of productivity from absolutely

445
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
everyone in the yard

446
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,158
looking for that piece part or component.

447
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,019
And so what our solution does

448
00:15:39,178 --> 00:15:41,178
is it tracks and provides that asset

449
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:42,119
visibility

450
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:44,529
across the entire life cycle from the, from the

451
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:45,798
time it's taken off

452
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:48,379
all the way through the the repair,

453
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,500
the overhaul, the replacement, but then all the

454
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,080
way to the time it gets back

455
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:54,418
because now that data plugs in and goes

456
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:56,859
into all of their scheduling and planning,

457
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,658
because how often,

458
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:01,340
um, if you know anything about shipyards,

459
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:03,519
if you know about any manufacturing, how often

460
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,178
is something scheduled to be installed.

461
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:08,009
But you don't have the right part or they scheduled it out

462
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,250
of order, so you put a larger component

463
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,830
and left 2 or 3 things behind it.

464
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,149
Now you got to go rip something else out to

465
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:17,190
put it back in. And so not only do

466
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,769
you have, you know, time saving some efficiency

467
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,099
to, you know where everything is and so you're not, you

468
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:24,308
know, double, triple, quadruple ordering

469
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:26,580
things, you know where it is, you know when it's ready,

470
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,950
so then you're also scheduling the right

471
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,500
crews at the right time,

472
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,830
you know, to go, to go reinstall the parts

473
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,529
in the right order.

474
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,250
And so the, the entire

475
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,750
process there is about enabling the Navy

476
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:41,428
to, to turn ships at the

477
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:43,769
organic shipyards faster, more

478
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,379
efficient, at a lower cost.

479
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:48,029
And so that's what Spector is doing for the Navy,

480
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:50,369
um, and it's been, it's been incredibly

481
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:52,408
exciting. So I think, I think we talked about

482
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:54,489
more of that in the, the press release if you'd like to know

483
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:56,269
more LMIsolutions.com.

484
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,149
Uh, we talked about that and, uh, and the Army example

485
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:00,210
as well.

486
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:02,960
Uh, and that is solving the problem

487
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:04,680
when you think about army depots,

488
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,539
you know, they are, they're resource constraints. They

489
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:08,969
have a ton of assets.

490
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,118
So where are those assets,

491
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,979
um, and so we partnered with them to, to answer

492
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:15,088
that problem, you know,

493
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,699
where, where are the assets, what condition

494
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,009
are they, are they in, you know, what components

495
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:22,469
are, are, are on that, that larger asset.

496
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:24,500
So we have parent-child relationships,

497
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:27,519
um, you know, different capabilities and tags,

498
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,449
uh, for different specificity. Um,

499
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:32,000
and that, so that enables them for the exact

500
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,900
same use case. I need to go find

501
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,140
a transmission

502
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,989
for, you know, uh, an AMV,

503
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,739
you know, in this configuration,

504
00:17:40,078 --> 00:17:41,059
exactly where is it

505
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:44,000
instead of driving around, you know, 230 acres

506
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,900
trying to find,

507
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:47,199
you know, the right vehicle at the right

508
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,348
time. And so that drives, you know, you know, that

509
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:50,180
efficiency.

510
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:51,160
Um,

511
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,930
did I do that? I didn't do that.

512
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:55,039
Anyway, great question. Thank you.

513
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:56,420
And so

514
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,969
really appreciate the opportunity to share

515
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:00,618
a little bit about LMI,

516
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:01,759
who we are.

517
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:04,019
I think the exciting journey that we've been

518
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:06,209
on for the last 3 years,

519
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:08,719
I think, you know, really shows

520
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:11,380
and should give, you know, excitement, encouragement.

521
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:12,618
Like this is possible.

522
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,289
You can do this,

523
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,680
um, and we're happy to talk

524
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,838
more about what we do and

525
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:19,719
how we do it.

526
00:18:20,078 --> 00:18:22,269
We're over at booth 491,

527
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,479
which is straight down this hallway to

528
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,759
my right, your left,

529
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,199
uh, and we'll have people there all week that, you

530
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:30,439
know, we love talking about the capabilities

531
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:31,118
that we have.

532
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,078
We partner well with others.

533
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:33,900
Um,

534
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:36,578
we, we pride ourselves on actually being a good partner.

535
00:18:37,088 --> 00:18:39,289
Uh, and so if that's something you're interested, please

536
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:40,769
stop by and talk to us.

537
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:41,588
Otherwise,

538
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,009
thanks for stopping by. I appreciate it.

539
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:44,930
Thanks for your time.
