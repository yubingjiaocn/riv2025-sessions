  "abstract": "AI isn’t a silver bullet — it’s a strategic investment for IT. To truly unlock its potential in reducing costs, easing burnout, and improving security, IT organizations should adopt AI thoughtfully, with people at the center of their approach. Done right, AI enhances teams and operations — it doesn’t replace them. Too often, hasty adoption leads to wasted time, broken trust, and poor outcomes. In this session, NinjaOne Field CTO Jeff Hunter explores the real costs of bad AI and outlines a smarter, human-centric path forward — one that integrates AI into everyday IT workflows to elevate teams and deliver stronger business outcomes. This presentation is brought to you by NinjaOne, an AWS Partner.",
  "abstract_cn": "AI并非万能解决方案——它是IT的战略投资。要真正释放其在降低成本、缓解倦怠和改善安全性方面的潜力,IT组织应该深思熟虑地采用AI,并将人员置于其方法的核心。如果做得正确,AI会增强团队和运营——而不是取代它们。仓促采用往往会导致时间浪费、信任破裂和糟糕的结果。在本次会议中,NinjaOne现场首席技术官Jeff Hunter探讨了糟糕AI的真实成本,并概述了一条更明智、以人为本的前进道路——将AI集成到日常IT工作流程中,以提升团队并实现更强的业务成果。本演讲由AWS合作伙伴NinjaOne提供。",
