  "abstract": "Sophos, a British cybersecurity company, faced exponential growth and complexity in its internal security environment—processing terabytes of log and security telemetry daily. In this session, Chris O’Brien, VP of Security Operations, shares how Sophos used Cribl and AWS to cut costs by filtering data at the source, normalizing and routing heterogeneous logs, and accelerating SIEM migration from months to weeks. The team leveraged Cribl to centralize logging and migrate data off of legacy infrastructure for greater flexibility and simplified compliance. Learn how the Sophos team tackles massive telemetry data growth to meet compliance requirements and future-proof their security data operations. This presentation is brought to you by Cribl, an AWS Partner.",
