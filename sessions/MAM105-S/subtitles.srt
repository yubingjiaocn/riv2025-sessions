1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,510
- Hello and good afternoon, everybody.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,343
- There you go.

3
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:05,790
- My name is Kam Amir.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,170
I am with Cribl.

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,323
I will be taking over for Chris O'Brien.

6
00:00:10,323 --> 00:00:13,170
And with me I have Ed Bailey.

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,040
- Hey, thank you very much.

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,873
My name's Ed Bailey.

9
00:00:14,873 --> 00:00:16,350
I'm Cribl's field CISO.

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,183
I just wanna say,

11
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,887
we're really missing Chris not being here.

12
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:20,310
He had a family emergency

13
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,010
and so Chris, we're thinking
the best thoughts for you.

14
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,560
But he will be here in spirit.

15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,071
We will try to sound
sophisticated, as you do,

16
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:30,630
but we will fail, but we'll try our best.

17
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,190
But thank you, everyone, for being here.

18
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,108
- Yes. Thank you again.

19
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:35,395
And for this session,

20
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:38,901
we're gonna talk about
how Sophos used Cribl

21
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:41,250
to modernize their data security

22
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,943
for their AWS data and other data sources.

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,260
So first things first, just
kind of put the agenda out here.

24
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,819
We're gonna talk about the
challenges that they faced,

25
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:53,010
the solution they came up with,

26
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,800
the outcomes that came from
this solution together,

27
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,180
lessons learned, best practices.

28
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,290
We're gonna do the best we can,

29
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,640
obviously channeling our
best Chris impression.

30
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,990
Quick demonstration, and
then questions and answers.

31
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,903
So please feel free to ask
us some questions at the end.

32
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:09,990
- So to tell you a
little bit about Sophos.

33
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,940
Sophos is a company

34
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,680
with an enormous footprint
across the world,

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,467
specializes in MDR, analysts and coverage,

36
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:18,630
600,000 customers,

37
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,847
just unbelievable wave of data.

38
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,230
And where Cribl comes in

39
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,570
is to help secure the infrastructure,

40
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,590
help secure the software,

41
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,140
help give Sophos the
ability to control costs,

42
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,690
but also provide better solutions.

43
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,190
So it's really important,

44
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,951
this is for a key global company,

45
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:36,300
and just one of the more phenomenal

46
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,650
security vendors out there.

47
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,350
- Absolutely. And about Cribl.

48
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,210
So Cribl is a late-stage startup.

49
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,779
We've been around for about seven years.

50
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:47,613
We have roughly, you know,
a thousand-plus employees.

51
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:50,130
We've been in the data
space for quite a while.

52
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,176
We kind of pioneered this data pipeline,

53
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:54,357
telemetry data solution.

54
00:01:54,357 --> 00:01:59,163
And we're backed by a lot of
leading venture capital firms.

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,120
- So the challenges that we all had was,

56
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,192
I mean, the exponential telemetry growth.

57
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,376
I mean, we see for most companies,

58
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:10,830
you know, 28, 30% is common.

59
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,660
Sophos, it's more like 60.

60
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,950
So much data.

61
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,220
And that generates a corresponding amount

62
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,990
of data coming off the systems

63
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,030
that needs to be collected,
needs to be secured,

64
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,800
for observability and security.

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,670
And just an incredible
diversity of sources as well.

66
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,590
You know, every cloud, every endpoint,

67
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,880
so many types of data.

68
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,150
And this is something we see
in the IT and security space,

69
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,350
it's the wave of data,

70
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,550
it's the diversity of data.

71
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,930
It's all coming out of there.

72
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,310
And finally, then cost.

73
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,250
And then just the legacy tool
sets just cannot keep up.

74
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,465
Sophos tried very, very hard

75
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:45,022
to build its own set of tools,

76
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:48,000
collection of commercial,
collection of open source.

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,630
And the engineering
cost wasn't sustainable,

78
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,220
the cost of SIEM wasn't sustainable,

79
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,546
the storage cost wasn't sustainable,

80
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:56,520
and they needed to look
for something different.

81
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,080
And this is where Sophos
then came to Cribl

82
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,700
to start looking for something new

83
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,490
and a way to solve these challenges.

84
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,323
- And this is a story

85
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:05,961
that we at Cribl have
heard many, many a time.

86
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:07,620
From what we see in the industry,

87
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,670
roughly 30% CAGR, year
of year growth of data.

88
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,590
Telemetry data is primarily
what we're talking about here,

89
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,150
logs, metrics, traces.

90
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,190
And there's also a
additional component here

91
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,190
where AI is starting to kind
of kick up even more data

92
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,050
that's being generated at scale.

93
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,230
And both of those are
kind of leading the charge

94
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,974
as far as how much data
is being generated.

95
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,790
But everybody's budget
typically doesn't grow

96
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,020
at the same rate.

97
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,690
What we're seeing is
that the major difference

98
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,430
between what the data growth looks like

99
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,620
and what their budgets
look like is significant.

100
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,235
And that's kind of where Cribl is found.

101
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:40,530
- Yeah, but add onto to that,

102
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,810
I mean, this is something
that we see a lot.

103
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,430
This has been going on
for quite some time.

104
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,190
The oldest conundrum in IT and security

105
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,840
is I got two terabytes of license

106
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,010
and 10 terabytes of data.

107
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,362
How do I make this work?

108
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:54,600
I never forget, just
before I discovered Cribl

109
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,880
completely by accident in 2018,

110
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,280
I get pulled into a meeting with my CIO

111
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,422
complaining about, "Well,
you're spending so much money."

112
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:02,970
And I thought I was doing pretty good

113
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,740
containing costs around 30%

114
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,565
when my login volume was growing 200%.

115
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,890
And the irony was, I'd
just come from a meeting

116
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,210
with a bunch of VPs complaining

117
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,279
about I wasn't giving them
enough data to do their job.

118
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,440
And so this is something we feel deeply,

119
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,000
we see everyone's out there

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,920
because, you know, you need more data,

121
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,720
you need to meet all the challenges,

122
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,982
but how do you maintain the cost?

123
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:25,230
And that was something that
was just really unique,

124
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,120
was being able to thread the needle

125
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,710
between manage your data,

126
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,210
but also have better quality.

127
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,292
Because at the end of the day,

128
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:33,450
high-quality data solves problems.

129
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,980
Less data doesn't solve problems.

130
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,231
Good data is what solves problems.

131
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:37,943
And that's where Cribl comes in.

132
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:39,960
- And that's kind of where Sophos came in

133
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,460
and started to see the value of Cribl.

134
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,293
- Right
- And with that,

135
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:43,860
they're able to start
to see these kind of-

136
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,170
- Exactly. And then the
modernization was huge.

137
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,540
Being able to start
replacing piece by piece.

138
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,996
Displacement costs are a
huge issue in any enterprise.

139
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:52,777
You have some vendor
that comes in and says,

140
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:54,750
"Yeah, you gotta replace
all that stuff right away.

141
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,355
You gotta install our agent everywhere."

142
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:58,650
And the cost of installing the agents,

143
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,390
like for me, you know, early on,

144
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,472
if I had had to put Cribl
agent on 200,000 endpoints,

145
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:04,765
it would not have happened.

146
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:07,620
But instead I was able to
start simply by the idea

147
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,410
of I could put a couple hundred
Stream servers in place,

148
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,624
use the sources I already
have, and start getting value

149
00:05:13,624 --> 00:05:16,440
and then grow my footprint over time.

150
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,300
So now I can manage my displacement costs

151
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,307
and get fast value.

152
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:21,180
And later on you'll see

153
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,490
just how completely
transformative that was.

154
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,680
And when Sophos then put Stream in place

155
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,392
and then they started to push
the Cribl Edge agent out,

156
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:29,790
a piece at a time.

157
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,673
So they were able to then manage the cost,

158
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:34,650
but still get value from
the entire solution.

159
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,730
And then they started working

160
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,572
for optimizing for volume and cost.

161
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:40,313
This is where I think data
tiering is incredibly important.

162
00:05:40,313 --> 00:05:44,100
You always have to think about
that, "Here's my data set,"

163
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,390
and this is where people get in trouble

164
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,130
with monolithic SIEM vendors

165
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,343
is you have to put all your
data in the same place.

166
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:51,030
Typically, your SIEM is gonna run you

167
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,560
about a dollar a gig.

168
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,097
And you have to always ask yourself,

169
00:05:54,097 --> 00:05:55,800
"Does all the data in my SIEM,

170
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,850
is it worth a dollar a gig?"

171
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,890
And more often than not,
that's not the case.

172
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,087
So you always have to look at,

173
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:02,070
you know, is it worth a dollar a gig?

174
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,390
And if it's not worth a dollar a gig,

175
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,236
we need to start looking at
putting it somewhere else.

176
00:06:06,236 --> 00:06:07,920
You work with a lot of customers.

177
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,500
What do you see especially
with data tiering solutions?

178
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,570
That makes sense, you
know, for most customers.

179
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,289
- Absolutely. I mean it starts with

180
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,920
the legacy solutions
that they have in place.

181
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,060
So we back up a little bit

182
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,010
and say, "Look, I have a
bunch of Syslog servers."

183
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,960
How many of you love
going into Syslog servers

184
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,854
and modify configuration
files multiple times?

185
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:27,930
That's not exactly what I call a fun job.

186
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,590
So here, Cribl can kind
of put itself in place

187
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,810
to help fix that one problem.

188
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,760
And then slowly look at your WEF.

189
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,536
If you're trying to
collect Windows events:

190
00:06:37,536 --> 00:06:40,627
WEF, WEC, that's a joy to do.

191
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:41,790
"Oh, I got the wrong certificate,

192
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,350
the wrong configuration set up."

193
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,870
So here's another solution
that Cribl can come help with.

194
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,280
And piece by piece,

195
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,714
when you start putting
these things together,

196
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:50,190
then you can start going down the path of,

197
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,650
now that I have all the data that I need,

198
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,480
or at least, a subset of the data,

199
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,340
I can start optimizing that data.

200
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,650
So all the debug files,
all the debug logs,

201
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,160
all the things that are generating
so much waste in my SIEM

202
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,170
and so much waste in my infrastructure,

203
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,432
I can start to, you know, tune that out

204
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:08,790
and make it so that I'm
getting way more signal

205
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,900
than I am noise.

206
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,593
And that's where we start
to see a big plus for Cribl.

207
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:13,800
- And that's a key piece.

208
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,700
By having Stream in the middle,
being able to understand,

209
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,080
okay, this is my detection event,

210
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,365
this is my IR event, this
is my compliance event.

211
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:23,130
Being able to understand your data

212
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,931
and then route accordingly gives
you that power to now scale

213
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:27,960
so that you can make sure
that, "Hey, you know,

214
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,790
we're gonna drive the best quality data,

215
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,130
we're gonna power our
detections, get the best results,

216
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,060
but still maintain control,
have all the other data."

217
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,245
I think last night I
thought I put it really well

218
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:40,360
with the idea that there's
the data you have to have,

219
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,940
there's the data you might want,

220
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,020
and there's the data you don't want,

221
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,370
but you have to take it anyway.

222
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,642
- Yep.
- Split it up like that.

223
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:49,110
Start using Stream, then
start putting the data

224
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,510
where it starts matching cost and value.

225
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,750
And so then that way you can then focus on

226
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,790
how do I get more value from my SIEM?

227
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,740
And this is another
big project for Sophos,

228
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,497
was migrating off their SIEM.

229
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:01,560
SIEM's are risky.

230
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,350
You see it all the time where
companies will routinely,

231
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,060
you know, come to us, you
know, we spent a year,

232
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,038
we spent two years trying
to migrate to a SIEM.

233
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:10,080
We started problems we couldn't migrate.

234
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,030
Now we have two SIEMs, we don't like this.

235
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,230
And this is the thing that the idea

236
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,513
about Stream was so powerful.

237
00:08:14,513 --> 00:08:16,373
This is something I discovered early on.

238
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:18,030
This is the same thing with Sophos.

239
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,440
The idea of my data's coming through,

240
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,564
I can put a copy of my
data to my legacy SIEM,

241
00:08:22,564 --> 00:08:25,470
I don't disrupt my
posture, nothing changes.

242
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,680
Then I fork a copy of that
data over to my new SIEM.

243
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,020
So now you have the
entire production volume

244
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,040
going to your new SIEM.

245
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,780
You can now start building your content.

246
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,132
You can now start validating.

247
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:36,980
Did my legacy SIEM get a hit?

248
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,285
Did my new SIEM get a hit?

249
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,080
You know, back and forth, back and forth

250
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,987
to make sure that your content works.

251
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:44,910
This is a underappreciated issue.

252
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,340
SIEMs are complicated, you gotta validate.

253
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,960
You have to cover your Edge cases.

254
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,050
You need more data.

255
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,802
So having Stream in place
makes that possible.

256
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:55,867
And we just recently with
a really insurance company,

257
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:59,520
they were on a legacy SIEM
provider for about 10 years.

258
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,990
We helped them migrate
to a next gen SIEM option

259
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,823
in about five months.

260
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:06,300
This is something that previously

261
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,950
just would not have been possible.

262
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,840
And so we were so proud to then bring this

263
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,340
and help Sophos do the same.

264
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,540
Anything you wanna add about that?

265
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,394
- Oh, absolutely. So a lot of the times

266
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:16,276
when you're talking
about a SIEM migration,

267
00:09:16,276 --> 00:09:18,426
you talk about this hard cutover, right?

268
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:20,252
Where you're saying, "Okay,
I'm on my legacy SIEM

269
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:21,815
and now I'm gonna go to a new SIEM."

270
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:23,520
- Yeah, the vaya con dios moment.

271
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,690
- Oh yes.
- Yes.

272
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,922
- Oh yes. So all of a sudden
you turn on their agents,

273
00:09:27,922 --> 00:09:31,500
their collection things and
going on and none of the

274
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,363
detections work.
- Exactly.

275
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,892
- None of the dashboards light up

276
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:38,100
and now you're kind of up
some creek without a paddle.

277
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,890
Here, with Cribl, you're, you know,

278
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,960
forking the data across multiple SIEMs.

279
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,160
Actually we had a couple customers

280
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,792
that have tried multiple SIEMs in a POC

281
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:49,620
to pick the one that actually
worked best for them.

282
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,130
So again, giving you that
choice and control of your data,

283
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,420
you can see that in any SIEM
that you want to try out.

284
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,608
And it leads to customers

285
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:02,670
having a much more satisfied
approach to getting their SIEM

286
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,290
and then being able to cut
over to it in a very soft

287
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,320
and kind of easy manner.

288
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,140
- Yeah, we've had a number
of customers that will...

289
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,770
they'll cut over to the new SIEM

290
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,243
but they'll leave the
data to the old SIEM going

291
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:15,480
like 1Ciso just like, I wanna
see what happens for 30 days.

292
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,927
I wanna make sure that we
didn't forget something.

293
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:19,526
And it was really powerful
'cause at the end of the day,

294
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:20,940
when they're ready, it literally

295
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,444
go to a button inside a
Stream, you turn it off

296
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:25,440
and you're done, and it
makes that transition

297
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,660
to a new platform so much easier.

298
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,180
It's easier in your teams.
It takes the risk away.

299
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,186
And also from a cost
perspective, it's not unheard of.

300
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:36,060
You know, even for a
small SIEM implementation,

301
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,250
you're gonna be paying,
you know, a million a year.

302
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,510
And the idea is that...

303
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,650
I'm not gonna be able to get value

304
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,070
from my SIEM implementation
for 8, 9, 10 months, a year.

305
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,050
So that's an entire million dollars,

306
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,030
potentially, you're not
getting any value from.

307
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,520
And being able to accelerate
that process to say,

308
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,070
go to, you know, five
months instead of a year,

309
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,690
you're now recovering that money,

310
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,910
you're now recovering that
value for your company.

311
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,430
- Yeah, especially if you're
talking about the AR model now.

312
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,680
Before it was like, okay,
I paid for a license,

313
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,379
I got that license, I could
let it sit on the shelf.

314
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,160
If I buy a SIEM now, I
have three years at least,

315
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,550
maybe a year to get that
thing to be valuable for me.

316
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,030
So if I can accelerate that
so that I can actually start

317
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,950
getting value from it from day one.

318
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,500
And thankfully with Cloud,
it makes it a lot faster,

319
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,390
'cause I remember the days
with Splunk where you had

320
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,250
to go set up indexers, set up searches

321
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,180
and do that fun dance.

322
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,597
Here you have everything
running in the cloud.

323
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:31,350
Only thing you're missing is
getting the data to the SIEM.

324
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,540
Now we accelerate that,
you start seeing value,

325
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,570
your boss sees value, your
boss's boss sees value.

326
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,160
Suddenly that investment in the SIEM

327
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,350
and investment in Cribl is well paid for.

328
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,300
- Right. And that's why we
always talk about the idea

329
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,881
of solving problems with better data.

330
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:46,920
You know, options. That's where
choice to control comes in.

331
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,530
And this, it's an important concept.

332
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,900
So, but always remember the
idea about data tiering,

333
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,141
matching cost and value,

334
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:55,500
and then de-risking your SIEM migration.

335
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,300
There's nothing worse than
being stuck with a SIEM

336
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,290
that you don't want.

337
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,389
And so this is the idea, is
make it a modular component,

338
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:03,051
gives you a lot more options
at the end of the day.

339
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:07,500
- And now here's kind of
the way that it all happens.

340
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,100
So what I'm gonna show you,
this is our portfolio for Cribl.

341
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,390
We have Edge

342
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,580
that effectively sits over
here on the source side.

343
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,581
So if you have an agent, great,

344
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,919
you can still use your agent
to get data into Cribl.

345
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,910
We can also use Edge, which
is kind of a replacement

346
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,660
for an agent to get
that same data transited

347
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,417
through Cribl Stream or
directly to your destination.

348
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:30,145
Then in the middle is our
flagship product, Cribl Stream.

349
00:12:30,145 --> 00:12:32,400
This is where the magic happens.

350
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,190
We effectively are using that
to collect data from sources,

351
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,800
any typical protocol we
can collect the data from.

352
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,682
We can then transform it, route
it to multiple destinations,

353
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:41,978
enrich it.

354
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:44,130
We can also look for PII

355
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,950
and if there's any sensitive
data, take it out, encrypt it,

356
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,720
so that it doesn't land in your SIEM.

357
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,160
Great story about that one.

358
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,650
We had a very large company
that was sending PII

359
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,710
to their SIEM, big, no-no.

360
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,454
And they had to basically go back,

361
00:12:57,454 --> 00:13:00,978
take the data out of their
SIEM, this was a fun one,

362
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:04,300
replay it with Cribl
after they sanitized it,

363
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,020
Cribl was able to sanitize the
data, put it back into SIEM,

364
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,470
everybody was happy,
compliance was restored.

365
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,930
- What a nightmare.
- I know.

366
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,510
And then the other two
components here, very briefly,

367
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,800
we do have a Lake offering.

368
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,595
So this allows you to basically leverage

369
00:13:18,595 --> 00:13:21,690
object storage at scale
with your organization,

370
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,790
with built-in role-based access control.

371
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,950
This makes it so that
lighting up an S3 bucket

372
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,060
is typically fun in an organization

373
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,680
where you have to ask
for the right policy,

374
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,495
the right roles, the
right retention policies,

375
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:36,621
All of that's built into Cribl Lake.

376
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:38,790
We also have the ability to accelerate

377
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,620
that data in Cribl Lake with Lakehouse.

378
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,991
So you have fast search.

379
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:44,820
And finally, you have
Cribl Search, which kind of

380
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,980
is the umbrella across
all of these components

381
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,815
that allows you to query the
data at rest, through APIs,

382
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:51,305
a lot of very fun things.

383
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:53,520
We actually have a new
integration with Security Hub,

384
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,283
so come by our booth, we'll
tell you more about it.

385
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,250
- And so how Sophos is
using the Cribl portfolio,

386
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,263
starting with Edge, and this is...

387
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:05,670
I've managed thousands, I
mean, tens of thousands,

388
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,895
probably close to a million
agents in my career.

389
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:09,967
Managing agents is a true pain.

390
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:12,540
There's probably few
things that waste more time

391
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,310
than trying to manage agents at scale.

392
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,730
And what I just love about Edge is

393
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,940
it centralizes all that complexity.

394
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,580
Get it installed. You now
have a policy based way

395
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,230
to manage everything from the same place.

396
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,230
You can upgrade it, monitor
it, understand your data,

397
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,360
you can customize it, add
scripts, do everything you need,

398
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,650
all from one place.

399
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,660
Gives you scale, it gives you ease of use.

400
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,390
And most importantly, when I
was an engineering manager,

401
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,167
the idea is that how you can then...

402
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,953
you know, I can have
junior people manage this.

403
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:40,710
I don't need someone senior who's managed,

404
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,072
who's figured out the
YAML syntax of the day.

405
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:47,474
Just make it easy, give you
what you need, get your data,

406
00:14:47,474 --> 00:14:50,100
and move your engineering
time off your endpoints

407
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,970
and move your engineering time

408
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,800
to getting value from your data.

409
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,410
Also using Cribl Stream, so
Cribl Stream in the middle.

410
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,110
So Cribl Stream is getting all the data,

411
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,850
all the sources, including from Edge

412
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,661
and then giving that ability
to now parse, enrich,

413
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:04,725
tier this data, route this data

414
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:06,630
as we share it across the enterprise.

415
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,880
This is something at the end
as we start going through

416
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,210
our demo is to start showing
the value of sharing data

417
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,050
throughout the enterprise.

418
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,825
I think that's really underappreciated.

419
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:16,680
Every time that you share data,

420
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,036
you're not compounding the value.

421
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:20,548
Take something as prosaic as firewall logs

422
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:22,687
can help solve problems
for the SOC, the NOC,

423
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:25,350
or DevOps team, your
network engineering team.

424
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,810
You may laugh, but you would
be surprised how oftentimes

425
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,972
network engineers don't have
access to their own logs.

426
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,850
And so these are the kind of
things by just share data,

427
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,970
get more value from it and
Stream's in a unique position

428
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,090
to share data across the
enterprise and do it safely.

429
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,080
I think that's a key.

430
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,790
As we work with security teams,

431
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,745
the idea that, you know, here's
the pieces we can't share,

432
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:45,330
here's the pieces we can

433
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,090
and Stream gives that ability to do so.

434
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,950
I've really been impressed
with how sophisticated

435
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,127
Sophos has gotten and just
in being able to make sure

436
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:55,160
that they're maximizing
the value of their data.

437
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,079
'Cause then at the end of
the day, you have to go back

438
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,506
to your business and
show what's the point.

439
00:15:59,506 --> 00:16:02,338
You gave me all this money,
how did I benefit the business?

440
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:06,960
How did I move the business
forward? How did I save money?

441
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,582
How did I enable new capabilities?

442
00:16:08,582 --> 00:16:11,023
And when you start speaking
the language of business,

443
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:13,950
business leaders are much
more likely to invest in you,

444
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,090
invest in your program.

445
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,293
It's just really
important. Always remember,

446
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:18,567
you gotta move the
business forward every day.

447
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:21,178
- And one more thing on this slide,

448
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:22,650
actually, two more things.

449
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,770
Number one, there's
actually AI built into Cribl

450
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,879
where it keeps the operator
in the whole process here.

451
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:32,070
We're not gonna put
you through a black box

452
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,990
and say, "Hey look, magic's gonna happen."

453
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,770
We're gonna help guide the
operator to get their job done.

454
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,010
So the AI components allow operators

455
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,480
to build a proper pipeline

456
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,820
and you're right in the middle
to make sure it's done right,

457
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,580
to maybe write a natural
language query that makes sense

458
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,660
that you can actually pull data

459
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,650
and understand what the data is

460
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,180
that you're collecting in Cribl Lake.

461
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,380
So we have all of that.

462
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,350
And the best part about all of this

463
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,650
is that you can actually
try this out yourself today

464
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,262
with a free Cribl Cloud
tenant and, you know,

465
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:05,326
see the value for yourself
with your own data.

466
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:08,100
We do have a free tier up to
a terabyte of data per day.

467
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,036
So I wanna make sure
you remember that part.

468
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:12,120
- Yeah, we gotta remember
to say AI a lot too.

469
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,960
- Yes.
- I mean, look at

470
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,390
someone counting in the audience
how many times we say AI.

471
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,440
So we gotta, you know.

472
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,057
But that's part of the issue,
and I think this is something

473
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,797
I'm really pleased with,
Cribl's approach to AI.

474
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:23,008
How can you use AI to help your users

475
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,440
just get more value from the tooling?

476
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,200
Or the search interface is wonderful.

477
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,690
I owned a large searching platform

478
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,299
and had 5,000 people using it,

479
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,070
and keeping everyone
trained was a nightmare.

480
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,227
And so having AI in
place for a Cribl search,

481
00:17:37,227 --> 00:17:39,600
the idea is, you have
your own personal helper

482
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,610
of how to find your data,
how to search your data,

483
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,520
suggest a better query,
a miracle upon miracle.

484
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,140
When you make a dashboard,
it's gonna help you make

485
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,670
an optimized dashboard by default.

486
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,720
You're not gonna have to know about

487
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,340
the magic of a base search.

488
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,117
And so these are the kind
of things that just help,

489
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:54,720
help just get more
value from your tooling.

490
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,580
And this is also, as
we're starting to roll out

491
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,042
more agentic workflows, to now
find the data that matters.

492
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,910
There's a background
helper that we're about

493
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,250
to load up into Stream
to help look for data

494
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,720
that might be of concern.

495
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,010
You know, AWS access keys, PAI, PHI,

496
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,230
all sorts of different
shapes of sensitive data

497
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,090
that you may not know are there.

498
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,480
It's just little by little
help solving these big problems

499
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,010
to help make you more productive

500
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,320
and at the end of the day,
get more value from your data.

501
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,180
- Yeah, one of my favorite
features by the way,

502
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,770
this is a little side note,
is within Cribl there's,

503
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,220
whenever you make a configuration
change, it's a Git repo

504
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,260
behind the scenes that gets updated.

505
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,540
Normally, it gives you a
little text box to say,

506
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,240
okay, go ahead and type out
exactly the changes you made.

507
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,975
Forget that. There's a little AI button

508
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:40,448
that you push that'll actually
tell you all the changes

509
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:43,271
that were made in that
configuration modification.

510
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:47,490
Puts it in the Git notes
or the commit notes

511
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,250
and there you go, simple
little things like that.

512
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,657
So that's six months from
now when someone goes back

513
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:53,760
and say, what changes happened here?

514
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,290
You actually have legit notes.
Not I configured Cribl, send.

515
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,700
It's actually something useful.

516
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,710
- I know. I spent years
yelling at my engineers

517
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,930
and code reviewers
about not writing notes,

518
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,700
and now you have a little
button. Makes it easy.

519
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,912
I mean they would literally
write me notes about, you know,

520
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:09,510
FU, because I'm not doing
this, you know, kind of thing.

521
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,536
So I mean these are the
ideas that, you know,

522
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:13,213
use AI to make your lives easier,

523
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:15,027
make the tools easier, and get more value,

524
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:17,018
and especially get it faster.

525
00:19:17,018 --> 00:19:18,390
Let's talk about the outcomes.

526
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,007
And this is something I think was just...

527
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:22,170
and this is why Chris
did such an amazing job

528
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,400
with rolling out Cribl.

529
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,040
I mean 48% cost savings
within the first 30 days.

530
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,034
That's awesome.

531
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:30,567
And this is the idea, being
able to show your bosses,

532
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,721
you know, that dramatic rise in cost.

533
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:35,220
Here's how we can put fast, immediate,

534
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,838
and real controls around it.

535
00:19:36,838 --> 00:19:39,390
And this is where a governance comes in,

536
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,100
'cause there's a whole
program to make sure

537
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,180
to look at your data.

538
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,980
Always look at your IT and security data.

539
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,680
It's changing, it's churning.
Make sure you understand that.

540
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,960
So constant looking, constant
reporting what's there.

541
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,080
Data independence was one
thing that really impressed

542
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,380
from a strategy standpoint that
Sophos implemented early on.

543
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,150
The idea from a first
principle standpoint,

544
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,571
we want our data to be portable.

545
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:02,430
We want it to be be useful,
we want it to be high quality.

546
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,330
And this is the idea.

547
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,547
Data independence I think is so important,

548
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:08,010
'cause too often with
the modern SIEM vendors,

549
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,170
you got a proprietary agent
talking a proprietary code

550
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,910
or protocol to a proprietary backend

551
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,556
that runs a proprietary search language.

552
00:20:13,556 --> 00:20:16,710
The idea, by making all this
portable and independent,

553
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,150
now it's my data.

554
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,830
It's not my vendor's data, it's my data.

555
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,080
I can now have my data
inside of a data lake.

556
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,424
I can now use something like
Cribl Stream to do a replay

557
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:28,050
to put my data into Splunk,
Elastic, Databricks,

558
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,250
Snowflake, take your pick.

559
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,870
I can use that data anywhere I want to.

560
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,219
It's no longer stuck.

561
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:36,050
And so, I think it's a very powerful idea

562
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,064
is of how we can get more
value from your data,

563
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:42,420
bring the discipline
that you see all the time

564
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,600
in BI institutions of business value.

565
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,120
Bring that discipline over
into the IT and security side,

566
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,830
you can see enormous value.

567
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,480
This is where we started in governance.

568
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,890
Secure by design is something, I think,

569
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,876
Sophos is very proud of.

570
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:58,230
They spend a lot of time making
sure that their software,

571
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,050
their hardware are secure,
unlike some other vendors

572
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,520
that seem to make an RCE,

573
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,380
you know, a feature instead of a bug.

574
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,790
They're very careful about that.

575
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,830
And so that's something they
do early on by making sure

576
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,438
they're instrumenting
everything coming into Cribl.

577
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:12,516
And they're looking for
things all the time in order

578
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:16,140
to make sure everything we
release is secure by design.

579
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,820
And finally, the idea of, you know,

580
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,454
so we've talked about better data,

581
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:22,290
now we can maintain cost effectiveness.

582
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,350
So we're showing value but also
managing within our budget.

583
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,952
And that's very, very important.

584
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,620
- And one thing about cost effectiveness,

585
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,420
I just wanna kind of
double down on this one.

586
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,060
Typically, if you remember
the first chart I showed you

587
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,589
30% CAGR growth and it's,
you know, exponential.

588
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:37,260
One of the things that you're trying to do

589
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,480
with this data is you're
trying to basically make that,

590
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,410
you know, hockey stick chart
look a lot more manageable,

591
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,560
a lot more like your IT
budget where it's predictable

592
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,530
so you can be taking data
that you didn't get before,

593
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,545
your proxy logs, your DNS
logs, all those rich value

594
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:56,100
data sources that you're just can't afford

595
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,400
to put into your data destinations

596
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,840
actually affordable again.

597
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,000
So this is kind of a big win that you have

598
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,110
with something like Cribl.

599
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,760
- Yeah, and that's really important.

600
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,740
So I'm gonna double down even more.

601
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,440
The idea is that you're
rarely gonna have less,

602
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,730
you're rarely gonna have less.

603
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,380
So you have your established budget.

604
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,213
You're getting in trouble

605
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:17,400
because you're going 25% more every year.

606
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,634
If you can get it down to 5%
because most businesses accept,

607
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:24,360
there's gonna be 5, 6, 7,
8%, that's just unavoidable.

608
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,680
Thirty percent's a problem.

609
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,817
You're rarely gonna get to less.

610
00:22:26,817 --> 00:22:29,490
And so the idea is flatten
out that cost curve

611
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,870
and that way you can then talk about

612
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,640
here's how we can get
more value from our data.

613
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,260
Collect the right data, control it,

614
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,940
but still maintain your costs.

615
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,773
- Absolutely.
- Yep.

616
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,730
- And now one of the most important things

617
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,961
I think most practitioners
here are gonna come for

618
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:43,920
is the lesson learned and
best practices for this.

619
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,166
So here's what Sophos was able to learn,

620
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:49,070
- Right, this is something I think

621
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,270
is important for everyone, have a plan.

622
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,220
You're not gonna get a single control plan

623
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,720
across all your data on day one.

624
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,010
Just not gonna do it.

625
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,579
Have a plan, a long term plan.

626
00:22:57,579 --> 00:22:59,550
The idea of byte by byte,

627
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,230
we're gonna advance across the enterprise,

628
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,218
across every line of business

629
00:23:02,218 --> 00:23:04,710
to have a consistent strategy
to collect your data.

630
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,240
It is always important.

631
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,170
Think long term.

632
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,830
You know, plan long term
and then and attack that

633
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,140
little by little because it
makes what would ordinarily be

634
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,522
an enormous project a lot more digestible.

635
00:23:15,522 --> 00:23:16,977
And so this is one of the big lists.

636
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:19,620
It's important to have that visibility.

637
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,090
Imagine you have a data plane

638
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,190
across your entire
organization where I can see

639
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,480
where my data's coming from.

640
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,971
I can see where my data's going to.

641
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,740
I can detect if a data source is down.

642
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,960
I can detect if the
data source is degraded.

643
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,194
I mean anyone who's been
in any kind of incident

644
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:35,662
has figured out all of a sudden,

645
00:23:35,662 --> 00:23:37,380
my data source stopped working,

646
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,418
it stopped working three months ago

647
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:39,780
and the only time you found out is

648
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,142
'cause now I need to look at it.

649
00:23:41,142 --> 00:23:43,538
It's typically very difficult to monitor.

650
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:46,230
So having that centralized data plane

651
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,210
gives you a lot of options.

652
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,740
Filtering and optimizing data early,

653
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,150
I think, is important too

654
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,513
where this is also from
a long-term perspective.

655
00:23:55,652 --> 00:23:57,156
And as you look at your data,

656
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:59,190
start building up a
long-term backlog of okay,

657
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,570
this is what we want to do with our data.

658
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,556
Here's what we can do.
Here's what we want to do.

659
00:24:02,556 --> 00:24:04,020
One of the big struggles is,

660
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,610
especially with data that's being used,

661
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,990
is you gotta work with your users

662
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,131
to update your content
to reflect new formats.

663
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:11,938
And so you have to have
this careful planning

664
00:24:11,938 --> 00:24:14,820
and communication process,
like I did with my team.

665
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,350
I had these thousands of users.

666
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,390
So we had communications of...

667
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,180
every couple of days we
started rolling out changes.

668
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,047
We notified our users,
we managed our risk,

669
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:25,080
and kept moving forward.

670
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,360
And so just make sure you
have a plan to do that.

671
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,380
Another big key as well,

672
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,610
and this is something I really appreciate

673
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,330
with Sophos going into
the data tiering is,

674
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,440
start looking at the
data you're not using.

675
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,639
I will guarantee you if
you look inside your SIEM,

676
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:39,450
you're gonna find 20, 25% of the data

677
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,400
that's not getting touched in 90 days.

678
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,200
That's the first thing you do.

679
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,168
If you're not using it,
don't put it in your SIEM.

680
00:24:45,168 --> 00:24:47,190
Move it into your data lake

681
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,940
and now you freed up 25% of your SIEM,

682
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,100
and without any kind of disruption.

683
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,200
So just really look at that long term.

684
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,020
And I think that first
principle everyone talks about

685
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,750
with data tiering, is match cost to value.

686
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,420
Is the data worth the dollar
a gig? If it is, absolutely.

687
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,470
That's what the SIEM is for.

688
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,020
If it's not, put it somewhere else.

689
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,610
And finally, the phase migration approach,

690
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,930
which we've talked about.

691
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,860
Anything you wanna add?

692
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,240
- Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know,

693
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,334
on that data tiering piece.

694
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:14,400
- Yeah.
- You know,

695
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,130
most SIEMs are running
on very expensive disc

696
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,075
and without even talking about
license costs, the disc cost,

697
00:25:21,075 --> 00:25:24,558
the people cost to get that
data in, it's not cheap.

698
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,026
And if you can save on those as well as,

699
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,490
you know, potentially a license help,

700
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:33,750
I think that's where you get
a real big win just long term.

701
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,830
- Yeah, we've seen this repeatedly.

702
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,170
Even with companies that
have an ELA for their SIEM,

703
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,790
for example, they're still saving

704
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,230
tens of millions of dollars

705
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,780
by moving data that they're
not using out of their SIEM.

706
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,120
And that's just from the
storage of compute cost alone.

707
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,600
Especially if you're
hosting yourself in cloud,

708
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,750
the costs are just astronomical
from an opus perspective.

709
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,580
So I always take a really hard look at...

710
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,350
and from a governor's
perspective every day,

711
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,200
understand what people are
using, what people are not using

712
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
in order to just have some controls there,

713
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,688
and then also, make it part
of your onboarding process.

714
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:06,390
You know, the idea that you
have to be able to say no.

715
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,959
Like, this data has no value,
we're not putting it in here.

716
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:11,850
This is where the governance
and policy process

717
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,691
is really key, to just
help provide answers.

718
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:16,223
'Cause otherwise you're
gonna drown in data,

719
00:26:16,223 --> 00:26:18,270
you're gonna drown in cost

720
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,337
and eventually you're
gonna have that meeting

721
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:22,249
with your leadership, who aren't happy.

722
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,020
- And I will say this, when
you have a centralized approach

723
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,060
to this login solution, that
immediately gives you options.

724
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,280
That also gives you the little
more control of this data.

725
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,164
And you can make it
repeatable so that you,

726
00:26:34,164 --> 00:26:37,691
the security operations
person, is not going in

727
00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:40,590
and having to build these
pipelines, build these things.

728
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,640
You can actually push this down

729
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,949
to maybe the application owners.

730
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:45,728
So now they have the ability
with the tooling in place

731
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:49,230
to build these repeatable
processes to onboard applications,

732
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,570
onboard things on their own.

733
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,560
And so it becomes less of a
burden on you to do it, so.

734
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,310
- Yeah, and I think that's a big thing

735
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,700
as teams mature using Cribl's
tooling, be it the ability

736
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,580
to expand and become a
service owner becomes key.

737
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,590
And this is also, I encourage everyone,

738
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,060
it's not just a security solution,

739
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,400
it's also an IT and
observability solution.

740
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,393
Huge chunks of data.

741
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:12,540
And the thing is, I've seen
it, there's a lot of crossover.

742
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,910
Lots of security data
gets used by ops teams.

743
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,142
Lots of ops data gets
used by security teams.

744
00:27:17,142 --> 00:27:19,623
And having it under a
common control mechanism

745
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:22,380
gives you a lot of power
and a lot of flexibility.

746
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,053
- Absolutely. Now let's take a look

747
00:27:24,053 --> 00:27:25,530
at what the tool looks like.

748
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,520
- Yeah, this is really fun.

749
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,530
So this is the dashboard that Sophos uses.

750
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,390
So think of it as a heads up dashboard

751
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,780
to understand what's my
consumption is, are things working,

752
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,252
are we seeing load issues?

753
00:27:36,252 --> 00:27:38,022
They have a much more detailed dashboard.

754
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:39,750
And this is something I encourage everyone

755
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,023
to take a look at Cribl Cloud.

756
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:43,200
We have a new product called Insights,

757
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,250
which is gonna give you a much more

758
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,690
expanded view of this data.

759
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,760
It's AI-driven and it's
also gonna give you

760
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,310
a lot broader view of your data.

761
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,547
And so this is a very
natural way of expanding

762
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,187
what we're doing with their data.

763
00:27:56,187 --> 00:27:58,680
And so before, I mean
this is all very blind.

764
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,123
This is something Sophos
really struggled with.

765
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:02,250
It's something if a data source stopped,

766
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,630
they just typically didn't know about it

767
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,280
until they needed the data.

768
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,300
And so this is the idea is, you know,

769
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,133
how do we bring in this data?

770
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:08,475
How do we get this value?

771
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:11,490
And you can see the data coming in

772
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,960
versus the data going out.

773
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,830
And so they're able to
get just a lot of value,

774
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,123
you know, going forward.

775
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,900
- Great point. And obviously
this you can see on your own

776
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,790
Cribl Cloud tenant when you
go download and play with it,

777
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,440
right?
- Absolutely.

778
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,966
And this is something just really great.

779
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:30,158
So from the Cribl website,

780
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:32,910
you can get a free Cribl Cloud
tenant, click a few clicks,

781
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,020
you're gonna have the full suite.

782
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,860
So that's gonna be Lake,

783
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,860
that's gonna be Search, Edge, and Stream.

784
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,330
We also have options for
what we call our sandboxes.

785
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,200
So sandbox.cribl.io, where
click another button,

786
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,640
you can have a guided use case

787
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,280
through using the actual
tools that are hosted in AWS.

788
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,040
So you can get an idea,
does this make sense for me.

789
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,909
Try to address this so you
have several use cases.

790
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:54,750
That's the big thing, does it make sense?

791
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,169
You wanna get your hands on the product?

792
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:57,883
No one's gonna bother you.

793
00:28:57,883 --> 00:29:00,458
You're not gonna have to
go through sales to get it.

794
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:02,100
You will be able to get access.

795
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,600
You just want to be able
to put this out there

796
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,313
and make it as easy as possible.

797
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,110
So this is really fun.

798
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,480
And so the idea of first
we talk about is...

799
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,800
we have what's called a route.

800
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,020
So as data's flowing through the system,

801
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,610
it's flowing through the system,

802
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,889
starts from the top to the bottom,

803
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:17,700
you're now looking for a filter

804
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,350
and you can see where
the idea that we're using

805
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,320
looking for user off events
and we're now gonna redirect

806
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,503
any event that contains this string,

807
00:29:23,503 --> 00:29:25,683
we're gonna put this into a pipeline.

808
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,590
Do you have anything
you wanna add about...

809
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,060
Common, like best practices?

810
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,770
- Yeah, I mean for the most part,

811
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,300
when you start with Cribl you'll see,

812
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,468
oh, you know, filter equals true.

813
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:36,720
So you're basically all your data.

814
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,939
But as you start to get refined

815
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:40,560
and understand how to properly
route the data based on

816
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,407
what you need, you can
start building your filters.

817
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:44,940
One of the best features
of Cribl, which is what

818
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,620
kind of sold me when I was
kind of coming to Cribl,

819
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,453
is the fact that they have helper buttons

820
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,938
on each one of these steps.

821
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:54,000
It'll actually pull in the
documentation, still have the UI,

822
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,860
but I have the documentation
sitting right next to you.

823
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,817
So it can actually do, you know,

824
00:29:57,817 --> 00:30:01,800
"Oh, how do I do a JavaScript
filter in regular expression?

825
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,440
Here's how I do that."
So very, very helpful.

826
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,420
- And one thing I wanna point out of this,

827
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,830
and this is something that's common.

828
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:11,846
So Sophos drives from this
one route, drive detections,

829
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:14,888
drive audit, drive compliance,
and so that's that idea

830
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:17,640
that I'm looking for pieces.

831
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,170
And this is something I
think is misunderstood.

832
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,145
You see a lot of times like

833
00:30:20,145 --> 00:30:21,958
we're gonna do detections of the Stream.

834
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,690
More often than not, what you're doing is,

835
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,904
is you're picking out interesting data

836
00:30:24,904 --> 00:30:27,286
and highlighting, this may be important

837
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:29,847
in order to stitch it together
on the back end of your SIEM.

838
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:31,200
And that's one of the
thing Sophos has done

839
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,920
a really nice job of finding
those interesting events

840
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,294
and then raising the
visibility to their SOC

841
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,720
with their new backend SIEM tool.

842
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,090
But then from an auto perspective,
they're now retaining it,

843
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,430
driving it into their analytics platform.

844
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,263
So now they can query it

845
00:30:45,263 --> 00:30:46,881
and understand it from a higher level.

846
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:50,400
And the idea is, you don't have
to do this all in one place.

847
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,870
And this is, I think, the perfect example

848
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,450
of breaking it apart and
making it more service-based

849
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,900
to give you more flexibility.

850
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,730
- And here you can basically
see kind of the progression.

851
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,470
They're adding multiple routes,

852
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,991
they're adding multiple kind of filters

853
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,550
so that they can properly
diagnose the data,

854
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,040
send it down to the right
pipeline, leveraging PACS,

855
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,210
which we'll get to in a minute,

856
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,040
which kind of just helps
accelerate the adoption

857
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,471
of these data sources that
also make it repeatable.

858
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,806
- And one of the cool things
that they're doing as well is

859
00:31:15,806 --> 00:31:18,120
they're pulling data
for their next firewall.

860
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,800
They're now adding an enrichment to it.

861
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,725
I think it's a very
underappreciated part of

862
00:31:21,725 --> 00:31:23,670
a better data story.

863
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,250
As data comes through,
let's make it better.

864
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,597
Let's add context to it.

865
00:31:27,597 --> 00:31:29,910
And one thing I did, this
is from an IT perspective,

866
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,410
is we started adding in playbook.

867
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,770
So we had a well-recognized
error message we would add in.

868
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:39,510
By using a lookup, we'd add
in a link to the wiki playbook

869
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,270
that then the NOC team
would use to then react.

870
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,836
And we did the same thing with security.

871
00:31:43,836 --> 00:31:45,810
So we're always, how
do we make data better?

872
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,700
How do we make 'em more actionable?

873
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,790
And this is a really great
look at how they're doing

874
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,233
it with their firewall tool.

875
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,090
And you can see as it's coming through,

876
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,037
that you're now you're sharing data.

877
00:31:59,037 --> 00:32:01,200
And so the idea is, so start with the top

878
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,610
and then this notice that...

879
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,260
there's a little button called final.

880
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,540
And that's the idea is, once
the data hits the right filter,

881
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,670
it's finalized, it doesn't follow through.

882
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,503
One of the fun things you can always do is

883
00:32:09,503 --> 00:32:12,390
as you especially just share
data, is flip the final flag.

884
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,670
So now the copy of the data
falls to the next route.

885
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,844
And that's how you enable
the ability to share.

886
00:32:16,844 --> 00:32:19,770
Imagine where you start
with my first route goes

887
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,050
to my object storage, my
second route goes to my SIEM,

888
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,750
my third route goes say say at Kafka.

889
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,910
So that's the way you can
put the same events in three

890
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,823
different places and have full
control over where it goes.

891
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,320
And so this is something that
the very amount, high volume,

892
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,153
this is a great example of this

893
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,080
with this pipeline in particular.

894
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,270
They were able to get
something like 60% reduction

895
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,770
by just making a simple change about

896
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,470
how they managed the data
and how they classified it.

897
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,222
- Yeah. Always very powerful.

898
00:32:45,222 --> 00:32:46,535
- Yeah. And look and look at the way now

899
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:48,330
you're structuring your data.

900
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,365
So this is a good example
of how from the idea of...

901
00:32:51,365 --> 00:32:53,850
I always wanna talk about
detection engineering

902
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,913
as being the end result
of good data engineering.

903
00:32:56,913 --> 00:32:58,500
But what you're seeing here is,

904
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,396
now Sophos has chopped up an event,

905
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:02,280
they've added structure to it.

906
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,692
And this is also one
of the fun things that,

907
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,720
depending upon the backend SIEM vendor,

908
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,120
you can actually accelerate
these fields as well

909
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,050
by doing this.

910
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,540
So not only do we get a better
format, it's more searchable,

911
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,160
typically it's gonna be smaller,

912
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,840
it's also gonna be more consistent.

913
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,673
This is something that...

914
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:18,120
Sophos didn't do this,
but also I encourage you

915
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,790
to consider fixing your
timestamp here as well.

916
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,623
- Oh my gosh. Yeah.

917
00:33:21,623 --> 00:33:24,300
- Yeah, normalizing your
timestamp is very, very powerful.

918
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,640
And so just the idea of
every time you run into

919
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,666
a data problem, this is
where you look to fix it.

920
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,769
- One of my favorite stories
around the timestamps.

921
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:32,610
We were talking to an executive

922
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,552
for a very large security firm

923
00:33:34,552 --> 00:33:37,248
and they came to us, says,
why do we need Cribl?

924
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,500
And clearly I was like, "Have you ever had

925
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,708
an issue with a timestamp?

926
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:46,650
Do you know that people don't
always use UTC use time zones?

927
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,390
And when you go look for an event,

928
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,670
hey magically it didn't exist until you do

929
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,800
either all time or you
go look in the future.

930
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,080
Oh look there's the event.
What's it doing out there?"

931
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,390
- Yeah, yeah. I'll never forget the...

932
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,780
I get called to a bridge
and their new application

933
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,907
that they had deployed in
Central Asia wasn't showing up

934
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:06,676
and the data was exactly
11 and a half hours off

935
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:08,340
to the millisecond.

936
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,107
And you know, looking at the
data, looking at the data

937
00:34:10,107 --> 00:34:11,940
and you know, an hour
later it suddenly hits me

938
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,249
that the developers had hard coded

939
00:34:13,249 --> 00:34:16,830
the central standard
time zone into the log

940
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,690
into something that was deployed in India.

941
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,030
And so that was the kind
of thing where this,

942
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,340
you know, timestamp controls
are really important.

943
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,740
So after that, I never trusted
a timestamp ever again.

944
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,785
And so the idea that the
data's coming through Cribl,

945
00:34:28,785 --> 00:34:30,403
the idea is I'm gonna fix the timestamp,

946
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:31,530
I gonna fix the time zone

947
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,630
and then I'm gonna alert
me that there's a problem.

948
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,250
'Cause it's just a fundamental issue

949
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,710
of you always need better
data to solve problems

950
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,920
and like time zones,
timestamps are still the devil.

951
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,557
- I mean, I can keep talking
about this for a little bit.

952
00:34:43,557 --> 00:34:46,410
There's one customer that
I had back in the day

953
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,810
where their developers
had 15 different ways

954
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,920
of doing timestamps.

955
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,275
Literally 15 different timestamps.

956
00:34:51,275 --> 00:34:53,640
So yeah, good luck
finding that in your logs.

957
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,770
- Exactly. And so these are key things

958
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,090
and I think one also wanna mention

959
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,170
that from a detection engineer,

960
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,597
they're actually ripping
apart the output of netstat.

961
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:03,594
If you're looking at netstat
as part of standard out,

962
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:05,089
you wouldn't think that was something

963
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:06,720
that was very easy to structure.

964
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,270
But this is an example by
essentially running the script,

965
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,627
you get the output and by
using this exact same template,

966
00:35:11,627 --> 00:35:13,920
they were able to get the
structure they needed,

967
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,621
make it repeatable, and get a...

968
00:35:16,621 --> 00:35:17,964
'cause there's so much you can do

969
00:35:17,964 --> 00:35:20,664
with that kind of data once
it's structured correctly.

970
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,540
- So this is part of
the kind of conversation

971
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,130
where we're having like
question and answer.

972
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,080
I'll skip this just to
show one more thing here.

973
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,150
We'll definitely have a question
and answer section here.

974
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,045
But really quickly, just
wanted to reiterate the fact

975
00:35:32,045 --> 00:35:35,490
that Cribl has our university training,

976
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,340
which is free training and certification.

977
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,306
You can go get it, you can
go tell your friends about it

978
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,890
and you can also get these certifications

979
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,440
that employers are actually
asking for these days.

980
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,240
It blew my mind.

981
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,360
It's Cribl, both of us were very early on,

982
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,240
and when we saw that
people, like companies,

983
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,570
are actually saying, "Hey, we
need a Cribl level one admin

984
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,860
or engineer level
certification to get this job

985
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,140
or to apply for this job." Blew my mind.

986
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,940
And I was so proud to see that.

987
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,334
- Well I mean it was just free training.

988
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:08,730
That blew my mind.

989
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,563
I mean, as a customer I spent

990
00:36:09,563 --> 00:36:12,519
hundreds of thousands of
dollars and additional money

991
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:15,627
paying to learn how to use
tools I'd already paid for.

992
00:36:15,627 --> 00:36:18,240
And so I was just like, "Really"?

993
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,751
I mean that sounds like
too good of an idea.

994
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:20,672
And I've seen...

995
00:36:20,672 --> 00:36:22,856
I know with your customers
you see the same thing.

996
00:36:22,856 --> 00:36:23,689
- Oh yeah.

997
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:25,728
- The idea that Cribl, we
try to look at the idea is

998
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,360
the better you know how to use the tools,

999
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,237
the better results you're gonna get,

1000
00:36:28,237 --> 00:36:30,390
you know, the better their relationship.

1001
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,490
And I think that's the way
it should be for everyone.

1002
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,828
I think training is everything.

1003
00:36:33,828 --> 00:36:35,934
- And our docs are also
not behind the paywall.

1004
00:36:35,934 --> 00:36:37,110
- Yeah, that too.

1005
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,070
- Always a big win.

1006
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,660
- Right. And also from the AI perspective,

1007
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,770
you can always ask Copilot

1008
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,260
and the Copilot will
look up the docs for you.

1009
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,400
- Yep.
- So it's really nice.

1010
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,200
And we already mentioned sandboxes.

1011
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,647
Sandboxes are a great
piece because it's just...

1012
00:36:47,647 --> 00:36:50,610
you know, you wanna talk
about data reduction, routing,

1013
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,900
you wanna click about, you know,

1014
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,054
putting data in object
storage, it's all right there.

1015
00:36:54,054 --> 00:36:56,130
You're gonna have a really nice rich way

1016
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,560
of walking through it, and
get hands on right away.

1017
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,639
Just, you know, a 10-minute investment

1018
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,960
in order to try all these
different use cases out.

1019
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,850
- Yep.
- Thank you for coming

1020
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,683
and we're gonna be here for a little bit,

1021
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,610
so if you have any
questions, please come by.

1022
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,570
- Yes. Thanks so much.

1023
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,403
- Thank you.

1024
00:37:10,403 --> 00:37:11,556
(audience applauding)
