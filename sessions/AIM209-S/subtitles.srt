1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- All right,

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:03,210
hi everyone, hopefully
you're all ready for this.

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,750
So, very quickly, I am Jon Griffiths,

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,430
I'm the field CTO at Dynatrace,

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,060
and we're the ones sort of
sponsoring this talk today.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,010
I'm here today with Ishan.

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,720
- Hi everyone. I'm Ishan Singh.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,675
I'm a senior data scientist

9
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:19,323
on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore team.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,570
- I'm Matthew Eisengruber,

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,090
I work for CDL. I'm the
head of Architecture.

12
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,400
- Yeah, and I work with
Matt, I'm Chris Buckley.

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,143
I'm head of operations.

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,400
- So today we're gonna
have a really exciting time

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,233
for you today.

16
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,380
So we're basically gonna be looking

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,530
at CDL's journey with AI,

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,650
how they've gone from early
stages in development,

19
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,750
all the way to actually
releasing their AI in production

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,403
and how, of course, Dynatrace

21
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:49,710
and AWS has supported them in doing this.

22
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,710
Now, as you'd expect, gonna start

23
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,390
with a little bit on Dynatrace first.

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,670
So just to check,

25
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,670
are any of you here Dynatrace customers?

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,240
A handful, so that's
a good start at least.

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,390
So to give you a very quick introduction,

28
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,730
what Dynatrace is
Dynatrace primarily focuses

29
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,400
around observability and security,

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,051
but the essence of it

31
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,790
and where it really comes from

32
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,740
is really pushing the
boundaries on AI and automation.

33
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,920
Now, this isn't just a matter
of helping you understand

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,050
and observe your AI,

35
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,960
but also AI within our own platform

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,780
to enable you to understand
the root cause of problems

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,250
to automatically detect those problems.

38
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,900
And, of course, start to self remediate

39
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,050
those problems as well.

40
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,580
As you can see with this slide,

41
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,710
it covers everything
from your application,

42
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,740
your infrastructure,
your customer experience,

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,270
your developer experience,

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,330
the business observability as well,

45
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,280
and even delving into, of course,

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,343
the AI and LLM observability as well.

47
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,374
Now, the way that we're
effectively doing this is,

48
00:01:58,374 --> 00:02:01,380
of course, the more we move towards AI,

49
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,250
the more we have been moving
with microservices and so on,

50
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,870
the more data there is, the more volume,

51
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,940
the more velocity of data.

52
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,915
And the issue with data
is that with the scale

53
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:14,790
that it's at nowadays, you
just don't have the time

54
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,700
or resources to actually
look at it individually

55
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,690
and actually diagnose

56
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,040
and investigate,

57
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,460
say each individual log
line or whatever it may be.

58
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,293
So what we're doing is

59
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:27,540
we're trying to take all
of that data in context.

60
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,440
Now that's both from a top
topological point-of-view.

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,900
So actually understanding
those logs, those metrics,

62
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,040
those traces, those events
against those topology entities,

63
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,400
but also understanding it within
the context of your domain.

64
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,650
You know, your application
domain, your services domain,

65
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,780
your infrastructure
domain, whatever it may be,

66
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,980
and understanding how
that actually applies.

67
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,020
Now the importance of that
comes in when you actually start

68
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,860
to apply automation and AI on top of that

69
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,660
because any automation

70
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,140
or AI based on bad quality data

71
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,263
will lead to bad quality answers
and decisions being made.

72
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,710
So, of course, we're trying to emphasize

73
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,708
how ensuring that good quality
data is really key to that,

74
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,600
both from Dynatrace's own AI,

75
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,170
but also if you start to
utilize your AI agents

76
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,390
through our MCP servers and so on,

77
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,679
to actually access

78
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,990
and utilize the data that
we're storing as well

79
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,680
to really drive forward your
business, to enable your teams

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,113
to do whatever it is that
they they need to do.

81
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,410
Now when we look at AI as a whole,

82
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,960
it's not just say the
application layer, you know,

83
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,450
again, you need to
understand the full context,

84
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,150
the full stack of the AI agents

85
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,390
or GenAI observability piece.

86
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,370
So, of course you've got
the different layers in

87
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,630
that you've got the application layer,

88
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,300
but you've also got say
the orchestration layer.

89
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,470
And, of course, there you can start

90
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,970
to understand things like the caching

91
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,950
that's taking place and so on.

92
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,740
You then got the semantic layer
with your vector databases

93
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,190
and so on where again
you start to understand

94
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,940
the different performances
and inputs and outputs

95
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,990
and semantic analysis

96
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,990
that's effectively taking place on that.

97
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,120
And continuing down your actual model,

98
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,320
an agent layer

99
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,250
and again, understanding
exactly what is being utilized

100
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,252
and how the token usage

101
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:22,830
and, of course,

102
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,533
the importance of that
onto things like cost.

103
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,720
And then finally,

104
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,300
the actual infrastructure
computational layer

105
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,100
where you're looking
at things like the GPU,

106
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,650
the resource utilization
and so on as well.

107
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,220
Because any one of those layers,
if not tuned appropriately

108
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,317
for the other layers, makes
things go bad very quickly.

109
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:44,103
Whether that's your cost
spinning outta control,

110
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:47,970
whether that's the performance
becoming really poor,

111
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,920
or whether it's actually
just providing you

112
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,860
with decisions and answers
that you're not expecting

113
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,760
or that it shouldn't be providing you.

114
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,030
Now from a dietary's perspective,

115
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,190
in the AI observability area,

116
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,400
where we focus on are
these four use cases,

117
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,190
the first one being cost and performance

118
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,750
and looking at how we can control that,

119
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,280
looking at token utilization,

120
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,650
looking at prompt caching
and performance around that.

121
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,865
So again, starting to
understand how you can improve

122
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:20,343
that cost of your AI engines.

123
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,120
And then moving on to
things like explainability

124
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,810
and debugging with traces,
the focus here is tracers,

125
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,660
because you have that
end-to-end understanding.

126
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,537
You have that ability to have

127
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:34,140
that explainability knowing exactly

128
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,060
which agents it went through,

129
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,575
knowing exactly which models
it's actually utilized,

130
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:41,430
not just the ones that were requested,

131
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,403
but actually the ones that
ended up being responded to.

132
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,395
And again, that leads on quite
nicely to the compliance side

133
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:49,307
of things as well,

134
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,103
because obviously with compliance,

135
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,840
you not only need to understand

136
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,210
what the actual input and output was,

137
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,470
but you actually need to understand

138
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,300
why it made the decision it made,

139
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,910
you know, which, at
which layer, which tier,

140
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,070
which agent did that start

141
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,080
to divert down the wrong
path when you start

142
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,160
to get into compliance issues

143
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,020
and start to get into queries around that.

144
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,110
So again, having that full explainability

145
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,790
of what happened when it happened

146
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,463
and why is very important for that.

147
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,150
And then finally, of
course, is the guardrails

148
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,500
and the safeguards.

149
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,460
'cause one of the biggest issues

150
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,010
with AI most of the time is trust.

151
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,750
So, of course, you need to ensure

152
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,600
that your guardrails are
being utilized appropriately.

153
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,400
You need to ensure that
the safeguards are there

154
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,570
and you need to ensure that

155
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,480
what you're actually providing
is what people are expecting.

156
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,040
You know, you are actually
providing the answers

157
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,690
that they should be providing

158
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,490
without any other issues coming in.

159
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,710
Because once you lose trust,

160
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,680
your AI suddenly loses
its entire business case

161
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,643
associated with it.

162
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,660
And finally, of course, we've
been partnering with AWS for,

163
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,900
for quite a long time
now, well over 10 years.

164
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,050
And as you'd expect, we've
gone through all of the sort

165
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,923
of compliance standards and
certifications around AWS.

166
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:09,150
So again, of course, things
like the GenAI competency

167
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,600
as well as the many others
that are listed here as well.

168
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,510
But again, ensuring that we are mapping

169
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,350
and managing against the standards against

170
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,970
how AWS is setting those to ensure

171
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,540
that not only are we doing
things in the right way,

172
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,370
but we're also doing things effectively

173
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,580
and efficiently with AWS's own services,

174
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,820
both from a perspective of
utilizing it within Dynatrace,

175
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,870
but also how we're providing
visibility of AWS's services

176
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,170
for our customers as well.

177
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,470
So now I think, you know,
I've done my little bit

178
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,303
of sales pitch.

179
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,740
We can now sort of hand over

180
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,450
to I guess the main reason why we're here,

181
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,030
which is obviously CDL and their story.

182
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,411
So Chris, why don't we start
with a introduction onto CDL

183
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:56,280
and take it from there.

184
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,020
- Yeah, yep, okay, before we get going,

185
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,000
if I could get everybody's
attention, could I get everybody

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,760
to stand up audience participation time?

187
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,980
Not joking, just stand up
for me. Stand up for me.

188
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,170
I know, it's like third day in.

189
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,580
You guys are (indistinct).

190
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,903
All right, stand up, okay.

191
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,870
Who here knows who AWS is?

192
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,680
If you know who AWS is,
stay standing, okay.

193
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,120
Who here knows who CDL is?

194
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,333
If you don't know who
we are, please sit down.

195
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,631
More than I thought, also, thank you.

196
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:27,180
Because before we came on
stage, I made a bet here

197
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,800
with my colleague 'cause we are in Vegas

198
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,120
and I said I would get all of you

199
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,100
to give him a stand when he started.

200
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,750
So thank you, I just won that bet

201
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,245
- And you get the round
of applause every time.

202
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:40,410
And I just brought me
down a race socks a bit.

203
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,280
No, lucky socks, man.

204
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,210
that's what made it bet.

205
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,575
- Excellent.

206
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:46,110
- Yeah, so I think I'll
stand. So who are CDL?

207
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,200
We are a B2B software company based

208
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,993
outta Stockport, Manchester, England.

209
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,500
We deal with B2B.

210
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,862
So we deal with directly
with the companies.

211
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:00,400
As a team, we are 600 strong

212
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,470
and we consider ourselves, you know,

213
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,663
at the top of our game in
the UK insurance industry.

214
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,900
The big green button, you said it, yeah.

215
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,980
Yeah, that'll be great.

216
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,260
- So one of my favorite quotes

217
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,040
that I heard from one of our
suppliers is CDL are the veins

218
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,633
of the UK insurance market.

219
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,910
What does that mean? It means
we are experts in our field.

220
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,973
In the UK, if you're gonna do
a or transact a private car,

221
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:32,130
household, motorcycle
or GV quote on online,

222
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,080
at some point in that journey,

223
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,510
you will touch one of our systems.

224
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,010
Typically we say we deal around
60% of all the transactions.

225
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,203
So just to try and bring that to life,

226
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:48,238
I'm Joe Blocks, I've purchased
a new vehicle in the UK.

227
00:09:48,238 --> 00:09:50,883
By law, I have to ensure that vehicle.

228
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,860
What do I do?

229
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,260
Typically, I'll go onto
one of the aggregators.

230
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,487
So in the UK that might be go compare,

231
00:09:57,487 --> 00:10:00,900
it might be money supermarkets.

232
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,040
I will go on there

233
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,170
and I will enter my details.

234
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,706
All personal to me, my vehicle,

235
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,970
my address, and I'll click get quote.

236
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,240
When you click get quote,
that'll be your first interaction

237
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,830
with one of our CDL systems.

238
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,220
Might not a big interaction,
but it will be an interaction.

239
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,540
If the premium displayed

240
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,183
or the price is good,
I'll click go to buy.

241
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,660
Again, chances are 60% of the
time you'll be linked straight

242
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,530
through to one of our customers.

243
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,980
If you go ahead to buy that
quote with that customer,

244
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,400
that policy would then be
administered on our system.

245
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,890
So far we've done the quote and buy,

246
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,350
now we run to the policy administration.

247
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,590
But also when it comes to the
regulation side of things,

248
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,110
our systems then tell the UK government

249
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,610
that vehicle's insured.

250
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,920
So in the UK we have ANPR cameras.

251
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,200
If we don't, if we don't tell the systems

252
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,630
that you're insured based
on your registration number

253
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,270
and who you are, you're gonna
get pulled over by the police.

254
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,408
So, you know, it's quite a, you know,

255
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,470
important sequence of events.

256
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,960
So from CDL we do the
purchase, the quotes.

257
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,580
We do the policy administration.

258
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,413
We do the payments.

259
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:07,246
We do the renewal,

260
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:08,079
and we let people know

261
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,010
you've actually got the vehicle insured.

262
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,280
And one of the things it's important

263
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,240
to mention it's high volume
retail we deal with, okay.

264
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,234
We're talking that the
amount of quotations

265
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:24,180
going through our system is,
you know, silly at times.

266
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,470
And that's where Dynatrace comes in

267
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,390
from an observability perspective.

268
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,600
They give us that real time
insights of what's going on.

269
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,660
You know, as a customer I
will not wait for a premium

270
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,310
to be showed, why?

271
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,080
The market's that competitive

272
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,187
that I'll just go to the next one

273
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:40,290
and it might be 10p cheaper.

274
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,440
Yeah, so that's why it's so
important that we understand

275
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,670
through Dynatrace

276
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,833
what our systems are
doing all of the time.

277
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,371
Now I did mention it's an ecosystem.

278
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:51,840
So there's, you know, a
raft of numbers up there

279
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,453
to show the scale that
we operate at in the UK.

280
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,830
As I said, veins of the
UK insurance market.

281
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,260
We are the middle of that bubble, okay.

282
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,570
The amount of integration

283
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,630
into other systems is vast.

284
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,940
Once again, some of it's like touch,

285
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,840
some of it is our complete
product of our complete service.

286
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,980
But likes at some point

287
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,860
in a insurance quote journey in the UK,

288
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,053
you will touch one of our systems.

289
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,440
One of the scary figures in
2024 in just our bubble alone,

290
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,293
Dynatrace observed 1
trillion transactions.

291
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,660
We don't know this year's numbers,

292
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,700
but I dunno the one to
count them to be fair.

293
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,400
But we expect it to, you
know, increase significantly.

294
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,455
Where Dynatrace also comes
in is this is, you know,

295
00:12:39,455 --> 00:12:41,703
highly interconnected.

296
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:44,040
If someone on the outside has an issue,

297
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,440
it impacts all the way through.

298
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,200
Previously without Dynatrace
we always got the finger

299
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,357
pointed at us, or it must be CDL.

300
00:12:51,357 --> 00:12:52,833
We use it, must be CDL.

301
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,460
But what's not considered
is all the other entities

302
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,540
in the chain of getting a
quote, paying for the policy,

303
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,070
administering the policy.

304
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,330
So a Dynatrace comes in,

305
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,850
it instantly tells us
where that problem is.

306
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,710
Ideally it's not CDL

307
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,020
and we can use that
information proactively

308
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,990
to tell our customers the
issue is here you need to go

309
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,573
and speak to that vendor,
that particular supplier.

310
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,840
So wrong button, there we go.

311
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,990
So as the title said, you
know, POC to production,

312
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,240
where did it all start?

313
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,890
I think, and hopefully
he's watching, you know,

314
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,880
we are blessed with a
very knowledgeable CEO

315
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,230
and when it comes to AI,

316
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,470
he's very much pushing
the organization to do it.

317
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,390
They always say top-down approach

318
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,340
and he lives and believes that, you know.

319
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,192
He's always challenging us to,

320
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:46,920
you know, know what's
going on in the market.

321
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,753
So I feel, you know, we
are blessed with our CEO

322
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:50,340
that is constantly challenging us.

323
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,980
We're not having to convince
him we need to start looking

324
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,830
to AI with our products and services.

325
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,100
He wanted us to build
something new and exciting.

326
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,740
Give something with a VR headset,
gimme voice, gimme vision,

327
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,950
give multimodal, give me
something and I want it yesterday.

328
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,040
You know, he is always pushing
us to do more and do better.

329
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,277
So I think, you know,
from that point, you know,

330
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:13,001
we had the early concept
design things that we wanted

331
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:14,730
to kind of progress with,

332
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,560
but the business ask was,

333
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,840
we've got the products.
We've got the services.

334
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,240
We've got the ecosystem and
we've got the knowledge.

335
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,690
Let's go and build something.

336
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,437
- I guess now that you know who CDL is

337
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:30,773
and I guess what the high
level business ask was,

338
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:32,610
I guess the question is,

339
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,082
Matt, with your technical
insights, where did you start?

340
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:38,123
- Make 'em stand again.
Make him stand again.

341
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:40,901
- Right, yeah, so as Chris said,

342
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:43,050
CEO is chomping at the bit, right.

343
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,690
He's got the GPT Max subscription,

344
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,643
he knows the capabilities of things.

345
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,300
Most of the rest of the
board actually uses Gemini

346
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,800
in their personal lives and things.

347
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,655
So got a decent
understanding at board level.

348
00:14:55,655 --> 00:14:58,260
So you kind of can't pull
the wool over their eyes.

349
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,320
Like I'm not gonna blind
them by science, right.

350
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,820
So we were a little bit on the back foot

351
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,430
and he actually went on stage
and we did a company all hands

352
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,440
and he said, right, we're going AI inside.

353
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,170
So for those Intel fans,
remember the Intel inside logo,

354
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,730
that's kind of what he was playing on

355
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,230
to get it in our heads like it's gotta be

356
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,523
inside everything we do.

357
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,960
So he did that bit and
then it was like, okay.

358
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,710
and then he got asked the
question, somebody said,

359
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,830
"Well you know, hey big boss,

360
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,570
do you have all the, do
you have all the answers?"

361
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,180
And he went, "No, I absolutely
do not have all the answers."

362
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,053
And then he pointed to me
and the team in the back

363
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,210
and he went, "But those guys
will. They'll figure it out."

364
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,330
So it was like no pressure, right.

365
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,460
So anyways, we were a
little bit on the back foot,

366
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,740
but then once we got thinking
about it, as Chris said,

367
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,470
it was, well actually
there's a bit of a journey

368
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,870
that we took to get to the
ecosystem that we were in

369
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,310
that put us in a pretty decent position.

370
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,440
So first off technology.

371
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,300
Well we used to have two
data centers in the UK

372
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,560
for those of you that know the UK,

373
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,220
they were just outside
Manchester in our Stockport area.

374
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,660
And we made a call

375
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,160
because what we kept
doing is landing bigger

376
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,470
and bigger customers and
we weren't able to scale.

377
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,580
So we went, right,

378
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,090
we're gonna go cloud
first is how we started.

379
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,230
And we went right, we're
gonna go cloud first.

380
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,353
so any new customers, we're
gonna put 'em on AWS, good.

381
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,870
And we went, we got a few customers,

382
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,280
a few big customers on AWS.

383
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,710
We went, you know what,
this is actually really good

384
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,110
and the old stuff isn't really that good.

385
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,580
So then we went cloud only,

386
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,620
moved all our customers over in two years.

387
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,050
So now we got all our
customer base on AWS,

388
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,540
that's important because now,
now we've got the agility

389
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,960
and the ability to adopt
new tech when it comes out

390
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,610
as we're leading into AI, right.

391
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,460
Next thing we did is it's not
just enough to move to cloud,

392
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,770
you also have to have
things that are accessible.

393
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,450
As John said, you need
to have context for AI

394
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,890
in order for it to be useful.

395
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,230
So luckily we had
adopted a product mindset

396
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,270
about being API first.

397
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,190
So almost all our
services, which also helped

398
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,270
with the interconnectivity, right,

399
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,950
We needed to make it
easier for our customers.

400
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,840
But again, it plays
heavily into the AI space

401
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,000
in that we adopted this
AI first mentality,

402
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,260
which means that data can
now be surfaced to AI easier.

403
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,960
So two key things there,
cloud migration and API.

404
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,420
Next thing we did, which most,

405
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,970
I know it's a tech conference,
but you're all people, right

406
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,050
So we focused on our people

407
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,360
and went, what do we need to do in order

408
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,830
to get our people there?

409
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,450
So as part of the cloud migration,

410
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,430
we actually upskilled all our engineers.

411
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,930
So Chris said at the beginning

412
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,580
we were 600 strong company,

413
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,740
250 of those people are engineers.

414
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,449
We made it a mandate
that every engineer had

415
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,230
to get the cloud
practitioner certification.

416
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,210
We did this not because we're mean people.

417
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,598
We did this

418
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:27,000
because we wanted everybody to
be able to talk the language

419
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,410
so that when we walked into a room

420
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:33,180
and said a word like S3, EC2, Bedrock,

421
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,580
no one had to ask what is that?

422
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,780
So we upskilled the language

423
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,540
that everybody's talking
on the same plane.

424
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,520
Next the other thing that we did

425
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,590
around this is we tried
to change the culture.

426
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,649
So I don't like to use the
Silicon Valley term fail fast,

427
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,090
but what we did is we made it

428
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,330
so that exploration was fun and safe.

429
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,190
Safe as in like you're
not gonna get a backlash

430
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,620
because if the idea
doesn't work, it's okay.

431
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,090
So how we did this is we did things like

432
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,220
incubators and hackathons.

433
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,020
So we created events for our engineers

434
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,370
with their new found skills now

435
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,920
and we gave them exposure
to the technology

436
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,110
'cause that's the most
important thing that we found

437
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,950
even with our board

438
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,990
is that the more exposure you give to AI,

439
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,280
the less fear there is around it.

440
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,600
The more the understanding is around it,

441
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,250
the easier it is to push forward.

442
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,328
So that also kind of wasn't enough

443
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:21,030
because of the way that we work

444
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,920
and the highly regulated industry

445
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,580
that we're in we're like PCI
DSS and all the rest of it.

446
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,870
We also needed to do what's right

447
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,280
and we wanted to do it the right way.

448
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,560
So we also started to look at our process.

449
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,450
So once we got our people
skilled up, it's like okay,

450
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,760
but we probably got some processes

451
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,110
that aren't gonna help us.

452
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,670
So one of the first things we did is we

453
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,170
formed an AI steering group.

454
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,780
Now the steering group was
composed of a few executives.

455
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,540
So again, had that top level down support,

456
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,700
it was compliance and legal

457
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,840
'cause again, the hurdles

458
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,940
that we figured we were
probably gonna come up against

459
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,470
are the same hurdles we're
coming up against today,

460
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,670
which is compliance and legal

461
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,320
and cybersecurity challenges, right.

462
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,250
You guys all know what it's like, right.

463
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,240
You build the software

464
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,320
and then you almost make it out the gate

465
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,240
and then it's like pump
the brakes we're right.

466
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,140
We didn't wanna make that mistake.

467
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,580
So we included them in that conversation,

468
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,420
in that steering group.

469
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,720
And also we had subject matter
experts like architecture,

470
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,040
there's actually the fellow
in the room over there.

471
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,360
He's also in that group.

472
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,193
And that was so

473
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:12,990
that we could bring that
deeper AI understanding

474
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,400
into that AI steering group.

475
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,110
So we've got decision makers.

476
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,720
We've got experts that
understand our interaction

477
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,370
with our customer, which
is really important.

478
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,390
So the steering group,

479
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,200
it allowed us to clarify
our why across the piece.

480
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,300
It also kept the customer in the room

481
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,160
because we were talking
about things like contracts.

482
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,230
Like okay, we're gonna be
using their data differently.

483
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,300
Do we need to redo contracts?

484
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,950
AI is gonna be more transactional.

485
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,390
Do we need to think more of a SaaS model?

486
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,190
Is it gonna be outcome based?
How are we gonna do this?

487
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,573
We need to steer those
decisions at that level up there

488
00:19:40,573 --> 00:19:43,487
so that like the CEO said, "We
don't have all the answers.

489
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,119
So we needed to form that group
to begin to give the answers

490
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,380
to the people so they can
build the right thing."

491
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,660
So centralizing the big
decisions made it easier for us

492
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,390
to coordinate and then roll
those out across the piece.

493
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,790
We also adjusted current
processes to streamline adoption

494
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,040
of the AI tooling and services themselves.

495
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,080
So again, we're regulated and things.

496
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,100
So we needed to make sure

497
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,900
that if we were gonna introduce something,

498
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,850
we weren't data leakage, right.

499
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,560
Like somebody wasn't gonna upload

500
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,140
some of our developer code into ChatGPT

501
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,039
and that's stored in the
states, which is a big

502
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,720
no-no when you're in the EU.

503
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,330
So it's like, okay, we needed
to watch those kind of things.

504
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,320
We also needed to do that

505
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,230
because the pace of change that AI brings,

506
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,570
and this is something
that you kind of feel it

507
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,607
when you go to cloud, like
that kind of speeds up

508
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:26,400
and it's like AI's like that on steroids

509
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,740
as far as you need to be
able to make decisions

510
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,390
very quickly as an organization

511
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,790
because week to week it's changing.

512
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,660
Now cloud,

513
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,790
it used to be you could go to
a conference like this, right.

514
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,520
You go to re:Invent and then
afterward everybody goes home

515
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,350
and before Christmas you
write up your plan for,

516
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,460
here's all the stuff from re:Invent

517
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,110
that I'm gonna introduce in the next year

518
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,460
until next re:Invent.

519
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,873
AI is like that every week.

520
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,710
So we adjusted our
process to streamline this

521
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,950
so that as evolving tech shows up,

522
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,990
we can evaluate that
and bring that through.

523
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,990
So to give you an example,
when a new model drops,

524
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,080
so I believe it was the Claude 4.5 model,

525
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,470
we had that approved via
this group within 48 hours.

526
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,730
So we could start using it.

527
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,270
Previously, this would've taken
probably about three months.

528
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,520
So you gotta look at your process as well.

529
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,820
We also used that time to
kind of reevaluate who we were

530
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,290
as a company around ethics.

531
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,660
So it's a good time to kind
of sense check, you know,

532
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,920
who you are to your customers.

533
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,150
Again, keeping 'em in the room.

534
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,800
So one of the things we did there was

535
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,900
it helped us encapsulate
some of those requirements

536
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,060
around like how,

537
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,250
'cause it's one thing to do
ai, it's another thing to,

538
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,720
like I said, do it right.

539
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,560
So with us, our tagline is
making powerful partnerships.

540
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,660
So how you do that, as
John was alluding to,

541
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,550
is you have to maintain trust

542
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,650
and you have to be transparent
about what you're doing.

543
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,814
And us as a B2B, we ultimately
have to be transparent

544
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:45,990
because we're the platform
that our customers operate on

545
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,340
and they need to know

546
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,790
how their lifeblood of
their business is running.

547
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,910
So I mentioned we're a
highly regulated industry.

548
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,290
There's two reasons I
wanted to mention this.

549
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,630
One, we got PCI, we got GDPR.

550
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,920
Some of those might not be considerations

551
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,870
for some of you in the room as US people.

552
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,360
But one of the other
things was we were looking

553
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,830
for like an AI standard.

554
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,420
And at this point in the journey,

555
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,500
there's a thing called ISO 42001

556
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,070
that like was in its infancy.

557
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,780
It wasn't really understood yet.

558
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,090
So we didn't actually have
anywhere to go with this,

559
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,010
but we were watching
that because we figured,

560
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:21,600
you know what, that's probably
gonna give us some trust.

561
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,340
It's gonna help us build
trust with our customers.

562
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,530
So what we did do is we leaned
on the well architected.

563
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:29,790
So our product we built will be FTR ready,

564
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,690
if you're familiar with that.

565
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,890
So foundational technical review.

566
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,333
So we made sure they got verified by AWS

567
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,890
that we're technically correct.

568
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,630
And then we wanted to
go for the ISO standard,

569
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,791
which I'm happy to say

570
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,600
we've just received
over the last two weeks.

571
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,710
So we've actually got
an ISO 42001 AI system.

572
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,630
So that should help us
both in the pre-sales

573
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,850
and around the trust and transparency.

574
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,290
Another thing that was
happening in this time,

575
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,180
you gotta go back, this
is like back in January,

576
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,100
is security, right.

577
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,870
So in traditional web world
you've got like entities

578
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,340
like OWASP, right.

579
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,750
So it used to be dead easy with cybersec

580
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,840
'cause you go right OWASP
top 10 for web, right.

581
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
We're gonna throw advanced
shield on top of that,

582
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,470
put a WF in front of
it, use the manage rules

583
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,570
that AWS give us cybersecurity signs off.

584
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,860
We're good to go.

585
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,740
So we're like, right,
what's OWASP got for us?

586
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,300
And they didn't have anything at the time.

587
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,890
And then literally I
said that to the board

588
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,390
and then a week later,

589
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,840
the OWASP top 10 LLM exploits came out.

590
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,780
But there's no managed rule set for that.

591
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,960
So we went, okay, right,

592
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,700
this system has gotta have a guardrail.

593
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,320
We're gonna have to figure out guardrails,

594
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,153
but at least we know

595
00:23:29,153 --> 00:23:30,720
what the requirements are
gonna be for these guardrails.

596
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,070
'cause we'll lean on OWASP.

597
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,770
- So let's bring all that together.

598
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,560
We've got a CEO who's on board.

599
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,260
We've got the ecosystem
to make a difference.

600
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,290
And what I mean by make a
difference is we're going

601
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,900
to be able to use AI at a large scale

602
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,260
with trillion transactions.

603
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,340
You know, you saw some of the numbers

604
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,020
before about quotations.

605
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,330
Our system has 7 million policies.

606
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,504
How can we use AI

607
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,991
to help our customers transact

608
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:05,940
and manage those policies cheaper?

609
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,640
Yeah, so it's all about
efficiencies and productivity.

610
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,380
We need to address compliance at pace.

611
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,080
You know, we are in a
highly regulated industry

612
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,913
as Matthew said,

613
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:20,160
but we brought everyone
along on the journey.

614
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,690
But AI goes at pace,

615
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,430
so how do we keep up,

616
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,310
how do we ensure we're
using the latest tech?

617
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,380
I said before with the
center of the ecosystem.

618
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,550
So we're in prime position to
make a real life difference

619
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,383
to how that industry works.

620
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,440
And also we've got the products.

621
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,273
You know,

622
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:42,000
when the CEO first said
build me something in AI,

623
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,087
we all went to it and said, right,

624
00:24:43,087 --> 00:24:44,760
"What new product are we gonna build?

625
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,090
What new shiny thing are we
gonna bring to the market?"

626
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,087
And we kind of, you know, went to,

627
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,360
"Oh, we need to make all
these fundamental changes."

628
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,690
and the CEO's credit, "No,
no, we've got the products.

629
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,090
we've got the services.

630
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,120
We AI needs to utilize those
to make the difference."

631
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,320
So it meant we had to be a lot more

632
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,700
surgical in our thinking.

633
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,810
It wasn't wholesale took
all that in the business,

634
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,643
start again.

635
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:08,700
It was, we've invested
35 years in developing

636
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,050
all this technology,

637
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,097
these relationships at how people used it.

638
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:14,700
So we had to take a much
more surgical approach

639
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,200
in how we were going

640
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,823
to embed AI in those
particular services and yeah.

641
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,240
- Yeah, so I think it's
obviously good to see there that

642
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,240
it wasn't just a matter of
going in all guns blazing,

643
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,860
building anything and everything.

644
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,440
It was a thought process
that started this.

645
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,950
It was understanding exactly
what should be happening,

646
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,450
why it should be happening

647
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,630
and changing not just what
they were trying to do,

648
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,460
but also changing the internal processes

649
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,150
to actually make what they
wanted to do work for the future.

650
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,920
Not just to get it out,

651
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,338
but also to continue that
momentum going forwards.

652
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:52,710
But I guess back to
Matt, the big question is

653
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,650
that the technology, right.

654
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,680
Yeah. How did you start piercing it?

655
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,690
What did you start using and and so on.

656
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,860
- Yeah, 'cause this is a juicy bit, right.

657
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,693
This is why you guys are here.

658
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:02,160
So we just said the CEO was

659
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,200
using this AI inside terminology

660
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,150
and then the CTO, which is our boss

661
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,557
came in and he had this
concept of, he said,

662
00:26:08,557 --> 00:26:10,410
"We need this engine room layer."

663
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,210
So we, like Chris said, we
don't wanna throw it all away.

664
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,290
We've got all these APIs

665
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,750
that got all this rich
information and accessible.

666
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,800
We need to have a layer though.

667
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,090
We need to have an engine room

668
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,470
that our customers can connect to.

669
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,030
Similar to the front door we were trying

670
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,443
to create with the API.

671
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,680
So we took that away

672
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,480
and architecture had a bit of a brain dump

673
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,320
and we went, right, this
stuff is changing so fast.

674
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,790
You gotta remember LLMs, were dropping.

675
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,650
This is what, like, you
guys know how it is, right.

676
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,510
Anthropic releases one and
they go, we're the best.

677
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,770
And then (indistinct)
releases one, we're the best.

678
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,220
And then ChatGPT, we're the best.

679
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,032
And they've all got different
evaluation ways of metrics

680
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,650
and it's like, how are you supposed to.

681
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,120
so I looked at this

682
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,590
as if I was an investor

683
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,330
and an investor, you've got
two different strategies.

684
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,440
You've got active investing,

685
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,630
which is where you go and you pick a horse

686
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,740
or you got passive investing,

687
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,090
which is where you buy an index

688
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,400
and you just invest in the market.

689
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,810
So I said, right,

690
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,180
based on how much these
guys are leapfrogging,

691
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,520
I don't think picking a
horse is the right example.

692
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,080
And everybody's like, yeah,
that, that makes sense actually.

693
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,540
So I said what we, what
we'll do is we'll come up

694
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,630
with a mechanism that
allows us to evaluate these.

695
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,670
So we need something that allows us

696
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,070
to chop and change the models,

697
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,450
but also evaluate them so

698
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,250
that we're not regressing
when we do change a model.

699
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,700
So we're not going backwards
if we make a change.

700
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,530
The other side we needed to worry about

701
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,880
was the insurance industry

702
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,920
isn't exactly the fastest
moving place, right.

703
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,749
We're do some cool things around volume

704
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:30,180
and we use technologies
in clever ways sometimes,

705
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,769
but it's not the most
forward thinking, right.

706
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:35,953
So we knew that in order for
our customers to get on board

707
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:38,340
with this, we were gonna
need to introduce this

708
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,080
as a thin slice of value.

709
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,910
So I'm gonna sound a little
bit like a product person now.

710
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,070
So we needed to get this
thin slice of value,

711
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,140
but that thin slice had to
be across that tech stack

712
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,490
that we were trying to create,

713
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,170
and then that needed to be quite modular.

714
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,080
So we could go right, once we've got that,

715
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,990
we're gonna wash and rinse and repeat that

716
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,970
and keep introducing these thin slices

717
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,070
so that our customers can
go on this journey as well.

718
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,380
'cause otherwise we're
gonna tear their face off

719
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,953
as we're going and nobody's
gonna wanna jump on with us.

720
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,260
So that was the ideas.

721
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,970
And then we're like, all right,

722
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,664
pretty sure somebody's
figured this out before.

723
00:28:07,664 --> 00:28:10,214
So the first thing we did
is we reached out to AWS.

724
00:28:11,714 --> 00:28:12,690
So as you guys go down this

725
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,790
and once you've defined
your why, like we were,

726
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,470
and you've got some of your, how,

727
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,510
now is when you start
leaning on the platforms

728
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,950
that you've chosen and your partners.

729
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,690
So we leaned heavily on AWS.

730
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,540
So we got in our AWS solution architect.

731
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,373
We gave 'em that.

732
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:26,490
We said, right, we need something

733
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,630
that gives us model selection.

734
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,730
We also need something that
does evaluations quite quickly

735
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,140
so that we can chop and change.

736
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,647
Like that's a major requirement
on the technical side,

737
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:34,650
you know, we also need it to be secure.

738
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,760
We need to have guard rail, you know,

739
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,780
gave him the whole dump.

740
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,613
And he went,

741
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:38,847
"Actually Matt, we got a good one for you,

742
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:40,377
it's called Bedrock."

743
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:42,099
I was like, excellent,

744
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:43,363
Bedrock sounds great

745
00:28:43,363 --> 00:28:46,500
. What is it? Yabba Dabba
Doo? All right, let's go.

746
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,333
So that was cool.

747
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:50,370
So we're like right Bedrock,
start researching that.

748
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,310
Then we reached out to John
here and we said, "Hey John,

749
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,020
you helped us when we moved to cloud.

750
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,165
We mandated that that Dynatrace
had to be on everything

751
00:28:58,165 --> 00:28:58,998
when we moved to cloud.

752
00:28:58,998 --> 00:29:00,240
You switched on the lights for us.

753
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,590
What's your answer for AI?"

754
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,160
And John goes, "Well, funny
Matt, I got something for you."

755
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,760
And he pulled up this dashboard,

756
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,701
I was like, "Oh it's pretty good, John.

757
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:10,787
What am I looking at?"

758
00:29:10,787 --> 00:29:13,980
And he said, "Well it's
traditional Dynatrace metrics

759
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,540
in the sense of you've got
your performance metrics

760
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,830
and things.

761
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,300
But what it also did,

762
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,320
'cause we knew we needed to worry about

763
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,730
security performance cost, right.

764
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,820
Typical IT problems, that's all in there.

765
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,980
But what it also opened
our eyes up to was things

766
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,570
that we hadn't considered yet at the time,

767
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,420
which was behavioral metrics of AI.

768
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,510
So things like relevance and grounding

769
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,060
and how many times you've denied a topic.

770
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,110
So you've triggered a guardrail

771
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,410
because somebody's tried
to exploit something.

772
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,840
And that was like, okay, yeah actually

773
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,520
that's really useful.

774
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,190
And then our head of products saw this

775
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,560
and he went, "I absolutely need that

776
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,390
because this is the first time

777
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,520
that I've tied together
performance metrics

778
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,520
with AI based metrics, with
token usage, with cost.

779
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,480
So now I've got the whole gamut.

780
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,647
I've got everything, which is great.

781
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:04,980
"So we said awesome, we're
gonna push forward with this."

782
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,620
So Dynatrace became a main component

783
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,110
of this from the POC stage,

784
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,490
observability was required.

785
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,960
So we didn't wait.

786
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,690
Day one, it was like we're doing this.

787
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,280
So this is all the you
guys have been waiting for.

788
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,900
This is we got out our big box of crayons,

789
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,770
started drawing pictures,

790
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,420
that's what architecture does.

791
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,500
So on the right-hand side here

792
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,240
is the ecosystem Chris was talking about.

793
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,140
We've obviously only got one

794
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,430
service on the right hand side there,

795
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:29,400
but that was our API interfaces.

796
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,080
What we then did is we layered Bedrock

797
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,960
on top of that using a
multi-agent approach,

798
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,430
that's a supervisor with
then subagents below that,

799
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,140
that are domain-specific.

800
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,520
There's reasons why we did this.

801
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,977
Most of the reason was as you
guys will have found out now,

802
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:46,473
so it's like hindsight was 2020 on this,

803
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,727
as we were going to
expose those interfaces,

804
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:52,410
remember this is before MCP was a thing,

805
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,703
so MCP wasn't out yet.

806
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,320
we needed to keep our domain
of what that agent knew.

807
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,840
We needed to keep that as
as specialized as possible

808
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,100
so that we could use the smallest model

809
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,510
possible for the highest accuracy.

810
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,280
So that's always the balance
you're trying to play, right.

811
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,020
Small model, but then on your front

812
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,860
where your supervisor is,

813
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,690
you want that one to have
like ultimate reasoning.

814
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,110
So it can utilize the
downstream agents very cleverly.

815
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,000
So it's gotta interpret
what the customer's trying

816
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,790
to say on the right-hand or on
the left-hand side coming in.

817
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,320
It's gotta interpret that reason that,

818
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,730
and then farm out the work to say,

819
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,900
Ooh, you wanted to do a quote.

820
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,200
Well I'm gonna send you
to the, the quote agent

821
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,210
or you wanna make a change to your policy.

822
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,890
Maybe you've gotten married
and your name's changed.

823
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,940
I'm gonna send you to the MTA,

824
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,061
which is a midterm adjustment
agent, which is just,

825
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:34,611
I'm just changing a certain
detail about my policy.

826
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,900
What we all, what that also did though is

827
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,180
Bedrock gave us really firm guardrails.

828
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,280
So the guardrails in Bedrock are amazing.

829
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,270
They're really flexible.

830
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,800
So you can do it on the input,

831
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,633
which is great,

832
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:46,710
so that when somebody
tries to act like a grandma

833
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,580
and or trick it into giving
you admin privileges, it won't.

834
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,557
It also does things
like it can prevent data

835
00:31:52,557 --> 00:31:54,570
like oversharing.

836
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,070
So somebody might ask for something

837
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,770
which is seemingly okay on the way in.

838
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,420
So you wouldn't wanna block it,

839
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,223
but the model itself might overshare,

840
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:03,965
maybe some PII, we don't want that.

841
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,730
So you can block it on the outbound.

842
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,350
So that's all really great.

843
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,800
The other thing we did, as I
said, the observability bit,

844
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,900
we leaned on OpenTelemetry.

845
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,910
I don't know if you guys are
familiar with OpenTelemetry,

846
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,400
but if you take a step
back into Dynatrace world

847
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,320
for a second here, Dynatrace
came out with Pure Path,

848
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,320
which was essentially the
precursor to OpenTelemetry

849
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,793
for those that dunno.

850
00:32:23,793 --> 00:32:25,631
So OpenTelemetry is the open
source version, essentially.

851
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:27,510
Peer Path was their proprietary thing

852
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,460
that pretty much was a claim to fame.

853
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,370
So we already had Peer Path
on the right-hand side.

854
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,320
So we needed to find a way to extend

855
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,060
that Peer Path back out to our customer

856
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,800
'cause that's where all the value is.

857
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,913
So Dynatrace has got an
SDK that you can drop in

858
00:32:39,913 --> 00:32:42,270
to Bedrock, which is what we did.

859
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,560
So we dropped in this SDK

860
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,720
and all of a sudden we lit up Bedrock

861
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,550
and we can see all the inputs and outputs

862
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,980
and all the times a guardrails triggered

863
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,940
and we can tie that back

864
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,650
to the backend system calls as well.

865
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,780
So now we've got tracing from customer

866
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,433
to backend, which is brilliant.

867
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,860
- One thing you didn't
mention the model story

868
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,700
about the costing.

869
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,193
So the reason I always get
Matt to mention this is

870
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:07,980
that it's bringing business insights

871
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,940
based on that dashboard.

872
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,316
So is it worth mentioning or not.

873
00:33:10,316 --> 00:33:11,490
I always throw you under the bus, but--

874
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,323
- Which one's that one?

875
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,360
- The costing one, the
model that VINCI version.

876
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,860
- Oh yeah, so one of the things

877
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,900
that we got off the
observability quite early on,

878
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,290
are you talking about the the
one where we had exhaustion?

879
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,420
Yeah, so we were using a model

880
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,424
and we were almost ready to
launch it into production.

881
00:33:26,424 --> 00:33:28,750
So this was like gonna
be the premier launch

882
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,840
and then we hit a thing
where we were getting errors

883
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,330
and had we had not had
observability in with Dynatrace,

884
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,380
we wouldn't have saw what that error was.

885
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,840
The error was actually token exhaustion

886
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,930
and the solution was really
simple, update the model

887
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,960
'cause we were using an end
of life model, that was it.

888
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,190
But had we not had any of that,

889
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,800
we would've spent weeks trying
to figure it out, right.

890
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,790
But we were able to do that

891
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,920
and then it didn't delay our release.

892
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,290
- Cool, thank you, so for my own sanity,

893
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,310
I had to put a simplified
version of the previous slide

894
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,570
because I'm probably the least technical

895
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,250
person here at Dynatrace.

896
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,980
But very briefly what we
can see there is I mentioned

897
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,745
vision and voice at the start.

898
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,970
So we've got, you know,
the multimodal digital,

899
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:13,590
how customers want to make
those changes to the policy.

900
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,440
We've got Amazon Connect at the top

901
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,393
or AWS Connect at the top for that,

902
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,760
for that voice side as well.

903
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,361
So it's the same engine powering
all these different inputs

904
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:27,840
on the customers and it's
given them the choice.

905
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,090
They have the choice of
what they want to do.

906
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,520
And then going back to,
you know, at the start,

907
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,320
we wanted to throw all
the products in the bin

908
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,630
and build this brand new AI thing.

909
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,910
What we've got in the middle
is this AI engine room

910
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,590
that Matthew spoke about, Matthew,

911
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,366
what Matt spoke about
before, Agent intelligence.

912
00:34:42,366 --> 00:34:47,100
And that's what we are
engaging our customer with now.

913
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,650
So it's not mass wholesale change,

914
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,980
it's a compliant product.

915
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,870
We've got legal buy-in.

916
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,760
We've got compliance buy-in

917
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,380
and we're not scaring our customers.

918
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,350
We're going after the low risk change.

919
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,526
And in the UK market, low
risk change is our change

920
00:35:03,526 --> 00:35:06,135
that don't impact the premium.

921
00:35:06,135 --> 00:35:09,142
So change in your telephone
number would be a good example.

922
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:11,460
Updating your marketing preferences,

923
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,720
don't send me any more junk mail,

924
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,800
those kind of things.

925
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,487
So yeah, I just wanted

926
00:35:15,487 --> 00:35:17,250
to include this kind
of slide as a precursor

927
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:22,250
to what the complex scary
AWS diagram looked like.

928
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,063
- [Jon] I guess now that we've done

929
00:35:24,063 --> 00:35:27,060
that exciting, nice and
deep explanation there,

930
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,130
I guess the real question is

931
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,687
with so much change going on, you know,

932
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:32,362
and as you said before MCP service existed

933
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:35,220
and obviously having
to architect all this,

934
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,360
how was that learning curve?

935
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,660
How did you adapt

936
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:41,696
and ensure that all of
your teams were able

937
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,163
to follow that learning curve with you?

938
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,160
- Funny you should ask, yeah,
I've got a slide on that one.

939
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,429
So to me, Matt touched on it
before, right at the very start

940
00:35:49,429 --> 00:35:51,540
and it's about culture.

941
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,390
It was very much about
bringing people along

942
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,800
on that journey,

943
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,890
making sure everyone was
using the same terminology

944
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,240
in a technical sense,

945
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,330
but also with the use of the AI dashboard,

946
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,270
everyone using the same
business language as well.

947
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,891
So to me the the biggest
learning curve was language

948
00:36:08,891 --> 00:36:12,180
and understanding across the business.

949
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,480
However, what we also came
across were, you know,

950
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,830
items in the news.

951
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,750
So being non-technical,

952
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,507
I hear the, the the the phrase DeepSeek

953
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:23,331
and I'm in a panic
contacting Matthew going,

954
00:36:23,331 --> 00:36:24,408
"We need to start again.

955
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:25,702
We need to throw everything out."

956
00:36:25,702 --> 00:36:28,080
You know, DeepSeek come
along, it's cheaper, faster,

957
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,730
what all that kind of good stuff.

958
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,280
And this is where the
groundwork we've put in

959
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,650
at the start starts to pay dividends.

960
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,090
- Yeah, so going back to that diagram,

961
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,770
if you remember one of
the original requirements

962
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,410
was we needed a mechanism
for evaluating models.

963
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,330
So this is where it started
to pay the dividends, right.

964
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,210
I got my first dividend kick
out of this passive investment.

965
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,970
So Chris came to me, rightly so, right.

966
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:48,840
'cause there's like trillions

967
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,860
wiped off the market overnight.

968
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,790
He goes holy smokes,

969
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,930
DeepSeek, what are we gonna do about it?

970
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,763
What's the answer?

971
00:36:52,763 --> 00:36:54,366
He wasn't the only one asking.

972
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:55,611
CEO was asking, board was
asking, what are we doing?

973
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:56,444
Is this something we need to jump on?

974
00:36:56,444 --> 00:36:58,350
Is this something we not need to jump on?

975
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:02,579
So what we did is we used
Bedrock's evaluation capability

976
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:05,190
via LLM as a judge and other things

977
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,350
and matched that with
Dynatrace's observability

978
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,430
to look at the metrics

979
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,680
and go, right, do we need to chase this

980
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,320
or is this just market hype for us?

981
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,610
Right, I'm not saying it's
market hype for everybody,

982
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,230
but in our particular case,

983
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,420
what we did then is we
actually wrote a blog on it

984
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,253
and posted it.

985
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:20,157
So if you look for CDL

986
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:21,510
and you look up DeepSeek,

987
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,040
you might see the blog
that we wrote on it.

988
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,100
We actually gave the eval
stats and our testing methods

989
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,420
and how we did that.

990
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,840
So that was a really quick
way for us to not lose focus

991
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,150
because with all this change
coming, one of the things

992
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,130
that you're gonna constantly
have to remind yourself

993
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,930
is why are you doing AI

994
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,910
and should you jump on the next thing?

995
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,250
Like when's the next time to jump on it?

996
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,330
The other thing that
Chris was talking about,

997
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,620
about terminology is

998
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,480
there's a lot of three
letter acronyms in IT.

999
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,820
There's a lot more three
letter acronyms in AI

1000
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,500
and there's protocols getting
released all the time.

1001
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,820
So A2A, AP2, MCP, right.

1002
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,830
I would say those things

1003
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,660
and I wanted the board to understand.

1004
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,940
So a lot of that terminology
I would bring to the board

1005
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,420
and say MCP is this,
this is what it means.

1006
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,180
And then I would encourage
them to go and use that

1007
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,860
and almost give 'em like
a homework assignment.

1008
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,247
It's like one of the
things I did is I said,

1009
00:38:09,247 --> 00:38:13,110
"Right has anybody tried a
different mode besides chatbots?"

1010
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,943
And like nobody raised their hand.

1011
00:38:13,943 --> 00:38:16,230
I said, "Right, how many
of you you use Gemini?"

1012
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,940
I went, "Oh yeah, everybody, okay cool.

1013
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,270
Use Gemini Live, try it
tonight, try it with the kids."

1014
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,430
And that's how we started to
introduce it into the boards

1015
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,650
to get them because then the fear reduces

1016
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,450
and they start to see the potential.

1017
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,440
- Yeah, so protocols, you know,

1018
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,470
this journey started
probably back in January

1019
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,000
and everything was new.

1020
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,490
MCP was new, A2A was being mentioned.

1021
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,353
I'm frantic trying to keep up.

1022
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,280
But one of my kind of favorite times

1023
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,690
of the month was when it
came to the board meeting,

1024
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:49,319
our CEOs, our CEO you know,

1025
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:53,160
highly educated in what's
going on in the world of AI

1026
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,227
and he's always trying to out
AI Matt, you know, saying,

1027
00:38:56,227 --> 00:38:57,843
"I've learned this, I've read that.

1028
00:38:57,843 --> 00:38:58,676
What are you bringing to the table, Matt?"

1029
00:38:58,676 --> 00:39:00,151
So, you know,

1030
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:02,790
the kind of the, the AI
world is always changing,

1031
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,440
but what I'm starting to, you know,

1032
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,400
as a non-tech person is
starting to enjoy is the world

1033
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,160
of MCP, the world of Dynatrace MCP,

1034
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,340
but also being able to
connect that to Kiro as well.

1035
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,590
So you know, the tech is now starting

1036
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,000
to put it in someone's hands

1037
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,370
that doesn't fully understand tech.

1038
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,700
You know, the Dynatrace MCP
with Kiro, I can see us rolling

1039
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,040
that out to a almost service desk level

1040
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,140
where the service desk now are able

1041
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,020
to service our customers using, you know,

1042
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,250
this kind of AI text.

1043
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,563
So it's not only B2B,
well no, it's only B2C,

1044
00:39:34,563 --> 00:39:38,910
it's also B2B now as well, Matthew.

1045
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,920
- Yeah, so around what
Chris was talking about,

1046
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,050
again, this goes back to
the, that AI steering group.

1047
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,580
So because of that AI steering group,

1048
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,880
we were able to get Kiro
approved again within a few days

1049
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,600
and we rolled that out
to all 250 engineers.

1050
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,874
What we then did is we held
a hackathon a couple of weeks

1051
00:39:54,874 --> 00:39:55,707
after we enabled that,

1052
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:59,033
got Dynatrace to give us
early access to their MCP,

1053
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:01,781
which is hosted, which is great, right.

1054
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:03,720
Hosted MCPs are way better

1055
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,130
'cause you don't gotta manage 'em.

1056
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,660
And then we had AWS come in

1057
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,330
and help us with a Kiro training session

1058
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,500
and then we combined all that

1059
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,930
and our last hackathon that
we had a couple of weeks ago,

1060
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,660
we had 23 teams submit

1061
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,530
and of those 23 teams, 21
of those teams used Kiro

1062
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,950
and some form of MCP, some
with Dynatrace, some without.

1063
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,954
So we're seeing a massive adoption

1064
00:40:24,954 --> 00:40:26,880
and it's like making changes,

1065
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,086
but again, it's helping people
get over that hurdle of,

1066
00:40:30,086 --> 00:40:32,130
you know, that learning curve

1067
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,420
and understanding the protocols

1068
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,730
and what MCP means for them and their day.

1069
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,930
Because I gave a a thing

1070
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,120
and I said think about the things

1071
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,510
that make you wanna get
out of bed in the morning.

1072
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,863
Don't use AI for those.

1073
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,150
Think about the things that
makes you wanna stay in bed.

1074
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,120
Those are the things that
you wanna automate with AI

1075
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,450
and to explain some more
of what AWS is offering is

1076
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,130
around this 'cause I talked
a little bit about Bedrock,

1077
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,250
a little bit about Kiro and
I'm gonna hand over to Ishan

1078
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,720
to talk about some of
the further developments.

1079
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,130
- Thank you Matt,

1080
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:05,520
so we looked at building AI agents

1081
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,770
is a part culture journey.

1082
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,682
We also looked at how different
offerings like observability

1083
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:15,731
through Dynatrace helped serial
CDL go in production work

1084
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:18,120
and build these agents.

1085
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,343
We also looked at how evaluations along

1086
00:41:20,343 --> 00:41:24,033
with observability was the
key to get to production.

1087
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:31,460
So we at AWS believe that AWS
is the best place to build,

1088
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,450
deploy, and operationalize AI agents

1089
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,420
and if you are looking for the recipe

1090
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,720
to building the agents,
you're in the right place.

1091
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,290
So let me give you like a four point note

1092
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:49,110
on what are some of the successful ways

1093
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,970
you can build the AI agents.

1094
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,640
So starting with you need
to have a use case defined,

1095
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,520
which has a clear success criteria.

1096
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,180
Success criteria is often a
mix of not just the quality

1097
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,170
but also latency cost and don't
miss out on good experience

1098
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,620
because that's what you're
building with these AI agents.

1099
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,390
So as you're building these agents,

1100
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,390
you are often looking
at different frameworks.

1101
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,800
You are looking at different models

1102
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,140
so that you know no one model

1103
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,580
can solve for all the problems.

1104
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,860
So you need a choice of models.

1105
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,800
You're also looking at how
can you securely, safely

1106
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,400
and reliably deploy these
AI agents in production.

1107
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,320
And lastly, you're also looking for

1108
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,600
how do you make these
AI agents discoverable

1109
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,220
to your other organizations,

1110
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,863
other teams maybe externally to customers?

1111
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:40,740
To do all of this, let's
look at the portfolio

1112
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:44,330
that AWS has across different AI services.

1113
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:48,717
So on the top we have
the out of box agent.

1114
00:42:48,717 --> 00:42:51,330
Agent tech features like Kiro.

1115
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,360
Kiro is our code built tool.

1116
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,410
You can build spec-based
agents using that.

1117
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,990
Then if you come little down from

1118
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,360
that in the center you have Amazon Bedrock

1119
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,810
and AgentCore which provides
you with like inference,

1120
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,590
sorry, inferences for the models.

1121
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,440
It gives you like ability to build agents,

1122
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,180
deploy agents in production

1123
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,650
and then as you need more control in terms

1124
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:22,350
of the infrastructure that
powers all of these agents

1125
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,740
and like your use your workflows,

1126
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,430
you may want to like look
into the infrastructure side

1127
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:32,310
of the things like SageMaker
provides you with the choice

1128
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,190
of like how you customize
these different instances.

1129
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:37,560
You can also look into the
AI compute side of the things

1130
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,250
with Trainium and Inferentia

1131
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,930
So these are a lot of offerings

1132
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:44,682
and today we are talking about AI agents,

1133
00:43:44,682 --> 00:43:46,713
building them in a reliable way.

1134
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,690
So I want to focus

1135
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:52,500
only on the Amazon Bedrock
AgentCore side of the things.

1136
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,150
So these are nine different
services offered under

1137
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,473
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

1138
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,230
So I'll start with the runtime

1139
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:04,260
and I'll try to describe
each of those on a high level

1140
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,530
because we have roughly 15 minutes left.

1141
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:09,300
So agent Go runtime is

1142
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,300
where you can deploy any agentic framework

1143
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,000
that uses any agent model,
sorry, any LLM model

1144
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,890
and you can do that on scale.

1145
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,440
So super easy to go production

1146
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,020
by deploying your agents
on AgentCore runtime.

1147
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,250
Agents need memory

1148
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,070
so that they can
personalize the responses.

1149
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:32,100
So AgentCore memory comes in handy there.

1150
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,380
It can seamlessly work with your agent

1151
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,620
and all of these are production ready.

1152
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,710
All the services that we
see here are composable.

1153
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,730
So you don't have

1154
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:45,076
to like use specific
services in a specific order.

1155
00:44:45,076 --> 00:44:46,764
You can just pick any,

1156
00:44:46,764 --> 00:44:50,070
use those wherever you are in the journey

1157
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:51,990
of building these agents.

1158
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,450
Then we have identity, which
is such an important aspect

1159
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:58,470
of controlling what access
does this agent have,

1160
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,680
what tools it can invoke
and so on and so forth.

1161
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,830
Then we have gateway which exposes like,

1162
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:07,083
which actually acts like a central,

1163
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,880
let's say central place
to host all your tools

1164
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,880
such that your agent can
talk to them seamlessly.

1165
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,190
Then we have code,
interpreter, and browser.

1166
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,770
These are the built-in tools
you can just associate directly

1167
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:27,300
with your agent in again,
using any framework, any model.

1168
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,770
So you could just associate those

1169
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,120
and use these out of the box.

1170
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,230
They're ready for the production agents.

1171
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,060
Then you have built in observability

1172
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:40,813
and yesterday we also launched
policy and evaluations.

1173
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,010
So policy helps you.

1174
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,925
So we first looked at
identity, which controls

1175
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:49,590
what access the agent has,
and then policy comes in

1176
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:54,270
and helps interrupt wrong
actions that an agent can take

1177
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,380
because as you know,

1178
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,110
agents are powered by
large language models,

1179
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,820
which are non-deterministic.

1180
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,696
So agent code policy helps in

1181
00:46:01,696 --> 00:46:06,150
to intercept any unexpected behavior.

1182
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,612
A typical example of that would be like,

1183
00:46:07,612 --> 00:46:12,612
let's say your agent can
refund on your behalf

1184
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,610
and you have a policy that,
hey, I don't want any refunds

1185
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:20,040
to be issued that are
over a thousand dollars.

1186
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,520
So if you want to implement
this AgentCore policy is

1187
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,370
something that would come very handy.

1188
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,265
Then evaluations is another offering

1189
00:46:28,265 --> 00:46:30,147
that we had launched yesterday.

1190
00:46:30,147 --> 00:46:32,372
It provides you like
with built-in evaluators

1191
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,410
that you could use,

1192
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,860
but you can also extend
these two custom evaluators.

1193
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,173
They are LLM as judge-based.

1194
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:44,370
So let's look at how
AgentCore different offerings

1195
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,409
within AgentCore work together.

1196
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:48,810
So as we see in this diagram,

1197
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:51,120
we have AgentCore runtime
in the center of it.

1198
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,552
So you can deploy again
any agent framework,

1199
00:46:53,552 --> 00:46:56,076
let's say for an example, strand agent,

1200
00:46:56,076 --> 00:46:58,530
it could be a LangGraph,

1201
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:01,590
could be LangChain,
LlamaIndex, anything really.

1202
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:04,050
So you can deploy any agentic framework

1203
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:07,710
that is using any agent
model, sorry, any LLM model.

1204
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:11,040
And it can seamlessly interact with memory

1205
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,890
to get the personalization,
sorry, personalized records

1206
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:17,373
of the context that you
want to feed into the agent.

1207
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,240
The runtime AgentCore
runtime also seamlessly

1208
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,620
interacts with gateway.

1209
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,050
Again, there is an
authentication layer here.

1210
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,800
So every time your agent
that's hosted on runtime

1211
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,800
also has to get like a
access from the identity

1212
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:35,670
in order to go through the gateway

1213
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:38,640
so that it can seamlessly fetch tools.

1214
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,020
Search through tools

1215
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,742
and search of tool

1216
00:47:41,742 --> 00:47:44,031
in the gateway is such
an important feature

1217
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:46,410
because you may have hundreds of tools,

1218
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,960
maybe thousands of tools and
you don't want to feed all

1219
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,000
of them into the agent's context.

1220
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,380
So that it really gives you

1221
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,380
that relevance and efficiency
that you are after.

1222
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,290
And then if you look at the
tools, there is browser tool

1223
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:00,201
and core interpreter, you can
seamlessly associate those

1224
00:48:00,201 --> 00:48:02,700
into your agent.

1225
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,560
And observability and evaluation

1226
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,710
sort of sits through across all of these

1227
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:11,459
and you get observability not
about just the agent tracing,

1228
00:48:11,459 --> 00:48:13,020
but also like,

1229
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,650
hey, how many requests
were raised to my gateway?

1230
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:21,650
Was it authenticated or not?
Did my agent invoke the memory?

1231
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,180
What was fetched from it?
What was written to it?

1232
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,480
And all those good things.

1233
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,610
So I spoke a lot about the capabilities.

1234
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:30,840
How you build,

1235
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,400
like these are like compostable services,

1236
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,920
so you could use these to build AI agents,

1237
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,720
but as I mentioned earlier,

1238
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,840
you're really after
creating a good experience

1239
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,006
and technical capabilities
are not so, sorry,

1240
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:47,760
technical capabilities are
not equal to good experience.

1241
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,280
Good experience is the only
one feature that matters

1242
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,410
as you're creating these AI agents.

1243
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:54,110
With that, I'll hand over to John.

1244
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,580
- Yeah, so I think, obviously,

1245
00:48:57,694 --> 00:48:59,531
we've had most of the CDL story now,

1246
00:48:59,531 --> 00:49:01,200
but I think that the key part here,

1247
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,640
especially with what Ishan's been saying

1248
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,020
about the sheer breadth

1249
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,820
of the AWS platform and
what can be provided

1250
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,710
and the reality of

1251
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,740
how much new capabilities
have come out in, you know,

1252
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,100
the recent even weeks, even
this week specifically,

1253
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,100
but you know, the recent months and so on.

1254
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,640
How did you as CDL know when it was right,

1255
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,435
when it was time to move into production,

1256
00:49:22,435 --> 00:49:24,270
when it was the appropriate time

1257
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:27,090
and you weren't just adding on
new capabilities continuously

1258
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,760
and continuously, when was it
right to move into production

1259
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,303
and, of course, how was the
actual rollout into production?

1260
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:38,580
- All right, well, I'd say,

1261
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,700
we knew we were ready for production

1262
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,885
when AWS was verified it with the FTR.

1263
00:49:45,885 --> 00:49:47,850
We achieved the ISO standard

1264
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,560
or we were on the path to achieving it

1265
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,050
because I think we actually
released it slightly before

1266
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,943
and we knew that we had defined
enough thin slice of value.

1267
00:49:55,943 --> 00:49:57,510
So our product research came in

1268
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:59,790
and said, we've defined
a thin enough slice

1269
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:00,957
that it's useful.

1270
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:03,390
And so we combined all those
things about why we were trying

1271
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:04,590
to do it and we had a good enough story

1272
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,180
and we had all the go to market material.

1273
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,310
And combining all those
things then allowed us to push

1274
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:12,210
that button and have the
faith to take that step,

1275
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,400
that will vary from
organization to organization

1276
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,510
is what I'll say on that.

1277
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:17,130
But as long as you're firm on your why

1278
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,390
and you've identified
that first thin slice

1279
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,487
and you've secured it to, you know,

1280
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,360
you've got your sign-offs,
just push the button,

1281
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,203
take the step.

1282
00:50:27,028 --> 00:50:29,374
- Yeah, I think just
to add to that as well,

1283
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:31,380
this is just the start.

1284
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,689
You know, we've got the compliance

1285
00:50:33,689 --> 00:50:34,522
and we want to go at pace

1286
00:50:34,522 --> 00:50:36,270
and we feel we've done that.

1287
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,860
What we can do now is we can start

1288
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,150
to work with our customers.

1289
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:42,660
So we've worked with our
partners, AWS and Dynatrace.

1290
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,150
We can now start to
work with our customers

1291
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,160
and find out where their value is.

1292
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,370
You know, we've opened
their eyes to what AI can do

1293
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:51,660
with our products.

1294
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:55,350
It's now let's go together,
let's go at pace together.

1295
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,060
Let's help you with your challenges,

1296
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:01,200
let's help you figure out
where we can help you.

1297
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,040
You know, our systems
are highly configurable,

1298
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,860
so how they can be used varies
from customer to customer,

1299
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,290
but you know, focusing on
kind of customer success,

1300
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,210
our products, our ecosystem,

1301
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:14,550
work with them and see what, what's next.

1302
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:15,894
So who knows what it could be?

1303
00:51:15,894 --> 00:51:19,440
Are they ready for,
you know, those changes

1304
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,840
to a policy that impact the premium?

1305
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,370
Or are they wanting to go,

1306
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:27,124
actually let's work more on
the policy lifecycle changes

1307
00:51:27,124 --> 00:51:28,923
which are left risky.

1308
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:33,870
- Okay, so we don't have a massive amount

1309
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:35,074
of time left, unfortunately.

1310
00:51:35,074 --> 00:51:36,360
- That's fine.

1311
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,193
- Sorry, talked a bit.

1312
00:51:37,193 --> 00:51:39,262
You like to talk.

1313
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:43,180
So I guess very quickly,
rather than own full Q&A

1314
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,970
obviously Chris,

1315
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,400
just then you were talking
about your customers

1316
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,360
and their success.

1317
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,800
Have you got any insights around

1318
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,843
how this has specifically impacted them?

1319
00:51:52,829 --> 00:51:53,772
- The biggest one is,

1320
00:51:53,772 --> 00:51:58,500
is fear at the moment, it's something new.

1321
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,467
So we've been on this
journey for 12 months

1322
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:02,520
and you know, we've been engaging
them and talking to them.

1323
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,750
So it's bringing them on the journey now

1324
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,490
is probably the biggest
thing I've got to say.

1325
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:09,680
What we don't want to do is

1326
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,630
kind of scare them with
the new technology.

1327
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,894
Is that me?

1328
00:52:13,894 --> 00:52:15,000
So that would kind of be my thing.

1329
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,980
That's the biggest
learning I've got so far.

1330
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,650
But I think internally as
well, we've learned a lot.

1331
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:23,463
I think the opportunities
that Kiro, Dynatrace, MCP

1332
00:52:23,463 --> 00:52:26,876
and all the other MPCs are
going to give us is really going

1333
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:29,850
to open up internal opportunities.

1334
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:32,520
You know, we speak about a
lot about AI and efficiencies,

1335
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,820
but it's trying to find
the why but also the what.

1336
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,838
And I think Dynatrace MCPs really going

1337
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:41,430
to open up opportunities
at our service desk level

1338
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,923
from a first line and
also second line as well.

1339
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,073
- I guess, Matt,

1340
00:52:46,073 --> 00:52:48,724
have you got any key takeaways you'd like

1341
00:52:48,724 --> 00:52:51,000
to give from this whole experience?

1342
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,500
- Know your why, right.

1343
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,446
So with AI it's not about

1344
00:52:54,446 --> 00:52:56,771
how many things you can do, right.

1345
00:52:56,771 --> 00:53:00,300
Because it can do so many things.

1346
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,820
It's about picking the right
thing that works for you,

1347
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,940
make sure it's part of your
core value proposition.

1348
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,280
And I know that probably
sounds really basic,

1349
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,710
but that is so key to
actually getting value.

1350
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:13,360
What you're giving your
customers today without AI

1351
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,200
is value enough, right.

1352
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,400
Because obviously you're
still making the sales,

1353
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,500
you guys are all still
sitting here getting paid.

1354
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,550
To take that next step.

1355
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,410
You gotta think, right,
what is AI gonna do

1356
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:24,340
that's gonna transform that

1357
00:53:25,755 --> 00:53:28,705
and grab onto that and just
run with it as fast as you can?

1358
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,946
- And it's finally very quickly as well.

1359
00:53:32,946 --> 00:53:35,011
Obviously as Ishan mentioned AgentCore,

1360
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:38,010
obviously a very big thing
for AWS at the moment.

1361
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,380
Obviously, didn't exist when
you were doing all of this,

1362
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,120
but I guess the question is

1363
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,500
have you started utilizing that?

1364
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,110
How do you think it's
gonna impact your estate

1365
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,450
and what you've built so far
and and what's your thoughts?

1366
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,860
- Yes, we're actually working on V2

1367
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,120
of that engine room already.

1368
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,675
So again, if Matt's still
here, he's in the back there.

1369
00:53:53,675 --> 00:53:55,590
He's working on V2 for me.

1370
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:57,710
But essentially yes it
will very much include

1371
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,490
AgentCore as an option.

1372
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:03,180
We see it as a way to remember
I always said we needed

1373
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,879
to wash, rinse, repeat those thin slices.

1374
00:54:04,879 --> 00:54:08,160
We see AgentCore is giving
us that repeatable capability

1375
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,650
of doing that and it'll probably allow us

1376
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:15,060
to embrace MCP in our backend
to start to to connect

1377
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,130
to these because we've got
all these API interfaces.

1378
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:19,560
So it's like right, we need to MCPify,

1379
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,300
if that's a word, all those things

1380
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,580
and we think AgentCore
is gonna help with that.

1381
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:27,510
We also know that as our
customers catch up so to speak

1382
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:30,213
and they come up with
their own chat things

1383
00:54:30,213 --> 00:54:32,143
or LLM things

1384
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:36,240
, they're gonna want to use
us as a tool in MCP speak.

1385
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,850
So we are probably gonna need
to offer them an MCP interface

1386
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,440
again, which we think we can do with this.

1387
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,490
And it's especially helpful

1388
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,470
'cause I think it was just
this week that API gateway

1389
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,450
now supports that type of transaction.

1390
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,430
So again, you're looking
at our model going,

1391
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:50,230
you can see the V2 before I
even really need to draw it.

1392
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,090
- Anything you wanted to add to Ishan?

1393
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,890
Anything that could help 'em further?

1394
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,347
- Yeah, so I think really what

1395
00:54:58,347 --> 00:55:01,560
from the capability point-of-view,

1396
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,340
AgentCore does have
these composable services

1397
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:08,076
that you can use in order
to build these agents

1398
00:55:08,076 --> 00:55:10,620
and go to production reliably.

1399
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,760
But I think I also want

1400
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,759
to focus on developing a success criteria

1401
00:55:14,759 --> 00:55:17,845
as we are all thinking about building AI

1402
00:55:17,845 --> 00:55:21,990
and especially like
measurable success criteria

1403
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,641
because that's really how
you are going to measure

1404
00:55:24,641 --> 00:55:27,300
if your agent is performing or not

1405
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,544
and usually the success criteria
should be very much related

1406
00:55:30,544 --> 00:55:32,880
to what your business metrics are.

1407
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,756
So I want you to also like focus on that

1408
00:55:34,756 --> 00:55:37,093
and have the experience piece a part

1409
00:55:37,093 --> 00:55:38,823
of that success criteria.

1410
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:42,270
- So if you do have any more questions we

1411
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,410
will be outside for a little bit.

1412
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,240
So do feel free and come ask questions

1413
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,253
to any of us about anything.

1414
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,127
Probably specifically Dynatrace, CDL

1415
00:55:50,127 --> 00:55:51,390
and what they've done on their journey.

1416
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,760
But obviously Dynatrace,

1417
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,070
we do have have a booth in the expo.

1418
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,860
So please do come and see us at 575.

1419
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:02,700
And if you did want some something to read

1420
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,430
on your potentially long
back, long walk back

1421
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:08,340
to one of the other
hotels for your next talk,

1422
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,187
feel free to scan on the QR
codes as well, thank you.

1423
00:56:11,187 --> 00:56:12,270
- [Matthew] Thank you Everybody.

1424
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:13,352
- Thanks so much.
- Appreciate your time.

1425
00:56:13,352 --> 00:56:14,958
(audience clapping)
