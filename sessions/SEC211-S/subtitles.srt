1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,130
- Welcome, welcome to SEC211-S.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,620
So we're going to obviously
talk about security stuff.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,850
My name's David Mills,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,420
and this is Nick, AKA Nicholas Jackson.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,810
And our goal for this session, as it is

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,390
for all the sessions
that we deliver, is for

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,090
you to take away at least
one actionable thing

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,290
from the session that you could take

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,320
back to your organizations and
help improve your security.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,053
So we'll try to make that happen.

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,860
And so obviously today,
we're going to talk about

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,450
agentic systems, how
those can be problematic,

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,940
how they can do wonderful
things, but also be problematic

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,430
because you have so many
non-human identities

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,610
that are tied in with
these agentic systems

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,540
and often not well managed,
either not tied to a real human,

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,730
they don't have the
right policies assigned,

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,100
and where that can get you into trouble.

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,220
So with that, I am going to let Nick

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,200
walk you through what the agenda items are

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,850
and what we're going to talk about today.

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,410
- So we're going to look through,

23
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,080
I think, predominantly some
of the risks and the threats

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,820
that can affect agentic systems,

25
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,520
the development life cycle because I,

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,630
we're going to kind of look at that

27
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,690
as a potential threat in addition to the

28
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,240
sort of the runtime of your systems.

29
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,450
How you can do things
like protect systems,

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,220
predominantly what we're
going to concentrate on

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,500
are looking at things like secrets.

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,300
All agentic systems like microservices,

33
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,680
like anything else you're
building is going to have

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,180
a requirement for secrets,
whether they are dynamic, static,

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,703
PKI, all of those kinds of things.

36
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,850
And we're going to look at this from a,

37
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,580
I think like a cautionary tale,

38
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,830
a little bit of a scenario for you,

39
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,010
which looks at I think
quite an interesting way,

40
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,130
which makes agentic system
a little bit more vulnerable

41
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,200
than an ordinary system.

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,460
And of course, how you can
address many of these threats.

43
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,130
And of course, one of the
most important things,

44
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,840
which kind of comes out of a lot of this,

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,730
which is looking at agentic
identity and how to manage that.

46
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,320
- Alright, with that, let's get started.

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,340
We got a lot to cover today

48
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,690
so we might move a little quickly,

49
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,390
but definitely provide a
lot of good information

50
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,970
for you to take away,
so most of us have seen

51
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,690
the big news headlines about
breaches that are happening.

52
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,580
A lot of them are happening for

53
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,360
reasons of just not enforcing
basic security practices,

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,780
which we're going to talk about
but AI is involved in these.

55
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,250
So McDonald's had exposure of
64 million job applications.

56
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,010
There was an AI agent that was accessed

57
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,080
the records using a basic password attack.

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,920
I think it was something like

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,790
one, two, three, four, five,
six for their Machir platform.

60
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,070
Samsung implemented a crackdown

61
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,070
after somebody accidentally
put source code in ChatGPT.

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,420
And so this was some IP
that got exposed via ChatGPT

63
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,080
and ServiceAide was
subject to HIPAA violations

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,990
and fines after a data
breach was discovered.

65
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,645
And this was related to
an Elasticsearch database

66
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:03,117
that was exposed for more than six weeks.

67
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:07,470
483,000 patient records were exposed

68
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,780
and these could have
been avoided using basic

69
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,710
security practices being put into place.

70
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,430
So if you look at the top
risks just a few years ago,

71
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,280
it was injection, so think SQL injection

72
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,890
and some of you might
have remembered the memes

73
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,330
with little bobby tables or
drop tables that was being used.

74
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,550
So basically just some
really bad formatting

75
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,050
to do bad things in databases.

76
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,280
And so over time, companies,
organizations learn

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,990
to be more careful about parameters

78
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,900
and how they were formatting
things to avoid this problem.

79
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,880
But here we are again and
currently now we've got

80
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,580
prompt injections as
the number one problem.

81
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,730
So it kind of feels like we
need to learn those lessons

82
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,933
all over again.

83
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,930
So let's start by looking at
what the attack surface is,

84
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,350
what the architecture looks
like for an agentic system.

85
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,000
And then I'm going to walk you through

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,630
some of the most common
categories of those threats.

87
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,490
We're not going to dive
deeply into all of them

88
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,260
because that could be a separate session,

89
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,990
but to give you some context
for what's going on here.

90
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,570
So here we have a system that has a user,

91
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,050
they're obviously wanting
to do something with AI

92
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,640
and they are accessing

93
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,130
and asking agents to do things for them.

94
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,830
Those agents are connecting to tools.

95
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,250
Those tools then are accessing services

96
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,440
to be able to do what they need to do.

97
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,940
And so if you go from left to right,

98
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,500
there's a lot of moving parts

99
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,690
and we start thinking about the fact that

100
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,180
these new agents are so autonomous

101
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,670
and they start making
decisions on their own.

102
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,930
They're not just making decisions

103
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,140
based on predetermined answers,

104
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,210
which is kind of where we started

105
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,820
with some of the AI stuff
that we worked with.

106
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,050
They have adaptive learning,

107
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,410
they're continuously learning
and adjusting their behavior,

108
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,630
and there's this expanded attack surface.

109
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,610
So you can see from left to right,

110
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,490
there's a lot of different
stages and a lot of different

111
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,180
vulnerability points in this architecture.

112
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,000
So let's go through some
of the major categories.

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,360
One is obviously identity
and authorization threats.

114
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,200
So something that you may have
heard called confused deputy,

115
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,810
this is where you have a
service with high privileges,

116
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,030
more privileges than they should have

117
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,220
because those policies or privileges

118
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,020
were not enforced correctly.

119
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,570
So if the user that's using that agent

120
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,780
has only read permissions,
that agent should not have

121
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,110
right permissions, so some of
those things are really basic.

122
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,290
If we look at credential
and secret management,

123
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,930
secret exposure and theft is a huge one.

124
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,190
And there still exists

125
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,710
a major issue with long-lived credentials.

126
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,960
So if you're not rotating the credentials,

127
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,160
they're hard coded,

128
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,920
you've got a lot of sprawl
and the more sprawl you have,

129
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,020
the more vulnerabilities you have.

130
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,090
Tool and integration and exploits.

131
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,470
So we look at some of those tools

132
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,600
and the fact that they're
integrating with services,

133
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,860
different things happening.

134
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,710
There's something called
a tool poisoning attack.

135
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,590
That can lead to sensitive
data exfiltration,

136
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,180
unauthorized actions.

137
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,100
And it's really about the APIs

138
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,420
not having robust
authentication and it makes them

139
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,190
particularly vulnerable,

140
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,390
Supply chain attacks,
so in working with AI

141
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,670
and working with these agents,

142
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,260
most organizations are starting

143
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,660
to adopt the model context protocol

144
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,430
that makes it easy to integrate

145
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,300
whatever your agentic or AI platform is

146
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,350
with your databases or whatever
you need to integrate with

147
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,780
because you don't have
to make these bespoke

148
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,800
AI integrations, MCP
servers can do that for you.

149
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,490
But those MCP servers
can also be vulnerable,

150
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,150
their server registries, their
patch and update mechanisms

151
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,980
introduce a new surface that
can be a threat and that can be

152
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,090
hijacked and do things
like inject malicious code.

153
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,320
Multi-agent systems, so in
many cases it's not just

154
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,590
one agent that you're leveRAGing
to do what you need to do.

155
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,840
There can be a control
agent and there can be

156
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,390
other agents that agent is controlling

157
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,580
for things that it needs to do.

158
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,240
Pulling records or doing other
things that need to be done.

159
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,860
So if you can inject

160
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,530
or tamper with messages
between those agents,

161
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,840
then you can inject false information

162
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,180
and that propagates across those agents

163
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,380
that are communicating and
get them to do bad things.

164
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,760
Prompt-based attacks,

165
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,060
direct prompt injection is
the one that I mentioned now.

166
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,010
It's the number one vulnerability

167
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,020
and that's a situation where

168
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,420
you can use carefully crafted commands

169
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,970
that can override agent instructions.

170
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,240
So a recent example of
this, sorry I'm laughing,

171
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,240
is when Chevy dealerships AI chatbot

172
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,240
was tricked into offering a
$76,000 Chevy Tahoe for just $1.

173
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,960
Yes, that happened.

174
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,840
I'd love to get that
offer for a Porsche Taycan

175
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,306
but that's another conversation.

176
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:03,930
Data security threats, RAG poisoning.

177
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,580
So basically you have retrieval

178
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,510
augmented generation systems
that we're starting to rely on.

179
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,030
That's a technique that allows
you to get retrieval-based

180
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,850
and generation-based input to improve

181
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,560
performance and accuracy

182
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,870
of these agents and some
of these language models.

183
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,760
And the two biggest risks associated

184
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,520
with the RAG systems
are the poison databases

185
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,030
and then also leakage of sensitive data.

186
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,950
In terms of runtime and
operational threats,

187
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,750
you've got tool misuse

188
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,330
and agents are tricked into calling tools

189
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,300
with the wrong credentials
or elevated privileges.

190
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,230
So once again, it comes back
to basics where you've got

191
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,860
credential problems and
you've got elevated privileges

192
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,000
that you can take care of
before this ever happens.

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,740
Detection and guardrail evasion,

194
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,920
there are some categories here
that are very sophisticated.

195
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,770
Sometimes just ensuring simple

196
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,410
security principles are not enough.

197
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,990
Multimodal attacks as an example here.

198
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,450
So if you can exploit
different input types

199
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,160
to embed malicious instructions

200
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,650
and formats that evade detection,

201
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,570
then that is a problem as well.

202
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,060
So for example, adversarial text

203
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,330
can use carefully-crafted phrases

204
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,930
and that can mislead the agent
to do things it shouldn't do.

205
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,270
These can be harder to detect because

206
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,310
malicious content may not be distributed

207
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,990
across different media types.

208
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,325
So in the healthcare sector,

209
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:29,700
multimodal models are often used

210
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,240
in critical diagnostics
treatment planning.

211
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,840
The systems may use
contributions from text-based

212
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,380
medical records, imaging
like x-rays or MRIs,

213
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,360
and then even real-time sensor data.

214
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,120
So the multimodal part is
they're getting input from

215
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,180
all different types of formats
and different types of data,

216
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,890
so that's very complicated.

217
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,530
In terms of compliance
and governance gaps,

218
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,100
simply having audit trails
is really, really important.

219
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,890
But that's something that
is not always in place

220
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,020
when people are using agentic systems.

221
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,960
So those audit trails obviously make it

222
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,400
possible to trace agent actions
back to human authorizers

223
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,370
and for you to do
forensics when things like

224
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,470
this happen and when things go wrong.

225
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,580
So as you can see, there's a
long list of vulnerabilities in

226
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,600
what we kind of put together
in 10 logical categories.

227
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,820
And so that's a lot that
you need to think about

228
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,830
and that's a lot that
you have to fend off.

229
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,730
Prompt-based exploits account for 35.3%

230
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,133
of all the documented AI incidents.

231
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,510
There's $100,00 a loss on average

232
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,270
with losses that are being
caused without writing code.

233
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,790
So you have some of
these text-based attacks

234
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,910
that seem very simple but very possible

235
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,860
and that are being used now.

236
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,200
The zero-click vulnerability,

237
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,550
one that was known as EchoLeak,

238
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,840
enabled data exfiltration
from Microsoft 365 Copilot

239
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,400
through pure text

240
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,440
that was embedded in
normal business documents.

241
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,200
So the payload requires no code execution,

242
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,660
Copilot behaves like it's supposed to,

243
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,120
and then it processes
this malicious prompt

244
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,170
when the user opens in a
seemingly innocent file

245
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,400
or something that's innocuous.

246
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,853
So with that whirlwind tour
of all of these categories,

247
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,930
security challenges don't
just emerge in production.

248
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,350
So you need to think
about this in development

249
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,780
and where some of these
things can be guarded against

250
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,160
and where some of them get introduced.

251
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,370
So Nick's going to give
you a dive into the whole

252
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,310
agent development lifecycle
and kind of what happens there

253
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,350
and how you think about security.

254
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,610
- So as David's kind of said,

255
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,770
we just looked at the landscape of your

256
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,510
agentic applications
running in production.

257
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,360
You can see there are a
number of threats on them.

258
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,010
Some of them are, you know,

259
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,260
fairly aligned to running something

260
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,780
that you might see in
a microservice system,

261
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,120
but the software development lifecycle

262
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,720
or the agent development
lifecycle is equally important.

263
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,763
And there's a number of threats,

264
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,410
which kind of make your
application vulnerable.

265
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,310
So this chart here comes from

266
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:07,310
a paper that IBM authored and
was validated by Anthropic,

267
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,850
and it looked at secure enterprise
application development.

268
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,100
So this is predominantly looking at

269
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,590
the application development lifecycle

270
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,470
and anybody who's looked at software

271
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,860
development lifecycle will
see that it's very similar.

272
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,860
So the area that I want to
concentrate on is build and test.

273
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,040
So let's kind of have a look at this.

274
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,470
So when you're looking at
the build and the test phase,

275
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,320
you sort of have to
consider certain things.

276
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,400
So the IBM document says that
we should be looking at things

277
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,080
like hybrid models by design,

278
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,420
looking at hybrid cloud by design,

279
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,860
looking at interoperability,

280
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,350
building things which are tool centric,

281
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,570
importantly, secure by design.

282
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,590
And I think this is something that we've

283
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,780
kind of learned over a number
of years to kind of have

284
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,150
that approach of just
building secure by design

285
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,440
as a first principle of
developing any new feature.

286
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,490
But also we need to look at
the kind of the blast radius

287
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,100
and trying to look at
our agents and our tools

288
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,300
and putting them in a box,

289
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,070
kind of really having
them heavily restricted.

290
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,603
So if something does go wrong,
then that is constrained.

291
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,830
Now where I kind of
want to put a little bit

292
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,020
more emphasis on this is
looking at vibe coding.

293
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:30,020
How many people here vibe code, right?

294
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,570
And are the rest of you lying
or have you not tried it yet?

295
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,840
Right? I mean, seriously,
it's a very powerful tool.

296
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,290
I use it myself, I love
using it as a tool because

297
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,610
something for me as an
application developer,

298
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,393
it assists me to get my
job done really quickly.

299
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,750
But the key thing is when
I'm looking at vibe coding,

300
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,790
my mind is in a very different place

301
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,670
than it is if I'm just writing
plain application code,

302
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,640
doing pair programming,
or writing on my own.

303
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,460
I'm looking at things inadvertently,

304
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,900
things like speed over security.

305
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,280
I'm just kind of working through this.

306
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,470
I'm just mashing away, right?

307
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,470
And where this kind of causes problems is

308
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,677
it introduces new areas
of supply chain attack.

309
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:16,380
And I can have issues where
maybe I'm not validating

310
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,840
dependencies as tightly
as I would if I was

311
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,440
manually kind of authoring
the code or going through

312
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:24,390
a sort of a more formal process

313
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,850
'cause this is new world, right?

314
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,850
So we're kind of breaking the rules here

315
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:30,603
to increase velocity.

316
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,430
And the kind of the key
thing I think around a lot of

317
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,890
code that is written
when you're kind of using

318
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,070
some wonderful tooling
like Claude and things

319
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,170
is that you have functional correctness,

320
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,650
but you don't necessarily have security.

321
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,650
And where this can fall down is

322
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,880
let's think of a little scenario here.

323
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,280
So what we're going to look
at is a little scenario.

324
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,410
So I am a junior developer

325
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,120
and I am going to be using Claude,

326
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,010
I'm empowered to write
a feature for an agent.

327
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,270
And the feature is going to be

328
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:14,270
that I'm going to add a new
endpoint to my weather tool.

329
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,870
Now, as a kind of a good practice,

330
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,930
my company has provided me
with a bunch of best practices

331
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,760
that the agent is going to use.

332
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,220
All of the kind of the
good development practices

333
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,330
we've encoded into a document

334
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,100
that the agent can understand and can use.

335
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,870
So we start off and
we're like, "Hey, okay,

336
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,200
I need to add a new
endpoint to the weather tool

337
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,740
that can go and fetch the
weather from open weather API.

338
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,250
So we go through that, we type the prompt,

339
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,150
and we hit the button
to make it do its thing.

340
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,530
At this point, I'm kind of sitting back

341
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,440
watching a bit of
Netflix, watching YouTube.

342
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,440
You know you do it, but my
attention is switched off, right?

343
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,480
It's not in exactly the same place

344
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,550
as I was writing this code myself.

345
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,610
And it's not by any other kind of reason,

346
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,460
it's just a different way of working.

347
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,260
So Claude is going away there,

348
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,090
it's using the best practices document.

349
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,613
It's generating the code for me.

350
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,690
It's kind of spinning through that.

351
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,410
It's kind of written that endpoint

352
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,410
to be able to fetch the data from the API

353
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,080
and then we want to go
through and sort of test it.

354
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,850
So yeah, it's just validating against

355
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,600
the corporate best practices there.

356
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:36,957
And then in a second,
I'm going to go through

357
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:38,670
and I'm going to test this, right?

358
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,020
So I'm like, "Well, how do I test this?"

359
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,917
I'm getting a little bit
lazy, so I'm just like,

360
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,410
"Hey Claude, just go test this for me."

361
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,410
So I stick my open weather API key

362
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,380
in my environment file
on my local computer,

363
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,540
I hit the button, I go back
to Claude and I'm like,

364
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,460
you know, "Make sure this works."

365
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,740
This is a fairly sort of typical flow

366
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,350
that I would take on a day-to-day basis.

367
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,937
And Claude comes back and it's like,

368
00:17:03,937 --> 00:17:07,110
"Yeah, everything works,"
and I'm like, "Great," right?

369
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:12,110
This is job done, I've just
achieved in a matter of minutes

370
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,830
what potentially could have
taken me a number of hours.

371
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,650
So I'm just like ship it, right?

372
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,300
Like again, the key thing is

373
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,133
what I want to kind of stress is

374
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:24,150
that my mind is in a different place.

375
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,280
All of those skills and those
things that I have learned

376
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,690
over the years as an
application developer,

377
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,600
I'm kind of just forgetting
about right now because

378
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,703
this is great, this is all just working.

379
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,990
Functionally correct
does not equal secure.

380
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,840
- Code nirvana.
- Right.

381
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,070
So I'm going to go a step further.

382
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,540
I'm even getting Claude

383
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,030
to generate me the Kubernetes
deployment manifest,

384
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,940
I'm getting it to
generate the docker files

385
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,963
and it does it very, very, very well.

386
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,820
But there are some problems

387
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,603
and we will kind of see
this in just one second.

388
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,770
The problem comes that again,
it's about that attention.

389
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,310
Where is my attention? And my
attention now is just ship it.

390
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,640
So I've got the secure
pipeline, everything is ready,

391
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,730
I get committed, I push it to GitHub

392
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,460
and everything is perfect, right?

393
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,450
We're done.

394
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,530
We can now put Slack on do
not disturb for a few hours,

395
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,580
slope off and do some some other stuff.

396
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,563
Well, until-

397
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,420
- Ready for it?

398
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,413
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

399
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,210
Okay, we're done with
that, right? All alright.

400
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,637
We're not saying don't
do vibe coding, right?

401
00:18:47,637 --> 00:18:50,280
- No, we're saying absolutely
do vibe coding, yeah.

402
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,440
- But you need to put guardrails in place?

403
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,850
- Right.
- Okay.

404
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,790
That includes the ability to monitor

405
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,580
unsecure secrets and other
things while you're doing this.

406
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,580
Okay, so HCP Vault Radar is a product

407
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,950
that will go out and scan data sources

408
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,610
and monitor data sources when
unsecure code gets introduced.

409
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,380
So I'm just going to walk you
through this a little bit.

410
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,750
So this is an example
of a tool you could use

411
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,250
to solve some of these problems

412
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,200
that we were walking
through in the category.

413
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,410
It detects over 300 patterns

414
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,720
looking for secrets and unsecured data.

415
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,350
It looks for entropy and
complexity that helps you find

416
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,600
some of those more complex secrets

417
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,920
and keys that are out there.

418
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,813
It does activeness inversion checks

419
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:36,390
to see whether the secrets that you find

420
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,240
are currently active or
are they in get history

421
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,240
and it will assign severity
and risk rankings to them.

422
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,720
So it helps you figure out how
bad your blast radius is from

423
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,450
doing some of the things that you do

424
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,570
and letting unsecured
secrets get out in the wild.

425
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,670
It's currently supports GIT servers,

426
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,700
collab platforms like Confluence and Slack

427
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,950
and will even scan in your IDE

428
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,130
currently supporting VS code to do that.

429
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,890
There's also integration with
tools that can help you alert

430
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,170
or automatically generate
tickets and do other things.

431
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,850
So when you start thinking about

432
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,530
the front end of all of this,

433
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,660
think about how do you,
number one, discover

434
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,420
all the secrets that are
kind of out in the wild

435
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,570
that might be long-lived
that are putting you at risk,

436
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,880
but also then how can you monitor

437
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,470
these data sources to make sure

438
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,140
if something is about to be
introduced that you can catch it

439
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,120
before that happens.

440
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,610
I also wanted to talk about the fact that

441
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,930
we have integrated Vault Radar
with AWS Secrets Manager.

442
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,210
So as much as you want
to find these secrets

443
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,730
that are out in the wild
and get them under control

444
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,730
and being managed, sometimes
people mismanage secrets

445
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,930
that are currently being stored.

446
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,920
So we are able to index AWS
Secrets Manager securely

447
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,120
with Vault Radar.

448
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,340
If you have a secret that
gets out in the wild,

449
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,710
you will know whether
it's also being stored

450
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,230
in AWS Secrets Manager, who owns it,

451
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,300
and then go back to that
person to be able to get them

452
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,600
to remediate it and talk about
how to better handle secrets

453
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,760
and not let them get out
of your secret manager.

454
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,670
So it integrates with
Vault, HashiCorp Vault,

455
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,530
our product AWS Secrets Manager.

456
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,250
And you can expect to see more
Secrets Managers being added

457
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,010
that will allow you to
do that correlation.

458
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,700
You are also able to get
remediation steps that are

459
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,060
customizable, so if somebody
finds a certain type of secret

460
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,310
in a certain type of location,

461
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,380
they get instructions to consistently

462
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,050
handle that the right way, whether that is

463
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,170
importing the secret into Vault,
which you can currently do.

464
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,470
And then basically you could
use something like Copilot

465
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,870
to be able to create the code

466
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,150
wherever it was hard
coded to point to Vault

467
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,680
to make sure that it gets the secret there

468
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,090
and it's no longer in the code.

469
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,730
So you need a way to
effectively be able to remediate

470
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,680
the stuff when you find it.

471
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,680
And Radar also will scan as
far left as your IDE platform.

472
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,600
So you can get alerts if
there's a secret that's in code,

473
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,850
as soon as that gets saved, it'll pop up,

474
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,230
gives you remediation steps,

475
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,330
the ability to copy that into Vault.

476
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,480
But we're also scanning
in the CICD pipeline

477
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,803
and then pre-receive and pre
pre-commit phases as well.

478
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,590
So with that, let's take a quick look at

479
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,990
what Vault Radar looks
like to help you do this.

480
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,813
- [Nick] I was going to say,

481
00:22:17,813 --> 00:22:19,710
nobody spotted my deliberate mistake.

482
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,620
- [David] Yeah. No, they didn't.

483
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,240
So this is the overview dashboard

484
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,250
where you can see all
the data repositories

485
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,530
that you're monitoring,
you can see all kinds

486
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,510
of helpful metrics about it.

487
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,210
You can see what are the
most common types of secrets

488
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,000
that are being discovered that
are unsecure, who owns them,

489
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,100
I mean, who are our biggest offenders

490
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,730
in this dashboard and all kinds
of other interesting data.

491
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,310
But ultimately, I'm not
going to be sitting here

492
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,047
just staring at the dashboard
for this product and saying,

493
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:49,590
"I'm watching for a new event to happen

494
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,750
or an unsecure secret to be discovered."

495
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,460
So I want to use the tools integration.

496
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,320
In this case, I've connected it with Slack

497
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,730
and I've configured a channel

498
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,130
where I get alerts whenever
something's introduced.

499
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,980
And here I can see I have a high severity

500
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,010
incident that was discovered,
who the author was for that,

501
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,190
what time it was, and
a link to go directly

502
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,010
to the source file where
that was discovered.

503
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:15,120
And I can see that where
this is, where the file is

504
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,970
that's in my cat generator
repo that I've been monitoring.

505
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,750
I also can go back to the
event that's in Vault Radar

506
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,140
and I can see similar
information and details

507
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,000
about what type of secret it is.

508
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,550
I also have that link to
go see where it showed up

509
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,590
in code or in the file.

510
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,760
I could see it's my weather app .env file.

511
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,430
And I also see that's
something that's being stored

512
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,950
in AWS Secrets Managers
so that's good to know

513
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,720
somebody has mishandled that.

514
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,020
I also can click on a link
for remediation instructions.

515
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,290
So when I found this, I could
go in and get the proper steps

516
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,510
and make sure that people
are following those steps

517
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,393
consistently when they
need to resolve that issue.

518
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,410
So I'm just going to go ahead
and mark this as triaged

519
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,840
and because I configured
RBAC for the product,

520
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,680
I can hand this off to the
proper repo owner or dev owner

521
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,030
who needs to go and finish
fixing that problem.

522
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,950
So with that, let's talk about
agentic AI a little bit more.

523
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,090
And you have a cautionary
tale for us, Nick.

524
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,500
- I do, so when I kind of
was going through before

525
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,950
and looking at that little
demo of my vibe coding example,

526
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,860
my inattention due to being kind of

527
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,930
in a different way of working

528
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,920
caused me to committing
that environment variable

529
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,310
to GitHub, a very simple
sort of standard mistake

530
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,930
that I've made before in the past,

531
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,110
and something that I'm actually
fairly aware of right now.

532
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,740
But again, that shift in
sort of concentration.

533
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,620
Now when I was kind of looking at that,

534
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,650
maybe there was a deeper problem
in that vibe coding example

535
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,800
because did anybody see this

536
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,100
when the code was created by Claude?

537
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,275
So the requests library,

538
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:02,640
that's not necessarily a standard library.

539
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,840
What about this one?

540
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,550
Did you spot

541
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,163
this when I generated the
Kubernetes configuration?

542
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:12,990
So I'm running host
network on my pod, right?

543
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,450
Well, why would I do that? Well, I didn't.

544
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,470
I didn't do that at all.

545
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,550
Now I had best practices in the agent,

546
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,609
the agent was using so well, how did

547
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:26,310
these kind of issues end
up in the source code?

548
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,680
And the way that it happened

549
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,210
was because we're looking at a very,

550
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,860
what I think is a sort of

551
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,370
an intelligent attack from the militia.

552
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,470
So a malicious person didn't decide

553
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,030
to attack my source code directly.

554
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,850
They didn't attack the production system.

555
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,270
They didn't attack my
supply chain indirectly,

556
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,660
even though we saw an example
of typosquatting there.

557
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,070
What they did

558
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,370
was they attacked my best
practices documentation.

559
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,700
So the attacker has found a way

560
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,070
to manipulate my best
practices documentation

561
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,110
that my agentic agent has used

562
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,230
and that has caused the
code to be produced.

563
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,060
Which included the typosquatted URL,

564
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,660
sorry, the package and also it included

565
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,480
the host networking switch on.

566
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,070
And what that has done
is that our typosquat URL

567
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,070
will activate a packet sniffer

568
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,010
whenever the weather server is running.

569
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,410
So whenever that a request
comes into that tool,

570
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,170
a packet sniffer now
running now because that

571
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:35,970
packet sniffer also now has
host network capabilities.

572
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,790
It's got the ability to
basically capture any of the

573
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:43,770
unencrypted traffic inside
of my Kubernetes cluster.

574
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,370
And unfortunately, I've
made other mistakes by

575
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,260
not looking at the defense in depth

576
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,120
and taking a full zero-trust approach

577
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,670
because I trust everything
that runs on the server.

578
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,020
So that attack that sniffer runs,

579
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,630
the credentials are detected,

580
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,880
and then the attacker can exfiltrate those

581
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,260
back to their own system.

582
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:08,040
So the packet sniffer that's
running inside the weather tool

583
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,037
picks up the database
credentials for Postgres,

584
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:14,730
for the customer database,
a completely unrelated tool,

585
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,243
and sends them back to be used as is.

586
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,940
And the way they did that was very simple.

587
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,680
They just used context poisoning.

588
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,680
They just injected this
very simple statement

589
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,790
into the developer documentation
that the agent uses.

590
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,810
Now it's just a kind of a backdoor attack,

591
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,550
but it opens up a vulnerability

592
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,560
that I wouldn't have been affected with

593
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,410
had I myself been writing
and authoring that code

594
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,350
because, well, A, I wouldn't
have used that library and,

595
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,140
B, I probably wouldn't
have been reading those

596
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,730
documentation every single time.

597
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,790
I've got it sort of encoded into my mind.

598
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,540
And the second step is
that they put another

599
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,760
manipulation into the best practices.

600
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,760
So whenever we are developing
a Kubernetes deployment,

601
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,140
there is a best practice
which says, "Well hey,

602
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,780
if you've used the requests library,

603
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,850
then this requires host networking

604
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,100
because of some bug in
the library," right?

605
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,040
So it's a way that I've circumvented

606
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,160
the complete sort of
security of the system

607
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,010
through something which is
probably fairly innocuous.

608
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,210
Like, you know, it's something

609
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,670
that's not necessarily used very heavily.

610
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:34,260
So let's look at that in
action and see how that works.

611
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,090
So we're just going to kind of see this.

612
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,760
So somebody goes into the UI

613
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,697
and then they're just going to say,

614
00:28:39,697 --> 00:28:42,060
"Right, we're going to
use the weather agent."

615
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,570
What's the weather like in Las Vegas?

616
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,720
TLDR, it probably sucks right now.

617
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,510
So the, you can see that
the agent calls the tool.

618
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,530
Now at this point the tool has
activated the packet sniffer.

619
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,750
So that is now running in the background.

620
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,920
And if we look at the logs,

621
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,910
I'm just going to kind of pull you

622
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:04,910
the logs there of the pod which
contains the weather tool.

623
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,070
You can see that the
sniffer's been running,

624
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,750
and attacker is obviously not going to be

625
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,020
that obvious in the
logs but now we can see

626
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,040
the kind of the database
that they're going

627
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,600
to exultate those credentials out to.

628
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,100
So when somebody now

629
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,387
goes and uses the customer
tool, I'm just going to say,

630
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:26,610
"Well, hey, get me the
customer data order details

631
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:31,140
for an I'd 8," right? So customer eight.

632
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,940
That again calls a tool.

633
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,290
The tool makes a
connection to the database

634
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,090
to retrieve the order details,

635
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,550
which has caused a connection

636
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,700
from the tool to be opened
against the database.

637
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,010
And what you can see is that we've now got

638
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,590
all of those credentials there now.

639
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,633
Again, there's a number of problems.

640
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,423
There's no TLS.

641
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,300
There is very, very open
credentials being used

642
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,950
with the data store.

643
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,970
We are not using a particularly
strong database connection.

644
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,430
We're using MD5 when we
should be using SHA sum.

645
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:13,430
Very, very simple to sort
of to decrypt that using

646
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,740
Hashcat or something like that.

647
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,630
And there's no attribution.
We don't know who did it.

648
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,520
We don't know when they
did it or what went on.

649
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,660
So there's like a number of
problems that we need to fix,

650
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,940
which David is going to
start to explain to us.

651
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,480
- Yes there is so

652
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,160
let's talk a little bit
about some of the basics.

653
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,600
You know how I mentioned
at the beginning that

654
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,450
there's a lot of sophisticated
attacks that are happening

655
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,890
based on agentic AI or
leveraging that to do bad things.

656
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,620
But really, a lot of these
things can be stopped

657
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,590
if you're using core
security best practices.

658
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,590
So every AI agent needs to have
a unique auditable identity.

659
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,550
There has to be user
attribution. So who is the human?

660
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:00,420
What is the human ID that
is mapped to this agent

661
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,540
so that you can trace that
back and so you can make sure

662
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,080
that you are not giving that
agent any greater permissions

663
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,990
than the human identity
that is using that agent.

664
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,660
Dynamic authorization,
no long-lived secrets,

665
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,950
nothing that's sitting out there

666
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,840
for a long time exposing you,

667
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,420
but you need dynamic authorization,

668
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,390
some kind of token exchange,
not static credentials.

669
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,790
And then you also need
a framework for consent.

670
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,270
So explicit, time-bound,
revocable permission.

671
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,000
So these are all kind
of core security things

672
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,510
that regardless of
having agentic AI or NHIs

673
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,940
starting to outnumber
human identities, 50 to 1,

674
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,030
100 to 1, these should
just be in place now,

675
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,200
but they often aren't.

676
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,150
So it's becoming a bigger problem

677
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,060
because of what's happening
with the agentic threat.

678
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,100
So if I go back through

679
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,970
those 10 kind of core categories
of threats, let's look at

680
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,640
with some of these core
security best practices,

681
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,910
how many of these problems
we could protect against.

682
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:00,000
So if we look at identity
and authentication

683
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,350
or authorization threats,

684
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,180
the solution here is really about

685
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,370
making sure you correctly configure

686
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,640
identity and access management
policies from the start.

687
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,410
And we can see the different phases

688
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,420
once again where these occur.

689
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,250
For credential and secret management,

690
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,620
Vault, we'll talk about HashiCorp Vault,

691
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,780
supports centralized secrets management

692
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,580
and short-lived credentials.

693
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,460
So why wouldn't you use
those things to solve

694
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,670
a multitude of these security problems?

695
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,290
With tool and integration exploits,

696
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,070
the use of short-lived creds,
once again, helps with that.

697
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,290
Also, PKI and certificate management

698
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,960
addresses that tool injection
problem because you are using

699
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,120
TLS or you're using MTLS

700
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,690
to make sure that things
are being securely

701
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,903
connected or communicated by that method.

702
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,020
The supply chain attacks, once again,

703
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,020
PKI certificates, using
TLS to protect against

704
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,517
those supply chain attacks.

705
00:32:53,517 --> 00:32:57,090
The MCP server registry and
update or patch mechanisms

706
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,958
would be a good example of that.

707
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:01,620
Multi-agent system threats.

708
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,050
Once again, you need to be able to protect

709
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,210
against agent communication poisoning.

710
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,400
You can do that with using something like

711
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,800
PKI certificates and having TLS

712
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,850
or MTLS in place for those
agents in sub-agents.

713
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,640
In terms of prompt based attacks,

714
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,130
the related data security
threats on the next slide,

715
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,750
including this one, are going to require

716
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,080
a multi-layered approach so
it's probably not surprising.

717
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,870
That's all often going
to require a combination

718
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,410
of things like team processes
that you put into place.

719
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,810
So you talk about the
concept of red teaming.

720
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:38,010
This is just one simple fix
for these types of attacks

721
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,860
because it's often to
require that combination.

722
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,640
And then also some
purpose-built AI security tools

723
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,740
that we're starting to see evolve.

724
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,420
That's because the attack surface

725
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,120
of the AI applications
is really different from

726
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,230
traditional apps.

727
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,840
The models are dynamic,
behavior changes and all that.

728
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,150
So you might want to see some tools

729
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,010
or investigate tools that have the ability

730
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:02,130
to do things like
inspect and filter inputs

731
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,470
to stop some of the malicious attacks,

732
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,860
monitoring for output
anomalies, hallucinations,

733
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,100
track and govern model versions.

734
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,020
And then also requiring integration

735
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,780
of security at the model lifecycle level.

736
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,577
So these are all kind of model changes

737
00:34:18,577 --> 00:34:21,060
that come with security thinking about

738
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,090
managing these threats and going forward.

739
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,940
And what I'm saying is we don't have

740
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,430
necessarily the solution for
all of these things right now

741
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,930
and they're going to
continue to be a problem.

742
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,810
But you need to think about
these and be investigating tools

743
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,270
that help in these ways going forward.

744
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,830
Once again, the data security threats,

745
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,210
that's another area where

746
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,220
you need some of this proactive testing,

747
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,120
a combination of security
mechanisms and a layered approach.

748
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,330
In terms of layer runtime
and operational threats,

749
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,270
once again, short-lived
dynamic credentials

750
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,830
protects a lot of ground
being able to implement that.

751
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,470
Detection and guardrail
evasion is an interesting one

752
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:03,470
because it's similar to more
AI-native risk categories.

753
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,450
And addressing these attack
vectors is going to require

754
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,420
tools that can provide capabilities like

755
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,776
automated red teaming, for example,

756
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:16,140
or continuous security testing.

757
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,510
So a little bit more sophisticated.

758
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,780
For compliance and
governance, enable audit logs.

759
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,240
Vault has detailed audit logs

760
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,120
for any action that
takes place within Vault.

761
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,620
And having those audit trails

762
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:32,370
makes it possible to meet
regulatory requirements and also

763
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,343
trace agent actions back to human actors.

764
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,350
So identity brokering is critical

765
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,600
to securely managing agentic identity.

766
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,480
And we talked about that
disconnect between human

767
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,700
and non-human identities,

768
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,250
and we've all seen the headlines
about what happens next

769
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,070
when you don't manage that well
or you don't connect the two

770
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,870
or have the proper policies.

771
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:59,430
So NHIs, I think I mentioned
that outnumber humans 50 to 1.

772
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,280
80% of breaches involve them.

773
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,690
97%, this is really bad
when 97% of NHIs have

774
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,023
excessive privileges, got to
solve the privilege problem.

775
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,060
And most organizations
don't even have a process

776
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,970
to offboard API keys
when they're out there

777
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,470
and they get abandoned
and they're sitting around

778
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,760
for a long time.

779
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,760
So with that,

780
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,040
Nick is actually going to
talk a little bit about

781
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,580
this kind of authentication
and authorization.

782
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,140
- Yeah, this is really important

783
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,880
when you start to think
about agentic system,

784
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,800
because an agent is doing
something on my behalf.

785
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,050
I am not doing the thing,

786
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,150
it is the agent which is
doing it on my behalf.

787
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:46,800
It's very similar to me just
giving my credentials to David

788
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,140
and saying, "Hey David, can you go and,

789
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,540
I don't know, like check my email

790
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,000
and tell me what my boss said."

791
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,683
Now I trust David.

792
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,077
Many people say I probably
shouldn't, but I do.

793
00:37:01,077 --> 00:37:04,650
But the thing is like David
is a trustworthy person.

794
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,860
The agent is potentially
open to manipulation.

795
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,950
We've already seen how there
are a multitude of ways

796
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,320
that that agent can be manipulated.

797
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,590
So we have to really,
really strongly think about

798
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,980
identity in behalf of a sort of a process

799
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,930
that an agent is acting on.

800
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,320
Now there is a kind of a
common sort of approach

801
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,570
called on behalf of and what
that allows you to do is

802
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,760
to take a token like a JWT

803
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,150
and to add additional information to it,

804
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,940
which tells you that it is operating

805
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,190
on behalf of a particular user.

806
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,620
So a in this instance,
what we're going to take is

807
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,980
a service token, an agent token.

808
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,610
And we're going to augment
that to token to say

809
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:51,120
that this agentic is acting
on behalf of this user

810
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,510
and this user has these privileges.

811
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,420
Now when we kind of go about
doing that, it means that

812
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,450
we have this approach of basically

813
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:03,210
taking two tokens and creating a third.

814
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,850
You can do this with a standard
IDP as to say on behalf of

815
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,090
as a sort of a formal process of OIDC.

816
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,270
But that works great for
the very sort of edge thing

817
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,300
but like from an internal
service perspective,

818
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,370
we kind of want to take another approach

819
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,990
and actually we're going to use Vault

820
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:22,080
to be able to mint those
internal identities

821
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,150
'cause this is happening quite frequently,

822
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,970
a number of different
agents, number of sub-agents.

823
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,580
And we want to be able to
refine those permissions

824
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:34,580
every single time to ensure
that the agent is doing...

825
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,170
Well, we don't know
that the agent is doing

826
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,770
what we want it to do, we're
going to assume that it isn't.

827
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,360
So what we're going to do is

828
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,610
ensure that the agent can only act

829
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,863
within a very, very specific bound.

830
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,000
And if we don't do that,
so let's just say, hey,

831
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,350
we're just going to
have the user identity.

832
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,690
Well, if we just pass the
user identity to the agent,

833
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,870
then the agent can misuse this.

834
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,680
the agent can kind of go wild,

835
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,490
it can kind of change its direction.

836
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,790
It can either be manipulated
or it could just be a bug,

837
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,430
but it can then use my privileges

838
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,430
to do something that it
shouldn't be able to do.

839
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,070
And if we look at that another
way and we say, "Well, hey,

840
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:22,070
well why don't we just use the
kind of the service token,"

841
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,670
you have exactly the same problem.

842
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:28,670
You know, the sort of without
the agent identity then

843
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,300
the customer or the user can
potentially trick the agent

844
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,730
into doing something and
elevating their privileges.

845
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:40,413
So both of those are needed
in order to restrict this.

846
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,640
Agent identity is really important.

847
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,490
And to create an identity from your agent,

848
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:52,490
you don't just need something
which is just like a random ID

849
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:55,260
you need to be able to
have that audit trail

850
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,680
and that audit logging, and
by that you need to be able to

851
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,130
have metadata, which represents the agent.

852
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,850
So the agent needs a proper
token which is similar

853
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,870
to what the human user would
have defining its scope.

854
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,760
Now with Vault, we can
go about that approach

855
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,810
by using a Kubernetes token,
we can create an identity

856
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:20,520
and we can swap that
for a more rich token,

857
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,590
which has got all of that metadata in it.

858
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,500
Again, we're putting that
into the audit log now.

859
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,993
So we're satisfying those things as well.

860
00:40:29,432 --> 00:40:32,760
The kind of the practice of
that is fairly straightforward

861
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,300
and in terms of the efficiency
where we use a plugin

862
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,010
into the secrets engine for Vault,

863
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:42,783
which enables us to generate
those on behalf of tokens.

864
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,170
And that kind of brings us to

865
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,880
the sort of the approach of Kubernetes.

866
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,453
So how are we going to use this?

867
00:40:52,402 --> 00:40:54,390
How do we use Vault inside of Kubernetes?

868
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,760
How do we secure those secrets?

869
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,870
- That is a great question.

870
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,300
So let's dive into this a little bit.

871
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,630
Vault has a capability with
the Vault Secrets Operator

872
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,960
to manage secrets in a
native way with Kubernetes.

873
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,990
So this includes being able
to use dynamic secrets,

874
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,440
PKI certificates, all
the kinds of credentials

875
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,140
that you would want to use
to keep things more secure.

876
00:41:17,212 --> 00:41:20,250
OpenShift OLM supports
it for instant upgrades,

877
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,110
so that also works as well.

878
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:26,010
Secret transformation is also
something that VSO can handle.

879
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:29,010
So you end up with templating
that looks familiar

880
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,860
with the secrets on the Kubernetes side

881
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,150
and so that's very helpful.

882
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,190
So basically what happens is

883
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,930
whoever is managing these things

884
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,630
and is familiar with Kubernetes,
not familiar with Vault,

885
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,550
they don't really need to
know anything about Vault

886
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:45,480
or how Vault works because this
process is all very native.

887
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,790
In terms of identity-based access

888
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:50,790
and authentication in Vault is processed,

889
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:54,030
whether it's human or
non-human by providing

890
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,320
identity verification.

891
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,090
And you can see there's a wide range

892
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,920
of different identity providers

893
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,920
that will plug into Vault
that you can leverage

894
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,980
so you can use all of
those identity providers.

895
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,440
And it also is really critical because

896
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,140
most organizations are working
in a very hybrid environment.

897
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,230
You're not just working in, often cases,

898
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:18,230
one type of cloud, one type
of identification system.

899
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,070
There's probably multiple that exists.

900
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,230
So you need that to be
able to be integrated

901
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:25,110
with whatever you're using
to centrally manage security,

902
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,390
so multiple off methods are supported.

903
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,950
And then before a client,

904
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,860
whether human or machine
can interact with Vault,

905
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,480
it has to authenticate.

906
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,630
That's really important and
so you need these off methods.

907
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,300
Once that happens, there's
a token that's generated

908
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,900
and there is a policy that
gets attached to that token.

909
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,080
And so whatever entity gets that token,

910
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,030
they can only do what
they're permitted to do

911
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,500
by that policy.

912
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,380
And so right here, Vault recognizes

913
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,300
Nick's different
authentication identities.

914
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,680
It can create credentials
dynamically based on that identity

915
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,060
and then create access
policies based on that as well.

916
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,630
When we talk about
unified identity in Vault,

917
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,630
there's an identity engine

918
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,090
that exists in Vault that
handles this sort of thing.

919
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,330
And when you have a new

920
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:17,880
entity or identity that is
authenticating with Vault,

921
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,620
it creates that entity.

922
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,870
So it is that one, it has a unique ID,

923
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:26,280
it is a unique entity to
Vault, but what allows you

924
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,130
to use this in a flexible environment is

925
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,570
you can have aliases.

926
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,910
So there might be different
authentication methods

927
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,460
that are being used for the same entity

928
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,800
and those are aliases that you have.

929
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,990
You can also assign metadata,

930
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,587
you can assign policies
at that alias level.

931
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:46,530
And so that gives you a lot
of flexibility to make sure

932
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,510
you have that one entity accessing Vault

933
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:51,360
and wanting to do something,
but you're locking things down

934
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,810
and enabling things for the
various aliases that that entity

935
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,490
might have, if that makes sense.

936
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,240
And this picture here is kind of

937
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,860
what shows that and being
able to enable the RBAC

938
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,810
for those more complex environments

939
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,580
that you find yourselves in with the human

940
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,990
and machine identity.

941
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:10,140
Audit logs, that's something
that is native to Vault.

942
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,350
They're stored in JSON
making them easy to query.

943
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,960
Vault automatically
hashes any sensitive data

944
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,247
so they're very secure
logs with HMAC-SHA256.

945
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,520
There's a unique salt that's used as well.

946
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,930
So extremely secure

947
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,060
and this allows you to
have that audit trail

948
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,100
for things that are going on with in Vault

949
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,293
because that all gets
logged very securely.

950
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,040
So let's talk about dynamic
credentials a little bit

951
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,910
because we saw in multiple
examples of the attack vectors,

952
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,700
if dynamic credentials had been used,

953
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,733
it would've ameliorated that attack.

954
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,170
So let's look at the first
problem and that was credentials.

955
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,260
So security's all about layered security.

956
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,180
If we stop that vulnerability,

957
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,670
there would not have been
any credentials leaked, sure,

958
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,170
but if it wasn't that attack,

959
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,460
it would've been another attack,

960
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,050
so that's kind of how you have to think.

961
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:04,260
So we should go ahead and assume
the credentials will leak,

962
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,870
and if they do, you need to ensure

963
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,610
that the blast radius is minimized,

964
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:09,930
and the only way you're going to do that

965
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,600
is to be able to set
just in time credentials,

966
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,990
ones that have time to live
that can be revoked immediately

967
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,253
to solve that problem.

968
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:22,530
Dynamic secrets within Vault
are created just in time.

969
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,750
There's a unique ID that is associated

970
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,280
with each one of those credentials.

971
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,560
It's a unique identifier

972
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,840
that allows the secret
to be audited, located,

973
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,510
revoked early if you need to do that.

974
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,550
And every application instance or agent

975
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,570
gets a different credential
with a different time to live.

976
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,180
In terms of the support
for dynamic credentials,

977
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,650
this is a look at the broad range

978
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:47,700
of dynamic credential types
that HashiCorp Vault supports.

979
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,150
So multiple different types of databases

980
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,010
via the database secrets engine,

981
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:56,130
cloud service provider
dynamic credentials, LDAP,

982
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,900
and then also security

983
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,070
or certificates like I mentioned
before for PKI and SSH.

984
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:04,920
So there's no reason not
to use dynamic credentials

985
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,083
when you have all of
that available to you.

986
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,160
This is an example of the
dynamic secrets database engine

987
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,350
and you can kind of see what
the flow looks like here.

988
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:16,530
Obviously, the secrets
are created just in time

989
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:20,160
and they ensure that access
is automatically revoked

990
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,223
at the end of the expiry
time for that credential.

991
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,810
And with that, I think we're
going to look at a quick demo

992
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,070
of how this works.

993
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:32,643
- Yeah, so rather than doing
like a bit of a deep dive,

994
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,480
we can kind of talk about these things

995
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,110
if you want to come over to the booth.

996
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,240
I'm conscious a little bit on time.

997
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,660
But ultimately, the way that
you can configure all of this

998
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,490
just using Kubernetes as an example,

999
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,220
which I think is a fairly sort
of common platform these days

1000
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,960
is just through using the
Vault secrets operator,

1001
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,890
which is verified,
compatible with OpenShift,

1002
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,570
and all sorts of things like that.

1003
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,590
And just by using that configuration

1004
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:05,010
through, well, setting up
the database secrets engine,

1005
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:08,430
but then injecting those
secrets into Kubernetes,

1006
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:12,570
we'll kind of skip over this
one for the moment as I said.

1007
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:15,420
If you're interested in looking
at a technical deep dive,

1008
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,030
come and find me, be more than
happy to run through those

1009
00:47:20,446 --> 00:47:23,820
schemas and processes in more depth.

1010
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,293
- Onto the next one?
- Yeah.

1011
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,100
- Alright, so let's talk a
little bit about certificates.

1012
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,150
I mentioned that as well

1013
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:33,180
and something, especially
using TLS or MTLS,

1014
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,460
that's extremely important in protecting

1015
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,143
against some of these attacks.

1016
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:40,110
In this situation, in this attack,

1017
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,670
if there had been TLS on the system,

1018
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:43,830
then the credentials would
not have been leaked.

1019
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,890
Moreover, if there had
been TLS on the system,

1020
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,800
the credentials would not
have leaked in this way.

1021
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,240
And so that's really important too,

1022
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,150
the way that this happened,
so we need to do both things.

1023
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:56,850
And it's not hard to implement
with the right tooling

1024
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:58,710
to make sure you're
using dynamic credentials

1025
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,600
and to make sure that
you're using certificates

1026
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,663
to enable things like TLS and MTLS.

1027
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,070
Vault supports modern PKI management.

1028
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:12,120
And what I mean by that is
very automated, very scalable,

1029
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,840
and Vault is flexible too
in the architecture because

1030
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,680
you can have multiple intermediate
certificate authorities

1031
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,200
that you can configure
based on your environment

1032
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,430
and what your needs are.

1033
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,770
It can act as the internal root CA

1034
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,530
issuing X.509 certificates.

1035
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,510
It automatically enables you to

1036
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:33,870
revoke and distribute these
certificates in different ways.

1037
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,270
And I'll show you some
of the multiple methods

1038
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:37,320
that it can leverage.

1039
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,780
It also has native support for Spiffy.

1040
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,190
So the Spiffy X.509
standard, extremely popular

1041
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:47,610
open standard because
it allows you to have

1042
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:51,390
very granular authorization
on certificates

1043
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,970
and gives you an easy way to manage

1044
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:58,590
and scale those identities
when you're using certificates.

1045
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:01,320
There's also service mesh
integration supporting MTLS

1046
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,980
for service to service
certificates as well.

1047
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,480
So let's take a look at
what this looks like.

1048
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,030
There's some examples,
so using the Vault agent,

1049
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:13,140
this is where the Vault
agent is actually connecting

1050
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,240
to the service or the application.

1051
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,360
It's keeping track of the time
to live on that certificate

1052
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,090
so when it knows when it's about to expire

1053
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:23,790
and then it will
communicate back with Vault,

1054
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:25,200
and it will authenticate,

1055
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,170
and it will request a new
certificate, it gets a certificate

1056
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:30,840
and then it updates that
certificate in the service.

1057
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,241
Vault, meanwhile, is keeping
track of all the roles

1058
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:37,200
that are accessing it to get certificates

1059
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,630
and then being able to use those.

1060
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,460
It also works in a similar way

1061
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,830
if we look at the Kubernetes environment,

1062
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:45,810
like we were just talking about.

1063
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:49,230
The Vault Secrets Operator is
what enables you to integrate

1064
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:52,050
with Vault and automate
that certificate management

1065
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,840
and have that work in your
containerized environment.

1066
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,470
So there's different methods,
if you look on the left,

1067
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,750
those are established
patterns using the Vault agent

1068
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,960
and then VSO, they're very opinionated,

1069
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,780
but on the right, you
also see the capability

1070
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,940
to use less opinionated methods

1071
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,940
of leveraging this type type
of capability with Vault.

1072
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:16,260
There's the Vault SDK, you can
integrate directly into code

1073
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,330
and then you can utilize the Vault CLI

1074
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:21,420
to authenticate and retrieve
one-off certificates.

1075
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,670
So there's multiple methods

1076
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,125
when we're talking about flexibility

1077
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:28,440
to be able to leverage
certificates with Vault.

1078
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,530
In terms of architecture and
scaling, like I mentioned,

1079
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:33,990
you can have an offline root CA,

1080
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,520
you create an intermediate CA

1081
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,800
that's kind of your
top-of-level wild card domain.

1082
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,440
You can have, you know,
a time to live of a year.

1083
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,190
You can create another
intermediate CA from the top level.

1084
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:45,780
It's got a shorter TTL,

1085
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,550
so you can see how you can architect this

1086
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:49,020
and be very flexible with it.

1087
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,950
And then lastly, you have your
instance of intermediate CA

1088
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,590
that's going to issue those
leaf certificates for your

1089
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:58,290
application or service
and make that 30 days

1090
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:01,680
or whatever you need to
do, but extremely flexible.

1091
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,340
In terms of performance,
compliance, and scalability,

1092
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:08,220
there's disaster recovery
that supports warm standbys

1093
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,503
that can be configured for easy recovery.

1094
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,290
There's automated deployment.

1095
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,570
So if this is something
that you want to deploy

1096
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,220
in an automated and scalable way,

1097
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,190
you can use Terraform to do that.

1098
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,320
You have audit logging that exists

1099
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,490
obviously that we talked about,

1100
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,710
so you can generate
reports for that purpose.

1101
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:29,400
Cross region support to meet
applications where they are

1102
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,810
from a performance standpoint.

1103
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:34,080
And then things like
path filters to ensure

1104
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,150
that secrets are not accessed or stored

1105
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,940
in Vault clusters where they
may be additional compliance,

1106
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:43,200
so you think GDPR and that
becomes important too.

1107
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,520
And if we put it all together,

1108
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:48,600
it's just an extremely
scalable tier zero application

1109
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,907
that you can leverage for PKI.

1110
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,790
And with that, let's go ahead
and take a look at a demo

1111
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:55,050
of how this works.

1112
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:58,860
- So again, from a sort of a
stance and how you go about

1113
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,410
dealing with this, how
do you configure Vault?

1114
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,990
it's fairly straightforward
if you've kind of understand

1115
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:07,650
how one of the endpoints work,
they're all fairly similar.

1116
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:11,280
Conceptually, you have
to enable an endpoint.

1117
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,190
So with PKI, I enable the PKI endpoint,

1118
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,290
I can generate a root certificate,

1119
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:18,360
and then I can configure it.

1120
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,480
And once I've got all of
those kind of things set up,

1121
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,110
that then enables me to use
the Vault Secrets Operator

1122
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:27,870
to use those roles that I've configured.

1123
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:30,030
Again, it's linked through to the policy

1124
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:32,880
and the service account in Kubernetes,

1125
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,180
and it will allow me to inject that secret

1126
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:40,170
from Vault dynamically generated
into a Kubernetes secret.

1127
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,240
So from an application
development perspective,

1128
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,193
there's nothing different here.

1129
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,720
Now if we kind of look
at all of those things,

1130
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,940
so if we look at the things
that we've talked about

1131
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,540
where the vulnerabilities,
which were core in our demo

1132
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,350
were that had we had TLS and
had we had dynamic credentials,

1133
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:02,460
the blast radius would've been
far, far, far more reduced.

1134
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,880
Of course, we're looking at
a very, very select problem

1135
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,340
and in a very select
area but that's a concept

1136
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,173
of defense and depth.

1137
00:53:09,173 --> 00:53:11,190
It's not about just doing one thing,

1138
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:14,340
you really have to do all the things.

1139
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:19,340
With dynamic secrets and with PKI

1140
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,920
in our agentic application,
if we kind of look through

1141
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,550
and replay that attack, you'll
see how things different.

1142
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:31,380
So now we've configured the
server to use PKI, again,

1143
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,030
the vulnerability still exists.

1144
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,500
So when I find out what the weather's like

1145
00:53:36,394 --> 00:53:37,620
and this time I'm going to kind of

1146
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,740
ask what the weather is like in Miami

1147
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,930
because it's going to be a lot nicer

1148
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:44,670
than it is here right now,

1149
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:46,170
unless you were in Miami last weekend

1150
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:49,359
and you realize that it
just rained for two days.

1151
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:53,970
But conceptually, that same
process has gone through, right?

1152
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,340
The sniffer is now enabled.

1153
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:01,340
It's now being sending the
credentials back to the attacker.

1154
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,430
And when we use the same thing
using the customer agent,

1155
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:08,327
we'll say, "Hey, give me the
customer order details here."

1156
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,360
What that is going to do is
the agent talks to the tool,

1157
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,180
the tool makes a
connection to the database,

1158
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,490
the database authenticates.

1159
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:20,070
You can see that kind of running
through in the application.

1160
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:21,540
But now when we look at the credentials,

1161
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,800
we don't see anything.

1162
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,090
And the reason we don't see anything

1163
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:27,030
because the connection between the tool,

1164
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,280
and the connection between the agents,

1165
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,080
and the connection to the database

1166
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,180
is all encrypted with a standard practice

1167
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,040
that you've been using for
thousands and thousands

1168
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,410
and thousands of hours
and months and years

1169
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:41,910
and, you know, since the
dawn of microservices,

1170
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:44,223
or any form of sort of secure system.

1171
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,500
So what are the key differences

1172
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,777
with agentic systems and microservices?

1173
00:54:48,777 --> 00:54:52,440
And I think the key
thing is that not a lot

1174
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,330
and actually quite a bit.

1175
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:56,730
That's a really sort of
ambiguous approach but

1176
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:01,170
the key thing is that agentic
system is very deterministic.

1177
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:04,620
You can't necessarily predict
what it is going to do.

1178
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,470
It has this kind of emergent
behavior where it'll just

1179
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,323
act on its behalf, it
is more human than it is

1180
00:55:10,323 --> 00:55:12,390
that the kind of that traditional approach

1181
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:16,080
where you can just follow
the code path through

1182
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,593
either as a single service
or a connection of services.

1183
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,410
The thing that's very
much the same is that

1184
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,240
a lot of the problems that you've fixed

1185
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,820
in your microservice systems
by just employing good

1186
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:30,660
sort of secure practices
around coding standards by

1187
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,740
employing sort of secure
systems still applies.

1188
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,650
There is nothing really, really different.

1189
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,320
But we do have to be aware,
we've got to be planning ahead,

1190
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,270
we've got to be thinking
what are the threats?

1191
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:44,640
Because some of them we just don't know.

1192
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,410
Like there are things that we know,

1193
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:49,890
but the attackers are becoming
very, very sophisticated

1194
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:51,780
and because of that emergent behavior,

1195
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,610
it's opening up new opportunities

1196
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:56,040
that just don't exist right now.

1197
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,620
So if you want to learn some more then

1198
00:55:58,620 --> 00:55:59,790
we've got some resources here.

1199
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:04,260
You can kind of grab our example
repo and you can kind of,

1200
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,530
if you want to run Vault in on
your own or run Vault Radar,

1201
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,690
you can kind of get a free trial there.

1202
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,670
And of course, if you
want a mode of a deep dive

1203
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:14,201
on the technical side of things please

1204
