  "abstract": "Want to modernize your monolithic applications but unsure where to start? Event-driven architecture (EDA) offers a powerful approach to decomposing complex systems into small, decoupled services that can scale independently.  In this session, learn about common design trade-offs for distributed systems and how to navigate them with design patterns, illustrated by real-world examples, learn how to apply integration patterns in complex use cases.",
