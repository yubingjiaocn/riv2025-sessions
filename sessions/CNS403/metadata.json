  "title_cn": "I understand you're referencing an AWS re:Invent 2025 session about serverless best practices. However, I don't have access to the specific content from that session (CNS403) since re:Invent 2025 hasn't occurred yet, and I don't have real-time access to conference materials.\n\nI can help you with general serverless best practices for AWS developers, or if you have specific questions about serverless architectures, Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB, or other serverless services, I'd be happy to assist with those topics.\n\nWhat specific serverless development challenges or questions would you like help with?",
