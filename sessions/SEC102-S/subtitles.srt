1
00:00:00,568 --> 00:00:01,830
All right, thank you.

2
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:04,669
Right. Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:06,809
Uh, my name is Aish Shah.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,310
I'm the product manager for network

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,349
and application services at AWS.

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,368
I focus on network firewall and threat intelligence.

7
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,228
And I'm joined by Sushmita. She

8
00:00:17,228 --> 00:00:19,489
is the senior director of product at

9
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:21,670
Lumen, managing managed security services

10
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,908
for Lumen. And we are

11
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:26,068
extremely excited here to talk about

12
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,530
how Lehmen and AWS have been working

13
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,388
together for the last couple of months

14
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:31,850
to help you.

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,658
Elevate the security of your

16
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:36,118
cloud workloads.

17
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:40,490
All right. So,

18
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:43,579
before diving deep into the joint

19
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:44,158
solution,

20
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:46,759
uh, I just want to give you a brief

21
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:49,250
introduction of what AWS

22
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,399
Network firewall is.

23
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:53,179
So AWS Network Firewall is a

24
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:55,259
fully managed cloud firewall

25
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:57,444
service. This is AWS Native Firewall

26
00:00:57,444 --> 00:00:58,033
Service

27
00:00:58,435 --> 00:01:00,543
that allows you to deploy essential

28
00:01:00,543 --> 00:01:02,793
network protections, so you can

29
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:05,073
inspect any traffic that is going in

30
00:01:05,073 --> 00:01:06,534
and out of your VPCs

31
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:09,183
as well as apply filtering policies

32
00:01:09,183 --> 00:01:11,275
between your VPCs to stop lateral movement

33
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:11,954
of traffic.

34
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:15,448
The service is fully managed, which means

35
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:18,000
you don't have to worry about deploying the firewall

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,010
infrastructure.

37
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,430
You don't have to worry about the maintenance upgrade

38
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,510
of the software. It's done automatically

39
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,948
for you and it horizontally scales automatically

40
00:01:25,948 --> 00:01:27,698
up to 100 gigabits per second,

41
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:29,790
depending on your traffic volume.

42
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:33,109
We have a built-in stateful inspection engine

43
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:35,430
on the firewall which allows you to write

44
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:37,668
any specific rules that

45
00:01:37,668 --> 00:01:38,290
are

46
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,989
required from your business application standpoint. So

47
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:43,189
you can write traffic matching rules based on

48
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:44,010
IPs,

49
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,620
fully qualified domain names, URL

50
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,730
filtering, um,

51
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:49,750
you can also do IDS IPS,

52
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:51,730
threat signature-based rules.

53
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:54,349
So it gives you lots of flexibility

54
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,430
on how you want to control traffic

55
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,409
that is leaving

56
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,069
out of your VPCs.

57
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:02,448
And it's fully managed by

58
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:04,409
firewall manager services so you can.

59
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,389
Apply consistent security policy

60
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,399
across your entire AWS organization and

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,808
different accounts using that single pane of glass.

62
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:15,050
So,

63
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:17,528
one of the things that I heard last year when

64
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,849
I was talking about network firewall with the customers

65
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:20,508
is

66
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,349
we want simplified security.

67
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:25,479
And, um,

68
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,379
especially like managing rules at scale

69
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,610
is a challenge for us.

70
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,240
What can you do to make it easy for us?

71
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,028
And for that,

72
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,788
I'm extremely excited to announce

73
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,288
um the partner manage rules

74
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:41,069
on AWS network firewall.

75
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:46,189
So earlier at Reinvent,

76
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,929
we launched Partner manage rules, which

77
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:49,449
gives you

78
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:52,429
curated list of threat intelligence

79
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:54,429
from some of the top AWS

80
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:55,889
marketplace partners

81
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:58,169
directly into the network firewall.

82
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:00,308
At launch,

83
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:03,308
we partnered with 7 vendors,

84
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,830
including Lumen,

85
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,569
to give you best of breed threat

86
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,669
intelligence that you can now

87
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:12,008
easily apply to your firewall policy

88
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:13,149
and protect your network

89
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:15,669
and improve your network security.

90
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,550
What it means is now you

91
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,639
get. Automatic

92
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,689
updates on this threats directly

93
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:25,719
into your firewall policy, which means you don't

94
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,750
have to worry about writing your own rules,

95
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,360
managing IP lists, domain lists,

96
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,139
or writing threat signatures.

97
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:33,899
It's all done by

98
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,179
Partners who have their entire

99
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:39,258
team of security experts

100
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:41,379
working on behalf of you and giving you

101
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,618
the best of breed threat intel

102
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:44,639
as well as

103
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:46,758
keeping you ahead

104
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,258
of attacks before they are even

105
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:52,020
discovered using their

106
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,960
threat intelligence.

107
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,429
It is fully integrated into the network

108
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:58,250
firewall console, which means

109
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,729
you don't have to worry about

110
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,210
going to the marketplace to subscribe to

111
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,229
those rules. You can do that directly from

112
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:05,929
the console,

113
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:08,528
and then you can with a few clicks

114
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:11,028
apply those rules directly into your firewall

115
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:13,028
policy. So it's all done within the

116
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:14,210
network firewall console,

117
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,209
which significantly simplifies the

118
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,649
operational complexity that was involved in

119
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:22,629
either writing the rule or managing these policies

120
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,449
at scale.

121
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,230
So as you can see here, when you log

122
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,488
into the console,

123
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:31,350
now you will see an option to add

124
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,769
partner manage rules.

125
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:35,209
When you click on that, you will see

126
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,209
a list of all available rule groups,

127
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:39,928
including the defender managed rule

128
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:41,949
groups from Lumen, which is available on

129
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:42,720
the console.

130
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:44,689
It will tell you exactly

131
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:47,730
what type of threats are being

132
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,949
covered from those rule groups. So

133
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,028
specifically talking about the defender

134
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:53,488
managed rule groups, you'll get.

135
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,910
Coverage from malware-based threats.

136
00:04:57,869 --> 00:05:00,269
Command and control threats, bot activities,

137
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,028
etc. directly

138
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,528
over here. So with one click

139
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:05,548
check box,

140
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,028
you can now add those rule groups in your

141
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:09,199
network firewall policy.

142
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,829
And this threat intel is coming from Black Lotus

143
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:14,000
Labs, so they are using their global Blackbone

144
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:16,769
and, and giving you and keeping you ahead

145
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:18,829
of the attacks before, before, you

146
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:20,350
know, they are even discovered.

147
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:21,809
So

148
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,459
this is how we are making it super simple

149
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:25,100
for you,

150
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:26,439
so you can

151
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:29,238
get ahead of the attackers.

152
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,579
So here is an architecture diagram,

153
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:35,660
one of the common deployment types on how

154
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,619
customers deploy a network firewall

155
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:40,019
to build a centralized inspection

156
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:40,759
capability

157
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:43,298
using AWS network firewall. And

158
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:44,809
with this integration,

159
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:47,178
you can now protect all your

160
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:49,000
workloads within VPCs

161
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,420
using network firewall and

162
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,459
the threat intelligence which is powered by

163
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,519
Lumen. So, here is

164
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,699
how you can deploy

165
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,000
network firewall and inspection VPC and as

166
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,170
I showed, you can add Lumen Defender

167
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,309
Manage rule group on your network firewall

168
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:03,819
policy.

169
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:07,519
So with that, I will introduce Sushmita

170
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:09,858
and have her walk you through like

171
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:12,100
more details on, you know, like how this

172
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,678
all

173
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,399
will help you alleviate your network security.

174
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:18,660
Sushmita. Thank

175
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,949
you Amish. Um,

176
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:22,379
hello all. Thank you for joining this session. I'm

177
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:24,480
Sushmita Nayak and I had all of our

178
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:27,019
network security services and

179
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,959
threat intelligence products at Lumen.

180
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:32,290
Uh, before we talk about

181
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,160
what Lumen's outside in intelligence

182
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,079
means and how it powers

183
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,588
the firewall security,

184
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,980
I want to introduce a little bit about who is

185
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,509
Lumen

186
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,088
and, uh, what kind of security products

187
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:47,139
and solutions and what kind of threat intelligence we

188
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,149
bring. So Lumen for

189
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,379
those who may be less aware,

190
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:52,769
is really the

191
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:55,028
Internet service provider that

192
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,488
if you're a business of any size,

193
00:06:57,988 --> 00:07:00,149
uh, whether you are a

194
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,309
local data center or you have an office

195
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:03,790
or a cloud data center,

196
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:06,509
if you need Internet connectivity, most likely

197
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,869
you are getting it from Lumen.

198
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:10,470
So we are one of the number

199
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:10,980
one

200
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:12,689
hash peer network

201
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:14,088
globally

202
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:16,428
and we bring the Internet to

203
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:17,149
all of your

204
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:18,579
um enterprises.

205
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:20,949
Also proud to uh share that we

206
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,350
provide the Internet connectivity for this conference

207
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,119
reinvent,

208
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:26,149
uh, it is powered by Lumen.

209
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,819
With that introduction, um, I wanted

210
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,819
to talk a little bit about what we mean

211
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:32,358
by,

212
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:35,129
um, cyber intelligence and why is it

213
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:37,588
important to have more cyber intelligence,

214
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,480
um, now than ever.

215
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,329
Really attacks are escalating, uh,

216
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,709
the risks are real and for

217
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,819
anyone of you who is deploying a

218
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:48,858
workload on AWS, which

219
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:50,040
probably is most of you.

220
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,949
You are worried about the attacks that are escalating

221
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:56,369
all of your workloads, whether it is on malware

222
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:58,540
or proxies or botnets or

223
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,759
phishing attacks or ransomware attacks

224
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:02,980
or DDoS attacks. All of them

225
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,358
have multiplicative

226
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:06,720
growth in the last several years,

227
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:09,100
and really what that means to each

228
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,838
of you

229
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,559
if you are on a security team

230
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,079
or you're on the network security team,

231
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,579
you are worried about whether

232
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,858
your cloud workloads are indeed

233
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:23,608
safe. Proud

234
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,608
to announce that we are

235
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:27,309
one of the launch partners

236
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:28,809
with AWS

237
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,250
to provide our

238
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,029
Lumen's threat intelligence

239
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:36,090
powered by Black Lotus Labs.

240
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,928
Black Lotus Labs for introduction

241
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:41,129
is Lumen's threat intelligence

242
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,250
arm. I'll introduce more

243
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,340
about who is Black Lotus Labs in a minute,

244
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:47,889
but we are bringing in the

245
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:49,928
proven Black Lotus Labs threat

246
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:51,019
intelligence.

247
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:53,960
That is unique to our

248
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,070
network at the visibility and the scale

249
00:08:56,408 --> 00:08:58,950
of our our network and how it operates

250
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:01,529
for the first time we're bringing this

251
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:02,349
outside our network

252
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:05,330
to the ecosystem to AWS

253
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,808
network firewall customers.

254
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,629
Never before have we

255
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,989
brought this threat intelligence

256
00:09:11,288 --> 00:09:13,629
to ecosystems like AWS,

257
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,279
so. What's in it for you

258
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,700
guys if you are a firewall customer

259
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:21,099
for the first time, as Amish was mentioning,

260
00:09:21,558 --> 00:09:23,879
when you are managing your firewall

261
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,269
right within those console,

262
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:27,558
you can look up Lumen as a

263
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:29,639
partner manage rule and be able

264
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,139
to subscribe to it and immediately

265
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,418
deploy it into

266
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:35,840
one or more of your VPCs or firewalls

267
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,918
right away, getting protection from threat

268
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:39,379
intelligence in minutes.

269
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,479
So this is Lumen Defender

270
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:45,538
managed rules.

271
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,200
The net of it is that

272
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:50,099
it is a managed.

273
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,719
Rule set that is provided

274
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:54,820
by Lumen and AWS.

275
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,460
What that means is

276
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,000
it comes at no operational cost

277
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,080
to you. Lumen brings the rule

278
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,658
sets in Surikata form

279
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,000
to AWS, which is bringing in

280
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,178
those rule sets automatically

281
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,590
updated into your firewalls,

282
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,200
protecting your networks without you

283
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,798
having to worry about it, completely hassle-free.

284
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:18,759
OK, so talk about

285
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,250
why Lumen defender manage

286
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,418
rules. There's a lot of threat intelligence

287
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:25,080
out there, so the question is

288
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,399
yet another threat intelligence. So

289
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:29,899
do I need it? I think that's the real question.

290
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,908
There are 3

291
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,739
elements of what we bring to the table. One

292
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:36,769
is early threat infrastructure

293
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:37,558
detection.

294
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:40,308
Lumen, because it's an ISP,

295
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:43,090
because we have the most peered

296
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,029
network globally,

297
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:46,570
because we can see each of the traffic that

298
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,320
is crossing our network

299
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,210
because of our global status,

300
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,330
we can

301
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,649
uniquely identify good versus

302
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:54,590
bad traffic.

303
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,099
And we can see it when the traffic is

304
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:58,200
coming on a network

305
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,500
and we can immediately because

306
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,359
we can see it,

307
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,859
we can say if it's good or bad traffic

308
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:05,779
and we can stop it if it's bad traffic.

309
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:08,418
So again uniquely positioned

310
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,840
threat intelligence from a network perspective

311
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,359
by Lumen. Second,

312
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:14,349
rapid

313
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,960
automated protection. What does that mean?

314
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,149
As I mentioned earlier,

315
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:20,719
you don't have to do anything. Looming

316
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:22,940
behind the scenes together with AWS

317
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,479
network firewall infrastructure is automatically

318
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,599
updating those rules, and I'm

319
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:29,840
proud to share

320
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,849
that we update our rules daily.

321
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,779
Which is pretty unheard of if you are a

322
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:38,418
CISO or a security team or a

323
00:11:38,428 --> 00:11:41,009
network security, uh, you know, uh, individual,

324
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,320
you'll say, well, I want if I know a

325
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,399
threat, I want to be able to protect from

326
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,379
it right away.

327
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,899
Most threat intelligence companies,

328
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,099
most firewall companies

329
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:52,820
protect on a

330
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,869
few days a week. They update their rules.

331
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,960
Lumen is probably one of the only vendors

332
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,038
who provides threat intelligence updates

333
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:01,558
daily.

334
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,379
Actionable intelligence with context. Let

335
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:07,649
me explain what that is and why is that important.

336
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,450
IPs, DNSs, URLs,

337
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:12,668
they're all kind of cold elements like

338
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:15,279
19.2.5.235.

339
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:17,250
Like what does that even mean to anyone?

340
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,469
What Lumen brings is actionable

341
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:22,440
context to that particular IP.

342
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,200
Explaining what is that IP,

343
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,440
which threat actors, which, which malware,

344
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,548
which category of of attack it belongs

345
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,690
to, is it malware or botnet or

346
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,719
C2 or proxy? What kind

347
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,798
of severity is it? What's the reputation of that

348
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,158
IP? And we constantly have

349
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,658
AI-led algorithms

350
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,580
along with human intelligence

351
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,950
rank and rate those IPs in terms of severity

352
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,019
so that you don't have to do that.

353
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,229
So automatically

354
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:51,849
classifying those IPs and

355
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:54,090
automatically providing context in

356
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,320
the first version of the release we have limited

357
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,009
context but we're working on providing enriched

358
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:00,298
context for example,

359
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:01,830
what does this IP,

360
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,570
uh, if it's a malware which threat actor, which

361
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,340
threat family is it associated with,

362
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:08,889
right? So you wanna know about that, you know,

363
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:11,460
which nation state. Actor has

364
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,570
been involved with launching an

365
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,960
attack from that IP

366
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,139
so we are one of the few vendors

367
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,359
who believe in providing

368
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,779
actionable context along with your

369
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,058
IPs so that when the IP gets

370
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:26,279
blocked on the firewall, it hits the logs

371
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,619
and your se ops teams are watching those logs.

372
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:30,859
They're like, what is this IP and why did

373
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:33,558
why anyone block it? We give you the context

374
00:13:34,298 --> 00:13:35,279
so. Because

375
00:13:35,658 --> 00:13:36,989
of these three reasons,

376
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,658
I think Lumen's threat intelligence is

377
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:41,859
sort of by far one of the top

378
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:42,479
ones.

379
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:45,609
Let's detail a little bit in the architecture

380
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:46,759
of how this works.

381
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:49,000
So behind the scenes, starting on the left.

382
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,918
You have Black Lotus Labs, which is us,

383
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,450
our threat intelligence, which is looking at the

384
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,330
global network,

385
00:13:55,678 --> 00:13:57,969
looking at our AI-led, you know, algorithms

386
00:13:57,969 --> 00:14:00,509
as well as human specialists and researchers

387
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:02,710
who are looking at the attacks and

388
00:14:03,048 --> 00:14:05,109
curating the threat intelligence

389
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:07,330
that is then being. Generate are formed

390
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,418
into sort of sorryrikata rules and

391
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,788
reputation data that is being associated with

392
00:14:11,788 --> 00:14:14,070
it and these rule sets are being

393
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:17,139
ingested in the form of Lumen Defender

394
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:19,729
manage rules that are being then pushed

395
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:21,808
into the AWS firewall if

396
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:22,989
you have subscribed to it

397
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,330
and this then then protects both

398
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,330
the inbound and outbound traffic

399
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,330
coming into your workloads or going out

400
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,369
from your workloads.

401
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:37,019
It's actually the amazing

402
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,500
thing is how AWS

403
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,219
AWS Network firewall has

404
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:43,298
brought the richness of this

405
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:45,418
experience to you guys. It's

406
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,500
not that you have to go into the marketplace

407
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,759
and search for threat intelligence and

408
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:52,298
learn about it and figure out what to do.

409
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,859
They have built it right into the

410
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:57,139
firewall administration page, the policy

411
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:59,119
page, where you can go look up.

412
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:02,085
Of vendors that bring the threat intelligence

413
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:04,364
and you can then subscribe to it

414
00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:06,384
and within minutes you can apply it to

415
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:08,744
your firewall or to even hundreds of firewalls

416
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:11,423
that you may have access that you may have monitoring

417
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:12,183
required for

418
00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:14,303
so the ease of use,

419
00:15:14,744 --> 00:15:16,783
the product led experience is

420
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,965
a very big highlight in how

421
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:22,303
US security teams or network security teams

422
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:23,764
can avail this functionality.

423
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,928
I want to take a few minutes to talk a little bit about

424
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,009
what is the Black Lotus Labs

425
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:32,048
threat intelligence and why is it different

426
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:33,538
from everyone else.

427
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,269
The reason it is different is because we

428
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:38,690
are powered by the network

429
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:40,889
and we can see the threat infrastructure

430
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:43,168
being stood up even before the

431
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:45,229
attack has hit your enterprise,

432
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:47,869
so. To give you a parallel

433
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:50,099
here, think about a

434
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:52,298
bad actor. Let's say I'm a bad actor. I've come into

435
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:54,298
the country with malicious intent. I've

436
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:56,509
started to lease the apartment. I've started to

437
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:58,658
contact my friends, ready to launch an

438
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,489
attack. On,

439
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,590
on this, on this on this country.

440
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:05,408
Before I launch the attack,

441
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:08,219
Lumen, because of its visibility into the

442
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:10,298
network, can see what connections

443
00:16:10,298 --> 00:16:12,450
I'm making and start to

444
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,879
create that intelligence and form

445
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,969
because each of the, I know they know that I have a

446
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:17,798
bad reputation.

447
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:20,080
They know that other people I'm I'm connecting to

448
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,119
have bad reputations,

449
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:23,700
so a combination of this intelligence is

450
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,798
being used to

451
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:27,700
find those network infrastructure and

452
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,820
attacks much before the attacks are coming into

453
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,519
the network.

454
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:33,889
We operate at a very big scale. We have 2

455
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:35,349
million threats that we,

456
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,710
we track and block on a daily basis.

457
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:40,168
We have 200 billion plus flow sessions

458
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,729
and DNS queries that we are monitoring

459
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:44,729
every single day, and we execute over

460
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:46,529
150 takedowns per month.

461
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:47,548
And again,

462
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:49,989
attacks are not new. Bringing down attacks is

463
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:52,109
not new to us. We have a rich

464
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:54,139
lineage. Over the last 10 years.

465
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:54,918
You can see

466
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:57,590
named attacks that Black

467
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,298
Lotus Labs has prevented.

468
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,019
We have been working with the public sector

469
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:04,439
for the last several years, working

470
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,630
discreetly with them.

471
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:08,034
And with the ecosystem of threat intelligence

472
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:10,202
and security companies to block and

473
00:17:10,202 --> 00:17:12,323
take down these attacks that you're seeing here, whether

474
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,343
it's Mirai back in 2018

475
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:17,023
to System BC REM Proxy

476
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,323
much, much, much more recently, we

477
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:21,063
are the specialists that bring down

478
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:23,722
network bone attacks like no one else

479
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:24,303
does.

480
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:29,567
Going back to Lumen Defender

481
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:31,587
and our credibility

482
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:32,667
in bringing

483
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,968
high fidelity threat intelligence to

484
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:35,667
you guys,

485
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:37,648
this is not a new space for us.

486
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:40,128
We have been protecting our own

487
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:40,708
networks

488
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:43,409
for years and we are

489
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:44,347
one of the preferred.

490
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:46,805
Vendors working with public sector

491
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:47,805
companies

492
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:50,064
um to bring down nation state

493
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:52,305
attackers at all levels for the first

494
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,654
time we're bringing this intelligence to

495
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:55,285
commercial

496
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:57,625
uh companies and enterprises

497
00:17:57,894 --> 00:17:58,824
so um

498
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,223
we're extremely excited that you guys should try this

499
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:03,799
out. Again,

500
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,039
I want to kind of give another example to help

501
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:08,279
people understand that not all

502
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:10,019
threat intelligence is the same

503
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:12,479
because you may be saying, well, I already have threat

504
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:14,959
threat intelligence from, you know, my endpoint

505
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,039
security, from my firewall security,

506
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:19,150
from my email security.

507
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:20,769
Why do I need another one?

508
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,199
Well, there's a distinction. Not all

509
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:24,759
threat intelligence is the same.

510
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,828
And let me use this analogy

511
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,170
that one of my threat research uh

512
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,449
leaders shared with me.

513
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:32,930
Think of the United States and think of all

514
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,289
the highways in the United States,

515
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,299
right? All these highways are interconnected.

516
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:40,068
Lumen has

517
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:42,650
the most visibility into the most

518
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,525
number of highways in the. United States,

519
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,924
why does it matter? Because the traffic that

520
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:48,193
flows on those highways,

521
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:50,644
we can see those and because we

522
00:18:50,644 --> 00:18:53,203
can see the suspicious traffic from

523
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:54,924
probably, you know, benign traffic

524
00:18:55,993 --> 00:18:58,144
or potentially malicious traffic, we are able

525
00:18:58,144 --> 00:19:00,584
to spotlight those and take action

526
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:01,943
on that intelligence.

527
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:04,029
So

528
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:06,769
all of this curated intelligence is being

529
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:08,189
brought to you at

530
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:10,588
sort of in the most easiest way

531
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,189
and again to those who are thinking about

532
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:15,489
I already have intelligence from endpoint

533
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:17,910
the endpoint intelligence is super important

534
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,250
it's like take another analogy it's like you know

535
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,328
your home security each of our

536
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,410
homes have sensors to protect

537
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,848
our homes. Think of endpoints intelligence

538
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:27,608
as that.

539
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:29,568
Can it be substituted by

540
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,939
Lumen defender manage rules? No,

541
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:34,390
you should not. We're not asking you to

542
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,430
replace because you need home

543
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,009
security.

544
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:38,608
You need neighborhood

545
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,088
aerial view of what is happening in the neighborhood.

546
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:43,568
You want us to say, well, 50

547
00:19:43,568 --> 00:19:45,848
blocks, 10 blocks down the, down your home,

548
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,368
something has happened.

549
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:49,608
That's the kind of intelligence that

550
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,289
Black Lotus Labs bring in.

551
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:53,949
So don't substitute it with other forms of,

552
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,890
uh, of, uh, intelligence.

553
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:57,328
Compliment it.

554
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,759
Key takeaways

555
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:03,219
we are bringing threat intelligence

556
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:04,959
previously uniquely

557
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,739
available to Lumen only for Lumen's

558
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,489
network. It is powered by the #1

559
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,229
network fabric that connects

560
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:14,598
all of you enterprises here.

561
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:17,519
Global visibility for the first time

562
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,578
is coming to AWS

563
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:21,078
to AWS customers.

564
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:23,640
It is product led integration

565
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,799
so seamlessly available to you

566
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,000
AWS network firewall customers.

567
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,699
Please give it a try,
