1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:00,708
All right,

2
00:00:01,308 --> 00:00:03,289
let's get started. My name's John Rogers.

3
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:05,839
I'm a, uh, client partner for Pearson,

4
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:07,309
and I just have the pleasure

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,898
to manage both AWS and the

6
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:11,390
ServiceNow relationship,

7
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,329
um.

8
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,669
Let's see, I guess after about 6 months of

9
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:16,179
research,

10
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,750
we concluded, uh, about midway

11
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,589
through this year

12
00:00:19,908 --> 00:00:22,109
and we, uh, developed a report. It's

13
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,510
a workforce skills forecast

14
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,690
report collaboratively with ServiceNow.

15
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:29,179
Um, what we did in this report is

16
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:31,219
we looked, use machine learning, we use

17
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:33,579
economic analysis, we use predictive

18
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:34,399
analytics,

19
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,918
and we're able to evaluate

20
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:39,939
not only market shifts from a labor perspective

21
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,439
but also how agentic AI

22
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,118
and related technologies

23
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:46,899
uh impact a role, so

24
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:49,048
out of the task level, how they impact

25
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,158
an industry, how they impact a country,

26
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:53,789
and roll that up to macroeconomics as well,

27
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,000
right? So it's a really fascinating report.

28
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,700
So I'd like to bring, um,

29
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,380
uh, introduce my two colleagues here next to

30
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,500
me. So one is Ian Gott. He's

31
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,620
a senior director for sales

32
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,959
for, um, ServiceNow in

33
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,739
AI

34
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:12,750
data and analytics, and also Ray

35
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,778
Murray for Pearson. Hello everyone, and he's our

36
00:01:14,778 --> 00:01:17,109
CRO and an SVP at Pearson.

37
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:19,644
And what we like to. Us today is dive

38
00:01:19,644 --> 00:01:22,284
into how these technologies

39
00:01:22,284 --> 00:01:24,364
are going to really redefine the world of

40
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:24,894
work,

41
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:27,314
um, how that we can

42
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:29,665
collaborate with AI as individuals,

43
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,724
right? And also just

44
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,105
starting to reimagine, I think

45
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:36,245
organizations are going to have to start reimagining how

46
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:38,284
AI impacts and how we work together

47
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:39,043
collaboratively.

48
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:41,183
So with that I'm going to kick it off.

49
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:43,635
I'll start with Ray.

50
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,778
Um,

51
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:47,290
what are kind of the key trends that you saw in

52
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,609
the research that would, that triggered

53
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,278
a reaction from you?

54
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,680
Yeah, well, thank you, um, thanks,

55
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,849
JR. First of all, I'll just start off by saying

56
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,879
it's wonderful to be here uh

57
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,629
at AWS Reinvent,

58
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,209
um, and to have this opportunity

59
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,519
to talk about powering the future of work.

60
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:07,069
I find it a little ironic, I have to say

61
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,159
that, uh,

62
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,929
we're sitting here in front of people that essentially

63
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:11,960
build and ship,

64
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:14,288
uh, the tools of how uh we're gonna

65
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:16,229
power the future of work and you and I are.

66
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:18,000
Uh, more on the theory side

67
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:20,419
of things, uh, but it's wonderful to

68
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:22,659
be here. And I also like a huge shout out

69
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,770
to, um, Ion from, uh,

70
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,778
ServiceNow, an organization that does so

71
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:29,088
much, uh, to bring products and services,

72
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,758
uh, that, uh, reshape the way we do work,

73
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:34,129
uh, and, and make our daily

74
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,319
lives very rewarding.

75
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,939
So essentially the res the headline of

76
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,118
the research is.

77
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:41,800
Agentic AI is not an

78
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,129
IT upgrade, it's a massive,

79
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,830
massive seismic shift

80
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:48,490
to every economy worldwide like we've

81
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,149
never seen.

82
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:52,189
And it will disrupt every

83
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:53,699
industry, um,

84
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:55,969
um, and, but not necessarily in a straight line

85
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:58,490
uh uh way.

86
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,330
By 2030, uh, we're estimating

87
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,490
that about 8

88
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:05,909
million people, the survey, uh, the, the

89
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:08,149
research showed that in America alone, 8 million

90
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:09,929
people's roles will get disrupted.

91
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:12,580
Uh, and that will get that disruption's

92
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,379
gonna happen,

93
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,689
um, at the skills level. It's

94
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:17,729
going to happen, um, you know,

95
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,610
by augmenting those skills and by redefining

96
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,479
roles, and the paradox

97
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:24,819
is that AI is disrupting

98
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:26,679
at a very fast pace,

99
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:27,508
um.

100
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,258
But the needs for skills are

101
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:32,300
actually uh going higher

102
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,338
at even a, a faster, a

103
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:36,419
faster pace. And in the, and if you, when you

104
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:38,618
look at the, the research in 8 of the 10

105
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,399
countries,

106
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:41,868
um, that we researched, there will be

107
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:42,699
more work,

108
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:45,258
uh, than workers to actually do the work

109
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,379
itself. Um, and that's great news,

110
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,679
that's great news for all of us, it's great news,

111
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,979
um, for all, uh, all

112
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:54,099
the attendees at, at, at Reinvent

113
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:56,000
because it really is job security.

114
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:58,610
Um, and so really the takeaway

115
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:01,258
at a macro level is that AI is

116
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:02,250
not reducing,

117
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,750
uh, demand for tech,

118
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:07,270
uh, talent itself, it's actually fueling

119
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,368
it moving forward.

120
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:10,990
Yeah, thanks, Ray. And Ian, would you,

121
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:14,110
can you, so that's a great macro macroeconomic

122
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,889
brush.

123
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,829
Can you take us in from an industry view that you're

124
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,879
seeing? Yeah, absolutely. So we,

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,660
we saw that with financial services,

126
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,838
um, you're going to see maybe a higher impact in

127
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:26,869
that type of industry. For example,

128
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:27,980
in Japan,

129
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,600
you know, as much as 15% of

130
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,298
that workforce impacted

131
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,720
in that particular industry and maybe some similar

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,459
trends

133
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:36,899
in the US

134
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:40,399
as well as other parts of the world. As

135
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,619
we get into other industries like retail

136
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:45,439
as well, we're going to see kind of a disproportionate

137
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,689
impact in in in countries like India and the

138
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,809
UK. When it comes to

139
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:51,069
things like inventory management,

140
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,290
customer service,

141
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:54,769
you're already seeing some of that, you know, probably as

142
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:56,769
an online shopper in your experience

143
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:59,170
in terms of how AI is recommending

144
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,119
products or how you're checking out,

145
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,160
and then other areas too like professional

146
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,449
services, technology,

147
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:07,869
other industry segments will be

148
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,459
impacted, but it's more. About the augmentation of

149
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:13,199
how AI will help further enhance

150
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,528
those jobs and roles.

151
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:15,699
And then lastly,

152
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,220
when speaking of roles and knowledge workers in

153
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,278
Singapore, we found

154
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:22,319
those knowledge workers are quite advanced,

155
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,500
so they're taking AI and making it

156
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,579
part of their day to day job and really

157
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:28,819
accelerating the productivity and impact they're

158
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:29,338
having,

159
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,238
and you'll see that as a trend evolve

160
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,149
around the globe for those that invest the time

161
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:37,379
to do more with it versus just learn it,

162
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:40,108
use it. Yes, I thought one of the most

163
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:41,488
amazing things for me is

164
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:44,449
there's only 2 countries in the study that we did

165
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:46,988
that oversupply, right? So the majority

166
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:49,108
is we have not enough workers

167
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:51,309
to do the work that's needed to hit those GDP

168
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,660
goals that we have, except in 2 countries,

169
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:56,108
and those were Germany and those were Japan,

170
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,350
right? There's going to be an oversupply over the next

171
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:58,858
few years,

172
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:01,244
but, and this is really Good for everybody here

173
00:06:01,244 --> 00:06:02,074
in this room.

174
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,665
If you look at the tech industry, it's

175
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,884
still something like 36%

176
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:08,963
growth skyrocketing. So you guys are in the

177
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:11,004
right spot, I guess is what I'm saying. You're in

178
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,494
the right industry that's going up.

179
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:14,403
OK, let's take it, um,

180
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:17,045
sort of out of the, the, the, the theory

181
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:19,153
and the economic and start to get a little bit more

182
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:21,345
applicable to the people here in the audience,

183
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:23,970
um. Ray, would you, could you

184
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,079
give us a little bit of insight or maybe like

185
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,108
your top three recommendations

186
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:30,670
at both the organization level

187
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,850
and probably at the individual level

188
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:35,790
on how to, how to navigate these shifts

189
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,369
that are,

190
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,269
you know, being thrown at us

191
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:39,420
uh through agentic AI.

192
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:43,509
So I, I, I'll start off with a bit of a

193
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,959
a summary and to paint a bit of a picture. So

194
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,528
if AI is the engine,

195
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,980
then, then learning really is the fuel.

196
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,519
And, and without power, without the fuel,

197
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:54,869
essentially the engine stays dormant and doesn't

198
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:55,579
get moving.

199
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,559
So at Pearson, we know that learning

200
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,858
is a lifelong

201
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:02,838
force multiplier. It compounds

202
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,838
just like interest does, and it's

203
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:06,920
not something you do once, it's something

204
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,160
that for most uh

205
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,559
learners, um.

206
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,939
At the baseline, really learning lifts

207
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:14,559
people

208
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,980
from poverty.

209
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:18,850
It, it, it enables people to

210
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:22,040
live healthier lives, live happier lives,

211
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,379
you know, when we learn, we are typically

212
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:25,519
generally happier,

213
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,259
and, and in the era

214
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:29,059
of AI

215
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:31,980
that that force multiplier is

216
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,358
really multiplying

217
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,970
because the, the, the truth

218
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,649
of the matter is in the future,

219
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:40,119
knowing how to learn.

220
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,028
and, and, and how to learn deep

221
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:46,059
and how to learn wide and

222
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:47,639
fast, abs, you know,

223
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,629
that's, that's the essence, how to go fast

224
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,750
and how to learn deep and how to learn continuously

225
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:56,009
is going to be the skill of

226
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,298
the future and that superpower that's needed.

227
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,798
Before AI

228
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,410
we, we, we used, we

229
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,509
used to essentially learn to earn,

230
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:06,730
so it was cyclical, you'd go to school, then you'd

231
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,983
go to. and then you'd earn

232
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:09,803
some money. Now

233
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:12,653
we're seeing a massive shift um

234
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:15,314
where you actually are learning to learn

235
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:18,165
and the people that are going to be able to keep at pace

236
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,254
and and organizations because

237
00:08:20,254 --> 00:08:22,504
essentially people are organizations are

238
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:23,744
going to have to

239
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:26,144
know how to learn and how to

240
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:28,184
learn faster, how to retain and how to

241
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:29,564
stay at pace

242
00:08:29,824 --> 00:08:31,903
with the growth of technology and

243
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:33,585
the growth that's happening within AI.

244
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:35,349
And at Pearson,

245
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:37,928
we have that science, that pedagogy,

246
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:38,690
we have

247
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:39,840
essentially

248
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,580
decades and decades of learning of

249
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,969
how people learn

250
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,538
and through our work with AWS,

251
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:50,000
through our work with ServiceNow, we're building

252
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,879
tools and products essentially that are embedded

253
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:55,320
in the flow of work that are

254
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,080
giving you that constant feedback

255
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:00,840
and really organizations

256
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:03,250
that essentially. Still look at learning

257
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,210
as something on the sidelines,

258
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,359
something that is not actually

259
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:09,820
embedded in the flow of work,

260
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,158
will essentially stay behind.

261
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:14,820
So really thinking about learning,

262
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:17,678
investing in learning and moving forward

263
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:19,200
with it embedded,

264
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,739
continuous in your in your daily

265
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:23,779
habit tools is really

266
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,889
something that every organization has

267
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,899
to has to adopt

268
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,239
and has to adopt very, very quickly. And

269
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:32,340
they have to do it ubiquitously across

270
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,019
all of the organization across

271
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,519
um all of their business units.

272
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:38,979
Yeah, so you, you're effectively saying that

273
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:41,558
the skill of learning is the most

274
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:43,229
important skill you can have

275
00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:44,548
in this world. That's

276
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,359
so um and that's really great and that's some perspective

277
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:49,629
certainly from Pearson which is

278
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:51,639
focused around lifelong learning and so forth.

279
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,038
Let's take a little technical lens, right,

280
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:56,484
so. From a ServiceNow perspective,

281
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,763
can you answer the same kind of top

282
00:09:58,763 --> 00:09:59,342
three recommendations for how

283
00:10:01,313 --> 00:10:03,604
organizations and individuals navigate this, but

284
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,803
through sort of a tech lens on that?

285
00:10:05,913 --> 00:10:08,202
Yes, no, of course, and at ServiceNow

286
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:10,322
we say, you know, we put AI to work

287
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:12,663
for the people, and that starts

288
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:15,183
with, you know, embracing AI and partnering

289
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:17,923
with AI in a way that it's going to

290
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:19,908
complement the thing. You're doing day to day,

291
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,687
embracing it in a way beyond, you know, you

292
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:23,236
learn it,

293
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:25,687
you orchestrate it, but also you're going to do

294
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:27,227
more with it in the sense of

295
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,567
setting goals, learning about

296
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,567
what means, you know, good in

297
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,727
terms of data that is output

298
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:35,788
and being able to really embrace

299
00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:37,807
kind of an end to end approach where it's

300
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:38,626
trustworthy

301
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:41,327
and you're building on it in a way that's going to have

302
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:42,447
impact, that's valuable,

303
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:45,251
the human. Element is going to stay involved in

304
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:47,410
this too. It's not just about the tech or

305
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,650
the agents. So like the human element of

306
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,600
creativity,

307
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,150
application, complex thinking

308
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:55,451
needs to stay in place. And that's

309
00:10:55,451 --> 00:10:57,850
why the third point is, you know, governance

310
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,971
is guardians. We all are that, you know, when we're

311
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:02,011
embracing AI and we're working with

312
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,131
data within an organization that just doesn't

313
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,171
fall on the C-suite or the

314
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:08,475
chief risk officer. We're all handling

315
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:10,735
that data and we need to handle it responsibly

316
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:12,894
and think about not only what we're putting in

317
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:14,934
but what's coming out and how we're applying it

318
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:17,195
and using it to make decisions

319
00:11:17,254 --> 00:11:19,296
and uh you know foster the outcome

320
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:20,985
that we're looking to achieve

321
00:11:21,254 --> 00:11:22,916
in terms of that balance of

322
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,416
innovation and capability

323
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,535
from learning is that combination of skill

324
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:29,754
that that the people are looking for it's gonna be

325
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:31,955
valuable as the workforce evolves.

326
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:34,375
Yeah, that's really, that's really interesting. So one

327
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,375
of the um.

328
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:38,149
The other things that stood out to me was

329
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:40,529
if you start to look at the demand for genic

330
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:42,668
AI skills, you, you, you can, I

331
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,908
mean any of the web crawlers, anybody who's looking

332
00:11:44,908 --> 00:11:46,009
at that skills base

333
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:48,629
sees this incredible hockey stick

334
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,538
at this point.

335
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,149
But if you actually look and you overlay that

336
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:53,609
with governance skills,

337
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:54,859
0.

338
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,119
Zero increase whatsoever.

339
00:11:57,418 --> 00:11:59,619
So you're seeing this agentic AI skill base

340
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,048
go through the moon,

341
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,580
and then you have a completely flat for

342
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,090
anything governance related to agentic AI

343
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,139
governance, right? So if anybody's looking for a

344
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:10,440
new job, I got a feeling at some point

345
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,979
they're going to have to close that gap. It might be an

346
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:14,038
interesting area to get into.

347
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:16,529
Um, OK, so that

348
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,690
was, you know, we've taken it down to the individual,

349
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:20,769
we've taken a look at the organization and we've looked at

350
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:21,668
the macro.

351
00:12:22,048 --> 00:12:23,719
Um, Ray, how would you,

352
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,070
I guess, look at

353
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,570
how this is impacting you? So let's

354
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,769
make it a little bit more personal.

355
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,239
So from the teams and, and from Pearson's

356
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:32,229
perspective internally

357
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,710
within our own company,

358
00:12:34,038 --> 00:12:36,418
um, could you give us a little insight on that?

359
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:37,700
Yeah, yeah, Jay, uh,

360
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,330
so, so I will say this, uh, you know,

361
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:41,229
at Pearson.

362
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,279
Um,

363
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,979
uh, AI has been part of our DNA,

364
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:47,538
uh, for a good 18 months now.

365
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,219
Um, and we're very fortunate

366
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,808
to essentially have,

367
00:12:52,158 --> 00:12:54,239
um, leaders that, um,

368
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:56,759
are, are, are very keen on, on, on Pearson

369
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,058
being at the forefront,

370
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:00,658
um, of essentially driving,

371
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:03,658
uh, AI and, and, and, and,

372
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:05,519
and education through AI.

373
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,119
Um, and, and, and

374
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:10,489
we have, uh, every Pearson

375
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,519
employee has

376
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:14,099
access to AI through their daily habit tools, which

377
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:15,558
is a wonderful thing to see.

378
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:18,019
And we also have KPIs and personal

379
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:18,649
goals

380
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,219
to get trained and get certified on AI.

381
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:23,379
After all, we are an education

382
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,500
and a certification credentialing organization.

383
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,849
Uh, so we like to be customer zero before we

384
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,168
roll things out, uh, to, to,

385
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,229
to our customers,

386
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:33,609
um, and we also like to drink, uh, our

387
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,759
own champagne or eat our own dog food,

388
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,950
uh, depending on how you, what the saying is.

389
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:40,038
Um, and so

390
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,759
moving forward, what we want to do is

391
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:45,979
essentially harness

392
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:47,298
the power of AI

393
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,940
and work with partners

394
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,639
such as AWS, such as ServiceNow

395
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,119
to bring real customized

396
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,580
ways of learning, AI tutors.

397
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,764
Coaches that are digital in the

398
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:02,835
flow of work,

399
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,264
um, and we also want to be an organization

400
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:07,485
that revolutionize education and

401
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:09,426
makes sure that everybody comes along,

402
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:11,966
um, so that's a big part and AI can actually

403
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:14,004
do that and can help us do that at scale, so

404
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:16,365
a lot of things that we used to think about in

405
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:18,405
the past, and, and of course then

406
00:14:18,405 --> 00:14:20,405
you've got the innovation side, you've got.

407
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:22,600
How does it impact our operations,

408
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:25,221
our customer service, HR and

409
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:27,312
finance? So we're making all those changes

410
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:29,631
and what it's doing there is it's taking

411
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,541
away from the,

412
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,660
the, you know, the mundane robotic

413
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,831
aspect of tasks that none of us

414
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:36,812
really like to do

415
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,671
and that AI is very good at,

416
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:40,610
but it also gives us and allows us

417
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:44,442
the chance to give elbow room for our

418
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:45,052
people

419
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,552
to essentially do the things that AI is

420
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:48,291
not good at.

421
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:50,779
Um, and that's the human side of

422
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,889
things, uh, and to,

423
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,599
uh, you know, mostly on the,

424
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:56,109
on the softer skills,

425
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,250
agility,

426
00:14:57,619 --> 00:14:59,580
leadership, communication, that kind of thing.

427
00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:02,090
And we're also hell bent moving forward

428
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,500
in the future on becoming an

429
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,109
organization that

430
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,369
part of that circle of organizations that's not

431
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:09,928
just investing in AI

432
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,158
to cost cut,

433
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:14,729
but to actually augment and enable

434
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:16,070
a human workforce

435
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,609
uh to to be more human and to do

436
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:20,469
those elements that I talked about before.

437
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,119
Thanks, Ray. Anything to add, Ryan?

438
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:25,769
Yeah, I mean, it also comes down when we're

439
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:27,808
talking about the technology side and, and what

440
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:29,830
we're doing with, uh, you know, Pierson View and

441
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,129
and AWS. It comes down to the, the

442
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:34,330
models, the AI, the choice that that

443
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,529
you have on what, um, AI

444
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:38,599
models you want to use, for example, with,

445
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:40,928
you know, the nowlysis platform on

446
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:42,509
ServiceNow and how we've built,

447
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:44,769
you know, integrations with AWS as, as,

448
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:45,928
as a hyper scaler

449
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,509
choice for our customers

450
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:49,969
is a great collaboration we have to make sure

451
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:52,592
that you, you have the approach and. Governance

452
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:54,302
and security you need to move forward

453
00:15:54,881 --> 00:15:56,043
with your use cases.

454
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,832
That's great. Thank you. So I kind of

455
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,001
heard several things come out as in summary

456
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,023
points. One is learning

457
00:16:03,153 --> 00:16:03,692
to learn.

458
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:05,381
That is a primary skill

459
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:07,763
that everybody needs to get comfortable with,

460
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:11,001
right? The technology is outpacing

461
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:13,241
our skills right now. So getting

462
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:14,802
comfortable with that. I can,

463
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:17,121
you know, I think my grandfather had one job

464
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:19,121
his entire life, worked for 40 years

465
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:21,235
at it. My father had a I think 2 or

466
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:23,514
3. I've had 5 on

467
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:25,596
Gen X, right? But you're starting to see that

468
00:16:25,596 --> 00:16:28,216
get more and more. But now there's a new twist

469
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:30,514
to it. It's not just I'm a role,

470
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:32,096
I'm one particular role

471
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:34,634
in multiple different companies. It's

472
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:36,934
starting to blend where my role

473
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:38,075
is evolving

474
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:40,716
consistently. I can give you a little bit more insight

475
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:41,995
into what we found,

476
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:44,445
particularly against all the ecosystem roles

477
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:46,514
that are sitting in the audience right now, the

478
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:48,894
data leaks, the architects, and so forth.

479
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,058
In the next 5 years,

480
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:54,960
our analysis is showing about 12

481
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,139
to 15 hours of time

482
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,320
being capacity being released in your workday

483
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,178
due to the impact of these technologies.

484
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,759
So unless we're all going to a 3 day work week,

485
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,000
which I don't think we are anytime soon, your

486
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,118
job's going to evolve. They're going to combine roles. They're

487
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:10,118
going to start looking for new.

488
00:17:10,553 --> 00:17:12,702
Ask, so just be ready for it. So learning to learn is

489
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:14,644
one. The second thing is around

490
00:17:14,972 --> 00:17:17,542
governance, right? Everybody has to be responsible

491
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:19,803
for governance, and I guess the third is really

492
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:21,483
like, look, we're all in this together.

493
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,894
It's here already. This isn't you kick it

494
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:26,894
down the road a little bit. We're already in the middle of

495
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:29,023
it, so I'm excited.

496
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:31,423
I will, um, I want to give a

497
00:17:31,423 --> 00:17:32,563
quick pitch. We, we,

498
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:35,972
we produced this report and it got so

499
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,023
much success around the world that

500
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,650
we've uh. Post

501
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,289
after that over the last 3 months we've actually

502
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:43,828
released

503
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,890
10 individual reports per country

504
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,130
so there's one for every single country.

505
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,420
What we're both using it. Both

506
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,529
Pierson and ServiceNow is using it to have

507
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:54,430
conversations with governments,

508
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,828
to have conversations with the institutions that

509
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:58,868
we talk with, and commercial

510
00:17:58,868 --> 00:17:59,949
enterprises as well.

511
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:02,309
So this is a great way to start a conversation

512
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:04,509
about what their skilling strategy and so forth,

513
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,890
but to actually have data

514
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,529
that represents that

515
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:09,930
there's a, um, it's

516
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,949
a public on the ServiceNow website. So the way you can find

517
00:18:11,949 --> 00:18:14,269
it, just type in workforce skills forecast

518
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:16,430
report, and it's available to anybody in this room

519
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,189
free of charge,

520
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:19,618
OK. We got about a little

521
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:21,670
bit of time left, but I think I'm going to excuse

522
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,068
everybody early. Thank you so much. It was such a pleasure.

523
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,269
I know your time is valuable, so thanks for

524
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:27,108
spending it with us.

525
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:28,910
Thank you so much, everyone. Thank you.
