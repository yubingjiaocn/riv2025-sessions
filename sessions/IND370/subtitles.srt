1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:01,320
All right, thank you.

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,099
All right, thank you. Good afternoon.

3
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:08,038
So among the excitement around

4
00:00:08,038 --> 00:00:10,358
the accelerated development and the increased

5
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,380
accessibility of artificial intelligence

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,278
has really been this sense of optimism in our

7
00:00:15,278 --> 00:00:17,519
industry for how AI can transform

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,620
manufacturing and supply chain operations.

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,408
But I'm commonly asked, uh, as

10
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:24,429
the industry just grapples with delivering on

11
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:25,600
that transformation,

12
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:28,010
what, what would be a clear framework for

13
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,620
how we balance modernization

14
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,130
with short-term financial ROI

15
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,348
while still building the foundations

16
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:37,408
for long-term, uh, innovative capabilities.

17
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:40,478
My name is Joe Rosing. I lead our center of excellence

18
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:42,719
for manufacturing and supply chain at AWS.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,399
And in today's session, we're really gonna talk about,

20
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:47,848
uh, uh, the best practice approaches

21
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,279
for how we can modernize manufacturing and supply

22
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:52,740
chain operations to really accelerate

23
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,859
the benefit that we can be, uh, achieving

24
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,098
with artificial intelligence.

25
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,548
Now that optimism that I spoke on before is really

26
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:03,618
grounded in the sense that the,

27
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,829
the industry right now is ripe for

28
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:07,888
change and ripe for re-industrialization,

29
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,870
and a lot of that is because of some unique challenges

30
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,689
that our industry continues to face.

31
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:15,109
Uh, we're still, for example, continuously

32
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,209
trying to build supply chain resiliency.

33
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,609
We're managing the impact of

34
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,909
an aging workforce and demographics on

35
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:22,969
business continuity.

36
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,569
And we're also, you know, struggling with

37
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,349
risks or mitigating risks related to geopolitics

38
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:28,909
and trade.

39
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,500
But fundamentally, re-industrialization

40
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,198
really has to be AI driven,

41
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,900
because for us to build a competitive advantage

42
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:39,329
through manufacturing and supply chain operations,

43
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,599
it's all gonna come down to how quickly

44
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,900
we can perceive, react and

45
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,338
re-optimize based on these changing

46
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,379
conditions. And we're gonna have to do that at a

47
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,819
scale and speed that simply surpasses

48
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,159
human capabilities.

49
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:56,668
And so the winners in reindustrialization

50
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:58,930
are not going to be those that, you know, just

51
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,230
implement technology for technology's sake

52
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:03,948
or chase the latest models that got released.

53
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:06,409
The winners are going to be those that really focus

54
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:08,449
on where we're going to deliver a financial

55
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,099
ROI,

56
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,569
but also where we can deliver on

57
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,808
the durable needs of the operation

58
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:15,069
or of the supply chain.

59
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:17,710
And I put those durable needs into three buckets,

60
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:20,449
the first of which is reducing variation.

61
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,008
So how do we become predictably boring

62
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:25,179
at the key performance indicators that matter

63
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:26,349
most for our business?

64
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,770
But when it comes to AI it's really thinking about

65
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,969
that through the lens of how do we solve

66
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:32,838
problems with human-like reasoning,

67
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,008
but with machine scale consistency.

68
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,050
The second durable need really comes down to empowering

69
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,569
employees. And we've been talking about empowering

70
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,599
employees in our industry for decades.

71
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,969
It's lean manufacturing, Toyota

72
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,830
production system, common topics.

73
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,250
But it's never more important than now when we talk

74
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,740
about artificial intelligence,

75
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,808
because fundamentally the role of artificial intelligence

76
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:57,528
should be how we empower employees to make better

77
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:59,729
decisions faster and also how we use

78
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:01,770
the technology to reduce the cognitive

79
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,889
load on our employees and really

80
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,830
free them up to do higher order tasks.

81
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
And then the 3rd durable need is just how

82
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,300
we execute at speed

83
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,159
and are able to re-optimize capacity

84
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,240
against those changing conditions. And like

85
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,278
I mentioned before, be able to do that at a

86
00:03:17,278 --> 00:03:18,258
scale and speed

87
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,719
that's going to surpass the way that we can do it

88
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,740
today through manual processes.

89
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:28,868
Now, many manufacturers

90
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:30,879
have started this journey, right? There, like I said,

91
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,129
there is a lot of interest, there's a lot of optimism

92
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,588
around the role that AI can play in helping us

93
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:38,110
achieve things like closed loop manufacturing systems,

94
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:40,909
helping us make real-time production adjustments

95
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:42,830
or software defined manufacturing,

96
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,349
and further reduce variation in our

97
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:45,929
processes.

98
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,770
But the fact of the matter is, only about a

99
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,788
third of the industry has their

100
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:53,099
data in a place that they really can innovate

101
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,689
at scale, and where they can quickly implement

102
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,469
a POC for example, of an AI use

103
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:01,028
case in one factory, and then replicate

104
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:03,330
that success across multiple factories.

105
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,270
And so really the role that AWS is playing.

106
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,088
Is helping us transition

107
00:04:09,368 --> 00:04:11,368
from our traditional model of

108
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:13,919
how we'd manage data in the factories and the

109
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,088
operations to one that is gonna be really

110
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:18,319
defined for us to achieve software defined

111
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,108
manufacturing.

112
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:22,418
So if we think about this traditional ISA 95

113
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:23,778
Purdue pyramid model,

114
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,117
it fundamentally is not built

115
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:28,298
to support the demands and the requirements of

116
00:04:28,298 --> 00:04:29,278
an AI world.

117
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:31,769
We have inherent data silos across each

118
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:32,778
of those layers,

119
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:35,139
and there's a lot of variation across each of those

120
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:37,418
layers when we look at the global manufacturing

121
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:37,988
footprint.

122
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,230
And so a lot of the work we're doing from a modernization

123
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,809
perspective

124
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,350
in the OT world in particular, is

125
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,709
thinking around how do we get to this desired future

126
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,879
state where we're running a lot of the IT

127
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,949
applications in the cloud, but we're thinking

128
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:53,009
about new characteristics

129
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:54,709
of what the factory looks like.

130
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,290
And we can define those characteristics by first

131
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,428
saying we're going to truly merge IT

132
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:01,660
and OT and make sure that it's integrated,

133
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,149
both as a function in terms of capabilities

134
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:06,420
of our teams, but also from a

135
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,170
technology perspective.

136
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,750
The second tenet is really making sure that we can

137
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,889
enable any to any communication.

138
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,230
So for example, when we think about agentic

139
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,509
workflows and how they might operate on the plant

140
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:19,189
floor, or if we want to do closed loop feedback

141
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,269
controls, it's going to require us to take

142
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:23,350
an insight that we might be generating off

143
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,509
of an IT system and drive

144
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:27,829
the action or automate that action back into

145
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,069
the hardware or the shop floor layer. And

146
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,230
that's going to really again require this any to any

147
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,670
communication capability.

148
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,298
And then the third piece is moving

149
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:38,338
beyond what we've traditionally thought of as systems

150
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:38,879
of record

151
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:41,019
and maybe systems of transaction,

152
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:43,869
to also now thinking about systems of action.

153
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,178
So a control tower type of view

154
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,869
or a way that we can observe

155
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,250
what the AI is doing and how it's

156
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,119
interacting with all of these systems.

157
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:54,579
And that will also then fundamentally change the

158
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:56,619
role that those systems of record and systems

159
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:58,778
of transaction, so the ERPs,

160
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,048
the MES, the skate systems, for example,

161
00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:03,488
the role that those systems are going to play in the

162
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,889
operation. Now

163
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,009
as we do this again, I was, as I mentioned earlier,

164
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:11,129
I, I oftentimes get asked for what are some of the

165
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,170
best practice approaches or how do we, how

166
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,988
do we boil this down so we can think

167
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,970
comprehensively about a long term manufacturing

168
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,009
strategy that allows us to

169
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:22,048
drive modernization, but also get

170
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,329
our data in a place that we have the right foundations

171
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:26,488
for long term innovation and then start

172
00:06:26,488 --> 00:06:28,649
thinking about where we implement AI in our

173
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:29,259
processes.

174
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,949
So really we think about this in 3 layers.

175
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:34,298
The top layer we call digitally composed

176
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:35,009
outcomes.

177
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,439
So it's thinking about how do we achieve those

178
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,678
common KPIs, uh, improving

179
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:41,720
maintenance reliability, improving quality

180
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,838
yields, improving on-time delivery in

181
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:44,778
full, for example.

182
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:47,480
How can we improve those KPIs through

183
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,600
technology? But what's different now from maybe

184
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
a couple of years ago when we think of the

185
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,959
industry 4.0 type of uh

186
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,480
movement.

187
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:57,088
Is we're not just talking about those

188
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:58,750
topics in the sense of

189
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:01,410
doing computer vision for defect detection

190
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,028
or doing predictive maintenance.

191
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,819
Instead we want to think holistically about the

192
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,928
process. How do I redefine the way

193
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,309
we do maintenance management?

194
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,569
How do I redefine the way we do quality

195
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:12,129
management?

196
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:15,000
Because now we have new tools at our disposal

197
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,459
to create future state process maps

198
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,699
that are way different than the traditional way

199
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:20,838
of doing these things.

200
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:23,379
So we're gonna have a look in a minute here of how we can integrate

201
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:25,519
AI into redefining those workflows.

202
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:29,009
The second layer we call our industrial data fabric.

203
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,329
And this is really where we talk about industrial

204
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:33,629
data ops and driving contextualization

205
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:35,649
of that OT data as close to the

206
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,889
source as possible, and building the knowledge

207
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,088
graph that really becomes required for

208
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:42,170
us to have this data foundation where

209
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,129
we can innovate off of that at scale.

210
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,528
And it's building common patterns such that

211
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:48,850
when we have success in one facility, this

212
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,170
is the layer that allows us to extend that

213
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,369
success or replicate it across multiple

214
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:54,149
facilities.

215
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,189
And then the last layer is thinking about manufacturing

216
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:59,259
application modernization

217
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,720
and doing that also in mind of what is

218
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,790
the role of OT security or how do

219
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,798
we maintain OT security as we

220
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:06,850
go do this modernization

221
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,439
and actually achieve a higher security posture

222
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,579
than we might have today.

223
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,000
And so this is where we're commonly working with customers

224
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,480
now about looking at those traditional

225
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,678
applications like Escada, a historian,

226
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,009
an MES system. And how do we deploy

227
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,319
those on a modern hybrid-based architecture

228
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,619
where we're still meeting the latency and the security

229
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:25,750
requirements at the edge,

230
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:28,238
but we're achieving the cost efficiency

231
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:30,559
and the DevOps capabilities of the cloud.

232
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,178
Uh, and so 11 way to kind of then

233
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:34,599
take this one step further.

234
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,979
It's just to further simplify it, of those

235
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:38,710
three layers.

236
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,259
The top layer we want to talk about creating a

237
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,298
common user interface for integrated

238
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:44,288
workflows.

239
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,700
The reason this becomes important is

240
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,320
because today,

241
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,099
a lot of operators are interacting with multiple

242
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:52,298
systems. Think about the time it takes

243
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,590
for an operator to come up to speed on their job,

244
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,178
if they have to interact with an MES, an EAM,

245
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:59,298
a CMS, an ERP, all

246
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:01,320
these different applications on the shop floor.

247
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,158
But now with the ability of implementing AI

248
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:06,288
into these workflows, we can actually create

249
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:08,629
a common layer, a common user interface

250
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:10,879
that greatly simplifies how we

251
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,229
execute operations, and it

252
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,369
removes some of that cognitive load off of our

253
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:15,950
employees.

254
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,960
The second layer when we talk that industrial data

255
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,119
fabric, really what we want to achieve here is

256
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:23,599
building new business capabilities and

257
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:25,710
data products that allow us to,

258
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:28,320
once we have that data product, have

259
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,399
repeatability up the stack in terms of

260
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,359
the analytics

261
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,820
or the models that we build off of that data.

262
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,029
And then on the bottom layer, we talk modernize,

263
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:39,229
it's really developing a repeatable

264
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:41,389
process around how we assess

265
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:43,379
requirements of those applications,

266
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:45,788
how we mobilize the teams around

267
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:48,149
capability gaps that we might have in today's

268
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:50,418
environment, and then modernize the

269
00:09:50,418 --> 00:09:51,668
application on a hybrid architecture.

270
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:54,254
To address those capability gaps, and

271
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:56,533
we might do that application by

272
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:58,533
application, but allows us to develop a

273
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,955
repeatable process where we can accelerate

274
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,455
uh that whole transition and really build out

275
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:05,754
a long term roadmap for modernizing

276
00:10:05,894 --> 00:10:08,254
those applications across our global manufacturing

277
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:08,793
footprint.

278
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,158
Now I wanna dive a little bit deeper into building

279
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:16,239
that common user interface for integrated

280
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:17,070
workflows,

281
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,918
because what's different now, as I mentioned

282
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,960
before, is our ability to pull new tools out of

283
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,019
the toolbox to redefine

284
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:26,239
how we do work and how work gets done on the

285
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:26,940
shop floor.

286
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,479
Uh, and as you read the quote, what's important

287
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,788
to think about is not just plugging AI

288
00:10:31,788 --> 00:10:33,320
into the existing workflow.

289
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,750
Uh, that's, that's just a short term view

290
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,440
of how we might get a POC done,

291
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,070
but really doesn't help us

292
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:42,609
build lasting change and build

293
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,649
lasting competitive advantage throughout,

294
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,048
through the way we execute manufacturing and supply

295
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:48,340
chain operations.

296
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:49,950
So what we wanna do instead.

297
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,359
Is take kind of a traditional approach of

298
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:55,719
systems engineering, but look at the new AI

299
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:57,759
tools and think about this in

300
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,859
a way of AI systems engineering.

301
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,119
And we don't wanna look at these tools of automation

302
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,580
and assistance or or chatbots

303
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,779
and agents as a progression,

304
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,960
right? This is not something where we start at automation,

305
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,519
and we've set a goal that we're gonna have every

306
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,158
workflow be fully autonomous multi-agentic

307
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:16,739
systems.

308
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:18,000
These are in fact

309
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,460
different tools in the toolbox

310
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:22,779
that we're gonna pull out and use most cost

311
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,719
efficiently at the task level

312
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:27,178
for us to have an overall systems

313
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:29,178
engineering approach for how we are gonna

314
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:31,308
rearchitect the workflows or the

315
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:32,599
processes on the shop floor.

316
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,538
As we go about doing that, there's a couple of tenants

317
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:36,798
that we wanna keep in mind.

318
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:39,619
The first is we simply don't wanna automate

319
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:40,918
the existing process.

320
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,450
Uh, there was a, a senior operations leader I

321
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,908
was speaking with about a month ago

322
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,690
who said, look, the reason why we're looking at this

323
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,690
process is it's broken today and it's

324
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,729
chaotic, and the worst thing I could do

325
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:53,629
right now is automate chaos.

326
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,369
So what we really wanna do is, let's, let's

327
00:11:56,369 --> 00:11:58,609
map out the current state workflow or the current

328
00:11:58,609 --> 00:11:59,450
state process,

329
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:02,070
but we want to start with a blank sheet of paper

330
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,529
and build that future, that desired future

331
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:05,710
state process map,

332
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:07,989
and then think through there what is the right tool.

333
00:12:08,558 --> 00:12:10,580
And that brings us to the second point, which is

334
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,219
no tool rules them all.

335
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,119
So as much as we've been talking about agentic AI

336
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:15,779
this week,

337
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,340
agents are not the hammer for every nail,

338
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,038
OK? They are not going to be the most cost efficient

339
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:22,580
way to do every application.

340
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,548
Uh, it's also gonna be that we don't

341
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:27,950
necessarily need to get to lights out and fully autonomous

342
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,918
on every task.

343
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:31,239
But again, we're gonna think very strategically

344
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:33,058
about what's the right tool for the job.

345
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:36,019
And then lastly, we want to establish a new baseline

346
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:37,340
for continuous improvement.

347
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:39,500
So when I meet with customers,

348
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,250
many have a very strong culture of continuous

349
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,609
improvement, and they've done great work through Kaiser events,

350
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,158
and we don't want to lose that.

351
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,739
But we still want to make a leapfrog jump

352
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:50,849
in our capabilities and create a new

353
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:52,899
baseline from which we can drive continuous

354
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,090
improvement off of. And so that's uh

355
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,139
really kind of this, the starting point

356
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:59,570
now or this checkpoint that we have of

357
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,779
redefining workflows with this AI

358
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,000
systems engineering approach.

359
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:06,509
And we think about the framework now of, OK, well,

360
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:08,129
what tool do I use when?

361
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,029
We can map that out against a 2x2 matrix

362
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,609
of complexity and risk.

363
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:15,139
So when I build out my desired future state

364
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:17,200
workflow, I'm gonna identify all of

365
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,690
the tasks in that workflow.

366
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:21,029
And then I might say, OK, for a given tasks

367
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:23,609
that are lower risk and lower complexity,

368
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:26,168
those are ones that are going to be most cost efficient

369
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:27,469
for us to automate.

370
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,190
These are typically deterministic workflows.

371
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:32,469
They're rules-based. We can write if

372
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:33,509
then statements.

373
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:36,269
Again, the most cost-efficient way is going to be automating

374
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:37,168
those tasks.

375
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,979
The second box we might look at are tasks

376
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:43,239
that are going to continue to be done by the human.

377
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,979
So a simple example, this might be actually

378
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:47,558
doing the maintenance on the machine.

379
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,899
A human is still gonna have to turn the wrench, if

380
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,979
you will, on the machine, because an agent won't be able

381
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:52,798
to do that.

382
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,418
But I want to accomplish that task

383
00:13:55,538 --> 00:13:56,899
at lower variation,

384
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:59,178
and I want to empower the employee to

385
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:01,298
accomplish that task at a high performance

386
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,279
or according to best practice principles.

387
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,139
And so this is where I'm not necessarily gonna have a chatbot,

388
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:08,379
but I'm gonna mature that chatbot into a formal

389
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:09,330
AI assistant.

390
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:12,099
And what I want that AI assistant to do is

391
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:14,460
provide troubleshooting guidance so I can

392
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,840
perform that task at lower variation

393
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,000
and again at best practice performance.

394
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,859
And then the role that agents come in is

395
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:23,918
really twofold.

396
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:26,219
So where I have a lower risk profile

397
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:28,700
on the task is where I'm gonna delegate

398
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,979
that task to the agent.

399
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,678
I've achieved a high enough confidence interval

400
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,058
in the output of the, of the model

401
00:14:35,058 --> 00:14:37,408
or the output of what the agent is going to go do,

402
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:39,820
that I'm just going to delegate the agent to go do that

403
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,399
task

404
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,808
because it now removes it, uh, uh, as

405
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:45,058
something that I need to have a human do, and it

406
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:47,139
reduces that cognitive load on the employee.

407
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:50,269
If it's a higher pro a higher risk profile

408
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:52,428
task, I'm gonna still probably do it

409
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:54,590
through an agent or a predictive model, but

410
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm gonna put a human in the loop.

411
00:14:56,308 --> 00:14:57,288
And that's OK.

412
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,989
Again, we don't need to bring everything

413
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:02,009
to be a fully autonomous system.

414
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:04,509
But if it's higher risk, we want a human in the loop

415
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:06,509
to check the recommendation that's being

416
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:07,869
made by the predictive model,

417
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:10,428
or check what the agent wants to go do

418
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:13,009
before we give it the green light to go do that activity,

419
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:15,440
right? So this is just a simple

420
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,759
framework that helps us to think about, again,

421
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,658
we have these new tools in our toolbox.

422
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,070
How do we do this AI systems engineering where we

423
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,129
pick the right tool for the job based on

424
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:26,239
the risk profile of the task or the

425
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,320
complexity of the task,

426
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,979
such that now we have a redefined workflow

427
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:32,279
that appropriately integrates AI

428
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,658
into the way we get work done.

429
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:41,219
Now the last uh slide that I would end with,

430
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,029
it's just a little bit of a challenge,

431
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,408
that the speed at which we can accomplish this

432
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:47,529
transformation really comes down to a

433
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,489
leadership decision.

434
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So the speed at which we can encourage our

435
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,029
teams to drive continuous improvement through

436
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:55,058
AI systems engineering, the speed

437
00:15:55,058 --> 00:15:57,139
at which we can build competitive advantage

438
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,279
through integrating technology into our

439
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,349
manufacturing and supply chain processes,

440
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,599
the speed at which we can further use

441
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:05,759
technology to reduce variation, empower

442
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,918
employees, and re-optimize our

443
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:10,200
operations comes down to a leadership

444
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,379
decision and comes down to a decision

445
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,739
of really driving our teams to dive in

446
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,038
and start transforming.

447
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:18,529
And that's really my last point of encouragement

448
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,840
is the best place to start is to just

449
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,590
get started.

450
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,928
Let's pick a workflow that we can really dive

451
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:25,830
into that's begging for improvement.

452
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:28,210
Let's identify the KPI that we want

453
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,570
to improve as a result of that workflow

454
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:32,729
and really work backwards into what are the

455
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:34,729
data, what's the data requirement to

456
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:35,808
improve that KPI.

457
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,678
Uh, and then from there we can look at, OK,

458
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:41,440
what is the data strategy and the modernization

459
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,479
plan that we want to build so that we can

460
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:45,479
comprehensively go improve that

461
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:47,639
workflow across your manufacturing footprint.

462
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:51,058
And so with that, I wanna thank you for your time today.

463
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,418
Uh, if you have any questions, I'll be off to the side,

464
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
uh, after this session here. But thank you

465
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,538
for joining us at Reinvent, and I hope you have a great

466
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:58,379
rest of the afternoon.
