1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,662
- Hello and a warm, warm
welcome to our session

2
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:09,550
on modernizing Mercedes-Benz's
Global Ordering system

3
00:00:10,459 --> 00:00:15,459
with Rocket on AWS and also using GenAI.

4
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:19,050
My name is Manuel Breitfield.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,551
I'm heading the delivery
for Mercedes-Benz Germany

6
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:26,310
at Capgemini, and I'm very, very excited

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,043
to be standing here today with Christian.

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,520
- Thanks, Manuel, and a warm
welcome also from my side.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,210
I'm Christian Klemme
from Mercedes-Benz IT,

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,340
based in Stuttgart, Germany,

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,660
and happy to be here with Manuel

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,850
to make you familiar with our big project,

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,590
which we call "Go to Cloud"

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,330
because it's about the application

15
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,270
Global Ordering, in short, GO.

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,970
Together with Capgemini and more partners,

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,422
we move to the cloud from the mainframe.

18
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:59,970
I will actually start
by making you familiar

19
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,733
a little bit with the
dimensions of this application.

20
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,650
On the left-hand side of
this slide, you can see

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,370
the process that is supported
by this application.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,360
It's, if you want, the lifeline
of our sales operations

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,840
at Mercedes-Benz, and
we always visualize this

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,031
by using the letter Y
because it's the processes

25
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:24,390
that are behind.

26
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,910
If you look from the right-hand side,

27
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,920
there is all master data creation.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,450
So, this is how we set up more or less

29
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,840
our product portfolio
inside Global Ordering,

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,940
and this is where the orders come in

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,353
based on that master data.

32
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,260
From the left-hand side,
you can see what we call

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,890
Volume Planning or sales planning.

34
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,830
This is where we more or less determine

35
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,920
how many cars we want
to sell in which market,

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,283
which type of cars we want
to sell in which period.

37
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,760
Then all this data comes
together in Global Ordering,

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,320
and based on this, we do the ordering

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,710
and we also serve
production with the orders.

40
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,140
So, you can imagine, and that is stated

41
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,500
on the bottom of this
picture, each and every car

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,300
that we sell, that we produce,

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,073
goes through the system landscape.

44
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,970
This is why I actually said this is where

45
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,430
the heartbeat of the company goes.

46
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,770
To give you some numbers,
only selected ones,

47
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,509
I'm not going to read you
through the entire slide,

48
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,860
we talk about an application
that has more than

49
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,860
20,000 interfaces in all
parts of our company.

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,020
If you look at the size of the application

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,140
in terms of lines of code, we talk about

52
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,140
5 million lines of code in Java and COBOL

53
00:02:42,443 --> 00:02:46,803
and more or less the same
size in the other languages.

54
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,980
We have, yeah, a huge workload,
at least for our dimensions.

55
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,100
So, roundabout 50% of
the mainframe workload

56
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,453
is with Global Ordering.

57
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,460
Technically spoken, we
support more than 800 queues,

58
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,170
we support more than 5.1
billion messages per year,

59
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,655
and we have 450 batches running

60
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:14,220
on the mainframe application.

61
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,050
By this, we support more than
8,000 users in 150 countries.

62
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,370
So, it's quite impressive.

63
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,270
For us, it's super
important, and this is why

64
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,030
we decided not to refactor the application

65
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,030
but to go in more steps to
start with the re-platforming,

66
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,610
and this is what we want to present today.

67
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,950
So, how did we tackle this
program or this project

68
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,550
of re-platforming this
important application

69
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,870
for Mercedes-Benz?

70
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,622
You can see the steps right here.

71
00:03:47,622 --> 00:03:50,673
We started already more
than two years ago.

72
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,250
Once having the idea, then
going through the rapid

73
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,670
assessment together with the
provider Rocket Software,

74
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,160
who provides this assessment
as a standard service

75
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,980
for all applications, for
all workloads that are

76
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,473
supposed to move from the
mainframe to the cloud.

77
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,340
Having this assessment done,

78
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,065
we then looked at the results

79
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:15,990
and initiated the mitigating measures

80
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,903
for the trouble or for
the issues that we found.

81
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,410
Of course, we had to
calculate the business case,

82
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,320
which at the beginning
already showed us significant

83
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,440
cost savings compared
to what we have as cost

84
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,613
on the mainframe today.

85
00:04:30,842 --> 00:04:33,930
This is more or less also
how we initiated the entire

86
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,110
mainframe exit program that is
running now at Mercedes-Benz.

87
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,530
So, the entire company is
about to leave this platform

88
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,973
in the next couple of years.

89
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,653
How did we tackle it
from a team perspective?

90
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:51,510
In the end, we decided for Capgemini

91
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,550
to be our general contractor.

92
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,510
So, as you can imagine
and as we will show later,

93
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,100
there's a whole team and
a whole number of partners

94
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,890
that are acting together
here to make this happen.

95
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,010
But we chose for Capgemini
to be our general contractor

96
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,370
who manages for us the
relationship between

97
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,600
the other partners, namely AWS of course

98
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,462
is the provider of the cloud platform,

99
00:05:18,462 --> 00:05:21,480
but also Rocket as
being the one serving us

100
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,700
with what they call the Enterprise Server,

101
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,323
so the emulation for mainframe
workloads on the cloud.

102
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,112
And of course, we as the MMB customers,

103
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:37,020
we also are part of the game
together, IT and business,

104
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,453
which is also one of
the key success factors.

105
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,580
Then in 2025, we finally got
the go to start a project.

106
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,470
We have strong management
involvement, of course,

107
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,770
which is important top
management involvement.

108
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,980
We also applied GenAI in
first POC pilot setups,

109
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,870
but later then also for larger workloads,

110
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,520
and Manuel will be speaking about that

111
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,520
a little bit more in detail in a minute.

112
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:10,883
Also from our perspective, a clear factor

113
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:16,680
for success is that we go in stages.

114
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,860
We start with parts of the application.

115
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,773
In this case, we even start
with a stateless part,

116
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:26,040
with some stateless
services which are part

117
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,190
of the application, to make
sure that we can really

118
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,230
run this in parallel on the old platform

119
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,640
and the new platform to be sure

120
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,640
that the new implementation
on the cloud serves

121
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,120
to the same levels of service
as the old application.

122
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:50,763
For 2026, we have still a way to go.

123
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,726
We will then migrate the
full-size application,

124
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:59,182
have to cancel all our legacy contracts,

125
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:01,770
also make sure that the
business case really is

126
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,280
implemented and realized
and the savings really come,

127
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,160
and of course, set up the
future mode of operations

128
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,650
on the new platform with the new partners

129
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,540
and finally fully dismantle the mainframe,

130
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,790
which is super important
in terms of getting

131
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,233
really rid of the cost.

132
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,850
Another key success factor is what we call

133
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,070
the Global Ordering Facade.

134
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,023
What do we mean with the facade?

135
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,410
That's also based on a standard product

136
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,330
that we buy from MuleSoft.

137
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,500
It's a gateway which allows
you to direct the workload

138
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,500
that comes from our web clients to either

139
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,500
the cloud backend or
the mainframe backend,

140
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,500
which is of course a very handy feature

141
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,453
in terms of testing, but also allows you

142
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:55,620
a very quick way back in terms of trouble.

143
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,920
And of course, that's
the most important part,

144
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:03,780
prevents all your consumers
from doing huge changes

145
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,980
when interacting with you.

146
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,990
They simply have to call another URL

147
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,600
but will not be impacted by
what we do in the background

148
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,760
when migrating the application.

149
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,460
So, this is how we believe we can migrate

150
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,880
this huge application
with the highest speed

151
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,960
at the lowest risk, also fully integrated

152
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,363
in the existing Mercedes-Benz landscape,

153
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,020
being then ready for the future

154
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,805
from a technology
perspective, but still having

155
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:40,200
all options open in terms of modernizing

156
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,510
the application towards a more modern

157
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,313
and cloud-native structure.

158
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,600
One more thing that is
important in our project

159
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,610
is the platform that we move to.

160
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,260
It's not an AWS native landing
zone that we are going at.

161
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,580
We have mentioned Rocket

162
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,253
as one of the software
providers many times now.

163
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,070
Rocket Software and their product,

164
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,690
the Enterprise Server, is more or less

165
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,270
the landing zone that we need to emulate

166
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,400
the mainframe on the cloud.

167
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,120
This landing zone is fully managed by AWS,

168
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,860
so not something that we have to manage

169
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,630
from Mercedes-Benz or Germany side,

170
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,280
but we just buy this
as a service from AWS.

171
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,490
But more than that, Rocket
is only the mainframe part.

172
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,120
We also have a Java stack on the cloud.

173
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,105
We have some services
for batch processing,

174
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:37,950
but also of course for database services.

175
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,080
Messaging is an important part.

176
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,170
Then all the things that
you need on top, of course,

177
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,530
like monitoring, financials, and so on.

178
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,953
The storage part is all
combined in this landing zone,

179
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,810
or this platform which we
call the Helios platform.

180
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,530
It's a Mercedes-Benz internal
product that combines

181
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,920
some of IAM services that
we need on top, of course,

182
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,720
with the standard services that you find

183
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,330
on that landscape that I have just shown.

184
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:11,330
So, that's about all, but
most important not to mention,

185
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:15,930
last but not least, is the partnership

186
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,140
that we have set up to make
this program successful.

187
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,360
Starting of course with us as the customer

188
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,063
who are the ones who want
to realize this project,

189
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,230
but moreover than the
general contract that we have

190
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,652
is Capgemini supported
by the two main partners:

191
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:36,150
AWS as the cloud platform
provider and Rocket

192
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,720
as being the inventor of
the Enterprise Server,

193
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,143
the emulation of the
mainframe in the cloud.

194
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,950
With this, I'm happy
to hand over to Manuel,

195
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,330
who will make you familiar a little bit

196
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,090
with the GenAI part of the story,

197
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,740
which is of course the most exciting one.

198
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,392
So, let's go ahead, Manuel.

199
00:10:55,392 --> 00:10:57,753
- Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Christian.

200
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,843
Before we come to the GenAI topic,

201
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,970
maybe let me walk you
backwards a little bit.

202
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,210
If you're familiar with the
topic of legacy modernization,

203
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,150
you might know those phases.

204
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:17,100
So, typically when we go
into mainframe modernization,

205
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,100
we look into four phases,
and with those four phases,

206
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:27,856
we try to find the best solution
for that specific problem.

207
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,410
So, typically you want to
start with the assess phase

208
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,230
where you look into the whole landscape.

209
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,560
Now with Mercedes-Benz
for Global Ordering,

210
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,100
we've also done that, but
also Capgemini is doing that

211
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,960
application for over 25 years.

212
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,810
So, we kind of knew
already what's at stake.

213
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,190
We kind of knew the application,

214
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,360
we kind of knew how it's
integrated into the landscape.

215
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,450
Christian said it's about
huge, huge interfaces

216
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,950
that we have to deal with.

217
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,323
So we knew that if we don't know it,

218
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,730
we help ourselves with tools.

219
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,370
CAP360 is one of them.

220
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,900
BREAD is another one that is also using AI

221
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,320
to determine how the
application structure looks like

222
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,610
and how interfaces look like.

223
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,005
As soon as this is clear

224
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,990
and as soon also the client is clear

225
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,880
on what the strategy is,

226
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,800
Christian mentioned for Global Ordering

227
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,190
we've chosen the
re-platforming or rehosting,

228
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,920
some call it re-platform,
some call it re-hosting,

229
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,840
so basically kind of an emulation

230
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,290
on the mainframe with Rocket.

231
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,370
As soon as you have that, you decide,

232
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,650
okay, this is our strategy.

233
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,290
You see the "6 Rs", some have five,

234
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,200
some have seven, here it's six.

235
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,900
Basically, what is your
migration strategy?

236
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,980
For Global Ordering,

237
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,360
we've chosen to go with a
re-platforming approach.

238
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,360
We wanted to keep the application
as untouched as possible

239
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,910
and also be sure that, kind
of the interfaces we have,

240
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,430
we have a good way to deal with that.

241
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,068
But also, and this is where I'm coming in

242
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:14,070
with regards to AI, at the very beginning,

243
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,168
we already knew there might be some cases

244
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:21,270
where we want to go refactor

245
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,970
because at the same time Mercedes-Benz

246
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,030
is doing their Sales Operations,

247
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,760
is refactoring parts of that already.

248
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,120
So, it does make sense from
a business case perspective

249
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,120
to look into Global Ordering at once

250
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,790
but also see if there were some slices

251
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,120
that would make sense to refactor them.

252
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,503
So, that was the idea.

253
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,360
When we went into the
migrate and modernize part,

254
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,081
we actually identified the
parts where we felt like

255
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:56,081
those would be good
elements to refactor them.

256
00:13:57,261 --> 00:14:00,030
GenAI is mentioned in the bottom,

257
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,640
I come to that shortly.

258
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,640
And obviously, not to
forget operate and optimize.

259
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,544
We are not at that stage yet,

260
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:15,277
but we are just starting to
have first services available

261
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:18,870
where we learn how to operate
and how to optimize them.

262
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,633
But definitely a big,
big part of the story.

263
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,550
If we look into the AI and
GenAI effects of those phases,

264
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,940
those are the elements
that we at Capgemini use.

265
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,020
So for the assessment, I've
mentioned that earlier,

266
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,070
we use a couple of tools
that help us identify

267
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,984
what is the inventory, how
does the code look like,

268
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:48,390
and also what is business cases,

269
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,280
what are business rules that are being

270
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,050
included in the application.

271
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,430
This is where we use BREAD, CAP360,

272
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,249
or also Gen Insights,
tools that just help us

273
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:04,443
to get a bit of an idea
on the application.

274
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,820
The other part is Agentic
AI refactoring, and I mean,

275
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,890
if you listened to some
of the sessions today

276
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,420
and probably also coming this week,

277
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,490
that's a big, big story.

278
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,140
It's also a big story here.

279
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,140
So with GenAI, which I will
come to later in the talk,

280
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,290
we have a multi-agent
setup based on agentic AI

281
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:35,431
that does transform legacy
code into the new world.

282
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,590
Obviously, we also use coding assistance.

283
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,170
So all developers, and
we've heard in the keynote

284
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,030
as well, like all developers,

285
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,060
happy to use some assistance while coding.

286
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,503
This is also true here.

287
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,010
And then when it comes to testing,

288
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,430
we also have tools that help us identify

289
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,993
was the test successful or is
there an error in the testing?

290
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,503
But as I said, I want to come to GenAI,

291
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,800
and this is what we have been implementing

292
00:16:06,827 --> 00:16:11,670
basically this year
within Global Ordering,

293
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,670
and the headline states
kind of the key message:

294
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,330
We don't just use AI;
we want to combine it

295
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,510
with our expertise and our strength.

296
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,090
So on the left-hand side of the picture,

297
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,900
you see this is what our
team currently still does

298
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,960
and where I believe it's fully
essential that they do it.

299
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,490
So it's about having an
analysis of the application,

300
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,960
knowing what do I
actually want to refactor;

301
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,983
I need to know it.

302
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,960
Also providing documents:
what are the documents

303
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,460
that are helpful for the AI

304
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,890
to be able to transform the code, right?

305
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:00,030
It's not only the code, it's
also documentation that exists,

306
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,370
it's test cases that might exist.

307
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,350
So all the things that you have

308
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,550
that do help the AI to better transform,

309
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,160
that's helpful and you need to provide it,

310
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,830
and obviously, you need
to specify what to do.

311
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,590
Like in this case, it's we want to migrate

312
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:21,090
from COBOL to Java, so I need to tell,

313
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,813
I need to learn, I need to
train the AI how it's done.

314
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,420
To be able to do so in GenAI,
we call it "cookbooks."

315
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,857
I need to explain, I need to say like,

316
00:17:32,857 --> 00:17:36,570
"Look, this is how you
would typically transform

317
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,750
that module into that part in Java"

318
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,360
to give the AI kind of a feeling

319
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,133
on what's right and what's wrong.

320
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,360
And GenAI then in turn has,

321
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,090
it's similar like a
software engineering team.

322
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,210
You have the agent being
the software engineer,

323
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,450
you have the agent being
the software reviewer,

324
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,000
you have the tester, you
have the DevOps engineer,

325
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,087
and actually, you really have
roles you assign to the AI.

326
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,390
"Look, you are the agent,
you are the engineer,"

327
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,850
and that agent does software engineering.

328
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,020
It doesn't do testing

329
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,420
because there's a different role for that.

330
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:20,154
So what they do, they
kind of build a software

331
00:18:20,154 --> 00:18:25,154
engineering team that is
then orchestrated by a human.

332
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:28,743
This is kind of the basis,

333
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,030
and while it might look
like theory on paper,

334
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,700
it's actually already on production

335
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,520
and has been able to transform

336
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,923
quite a number of code for Mercedes-Benz.

337
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,530
Now, looking into that specific case,

338
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,680
so I called it, we within Go to Cloud,

339
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,407
within the application at Mercedes-Benz,

340
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:57,840
there is one service
called Pricing Service

341
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,560
consisting of 1.3 million lines of code,

342
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,173
1.3 million lines of COBOL code.

343
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,164
What you see on that slide,

344
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:11,310
I mean it's kind of
the rough architecture,

345
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,290
is running on the mainframe.

346
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,780
It is split between a Java part

347
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,570
which is running on IBM WebSphere

348
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,783
and a COBOL part which is on IBM CICS,

349
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,500
both parts accessing the same database

350
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,263
and Java calling COBOL as well.

351
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,663
This is what we have today,

352
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,710
and what we've decided is

353
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,740
we want to migrate the
COBOL part into Java

354
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,933
and have just one application after that.

355
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,180
So the outcome, you see
it on the right-hand side,

356
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,270
is Christian mentioned the GO Facade.

357
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,120
This is kind of the layer sitting on top.

358
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,120
This is where all calls go
in, this is where we can check

359
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,490
is it a successful test
case or is it unsuccessful.

360
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,210
This is where we can
also route certain calls.

361
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,630
So, should that call already
go on the new Java part

362
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,610
or should it stay on the mainframe?

363
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,060
This is kind of the tooling
that allows us to do testing

364
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,730
that allows us also to
control the go-live.

365
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,710
And also what Christian mentioned earlier,

366
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,860
it allows us to minimize changes

367
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,660
with all neighboring systems.

368
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,270
They should not do a lot of changes.

369
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,313
In fact, they only change the URL.

370
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,120
And then in yellow, you
see the new Java stack.

371
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,040
So everything which is on the two boxes

372
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,930
on the left-hand side,
we have the COBOL part,

373
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,130
we have the Java part,

374
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:49,130
everything is now moved
into Java with GenAI,

375
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:51,780
and there was still one problem.

376
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,030
Like, the COBOL part and the Java part,

377
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,120
they have been accessing
the same database,

378
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,300
and it's a Pricing Service,

379
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,520
but in fact, it's also part

380
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,400
of the whole Global Ordering system.

381
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,730
So the data in that specific case

382
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,133
is still existing on the mainframe.

383
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:17,210
So, what we've used is
Precisely as a tool.

384
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,230
Precisely is able to basically
sync data, lots of data,

385
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,240
basically in real-time.

386
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,540
So what we are doing is, to
be able to have that data

387
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,520
accessible on the new service,

388
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,520
we use Precisely to always
sync that data in real-time.

389
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:40,321
With that, we not only
have the new service

390
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:44,550
more in your new target language,

391
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,710
we have been able to
reduce mainframe costs

392
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,730
at the same time and have also been able

393
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,730
to actually increase the speed
for the neighboring systems.

394
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,190
So that's the core concept.

395
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,710
I've talked a bit on the story already,

396
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,013
but I just also want to
walk you through that again.

397
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,183
I feel like nowadays when
people talk about GenAI,

398
00:22:10,968 --> 00:22:14,883
I think it's always better if
you show how it actually went.

399
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,724
It all started with a problem,

400
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:22,950
I think beginning of the year,

401
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,820
that that Pricing Service
that was on the mainframe

402
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,820
was not capable of executing as many calls

403
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:37,470
as Mercedes-Benz would
need for modernizing parts

404
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,090
of their new system.

405
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,413
So the problem was what to do?

406
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,940
Should we up the mainframe infrastructure

407
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,470
and try to just make it bigger

408
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,430
to be able to handle those calls,

409
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:58,413
or the other solution was try GenAI.

410
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,090
In fact, it was kind of trying GenAI,

411
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,383
not fully knowing if it would succeed.

412
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,683
So that was beginning of February,

413
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,810
but we decided, okay, let's try that,

414
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,320
knowing that the number of lines of code

415
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,383
with the 1.3 million is quite a challenge.

416
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,210
But in March, if we look back,
there was actually already

417
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,540
the first commit into
the GitHub repository,

418
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,270
and not too much later in May,

419
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,183
we had the first version
which was deployable.

420
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,160
So really in a very, very
short time, we were able

421
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,300
to transform the 1.3 million lines of code

422
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,540
into a Java application.

423
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,927
And just recently, because so
many people are asking now,

424
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:55,500
"How does that code look like?

425
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,930
Are you able to maintain it?",

426
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,570
just recently we've looked into the code,

427
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,210
and you're not able to distinguish

428
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,570
is that code written by a human

429
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,693
or is it the AI that has written that.

430
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,650
Also, to be frank, there are some parts,

431
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,550
and you see it in the
additional performance tuning,

432
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:21,990
there are some parts that
we did adjust manually.

433
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,890
So especially coming from
legacy, coming from the mainframe

434
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,890
where in this case database
access is just very, very quick

435
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:35,820
and everything is in memory, obviously,

436
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,780
that's not the case on AWS,
and it shouldn't be like that.

437
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,500
So there are parts that you need to tune

438
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,510
and that the AI in this stage

439
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,940
does not know that it should be tuned.

440
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,650
So what we did is we looked
into all the database accesses

441
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,160
and this is where we've
done some fine-tuning

442
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,943
to be able to max out the
speed that we needed to do.

443
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,230
Also, all the infrastructure setup,

444
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,780
mainframe now is running on AWS,

445
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,080
and the Precisely data
sync also fully functional,

446
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,080
then in September, and not long ago,

447
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,080
I think almost one month,
one and a half months back,

448
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:23,070
there was a big, big
go-live for Mercedes-Benz

449
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,940
of that whole system.

450
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,120
The Pricing Service is a part of that

451
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,160
and went live successfully.

452
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Actually, is faster than before
with that GenAI use case.

453
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,160
Now, having that in mind and
also having that success story

454
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,330
checked, we are currently evaluating

455
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,840
together with Mercedes-Benz
what are other parts

456
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,560
where we feel like we will
find a similar success story,

457
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,270
where parts where we feel like, okay,

458
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,613
we don't want to just refactor,

459
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:02,280
we don't want to just rehost;

460
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,777
we want to refactor

461
00:26:03,777 --> 00:26:06,423
and we want to use the benefits of GenAI.

462
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,050
So summing that story up,

463
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,020
it's 1.3 million lines of COBOL code.

464
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,670
It's also 500 megabytes
of database records

465
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,940
that are kept in sync in real-time.

466
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,333
So it's really, really a big achievement.

467
00:26:25,624 --> 00:26:30,090
Now, one last thing that I want to come to

468
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:35,090
is the facade or integration
layer that we also call it.

469
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:41,630
Was now in production and
was really a key element

470
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,920
to be able to test the whole service

471
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,460
but also to be able to bring it live.

472
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,460
So while we did the QA
phase, the testing phase,

473
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,760
the UAT phase, we were always able

474
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,760
to use the integration layer
and route calls to mainframe,

475
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,203
but also route calls to Java,

476
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,280
and because Precisely was still
taking care of the database,

477
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,770
so it was really clear
like for both worlds

478
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,500
you should get the exact same result.

479
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,390
So this is what we did in testing.

480
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,550
We've monitored all calls

481
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,340
and we've actually looked
into the integration layer

482
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,590
and it was a simple check,

483
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,440
like the result that you
get from both systems

484
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,853
should be the same, right?

485
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:39,138
This reduced the testing effort enormously

486
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,690
because it was not only
able to check it manually,

487
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,630
we were also able to test with real data.

488
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,210
It was not like someone who needed

489
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,240
to sit and test certain systems.

490
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,480
We were able to use and capture real data

491
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,170
and just run it against the two systems

492
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:03,170
and then be able to go into
production with a good check.

493
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:08,373
It turned out well also in production.

494
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,980
As soon as we went live,

495
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,780
we were also able to
test both of the systems

496
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,013
and were able to compare
all of those results.

497
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,170
Moreover, it's not only a
functionality that we use

498
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,410
and that I think you
should use in the system

499
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,930
to compare results.

500
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,570
It's also something where you can monitor

501
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,312
what is your latency,
what is your throughput,

502
00:28:36,312 --> 00:28:38,607
how is speed looking?

503
00:28:38,607 --> 00:28:42,270
Are you achieving against SLAs or not?

504
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:46,642
Like all those NFRs
that you certainly have

505
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,480
in your applications.

506
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,670
You can also check that
if you have something

507
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:54,453
like an integration layer,
something like a facade.

508
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,240
And what is written on the
right in the outcome section:

509
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,690
Control cut-over, we've said that already,

510
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,090
like you can control the systems,

511
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,650
when should they change?

512
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,520
And then it's your decision to turn over;

513
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,540
is not their decision.

514
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,430
You can control it.

515
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,100
You have your automated quality assurance

516
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,010
because you are actually
doing all the tests

517
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,120
with the facade.

518
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,080
In this specific case,
obviously all of us very proud,

519
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,410
we actually didn't have
any incident on go-live

520
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:32,893
for such a big system which
again was migrated with AI.

521
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:39,381
And lastly on that screenshot, yeah,

522
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:41,643
the colors are visible here too.

523
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,760
You see what the result is:

524
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,720
yellow is the mainframe system
that was running before,

525
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,530
the Pricing Service on the
mainframe system in COBOL.

526
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,770
Green is the one in Java.

527
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,540
And you see it has been
running in parallel

528
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,373
for quite a while.

529
00:29:58,373 --> 00:30:00,123
It's just a testing that I've said,

530
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,630
and then at a certain point in time,

531
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,330
we were able to just cut
it off as we've seen it.

532
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:11,330
The performance is just better
all the way, and even spikes,

533
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,290
you can handle it much
better on AWS obviously

534
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,136
than you would be able to handle it

535
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:19,713
on a mainframe system.

536
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,980
Yeah, and with that,

537
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,583
we are done with the
presentation for today.

538
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,600
We would be very happy to
answer a couple of questions

539
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,530
if you have them.

540
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,130
We stand right by and
happy you listened here,

541
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,773
and see you then, thank you very much.
