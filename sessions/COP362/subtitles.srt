1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,900
- Got awful quiet in here all of a sudden.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,010
I'm Bill, product manager
for AWS DevOps Agent.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,100
I'm gonna be joined here
on stage later by David,

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,850
who's a senior principal
engineer here at AWS.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,760
And a little bit about
David before I start,

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,920
before he comes on a little bit later.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,460
David's been part of the teams
that have built AWS services

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,970
like DynamoDB, Lambda, IoT, CloudWatch.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,650
He's also as a senior principal engineer

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,000
and been at Amazon for
nearly 20 years now.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,470
Been one of the people
that's really shaped

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,430
the DevOps culture at Amazon and AWS,

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,160
so he publishes weekly inside of AWS

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,220
to all of our AWS and Amazon builders,

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,277
a blog called, "This
Week in Observability."

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,510
He's also been a primary
contributor to something

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,870
called the Amazon or AWS Builder Library.

18
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,690
Is anybody familiar with the
Builder Library out there?

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,040
A few of you.

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,110
So that's where we publish in-depth pieces

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,250
on how Amazon approaches
building and operating software.

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,170
And I checked last night, David.

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,330
David's authored 11 of those articles.

24
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,940
I think he's the most
prolific author on that site.

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,853
So I do encourage you to look at those.

26
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,500
A lot of really interesting
and helpful information there.

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,680
And so I say all of that
because we've been really lucky

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,480
to have David be part of the team

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,450
that's helped us build
the AWS DevOps Agent

30
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,360
over the past year, so his
fingerprints are all over it.

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,610
A lot of the culture, the
DevOps culture that he's tried

32
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,840
to infuse into the AWS
and Amazon development

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,570
and operations teams has been poured

34
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,393
into the DevOps Agent itself.

35
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:48,240
And so the other thing
I wanted to say, I said,

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,840
David's a senior principal
engineer and at Amazon.

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,180
Some of you might be
wondering what is that?

38
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,690
What does a senior principal
engineer at Amazon really do?

39
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,720
And it's actually, it's
kind of a big deal,

40
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,170
but like what's the day
in the life of David?

41
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,390
And so if you were one of those people,

42
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,180
hopefully there's a few of
you that had that question.

43
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,120
We got some undercover
footage of a day in the life

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,373
of David from a couple of weeks ago.

45
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,300
So let's take a look at this.

46
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,133
So there he is.

47
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:20,547
So turns out that the first thing

48
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:24,663
you need to know about a
senior principal engineer

49
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,030
is they still get paged and
they still have to scramble.

50
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,260
They have to get back to their office,

51
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,220
they have to drop everything,

52
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,900
they have to get their laptop out,

53
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,690
get their favorite playlist
going to help them, you know,

54
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,120
work through this
troubleshooting scenario.

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,470
But what's new about this case

56
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,110
or what's new about this week,
is David has a new teammate.

57
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,900
He has the AWS DevOps Agent to help him.

58
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,850
So he is, first thing
he does is he checks in

59
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,930
and before he got his laptop
out, metrics, analytics, logs,

60
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,490
traces analyzed, check for, you know,

61
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,700
deployments that may have
impacted this situation,

62
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,030
already found root cause identified.

63
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,770
It's all before David got his laptop open.

64
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,750
So let's see what else it can do.

65
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,380
Can it help us get out
of this alarm state,

66
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,430
resolve this incident?

67
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,090
So sure enough, following
has been clearly reading

68
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,310
David's blog about this
week in observability.

69
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,070
So it knows how to generate an effective,

70
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,400
what we call an MCM or a change document

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,130
that's gonna include pre-validation steps,

72
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,860
action steps, post-action steps.

73
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,020
And then you'll see here

74
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,690
that it's actually even
showing off a little bit.

75
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,090
The agent is providing
David with code to go ahead

76
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,320
and actually fix what was in
this case a bad deployment,

77
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,760
the code itself.

78
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,260
So the last thing to do here

79
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,500
is to actually perform the rollback

80
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,720
as instructed and fix the issue.

81
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,350
So fingers crossed, we'll
check the validation steps.

82
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,613
The errors are going to,
wait for it, go away.

83
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,030
Alright, and so we should have

84
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,150
a happy senior principal engineer.

85
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,120
So that's just a little
bit of insight into David,

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,330
but also really what the
AWS DevOps Agent does.

87
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,030
And so we launched AWS DevOps Agent

88
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,450
in public preview yesterday.

89
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,460
And let me ask, who here in the audience

90
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,950
has ever been on call, carried a pager,

91
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,620
been on the other side of that page?

92
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,453
Is that it?

93
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:24,693
Really only about half of you?

94
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,500
Okay, one other question
just outta my curiosity.

95
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,923
Is anybody here actually
on on-call right now?

96
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,820
Okay, well, we've got a couple
of dozen of you so you know,

97
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,730
if you get up and run out,
I won't take it personally.

98
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,120
So what does the AWS DevOps Agent do?

99
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,430
So it performs two fundamental tasks.

100
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,230
So the first I just showed you.

101
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,990
Helps you resolve incidents faster.

102
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,540
It's gonna analyze your
metrics, analytics logs

103
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,820
as traces that are related
to a particular incident.

104
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,950
Look for related deployments.

105
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,260
It's going to share with you its findings,

106
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,600
it's gonna generate a root
cause and it's gonna provide you

107
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,300
with mitigation steps
to resolve the issue.

108
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,993
So all with the goal of
helping you reduce MTTR.

109
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,470
The second thing, what you
didn't see in that video

110
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,590
is the agent is always
there, it's always available,

111
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,720
it's always sort of
lurking in the background,

112
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,390
and it's designed also to
help you prevent incidents

113
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,830
before they happen.

114
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,480
So it does that in a couple of ways.

115
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,040
But you know, what is able to do

116
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,019
is it will periodically
scan all of the incidents

117
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:29,820
that have been investigated
and managed by the agent.

118
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,590
It's gonna take its
understanding of things

119
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,130
like AWS best practices or well
architected best practices.

120
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,580
It's understanding of your
application environment,

121
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,530
and this is gonna suggest changes.

122
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,120
Changes to fix what it detects

123
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,680
is maybe under underlying problems

124
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,850
that created the context for
a particular set of incidents

125
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,510
or other opportunities it sees to improve

126
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,120
the posture of your application.

127
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,280
So how does it work?

128
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,260
Four things that I wanna highlight about

129
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,040
how the AWS DevOps Agent works.

130
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,290
So the first is that we've designed it

131
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,960
to operate as a member of your team.

132
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,310
If you saw the keynote yesterday,

133
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,500
Matt Garmin talked about frontier agents

134
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
and an aspect of a frontier agent

135
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,930
is it can work autonomously
as part of your team.

136
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,360
And so in this case, what
it can do is it can respond

137
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,090
just like an on-call
engineer would respond

138
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,550
to support tickets, pages, alarms

139
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,640
that you configured to trigger the agent

140
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,630
to perform an investigation
of a particular incident.

141
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,920
It can then write its findings,
communicate its findings

142
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,690
back into say the comment
in a ServiceNow ticket.

143
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,690
It can also, you know, if you're
using something like Slack

144
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,610
for your team to coordinate
during an incident,

145
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,880
it'll provide just as
any other engineer would,

146
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,690
its findings back into
the Slack channel itself.

147
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,000
We've also designed the
agent to not just work

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,430
with the people on your team.

149
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,780
And I'll talk about this

150
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,880
in a little bit more depth in a moment.

151
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,570
We've also designed it as an
agent to work with other agents

152
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,023
that you may be deploying
in your environment as well.

153
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,000
The second characteristic
of the DevOps Agent

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,520
that I wanna share with
you is we've designed it

155
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,750
to be a telemetry expert.

156
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,230
So we've built in integrations
with not just AWS CloudWatch

157
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,870
and telemetry that AWS provides,

158
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,470
but with our launch partners,
Dynatrace, Datadog, New Relic,

159
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,070
and Splunk, we've given
it access to the telemetry

160
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,860
and the telemetry signals
that you all have told us

161
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,870
that you you use and you all have told us

162
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,150
that you use other things too.

163
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,850
And a very common thing we've
heard is open source stacks

164
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,270
with Grafana, Prometheus,
something like Loki for example.

165
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,770
And so we give you a way to tie

166
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,770
into those self-hosted telemetry systems

167
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,080
or really any other
telemetry that you may have

168
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,450
through something that we call BYO

169
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,703
or bring your own MCP server.

170
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,810
And so with that in place, you know,

171
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,570
what it gives the agent the ability to do

172
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,360
is what you saw in that
video, which is rapidly

173
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,980
and quickly scan through the important

174
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,590
or related logs, metrics,
alarms and traces

175
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,900
that you have in your infrastructure.

176
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,600
But because it has access and
because it's also oriented

177
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,880
to prevent future incidents,

178
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,620
it will provide you with recommendations

179
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,230
on how to improve your
observability postures.

180
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,440
So that might be adding what it receives

181
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,880
to be missing metrics or perhaps tuning

182
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,613
what might be flapping
alarms, those kinds of things.

183
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,290
So the third characteristic
of the AWS DevOps Agent

184
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,900
that I wanted to highlight
is we've worked very hard

185
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,760
to make it what we think
of as a pipeline pro.

186
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,020
So often it's the case that
when an incident happens,

187
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,390
as a result of some kind of change.

188
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,440
It might be a change to
the application code,

189
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,320
it could be a change to
the infrastructure code.

190
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,230
And so we've given it access
through built-in integrations

191
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,970
to things like GitHub and GitLab

192
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,743
so it can understand
your deployment pipelines

193
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:59,010
and the repos that sit
behind those pipelines

194
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,840
so it can detect these changes.

195
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,000
And again, it's got this dual personality

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,010
of being able to react to incidents

197
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,420
but then also provide guidance

198
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,220
on how to prevent future incidents.

199
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,950
So in this case may make suggestions

200
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,768
to improve your pipelines
themselves, perhaps to add tests

201
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:18,330
or other things that will
help you prevent incidents

202
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,343
to begin with before they happen.

203
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,520
Fourth characteristic, and the last one

204
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,570
that I want to talk about

205
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,390
is it was important for us to be able

206
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,670
to construct this agent
so that it really knows

207
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,640
your apps and your organization.

208
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,980
So knowing your apps.

209
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,210
So what it will do is it'll
automatically generate

210
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,130
what we call an application topology.

211
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,020
You can think of it as a knowledge graph

212
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,050
or a map of your application
and your environment.

213
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,460
What are the important entities?

214
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,830
What are their relationships
with each other?

215
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,550
That'll help guide the agent
as it's performing its tasks.

216
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,960
The other thing that we recognize

217
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,910
is that there's some things
that are going to be unique

218
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,790
about your organization, your practice.

219
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,160
So you can provide those
to the agent in the form

220
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,610
of two things, what we
call steering files,

221
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,020
or you might think of them as runbooks

222
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,290
that you can directly provide
to the agents that you create.

223
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,270
You can also give the agents access

224
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,120
to existing runbooks that you may have.

225
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,300
So these might be coming out
of your ticketing system.

226
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,400
Or for example, we have customers

227
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,960
who told us they've maintained the runbook

228
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,730
in something like Confluence.

229
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,830
And if that's something they
wanna actually see in action,

230
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,260
I understand that the
Atlassian booth at five o'clock

231
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,920
they're gonna show you how
to connect AWS DevOps Agent

232
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,490
through the Atlassian
MCP server into a tool

233
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,210
that'll give the agent access
to the Confluence runbooks.

234
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,350
So having said all of that,
the one thing we've also

235
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:48,350
sort of acknowledged is that
it's important, you know,

236
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,340
to know that some point there's a limit

237
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,380
to what the agent can do.

238
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,360
And so that's where we
give you the ability

239
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,640
to bring in an expert, a human expert.

240
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,150
And so at any point, for
example, during an investigation

241
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,200
that the AWS DevOps Agent
is, you know, in the process

242
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,720
of completing as it's working
through findings, plan,

243
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,250
you know, the hypothesis
generating root cause analysis

244
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,140
or mitigation plans, if you wanna have

245
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,720
an expert's human set of eyes,

246
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,960
one click, you can pull
an AWS support engineer

247
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,220
into an investigation.

248
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,230
They'll be provided with
all the context stuff

249
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,870
up to that date, and
you can be in chatting

250
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,310
with not just the agent but
also an AWS support engineer

251
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,140
to help you refine the root cause

252
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,783
or basically maybe
validate mitigation steps.

253
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,070
So I talked about topology,
I wanted to double click

254
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,743
on that just for a second here.

255
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,640
This is a picture of what
an application topology

256
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,560
looks like in the AWS DevOps
Agent web application.

257
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,140
So what is it?

258
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,880
So, you know, how this is created.

259
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,840
It starts from the ground up.

260
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,290
When you set up your AWS DevOps Agent,

261
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,850
you create what's called an agent space.

262
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,100
And within that agent
space, you give it access

263
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,070
to one or multiple cloud accounts.

264
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,860
And we'll start discovering the resources

265
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,620
that you've given us
access to through IM roles

266
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,990
and the relationships with each other.

267
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,490
The agent will then start to,

268
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,930
will continue to maintain that.

269
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,270
We'll look for additional relationships.

270
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,490
If you've given it access
to a telemetry source,

271
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,560
it'll bring in their service maps.

272
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,570
It'll map like say log groups, metrics,

273
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,880
alarms into entities in your topology.

274
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,000
If you've given it access
to your CICD pipelines,

275
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
it'll map deployments into entities.

276
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,180
So it builds up this structure

277
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,840
or this map of your architecture
that helps it, you know,

278
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,190
during an incident, narrow in
and refine, say log queries

279
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,040
or metric queries that it needs to do

280
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:47,760
to determine what's going
on in a particular incident.

281
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,590
It'll also use this application map

282
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,500
and compare it to
patterns, say for example,

283
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,160
in AWS best practices
patterns that it knows

284
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,460
are well architected principles
as well as any guidance

285
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,530
that you've given it
through the steering files

286
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,780
for your own guidelines and policies.

287
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,520
And it'll look for deviations from that

288
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,570
and use that form part
of its recommendations

289
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,003
or what I called earlier the
prevention recommendations.

290
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,510
So last thing I want to
talk about is, you know,

291
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,900
how this is, you know,
the success that customers

292
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,740
have had with the AWS
DevOps Agents so far,

293
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,420
and then I'm gonna turn it over to David

294
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,553
to demo the solution to you.

295
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,130
But the first thing I wanna
say, you're probably wondering,

296
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,240
we released it yesterday,

297
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,400
how could I have customer
examples of this?

298
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,490
But we actually started back in August,

299
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,970
we gave a AWS DevOps
Agent, we made it available

300
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,090
to internal Amazon and AWS teams

301
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,950
to use in their on-call rotations

302
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,420
to help them improve the posture

303
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,120
of their applications and services.

304
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,600
And so far today the AWS DevOps Agent

305
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,070
internally has handled over
a thousand real live Amazon

306
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,150
and AWS, you know, application
and service team incidents.

307
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,040
And we carefully track each of those.

308
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,070
We work those manually with the teams

309
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,250
that have the actual on calls
that have been responding

310
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,450
to those incidents.

311
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,390
And we've determined that
the AWS DevOps Agent to date

312
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,450
has been able to achieve
an 86% success rate

313
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,640
on its root cause analyses.

314
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,437
So two things about that,
86%, it's a B, right?

315
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:25,005
And so, you know, we're
certainly after an A here,

316
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:25,920
and so we are continuing to work

317
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,260
on improving this every day.

318
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,900
But one thing that you
know, was pointed out to me

319
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,320
by some of our customers is
that don't beat yourself up

320
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,350
too much over that 14%
because even when the agent

321
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,010
is getting it wrong or
maybe has an incomplete RCA,

322
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,530
it's gone down pathways, right,

323
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,130
and shown its work in
terms of the log analysis

324
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,960
that it may have done
or the metric analysis

325
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,160
that it may have done.

326
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,010
And those are pathways
that I would've gone down,

327
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,920
dead ends that I as an on-call
engineer would've gone down,

328
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,840
and so you saved me a lot of time

329
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,990
even if in the end you
didn't get it right.

330
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,810
So a couple of other examples here.

331
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,890
So we did open it up then in September

332
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,480
to external beta customers.

333
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,960
One of the first customers
that we made it available to

334
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,750
was the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

335
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,020
And the first thing they
did, they got it set up

336
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,400
and they said, let's
give it something tricky.

337
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,100
Like they said, we had a network outage

338
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,290
a couple of days ago,
or not a network outage,

339
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,980
a network incident of
some type that took them

340
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,370
and their team a little over
five hours to root cause.

341
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,150
And so what they did is they
gave the AWS DevOps Agent

342
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:43,200
the same context that their
teams had a couple days prior

343
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,510
and asked it to figure it out.

344
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,900
And what came back in 15 minutes

345
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,050
was an accurate RCA analysis.

346
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,840
So really happy with what we're seeing,

347
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,200
what our customers are seeing
in some real world scenarios.

348
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,440
Last thing I wanted to point
out to you all, you know,

349
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,750
as a result of the customer
experience in the beta,

350
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,180
as I mentioned earlier, that we're making

351
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,310
the AWS DevOps Agents something that works

352
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,070
with not just other people,
other on-call engineers

353
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,580
and other SREs DevOps
engineers on your team,

354
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,040
but also with other agents.

355
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,100
And so we worked with some of
our launch partners on this

356
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,940
and here's an example of
of one of them, Dynatrace,

357
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,250
where we targeted jointly
a couple of customers.

358
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,980
You see Clariant, a chemical
manufacturing company.

359
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,170
Western Governors University,
if you haven't heard of them,

360
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,860
they have about 200,000
students, United Airlines,

361
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,190
who many of you probably
flew here to get here.

362
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,040
These were joint Dynatrace
and Amazon customers

363
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,280
where we worked with them
to set up AWS DevOps Agent

364
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,830
to work in concert with Dynatrace

365
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,060
and particularly Dynatrace's
Davis AI capabilities.

366
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,660
And so Western Governors is
a great example that I like

367
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,450
to highlight in less than a
day, they were able to get

368
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,000
both of these systems, these
solutions, these agents

369
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,090
up and running and working
collaboratively together

370
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,910
in their production
environments to help them

371
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,363
investigate in this particular
case real world incidents.

372
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,630
So that's the introduction.

373
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,270
It's time now to turn it over to David

374
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,846
who's gonna walk you through
in detail what the agent,

375
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:21,483
the AWS DevOps Agent can do.

376
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:26,331
(audience applauds)

377
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,720
- Alright, so yeah,
picture's a thousand words.

378
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,720
So let's just look at a
whole bunch of examples

379
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,750
of the DevOps Agent
going and doing things.

380
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,240
So we'll actually show
you four different demos.

381
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,180
We'll start with another
kind of slow motion version

382
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,340
of that fast motion video where I was,

383
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,650
had that started with the
pager, which I still have.

384
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,510
Hopefully it doesn't go off

385
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,920
while we're having this presentation.

386
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,960
I might have to investigate something.

387
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,760
It's not going to, I'm just, okay.

388
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,470
But then we'll also look
at customizing DevOps Agent

389
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,260
with bringing MCP servers.

390
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,940
I'll show you how you can steer it

391
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,140
and nudge it in a direction

392
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,970
or ask questions about with chat.

393
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,040
And then I'll show that
future issue prevention

394
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,760
where it scans past incidents
to look for patterns of things

395
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,300
that you can improve long
term to prevent future issues.

396
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,860
Okay, first demo time.

397
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,670
Now throughout, we're gonna
look through a set of services

398
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,780
that I built that work together

399
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,150
called Robots-as-a-service service.

400
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,030
This is, you can imagine
this is a set of web services

401
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,740
that talk to each other that make it

402
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,290
so you can control
robots like in the world.

403
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,840
Like you can send them commands,
schedule them to do things,

404
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,780
see where they are and whatnot.

405
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,467
I actually created this,
it's a set of microservices,

406
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:42,000
like a gateway service,
the bot service that talks

407
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,810
to a schedule service that talks
to the action service to go

408
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,470
and use AWS IoT to send
commands to the robots.

409
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,120
And then a forge service
that you would use

410
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,083
for provisioning.

411
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,710
This is simple, but
it's also each of these

412
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,910
are internally complex.

413
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,220
There are a lot of different
things, security groups,

414
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,770
load balancers, autoscaling
groups, all acles,

415
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't all kinds of stuff

416
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,560
that actually make up these things.

417
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,393
IM roll.

418
00:19:05,393 --> 00:19:08,190
So lots of things that
could potentially go wrong.

419
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,140
So less talk, more action.

420
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,610
Let's get into it.

421
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,580
So let's start by implementing a bug

422
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,200
and pushing it to production.

423
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,220
Here I am in Kiro.

424
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,650
I have this caching logic
in the forge service

425
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,690
and I'm gonna say let's
add a timestamp field

426
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,490
to the cache records just to,

427
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,400
because maybe I need to measure
how effective my cache is,

428
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,140
how long things are cached for.

429
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,980
Harmless change.

430
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,620
We're just adding data, it's
not gonna cause any problems.

431
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,670
So let's just push that.

432
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,380
Fantastic.

433
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,090
And in the distance, alarms.

434
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,010
So, okay, so things break.

435
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,290
So in this case I'm using
Dynatrace for my kind

436
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,230
of application level
monitoring and alerting.

437
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,290
And sure enough it goes and it detects

438
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,520
the problem automatically.

439
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,200
It's pretty nice, these Davis alarms.

440
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,390
They kinda just, I didn't
have to set anything up.

441
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,040
Finds, sees the failure rate increase

442
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,700
and sure enough, yep, problems,
bot services, seeing errors.

443
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,210
I can see overall that there are problems

444
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,440
kind of throughout the stack.

445
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,060
All the services are kind of lighting up

446
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,399
with bad failure rates, so not good.

447
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:10,320
So in the meantime, Dynatrace
has called a web hook

448
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,730
that sent this notification
to the AWS DevOps Agent.

449
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,070
So before I didn't
necessarily even need to be

450
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,020
to show up here and look at it,

451
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,900
it already kicked off an investigation.

452
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,490
In this case, this is the operator app

453
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,770
within the AWS DevOps Agent.

454
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,870
So I go here and I see all my ongoing

455
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,220
and past investigations.

456
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,960
Let's go ahead and look at this one

457
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,313
to see kind of the details.

458
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,970
So here we can see, oh, you don't need

459
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,290
to use the chat for right now.

460
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,490
We'll come back to that.

461
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,780
So, here we see the issue.

462
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,250
This is what Dynatrace Davis
sent the AWS DevOps Agent.

463
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,040
You can see the details of the
problem, where the problem is

464
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,976
and extremely precise timestamp

465
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:52,560
of when the problem occurred there.

466
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,790
So that's really helpful.

467
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,650
And so let's go from here.

468
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,940
Let's just like jump to the end

469
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,320
from like a storing standpoint.

470
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,940
Let's go right to the root cause.

471
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,160
So at the end, this
investigation's already complete.

472
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,620
Like by the time I made
it back into the office

473
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,870
and opened my laptop, the
investigation was done.

474
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,760
And so what is the root
cause in this case?

475
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,710
Well, it says a code deployment

476
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,440
introduced a cache serialization format

477
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,182
incompatibility in the bot-forge service.

478
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:18,607
And this is exactly what
you saw me implement.

479
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:22,375
I added a new, it says I
added a new timestamp field

480
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:26,190
that's with the code change
and the deserialization method.

481
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,710
So it understood the surrounding code

482
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,420
that the deserialized method

483
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,980
didn't like to see this new field.

484
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,723
So, it was failing.

485
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,690
And so it also talked, said that,

486
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,170
well, actually the requests
that were cache misses,

487
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,050
the ones that went right
to DynamoDB succeeded.

488
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,090
So that's actually an
interesting kind of nuance

489
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,370
that it noticed while
doing the investigation

490
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,560
that some request for succeeding.

491
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,390
It wasn't obvious, but it's useful

492
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,180
from figuring out useful evidence

493
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,300
to prove that this, yes, this
code change was the problem.

494
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,710
So great, let's go back up the top

495
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,390
and see how the agent got there.

496
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,370
We're gonna scroll through slowly here.

497
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,130
So it started off, it said,
okay, I'm gonna investigate.

498
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,840
Let's start by just kind of figuring out

499
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,670
where we are in the world.

500
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,230
It's gonna goes, read some runbooks.

501
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,730
These are all MCP tool calls.

502
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,650
You notice since I'm using Dynatrace,

503
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,480
it's doing DQL queries.

504
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,240
I could, if I want to inspect
and see what it's been up to,

505
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,860
I'm clicking on one of the details

506
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,630
and it's showing me the inputs and outputs

507
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,060
of each of those MCP calls to.

508
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,430
And then so fantastic, it
runs a bunch of queries.

509
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,620
Just get figuring out what's going on.

510
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,050
Now it has between calling Dynatrace

511
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,030
and querying our own kind of internally

512
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,800
figured out version of your topology.

513
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,390
It says, okay, here's
what we're dealing with,

514
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,820
here are the services,
here's what talks to what.

515
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,843
Let's keep going.

516
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,720
So next it's gonna continue to triage,

517
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,210
kinda understand the health
of each of those services.

518
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,490
And it says, okay, yep,
the front end service

519
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,450
is seeing errors.

520
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,490
It's having errors
talking to dependencies.

521
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,870
So it's kind of gonna look for

522
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,190
a needle in a different haystack.

523
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,960
Okay, let's go investigate those services.

524
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,150
Those services are also seeing errors,

525
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,250
but they're talking to
the bot-forge service,

526
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,090
which is seeing errors.

527
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,600
So let's go move search for a
needle in a different haystack

528
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,040
and says, okay, fantastic.

529
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,890
Bot-forge seems like the
most dependent service.

530
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,030
Let's go.

531
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,580
Let's now zoom in on bot-forge

532
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,816
and really interrogate that
to see what's going on.

533
00:23:14,816 --> 00:23:18,150
And so it's bot-forge, it's
calling AWS APIs through MCP,

534
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,130
it's calling its own topology

535
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,530
and now it has figured
out the AWS resources

536
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,600
and other, just everything that makes up

537
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,532
like what pipelines are
deploying to this service,

538
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:29,760
where are its logs, let's just figure out

539
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,490
how we zoom in and explore this thing.

540
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,710
Okay, so let's, from there now we have

541
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,170
a lot of investigations we need to do.

542
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,090
So he comes up with a lot of ideas.

543
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,340
Okay, let's search the
bot-forge deployments

544
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,420
and infrastructure changes

545
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,070
to see if we just changed something.

546
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,620
Let's look at the EC2
instance health metrics

547
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,780
to see if maybe there's,
we ran out of something

548
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,000
like a file descriptors or CPU.

549
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,730
Let's check other components
like the bot config

550
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,010
DynamoDB table that this uses to see

551
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,140
if it's running out of
capacity or something.

552
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,240
Let's look at application logs and zoom in

553
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,250
to see if there's any hints there.

554
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,050
And actually let's look
at traffic patterns

555
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,940
to see maybe there's some incoming shift

556
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,530
that's causing some problem here.

557
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,170
Some new robots being added or asked for.

558
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,100
Who knows?

559
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,200
These are kind of, I
find from my experience

560
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,110
that these are the kind
of key beats to look for

561
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,640
when you're trying to
figure out what to mitigate

562
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,620
'cause each of these
can map to a mitigation.

563
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,110
We're running out of CPU,
let's add more servers.

564
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,670
If we deployed something, let's roll back.

565
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,970
So these kind of map to
things that can be mitigated.

566
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,830
Okay, so, but that's a lot to look for.

567
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,940
So the agent is actually,

568
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,650
has listed all these
things it wants to do,

569
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,810
but it's gonna do this in parallel.

570
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,580
It has a lot more hands than I do,

571
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,340
so instead of me doing
one thing at a time,

572
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,020
it's just gonna investigate everything,

573
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,430
so it uses a subagents.

574
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,080
Now we're not gonna look at the output

575
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,450
of each individual
subagent as it goes along.

576
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,910
We're just gonna see,
look at the observations,

577
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,950
the key things that it has figured out.

578
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,573
Okay, so, and these
are the types of things

579
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,610
that get pushed to like a Slack channel.

580
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,220
So it says aha, there's
been a cloud formation stack

581
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,860
deployment with a new
launch template version.

582
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,693
This was created.

583
00:24:59,693 --> 00:25:01,590
And it's interesting, like the agent

584
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,840
likes to do a little bit
of extra credit sometimes

585
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,300
and it says, okay, well, and it found

586
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,460
during this cloud formation stack update,

587
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,070
here are the instances that
were added and replaced.

588
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,570
The way I do deployments in this fleet

589
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,430
is I replace my instances

590
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,500
kind of blue green with deployments.

591
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,390
And it noticed that it says,
okay, here's an instance

592
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,490
that started here, here
when it had errors.

593
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,450
It's pretty neat.

594
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,110
Okay, what else does it
notice observation wise?

595
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,270
It actually is looking at a lot of things

596
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,700
and giving me the evidence
that it has ruled things out.

597
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,200
This is what Bill was talking about.

598
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,180
It's useful that it kind of also tells you

599
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,120
what it looked at that it
thinks is not important.

600
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,340
And it's actually kind of
interestingly clever about that.

601
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,610
For example, it noticed
here below it just found

602
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,210
that there's a CPU spike
on one of the instances,

603
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,900
which is suspicious and
correlates in time but irrelevant

604
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,000
because this is an instance
that just started up.

605
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,770
So of course it's gonna use a lot of CPU

606
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,160
as it does whatever installation
of software and everything.

607
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,570
So it's nice, it just, okay,

608
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,340
we saw this, we're gonna ignore it.

609
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,730
Okay, so this is just all of
the evidence that it found.

610
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,610
It also found looking at log files,

611
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,690
wherever the log files were,

612
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,970
it found them and noticed
some stack traces.

613
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,740
This is where it starts to get some hints

614
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,367
of the root cause of this.

615
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:14,730
Here's the line of code
according to the logs

616
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,560
that seems to be having some problems.

617
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,360
Okay, more observations.

618
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,700
It's pushing these Slack and stuff.

619
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,410
What else happened here?

620
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,800
It's found the rolling
instance replacement.

621
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,510
So it see, yeah, these are the instances

622
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,870
that started up and were shut down.

623
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,000
It also noticed, this is
where it observed that

624
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,650
from the logs that the requests

625
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,930
that were cache misses succeeded.

626
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,300
So that's just really
interesting details as aha,

627
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,320
there is definitely something wrong

628
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,310
with the cache interaction here, okay?

629
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,290
And then sure enough,
here's the code deployment.

630
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,450
It is connected to my GitHub actions

631
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,150
that I'm using to actually
drive the code changes,

632
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,680
not just the cloud formation part

633
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,090
of the infrastructure change.

634
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,920
And this is where it really under kind

635
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,570
of did this fusion of, okay,

636
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,010
based on what I know about the logs

637
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,200
and based on the code that changed,

638
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,780
here's what I think is
starting to really happen.

639
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,850
So great, all the subagent are done

640
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,970
and it's going to come
up with just kind of pull

641
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,437
all that data together and think it

642
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:12,540
come to the right conclusions from that.

643
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,370
And then we're back at the root cause,

644
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,620
which is what we talked about before.

645
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,420
So great, I figured it out.

646
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,980
Now there's actually, if I were to really

647
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,990
just jump to this from Slack,

648
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,790
the first thing I would
look at if the investigation

649
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,900
is done is the root cause.

650
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,600
This is where it's just
formatted a little bit nicer.

651
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,250
I don't have to scroll through like a ton

652
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,430
of raw findings and things like that.

653
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,140
So it just says that here's the impact,

654
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,270
there's a failure rate increase.

655
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,750
It then talks about here's
that same root cause text

656
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,620
that I showed you before.

657
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,970
Here's the root cause.

658
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,620
Cause there we already saw this.

659
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,160
It's that the cache serialization issue.

660
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,890
And then it shows the kind
of key observations below it.

661
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,723
The observations.

662
00:27:50,723 --> 00:27:52,890
These are the key findings
that kind of prove

663
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,730
that this root cause.

664
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,020
There could be multiple root causes.

665
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,430
In this case, it's just one.

666
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,530
It says, okay, yep,
there's that evidence about

667
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,370
the failure rate of the cache
hits versus cache misses.

668
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,770
It talks about the code that was changed

669
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,230
and it talks about the
cloud formation stack update

670
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,520
that was part of the code change

671
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,420
that actually made it into production.

672
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,690
Great.

673
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,770
So there's that root cause.

674
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,240
Okay, but root cause is great,

675
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,950
but we need to fix the problem.

676
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,960
So here's where we can
generate a mitigation plan.

677
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,500
We ask it to, okay, like what should we do

678
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,360
In this case it's gonna be pretty simple

679
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,680
because it's a bad deployment.

680
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,600
So what do you do when
there's a bad deployment?

681
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,250
Well, you roll it back.

682
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,755
So it's this rollback.

683
00:28:30,755 --> 00:28:33,960
But I hadn't actually
until I was using this,

684
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,600
doing this demo, I
didn't really know about,

685
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,130
I hadn't used GitHub actions before,

686
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,290
so this is teaching me for the first time

687
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,610
how to do a rollback.

688
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,980
Now it breaks things
down into how I change.

689
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,630
Whenever you're gonna do
anything in production,

690
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,340
you wanna do things very carefully.

691
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,630
You wanna prepare, make sure

692
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,190
you have everything in order first,

693
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,010
pre validate, make sure
the system hasn't changed

694
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,890
in the meantime, when you kind
of have this first idea about

695
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,080
what to do, you need to
prepare and then make sure,

696
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,270
did somebody else on my
team roll back already?

697
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,760
Did we learn something new
in the last five minutes?

698
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,340
So you just do all those
careful preparation, then apply.

699
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,540
This is where I didn't really know how

700
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,940
to do GitHub actions rollbacks
before, this taught me.

701
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,923
And it it showed me what to expect.

702
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,760
Then after you do that, it says,

703
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,230
here's some commands
you can run if you want

704
00:29:18,812 --> 00:29:20,457
to make sure that the
change is rolling back

705
00:29:20,457 --> 00:29:23,070
and that you're seeing
the recovery you expect.

706
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,230
And of course if that
goes wrong, then you want

707
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,750
to be prepared ahead of
time to undo the thing

708
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,590
that you just did.

709
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,810
In this case, rolling back the rollback.

710
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,840
So, put the bad, potentially
bad code in back in place

711
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,430
and then figure out what to do from there,

712
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,330
which will be a real exciting journey.

713
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,020
Now, I would look at this later,

714
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,460
but this is the long term solution.

715
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,750
I don't wanna be distracted by this.

716
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,070
I need to kick off the rollback.

717
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,860
But the long term solution,
it repairs this spec

718
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,370
of what I can do to hand
to say a coding agent

719
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,960
or just do myself.

720
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,143
It says, here's how you
should actually fix the code.

721
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:58,500
You wanna make sure you have good tests

722
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,540
and that you update the deserializer

723
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,950
to match the serializer.

724
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,053
Okay, but let's focus on rollback.

725
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:09,450
So let's go over to GitHub
actions where I can do that

726
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,730
and this, I'm just kind
of following that runbook.

727
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,610
It says, okay, this is actually,
this is the bad deployment.

728
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,430
The adding the timestamped
was the problem.

729
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,963
So let's go back.

730
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:20,843
And so the problem was that,

731
00:30:20,843 --> 00:30:24,060
or the thing we wanna roll
back to is the actually last,

732
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,920
that's last known good deployment.

733
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,033
So click on that and rerun all jobs.

734
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,090
There's nothing special in the agent

735
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,460
that knows about GitHub actions.

736
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,030
It just kind of knows that
'cause it's an LLM frankly.

737
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,100
And so it's just a, it teaches me how

738
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,947
to use GitHub actions to do the rollback.

739
00:30:42,947 --> 00:30:44,700
And this is just one example of a thing

740
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,170
that it would figure out.

741
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,050
And so just confirm, I can go
to whatever observability tool

742
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,910
I'm using, in this case Dynatrace.

743
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,270
Hit that refresh, and then
we are back to healthy.

744
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,980
So there it is.

745
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,920
That's going through an investigation.

746
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,680
So now, oh, and it shows there,

747
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,480
the Davis problems have been cleared.

748
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,503
So that's great.

749
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,160
Now let's do that follow up.

750
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,250
Let's fix the bug so
that we don't, you know,

751
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,420
you come into this problem again.

752
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,110
So I copy the spec, which is at the bottom

753
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,180
of that mitigation actions page.

754
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,430
And then I like to use Kiro for the using

755
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,840
its spec driven development.

756
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,670
It does kind of production
changes pretty well

757
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:29,010
without and while keeping
the fun of vibe coating.

758
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,690
And so I paste that in.

759
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,180
Kiro is gonna generate
its own specification,

760
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,250
its own, okay, here are
the full requirements.

761
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,890
I'm gonna go spend some time
understanding your code.

762
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,020
Maybe it's a code I didn't
have to author with Kiro.

763
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,090
It'll just I'll just learn
about your code base,

764
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,320
come up with a plan.

765
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,720
I'll read the req, come
with detailed requirements

766
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,140
that say how I should make the change,

767
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,450
come up with a design and
I can review the design.

768
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,530
I'm not showing you all this.

769
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,540
And then come up with a
timeline, oh, excuse me,

770
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,030
a task list of things
that it's going to do

771
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,102
one thing at a time.

772
00:31:58,102 --> 00:32:00,180
And I can say, okay, implement it.

773
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,550
I actually used Kiro to implement
a lot of the things here.

774
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,566
So it works really well for this.

775
00:32:04,566 --> 00:32:06,870
And then it also generates
really nice tests

776
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,380
because you have that specification

777
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,210
that says the requirements of things

778
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,670
that you wanna make sure you have.

779
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,190
Kiro generates property
based tests to make sure

780
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,430
it's not just kind of no op unit tests.

781
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,140
It does very thorough tests on

782
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,490
because it understands the behavior

783
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,710
that you want to have
through the specification.

784
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,080
So it can generate really nice tests.

785
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,340
So that's the end to end fix
on a typical incident for me

786
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,590
is you react to it, you mitigate it

787
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,810
and then you solve the root cause.

788
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:40,020
So the flow of this, so why
didn't we build this before?

789
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,950
Like why didn't we just build

790
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,380
DevOps Agent like a decade ago?

791
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,050
It's because like DevOps is messy.

792
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,990
It's a mix of so many different
tools and systems together

793
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,220
that were never really designed

794
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,900
to interact, interface with each other.

795
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,580
Like sure, they all have APIs.

796
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,460
Like when APIs, web
services became a thing,

797
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,860
like you can make
anything talk to anything

798
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,200
by like coding the integration.

799
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,300
But there are just so
many, it's like end to m.

800
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,980
Like there's so many combinations of tools

801
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,540
that you might use
together for deployment,

802
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,380
observability, logs,
metrics, traces, who knows?

803
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,400
And so, the key unlock
for why we can do this now

804
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,190
is thanks to LLMs and MCP
and that kind of thing.

805
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,010
So you saw the bad code change,

806
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,772
in this case flow through GitHub,

807
00:33:20,772 --> 00:33:22,830
through cloud formation, EC2 service,

808
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,280
use Dynatrace, use CloudWatch,
Slack for to talk to me,

809
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,020
ServiceNow to page me.

810
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,420
All these things that all
need to play together.

811
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,300
And so you, I'm sure you can kind of map,

812
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,530
you might use some of these tools,

813
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,030
you might use a different set of tool

814
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,863
for a different type of thing.

815
00:33:36,863 --> 00:33:39,990
So that's the, the flexibility is key.

816
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,610
Okay, so how did it actually do this?

817
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,410
Like under the hood, what's going on?

818
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,713
Well, the objective of incident management

819
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:49,350
is to find some hidden
gem, the root cause, right?

820
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,340
You've gotta find the thing.

821
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,160
Something that you can do something about.

822
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,280
So the agent gets just kind
of plopped into a desert,

823
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,650
says, hey, go, go find that hidden gem

824
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,120
with really no instruction.

825
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,950
It doesn't need any
instruction at the beginning.

826
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,850
So this is where it starts
by building that topology,

827
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,160
it needs to understand what
you have in your system.

828
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,230
Like what is the universe
that I might need to look at?

829
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,970
I don't know even know
where in the desert to look.

830
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:14,190
So okay, let's understand your system.

831
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,140
It learns how do I find metrics

832
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,600
and how do I find logs
about each of these things?

833
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,950
How do I find out how you're deploying?

834
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,620
So it surveys the
landscape and then it needs

835
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,360
to understand the links between.

836
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,220
And so this topology is the connectivity

837
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,130
between different resources,
different systems,

838
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:32,250
and it uses everything available
to build this topology map.

839
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,370
It looks as well, are you using traces?

840
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,230
Then I can follow traces
through the system.

841
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,470
Do you have IAM permissions
on this lambda function

842
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,000
to talk to that DynamoDB table?

843
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,800
Oh, okay, let's draw a line there.

844
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,990
It doesn't necessarily
talk to it, but I should.

845
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,810
It's worth looking at
during an investigation.

846
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,160
And then it learns how to drill down.

847
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,650
It says, okay, do I know how
to zoom in on this service

848
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,960
and break it down and see it,
look at all the host metrics

849
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,340
and everything, all the little things.

850
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,340
So that's ultimately what it's doing

851
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,923
behind the scenes as pictured here.

852
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,700
Okay, let's look.

853
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,533
So, what we saw?

854
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:08,730
We saw an investigation happen,

855
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,770
it interfaced with a
ton of different tools.

856
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:13,770
It provided all of its evidence,
maybe more than you needed,

857
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,680
and it gave safe mitigation
steps really thoughtfully

858
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,150
because you're about to mitigate something

859
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,370
by doing a production
change kind of on the fly.

860
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,570
So you need to be ready for that

861
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,490
and review that and break it down.

862
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,860
So that's that.

863
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,620
Okay, demo two, MCP servers.

864
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,200
Bring your own MCP
server and customization.

865
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,720
Like I said, you probably
use some combination

866
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,970
of these types of tools or
totally different tools.

867
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,900
Let's do another where
instead of sending our traces

868
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,330
to Dynatrace and logs and
metrics to CloudWatch,

869
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,750
let's say you have some,
your own log store.

870
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,830
So let's say you have a log store,

871
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,810
maybe it's an S3 or something,

872
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,790
and then you send your
traces to CloudWatch,

873
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,230
whatever, let's mix it up.

874
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,880
Use different observability tools.

875
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,580
Well, how would the agent know how,

876
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,950
it doesn't know about your
bespoke logging system,

877
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,240
so how would it do that?

878
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,080
Well, the answer is to just
add an and pop up an MCP server

879
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,360
and then configure the agent to use it.

880
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,274
I did this in like 20 minutes with,

881
00:36:09,274 --> 00:36:11,220
I actually implemented
this and you'll see it.

882
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,690
I using Amazon Bedrock
agent, core MCP gateway.

883
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,150
I just stood up a gateway,
talks to a Lambda function

884
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,860
and queries my S3 logs.

885
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,890
I used Kiro specs to
generate it and it was done.

886
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,413
Maybe let's get say 40
minutes, just end to end.

887
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,403
Okay, great.

888
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:29,310
So here's another failure.

889
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,770
Let's cause another problem.

890
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:35,370
So here I am, same
bot-forge service setup.

891
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,320
Lemme just log into
one of these instances.

892
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,610
I'm gonna SSH into one of 'em.

893
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,310
Maybe I'm like troubleshooting
some latency issue.

894
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,930
I don't know. Let's say, oh, I'm seeing,

895
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,970
I'm gonna pick on the cache again.

896
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,200
Let's say there's,

897
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm seeing something weird with the cache.

898
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,120
Let's just go into the
cache and clear the files.

899
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,730
Like I think that might fix the problem.

900
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,260
Just remove the cache.

901
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,310
Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.

902
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,143
I don't know.

903
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,760
And again, maybe not a good idea.

904
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,410
It depends on how it works.

905
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,120
So it wasn't a good idea.

906
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,070
And so here we have the investigation

907
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,660
that triggered off of a CloudWatch alarm.

908
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,610
So in this case it was triggering off

909
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,070
a CloudWatch alarm on a load balancer.

910
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,720
So now it's the tools are different.

911
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,340
The flow is the same but
the tools are different.

912
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,780
It's getting, looking at X-ray,

913
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,910
it's looking at CloudWatch metrics,

914
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,190
it's using the topology
again, that's similar.

915
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,920
And it says okay, yeah,
we have a load balancer

916
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,970
showing errors.

917
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,950
Let's dig in from here and figure out

918
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,990
where to do that investigation.

919
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,360
Goes in, looks at stuff, looks at stuff.

920
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,800
Okay, now it found quickly

921
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,380
that these are the SQLite
cache table is missing

922
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,210
causing HTTP 500 errors.

923
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,043
We just figured that out.

924
00:37:37,043 --> 00:37:38,430
How did it figure it out?

925
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,040
Well, it's sorted in
the S3 application logs.

926
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,480
This is that random MCP
server that didn't exist

927
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,700
until 40 minutes before
this that I configured

928
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,310
and it just knew how to
talk to it to query logs.

929
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,250
Pretty great and use it
contextually in the investigation.

930
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,770
For this service I know
how to get to its logs.

931
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,653
So it's great and it figured it out.

932
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,500
More just investigation.

933
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,783
It's coming to
observations, the same idea.

934
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,973
It just investigates and
figures out what's going on.

935
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:14,070
More metrics, more metrics,
more metrics, more metrics.

936
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:18,393
All subagents are done, so
let's synthesize the findings.

937
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,220
Great.

938
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,680
It actually noticed, I was busted.

939
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,950
Manual SSM session on bot-forge instance

940
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,110
caused SQLite database corruption.

941
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,700
dyanacek, who's that?

942
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,030
Started an SSM session and
maybe messed with some stuff.

943
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,100
And so sure enough it
found through CloudTrail

944
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,860
that I had logged into the
host before and it's like,

945
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,800
oh, that's suspicious,
because that's the same host

946
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,880
that it saw from the logs

947
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,340
that had the errors about the cache.

948
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,173
So great.

949
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:46,770
Again, I'm just showing.

950
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,660
The interesting thing
that I'm showing here

951
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,610
is that how similar the investigation

952
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,290
is to the past investigation.

953
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,270
It just happens to be
using different tools.

954
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,230
It's still successful.

955
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,688
It's just using this
custom bespoke MCP server

956
00:38:58,688 --> 00:39:02,580
that I made that, you know,
if you have your own system,

957
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,590
you can also plug that in.

958
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:07,440
And so here it is with
the root cause manual SSM.

959
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,953
Session maybe messed up
the a SQL like cache.

960
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:14,310
So, let's see like how
what it comes up with.

961
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,110
The earlier mitigation plan was simple.

962
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,010
It was just a rollback.

963
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,980
This is a little bit more
exotic of a scenario.

964
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,150
What does it figure out?

965
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,680
It says, well, what you should do is just,

966
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,860
it's happening on one instance,
you should just replace it.

967
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,950
And that's absolutely what
I would do in this incident.

968
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,350
I would just first just
get the bad thing out

969
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,630
and then quickly like follow up with more,

970
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,397
figure out, make sure we understand why

971
00:39:35,397 --> 00:39:36,750
and we actually do have the evidence

972
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,850
as to why it's 'cause I logged into it.

973
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:41,250
So similar thing, prepare, let's make sure

974
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,170
that the auto-scaling group that we have

975
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,600
all the right arms
figured out and make sure

976
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,090
these are the right things
we should be messing with.

977
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,280
Pre validate, make sure
that more instances

978
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,113
haven't come up bad.

979
00:39:51,113 --> 00:39:52,470
Make sure that the healthy instance

980
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,480
is still there and healthy.

981
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,763
Maybe the situation has changed.

982
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,340
And then apply.

983
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,230
It also gives the, you know,

984
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,910
conveniently it gives the right, I would,

985
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,470
this is how I would terminate the instance

986
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,960
with autoscaling command
instead of an EC2 command.

987
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,750
Okay, just because this
does the graceful shutdown.

988
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,740
Okay, fine.

989
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,230
Little nuance but still useful.

990
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,160
And then post validate,

991
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,610
make sure that you have
a healthy fleet and then,

992
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,130
and if rollback steps
I guess are just to try

993
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,443
to put the fleet back
together in a good way.

994
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,423
Great.

995
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,213
So that's about that.

996
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,050
So what did we see?

997
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,620
We saw bringing a random MCP server

998
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,270
that can do some part of your ops.

999
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,100
Whether it's how you do deployments,

1000
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,750
if you have your own deployment system,

1001
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,540
if you have your own knowledge
base that you wanna wire in.

1002
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,390
If you have your own
observability tool for something,

1003
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,830
if you have like business metrics,

1004
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,410
maybe you measure customer
impact using your own tool,

1005
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,910
I don't know, whatever it is,

1006
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,120
just bring it in an MCP server
using agent core gateway.

1007
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,190
I find it to be really
easy to do that securely.

1008
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,320
Like this agent is the only thing that is,

1009
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,270
has permission to talk to that MCP server,

1010
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,770
so it's not like it's just open.

1011
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:02,603
It's great.

1012
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,790
And this particular root
cause was interesting.

1013
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,943
It was a gray failure that
we did and so it was great.

1014
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,220
Now let's see how you can
interact with investigations

1015
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,580
and with the DevOps Agent

1016
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,860
outside of passively
watching what it's up to.

1017
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,260
So you can ask questions
about investigations.

1018
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,120
That's one thing you can do is to say,

1019
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,827
let's say I had some investigation

1020
00:41:25,827 --> 00:41:28,230
and okay, say what is the start time?

1021
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,730
Well, it's a simple question

1022
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,560
but maybe I didn't wanna
read through and scroll,

1023
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,790
so I can say, what was the start time?

1024
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,360
It just answers questions
about what this chat is about.

1025
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,430
What did the investigation already find?

1026
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,140
So it's not gonna do
big research projects.

1027
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,580
It's just gonna answer questions based

1028
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,370
on what was already revealed
in the investigation.

1029
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,020
So for example, I could say what alarms

1030
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,980
triggered during the event.

1031
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,840
It says, well, this is one alarm.

1032
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,100
And it says what, by the way,

1033
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,410
the investigation didn't
look super thoroughly.

1034
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,120
So if you want, you would have to ask me

1035
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,470
to go look for other alarms.

1036
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,210
And so, okay, great.

1037
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,340
So I might say, okay,
let's do a little bit more

1038
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,240
of a research project.

1039
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,180
Let's say can you summarize
the customer impact?

1040
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,710
Maybe I want to just have a nice report

1041
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,640
that shows a little bit more
about what the impact was.

1042
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,430
You can see it sends
that request to the agent

1043
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,470
and then the agent
replies with this report.

1044
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,880
Maybe had to do a little more research

1045
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,890
and just compile things.

1046
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,480
And you can see just, it's a nice report.

1047
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,900
It says here are the services,
each of their failure rates

1048
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,940
that happened during the incident.

1049
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,740
And just a bunch more details
about like the duration,

1050
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,170
the timeline, customer facing impact.

1051
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,500
It describes things in
terms of what it understands

1052
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,733
my functionality is.

1053
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,210
Okay, and if wanna ask a
deeper question to say, okay,

1054
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,500
but how many robots like this

1055
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,090
is the bot service, robot server,

1056
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,913
how many robots were impacted during this?

1057
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,420
I could later on figure out which robots.

1058
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,670
Okay, how many robots were impacted?

1059
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,140
So it's gonna have to do more queries.

1060
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,150
It didn't query that
during the investigation,

1061
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,040
so it's gonna take a little bit of time

1062
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,330
to go and do a bunch of queries.

1063
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:01,176
You can see it doing more
DQL queries to Dynatrace

1064
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:02,130
'cause spans are the part

1065
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,900
that are really rich
with this information.

1066
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,440
The labels of like, this is
the robot that I was working on

1067
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,550
and this is the status code and stuff.

1068
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,890
Spans are really rich
with that information.

1069
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:15,890
So it queries the spans and then and logs.

1070
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,230
It's kind of again, just figuring
out what it needs to pull

1071
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,990
to answer my question of like
which robots were impacted.

1072
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,020
And then it answers, okay,
we found 91 unique robots

1073
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,510
that had and here said the way
in which they were impacted.

1074
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,950
They saw five hundreds.

1075
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,290
They were impacted on certain operations.

1076
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,297
It's kind of breaking that down by API.

1077
00:43:33,297 --> 00:43:36,210
All great because this
was all in the span data.

1078
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:37,470
I don't know how it figured it out,

1079
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,423
but I just happened to have know.

1080
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,990
And then, yeah, it just gives a nice,

1081
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,300
you get a nice overall summary.

1082
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,520
This isn't something it
was specially coded to do.

1083
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,710
I just thought it would be
a nice thing to show off.

1084
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,700
Well, what should I ask it?

1085
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,840
Let's ask it customer impact,

1086
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,880
'cause it's something that I often do.

1087
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,190
During an incident I want to see

1088
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,770
kind of what my customers
saw when there was a problem.

1089
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,660
It's really an important question

1090
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,313
in the moment and then later.

1091
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,670
Okay, you can also, when an investigation

1092
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,080
is going on, you can nudge it.

1093
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,250
You can steer it to say, Hey,

1094
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,900
I think you should
actually go look at this

1095
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,490
'cause you might not
just be sitting there.

1096
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:17,820
If you do open your laptop
before the investigation is done,

1097
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,230
you might want to go look at things

1098
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,450
and be active in this.

1099
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,530
So when you're looking at things

1100
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,270
you might share things you found.

1101
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:25,680
Or if you see it get off track,

1102
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,600
you might wanna put it back on track.

1103
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,330
Here's a real example
of a getting off track.

1104
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,910
During when preparing
this demo for all of you,

1105
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,860
I noticed I was doing an investigation

1106
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,770
but I was breaking things
like every 30 minutes.

1107
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,090
Letting it recover for a short time

1108
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,047
and breaking something again.

1109
00:44:40,047 --> 00:44:41,190
And so it was confused.

1110
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,110
It was like, oh, there are
all these different things

1111
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,340
happening at the same time.

1112
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,400
And so I said, can you show
me the incident timeline?

1113
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,429
And it said, okay, well, 18:00

1114
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:51,270
and then 19:00 this thing happened.

1115
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,370
And then at 21:00 this thing happened.

1116
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:56,790
And then like the 22:00.

1117
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:00,030
It's finding all these different
things that I had broken.

1118
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,380
I don't remember what I had prompted.

1119
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,970
The next day this other thing happened.

1120
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,540
I'm like, okay, like
agent, like can you relax

1121
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,710
and just look at, I said, can you look at

1122
00:45:10,443 --> 00:45:12,360
the most recent impact only.

1123
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,380
I said, yeah, these deployments
are way too spread out.

1124
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,970
Can you ask the investigation to focus

1125
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,370
on the most recent impact to see

1126
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:21,510
what might have triggered that?

1127
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,060
I think for this prompt,
initially for this investigation,

1128
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,880
I didn't actually ask it
about a specific, you know,

1129
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,920
alarm timestamp or
something. I don't know.

1130
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,380
So that's why it kind of got
a little creative and said,

1131
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,990
great, okay, I'm gonna, and it actually

1132
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,180
like improved my prompts to the agent too.

1133
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,390
It said actually let's get this timestamp.

1134
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:41,043
I didn't paste that timestamp.

1135
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,340
It figured out the start point in the chat

1136
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,870
and then it pasted that to the agent

1137
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,700
to have it look at the most recent wave.

1138
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,970
So pretty nice way of
steering investigations

1139
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:52,053
but through chat.

1140
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:58,320
I can also just kind of
learn about my environment.

1141
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,300
I don't have to ask about a specific

1142
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,650
maybe operational issue.

1143
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,980
We have it really tuned to ask
about like explain an alarm,

1144
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,350
explain like why there's
a problem right now.

1145
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,560
But you can actually ask it
really whatever you feel like.

1146
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,890
For example, sometimes I
might start an investigation.

1147
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,720
You can tell it what
alarm to look at here,

1148
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,700
but I can say maybe don't
investigate anything.

1149
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,310
I just want to ask you some questions.

1150
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,143
Great.

1151
00:46:21,143 --> 00:46:24,933
And this is start an
investigation about TBD.

1152
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,800
And so the agent responds
with, okay, I will just,

1153
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,440
I'll help you, let me
know what you want to do.

1154
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,150
So I might ask, can you investigate

1155
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:35,970
to see what ec2 instances
I had a few minutes ago?

1156
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,260
And this is a real thing I was doing

1157
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,400
when preparing for this.

1158
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,960
I just thought, what would be a neat thing

1159
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,490
to ask and show all of you?

1160
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:44,010
I didn't really realize it
was gonna be kind of neat.

1161
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,580
So it said, okay, I'm
gonna describe instances,

1162
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,500
look at the topology, figure it out.

1163
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,060
It spent a little bit of time and it said,

1164
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,290
well, here's a summary.

1165
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,590
And it said you have
54 terminated instances

1166
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:58,380
in the last 30 minutes and I
didn't know this was going on.

1167
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,690
It said, you have instance churn happening

1168
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,640
in your auto scaling group,
instances are coming up

1169
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,470
and getting shut down right away.

1170
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:05,580
I was like, ooh, whoops, okay.

1171
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,699
So I didn't actually realize

1172
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:09,005
it was kind of actually
a kind of fun question,

1173
00:47:09,005 --> 00:47:11,310
so it didn't just literally
answer my question.

1174
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,050
It did, but then it also got a little bit

1175
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,090
of that extra credit and it
said, well, this is funny.

1176
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:16,830
Maybe you want to know why.

1177
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:20,070
So it has that nice helpful
curiosity to help me,

1178
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,820
oh yeah, okay, this is a
problem I need to go fix that.

1179
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,790
From customers who have
been using this so far,

1180
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,590
they've also said just
in different things,

1181
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:31,350
whether they're glancing
at that noisy topology map

1182
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,450
or they're looking at anything

1183
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,430
during an investigation
or asking these questions.

1184
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,820
We keep hearing that people
are always learn a little bit

1185
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,980
something that they didn't
realize they would learn

1186
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,380
that is interesting and
relevant in some other way.

1187
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,750
So, it's interesting that
just that little extra

1188
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,550
looking around corners for you.

1189
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,320
There's so much telemetry data out there,

1190
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,970
so much going on in logs

1191
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:52,260
that's just, but you don't have time

1192
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,110
to go look at everything all
the time but the agent does.

1193
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,530
Another way you can influence the agent

1194
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:01,323
around future investigations
are with Runbooks.

1195
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:06,180
Now Runbooks are sort of
like things that will,

1196
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,160
the agent can use and reference

1197
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,290
when doing an investigation
to speed things up

1198
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:13,170
or steer it in a certain way.

1199
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,990
They're kind of like
today we released in Kiro

1200
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:18,090
this thing called Kiro powers.

1201
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:21,090
Kiro powers are, when
you're using the Kiro IDE,

1202
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:24,420
they're a kind of a
combination of MCP servers

1203
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,760
and steering files and hooks and things

1204
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,680
that just like in a nice packaged format

1205
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,710
that help the agent
specialize in a certain tool

1206
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:34,380
that it might not just your
agents are generally good,

1207
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,780
but like broadly good, but
to specialize in something.

1208
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,640
It's nice to package all of that up.

1209
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,870
And so this is the same idea.

1210
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:43,110
It's runbooks, that just
little pieces of guidance

1211
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,400
that are just loaded on demand

1212
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,020
whenever the agent wants to look at it.

1213
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,853
Let's look at something.

1214
00:48:46,853 --> 00:48:49,260
You can add one or let's look at a couple

1215
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,880
that I find are useful.

1216
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,590
So I decided to write one for this

1217
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:55,350
that kind of just helps
the agent speed up,

1218
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,660
maybe shave off a minute
of an investigation.

1219
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,937
Actually I think I disabled the Runbook

1220
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,850
and I don't think it was
helping, but it doesn't matter.

1221
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,490
Just for demonstration purposes.

1222
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,800
I kind of gave it an overview and said,

1223
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,960
okay, here's where I'm
storing all of my stuff.

1224
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,990
I was using logs in an MCP server.

1225
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,470
I'm doing code deployments

1226
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,060
maybe through GitHub actions in this case,

1227
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,260
just to kinda give it a little bit

1228
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,090
of a head start on figuring it out.

1229
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:23,070
It'll wander around and
figure out what I have,

1230
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:24,900
but this kind of, I just feel like

1231
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,673
it sometimes it helps ground it.

1232
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,580
So that's one kind of
Runbook you could write.

1233
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,440
Just give, nudge it in
the right direction.

1234
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,940
I gave it a little bit of a Runbook

1235
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,280
for that bespoke MCP server for logs

1236
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,200
that I've been talking about.

1237
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,350
I found that the agent, it
was using the MCP server okay

1238
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:43,800
but it kept querying for
the current minute of logs.

1239
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,230
Like the right now, like
if it's like two o'clock,

1240
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:48,720
it was looking for logs
from two o'clock and I said,

1241
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,730
Ooh, actually I only push my logs

1242
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:51,960
like with a two minute delay,

1243
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,270
so only look for logs two minutes ago.

1244
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:56,550
And all that does is save a
little bit of a back and forth.

1245
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:58,187
It figures it out, but it's still.

1246
00:49:58,187 --> 00:50:00,030
I just give it a little
bit more information

1247
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,950
about how to use the tool.

1248
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,650
Often that information is in
the MCP tool documentation,

1249
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:07,350
but whatever you can, it
doesn't matter where you put it.

1250
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:10,770
I also said, oh yeah,
a good logging service

1251
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,980
like CloudWatch logs will
just package up stack traces

1252
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,840
and everything into the same line.

1253
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,730
In my case, you could,

1254
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,430
my MCP server let you grip for errors,

1255
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,940
but it didn't return
any data after that line

1256
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,350
that it gripped and found, so I said,

1257
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:28,170
Hey, don't forget to ask
for extra lines after,

1258
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,850
so that you can actually
see the stack trace.

1259
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:31,560
So, I just gave it some tips.

1260
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,760
The details aren't super important.

1261
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,010
This is just how you can
give the agent a little bit

1262
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:37,140
of hint if you see in the details like,

1263
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,700
why didn't it get to
this thing fast enough?

1264
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,653
Oh, let me help it next time.

1265
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,340
So great.

1266
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,170
That's, you can use Runbooks

1267
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:49,560
and to influence future investigations.

1268
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,490
You can learn about your
environment and chat and you can,

1269
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:56,610
yeah, and you can actually just
learn about your environment

1270
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:58,323
by just talking with it.

1271
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,850
Okay, let's now talk about
preventing future incidents,

1272
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,743
which sounds impossible, but it is.

1273
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,380
So one thing that DevOps
Agent does is prevention.

1274
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,540
If you go into the top of the ops council,

1275
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,490
there's a prevention of the operator app.

1276
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,630
There's a prevention tab.

1277
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:17,850
And what this does is
just in the background,

1278
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:20,910
there's no real hurry, but in
the background it's looking at

1279
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:23,430
your past incidents to look for patterns

1280
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,070
of like what seems to be going wrong

1281
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:27,990
that I can recommend you change

1282
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:32,370
that could prevent this class
of issue from happening again.

1283
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,800
So in this case, I had been injecting

1284
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,390
a bunch of failures into this environment

1285
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:38,850
and it looked at the
last, in this case 19,

1286
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,530
and gave some recommendations.

1287
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,180
The recommendations are categorized.

1288
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,950
They're like governance things,

1289
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:46,800
infrastructure
recommendations, observability.

1290
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,990
Notice it has no
observability recommendations.

1291
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:51,210
I used to work on CloudWatch,
so I'm pretty good at that.

1292
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:55,770
So I guess I passed the
test for observability.

1293
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:56,603
Great.

1294
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:00,870
Let's look at some examples
of what it did find.

1295
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,600
Just a bunch of stuff.

1296
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,730
I found some health
check stuff I should do.

1297
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:08,370
Let's just explore a few of these.

1298
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:10,740
One is configure the
mininstances in service.

1299
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,390
They found some auto-scaling setting

1300
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,760
that I had screwed up
at one point in time.

1301
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,830
It said, Hey, there was
this change you made

1302
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,538
where you configured
your auto-scaling group

1303
00:52:18,538 --> 00:52:20,100
in a dangerous way.

1304
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,140
It didn't immediately cause a problem,

1305
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,450
but you made it so in certain cases

1306
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:27,540
it could replace all of your
instances at the same time.

1307
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,373
I don't want that.

1308
00:52:28,373 --> 00:52:30,330
So this might have prevented
me an outage from happening.

1309
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:33,540
It's like you should change it
to be the safer configuration

1310
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,310
of your autoscaling group to avoid that

1311
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:36,720
if it were to happen.

1312
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,420
That way, it would keep instances
in service all the time.

1313
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,377
Okay, that's great.

1314
00:52:40,377 --> 00:52:41,760
You could avoid an outage with that.

1315
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,690
I'll take that.

1316
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,640
And it gives some details
on what I should do

1317
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,807
and how to make that change and where,

1318
00:52:45,807 --> 00:52:46,957
and that kind of thing.

1319
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,270
Where to look in your, it
knows about the CDK stack

1320
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:52,917
and here's where you should change it.

1321
00:52:52,917 --> 00:52:55,350
And I could paste this
and give that to Kiro

1322
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:56,493
or some coding agent.

1323
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:02,010
Alright, another type
of thing that I found

1324
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:06,630
in this case was it noticed.

1325
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,210
Oh yeah, these, I didn't
show you this failure mode,

1326
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:12,870
but I had kept messing with
my DynamoDB table permissions

1327
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:14,190
and it was finding this just fine.

1328
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:18,810
So it was saying, okay,
somebody 10 times has,

1329
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:21,510
that was me just testing
this over and over again

1330
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:24,870
has keeps breaking your
DynamoDB table policy

1331
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,420
denying permissions and
messing up everything.

1332
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,010
And so the recommendation for this

1333
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,770
that it gave was
actually, hey, you should,

1334
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,420
well, it gives all the affected incident.

1335
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,253
And it was just telling me,

1336
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,180
Hey, like lock your permissions down.

1337
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,670
Don't let this Deanna
check person keep breaking

1338
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,460
your permissions on your
DynamoDB table. (chuckles)

1339
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,710
So then another one, it said, okay,

1340
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,740
implement post-deployment
health validation

1341
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,650
with automatic rollback to
prevent defective deployments

1342
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,540
from causing service failures.

1343
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:56,220
This was, it noticed that I had broken

1344
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,790
the ping health check, so
it just had a syntax error

1345
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,550
in my ping health check
logic and that was making it

1346
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,710
so my instances were launching
and getting terminated,

1347
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,470
launching, terminated, and
said, well, you should fix that

1348
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:12,000
and you should also, you should add checks

1349
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,730
to make sure if you
break it in the future,

1350
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:16,710
that it will get rolled
back automatically.

1351
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,810
So it's not only is it
saying fix this problem

1352
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:22,020
but also prevent it, this class of problem

1353
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,520
by having an automatic rollback.

1354
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,750
Great idea.

1355
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:28,650
This incident now this, remember
when I said my instances

1356
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,500
were churning, like they were
getting replaced all the time?

1357
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,600
That's what this was actually recommending

1358
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,090
the long term fix for
that for fixing that.

1359
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:37,200
So it was very nice.

1360
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,973
It kind of links all links all up, great.

1361
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:47,250
So let's look at an, oh yeah,
yeah, implement auto rollback

1362
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,960
and this is, and it knows about my code.

1363
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,654
It says, here is what you should change

1364
00:54:51,654 --> 00:54:52,996
your launch script to do

1365
00:54:52,996 --> 00:54:55,320
and here's how to make
it do the auto rollback.

1366
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,793
So, pretty convenient.

1367
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,900
Last thing was it just found
this whole class of problems.

1368
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,970
I kept pushing those cache breaking bugs

1369
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:06,600
and said somebody keeps
pushing bad code changes.

1370
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,000
They keep making it to production.

1371
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,890
Can you write some tests and like,

1372
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,620
have good responsible CICD going on here?

1373
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,453
It's like, good idea.

1374
00:55:14,453 --> 00:55:15,510
Okay, so sure.

1375
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:16,830
That doesn't make for as good of a demo.

1376
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:17,970
But yeah, that's the thing.

1377
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:20,490
So it says, let's put some blockers

1378
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,320
in your pipelines, your
deployment pipelines.

1379
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,110
Let's add some tests to
make sure that you're on,

1380
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:26,820
you're testing your gamma environment,

1381
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:29,760
your pre-prod before prod,
and if you do break things

1382
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,170
in prod, make it auto rollback.

1383
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:33,630
So just gimme some nice
recommendations there

1384
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:37,230
to just have better operational posture.

1385
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:40,440
So the prevention part, it
kinda is finding improvements

1386
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,680
to my operational posture
based on what it notices

1387
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,880
about the things that
seem to keep breaking.

1388
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,920
When it looks at all the past
incidents and investigated

1389
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,770
and looks for patterns of
things that you should improve.

1390
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,200
Great.

1391
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,260
So, Bill, you wanna wrap
us up and talk about

1392
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,633
how to get everybody
started with everything?

1393
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,861
- Yeah, so thank you, David, for that,

1394
00:56:05,861 --> 00:56:08,280
and for all of you to be here.

1395
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,720
So we, as I mentioned earlier,

1396
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,360
we launched in public preview yesterday.

1397
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,250
And so what that means is it's available

1398
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,110
as a service in the AWS console.

1399
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,840
You can go there, get it
set up, search on Google,

1400
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,120
you'll find the docs, you'll
find there's some links there

1401
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:25,050
that have provided for you and try it out.

1402
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,690
Public preview means it's free to use.

1403
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,900
You might have some charges
like if you're, you know,

1404
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,960
the actions that the agent takes to query

1405
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,280
some of your logs and traces.

1406
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,670
If those generate expense,
you may have some expense,

1407
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:41,400
but we won't charge you
for the agent itself.

1408
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,450
There are some limits.

1409
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:45,600
So you get 20 per account that you set up

1410
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:50,130
per set of agents that you deploy.

1411
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:53,340
You get 20 hours of
investigation time per month

1412
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,950
and 15 hours of prevention time per month.

1413
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,530
So plenty to give it a try.

1414
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:00,120
So super easy to set up.

1415
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:00,953
I hope you saw that.

1416
00:57:00,953 --> 00:57:03,390
It has a lot of power already.

1417
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:04,830
I'll anticipate the first question.

1418
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:06,480
Are we thinking about
giving it the ability

1419
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,730
to actually take actions
in your environment?

1420
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:11,010
The answer is yes, that's
something that we're working on,

1421
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,410
but we want to step into that closely.

1422
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,120
You should be able to
see that there's a lot

1423
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,430
of promise there, but give it a try.

1424
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,940
You can get it set up running
in a couple of AWS accounts

1425
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,670
with literally, in just
a couple of clicks.

1426
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:25,650
Start asking a question,
seeing you know what it can do.

1427
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,380
Throw alarms at it, throw questions at it.

1428
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,500
I'd love to get you trying it
out and give us your feedback.

1429
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,094
So again, thank you for your time.

1430
00:57:33,094 --> 00:57:33,927
(audience applauds)

1431
00:57:33,927 --> 00:57:35,880
We have a few minutes for questions

1432
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,330
and we can take some
questions on the side after.
