1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,730
- Hi, and welcome.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,720
Hopefully you are here

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,897
for Your AI Agent Is Expensive
and Wrong (Let's Fix Both).

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,430
If you're not, enjoy the next 60 minutes

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,180
and for those of you who I recognize

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,630
from past re:Invent or
data and AI Summit talks,

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,131
thank you for coming again

8
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:25,131
and pleasuring us with your presence here.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,890
So (clears throat) my name's Craig Wiley.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,770
I run product management
for AI and ML at Databricks,

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,980
joined today by Nic, Vikram, and Marcos,

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,510
Nic also from Databricks

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,510
and Vikram and Marcos from Conde Nast,

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,820
who will talk a little
bit about taking some

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,070
of what we're doing, what we talk about

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,420
in the first half of this,

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,910
about how they've
implemented that successfully

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,883
at Conde Nast so far,
so let's dive right in.

19
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,860
So this is what we're gonna do.

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,080
We're gonna talk a little bit about why,

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,090
why a different approach
to AI agents is needed.

22
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,320
We're gonna go do a big,
thick, long, meaty demo.

23
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,780
Conde Nast will come
up and talk for a bit,

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,520
and then we'll finish
off with any questions

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,050
and answers that you might have.

26
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,660
If, for some reason, we run out of time,

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,010
which is reasonably likely,
then we'll do Q&A up here

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,960
until they kick us out and then
we'll do it out in the hall.

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,660
So if you have questions,
feel free to keep 'em

30
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,190
and make sure they get answered.

31
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,030
So with that, apologies.

32
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,540
But you are, I believe,
I am contractually forced

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,090
to show you this slide, which is,

34
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,760
this is Gartner's annual comparison.

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,160
For those of you guys who
don't know, this is really,

36
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,370
I think used, Gartner says
this is used very infrequently

37
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,650
by actual customers and users,

38
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,650
and is mostly used by the
vendors to flex on each other.

39
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,730
And given that I was responsible

40
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,520
for building the AWS stack
and the Google stack,

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,283
this was a particularly
exciting flex for me.

42
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,280
But, so with that, let's dive in.

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,880
So, our goal at Databricks
is to help democratize data

44
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,080
and AI and that goal has
changed significantly

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,360
over just the last two or three years,

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,650
as I'm sure you can all imagine

47
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,560
with agentic AI becoming more and more

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,130
of a powerful force in the industry.

49
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,160
About three years ago, our CEO,

50
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,040
or I should say yeah, three,
just about three years ago,

51
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,870
little less, about two
and a half years ago,

52
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,480
our CEO actually got up on stage

53
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,280
at our annual conference
and said, in the future,

54
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,232
you're just gonna use natural language

55
00:02:34,232 --> 00:02:38,160
to power Databricks and to use Databricks

56
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,220
and while we're not there today yet,

57
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,600
today on Databricks,
you can build pipelines

58
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,230
with natural language and
jobs with natural language.

59
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,030
You can, you know, build, you can,

60
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,800
you can do Text-to-SQL,

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,350
you can now do text to machine learning.

62
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,930
You can now do text to agent.

63
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,060
You can do text to visualization.

64
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,490
So you, while you can't
do kind of text to all

65
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,190
of Databricks, you can get pretty close

66
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,270
with some of the capabilities.

67
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,673
And we'll talk about some of those today.

68
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:14,070
This is Databricks, by
the way, more or less.

69
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,200
At the lowest level, we have your data

70
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,310
in open formats, in cheap blob storage.

71
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,690
On top of that, we have Unity
Catalog designed not only

72
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,860
to govern and access
control that data layer,

73
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,860
but also designed to really be the brain

74
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,400
and the kind of metadata
collection system to be able

75
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,530
to power some really cool capabilities,

76
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,120
which we'll talk about shortly.

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,210
Then you have Agent Bricks,
our ability to orchestrate

78
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,430
and build agents on top of all of this.

79
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,620
And then you have a
series of engines, right?

80
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,220
AI/BI, our business intelligence
capabilities, right?

81
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,040
Our apps capabilities, Lakeflow,

82
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,840
our pipe lining capabilities, Lakehouse,

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,910
our data warehouse capabilities,

84
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,470
and Lakebase, our new OLTP capabilities.

85
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,880
I don't know about all of you,

86
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,540
but in my experience,
every data professional

87
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,440
spent some amount of time
early in their career

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,420
where they said, you know, oh yeah,

89
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,810
I'll just go get the information
out of the data warehouse.

90
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,790
And they go and they
look and they're like,

91
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,620
hey, the information's
not in the data warehouse

92
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,450
and someone smart in the company said,

93
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,983
yeah, it's in the database.

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,963
And you go, wait a
minute, there's two...why?

95
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,067
And you know, they,
oh, well, OLAP and OLTP

96
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:38,970
and we all just nod and go,
oh yeah, that makes sense.

97
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,800
Those should be separate.

98
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,990
But no, no, they shouldn't be, right?

99
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,060
They should hopefully,
in the fullness of time,

100
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,180
be one thing and so,
you know, it's with that

101
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,730
that we're really excited about
some of those capabilities.

102
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,000
So today we're really gonna
talk about three things.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,600
We're gonna talk about Unity
Catalog for a hot second.

104
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,160
We're gonna talk about AI/BI

105
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,410
and some of the natural
language capabilities

106
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,400
we've brought into that,

107
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,680
because those end up
being really important

108
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,860
to some of our agentic capabilities.

109
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,870
And then we'll dive into Agent Bricks

110
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,450
and what it means to build
an agent with Agent Bricks

111
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,450
and how and why that's
different from building agents,

112
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,390
maybe using other
platforms or other tools.

113
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,320
So this is how I think
about the AI opportunity

114
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,330
sitting in front of all of us right now

115
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,290
is how do I simplify the creation for you

116
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,290
of high quality AI apps and
agents on your data, right?

117
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:36,450
And we're very clear about what we mean

118
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,910
by high quality, right?

119
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,730
What we mean is we want it to be accurate

120
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,090
and secure enough that
you could implement it

121
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,370
in the path of risk, right?

122
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,070
Either financial risk, maybe
in an internal workflow,

123
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,200
or maybe externally in reputational risk

124
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,950
as you expose it to your
customers or your users, right?

125
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,860
This is really a different goal, right?

126
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,160
Most of my competitors will say,

127
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,040
we wanna simplify the
creation of these systems.

128
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,220
We want to give you one click RAG, right?

129
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,560
But really, and those, that's great.

130
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,230
And listen, if what you're trying to build

131
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,370
is a little personal productivity hack

132
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,150
for you and your colleagues,
those are great tools.

133
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,000
But we see the problem
slightly differently,

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,110
which is if you were to go deploy an agent

135
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,020
into the path of risk,
either externally facing

136
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,790
or into some sort of internal workflow

137
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,910
that, at some point, you hope
to be hands off the wheel

138
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,680
and allow it just to run autonomously.

139
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,500
If you expect to be
able to deploy an agent

140
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,970
into those environments,

141
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,300
your CFO is gonna have questions, right?

142
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,590
Your CFO is gonna ask two things, right?

143
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,870
They're gonna ask if you
can govern this thing.

144
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,930
And by govern, I don't just
mean access management,

145
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,540
I don't just mean, you know,
who can call the agent.

146
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,940
I mean, who can call, I do
mean who can call the agent,

147
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,180
but I also mean what
precisely is the agent capable

148
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,300
of doing at every
intermediate step, right?

149
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,330
What are all the systems it has access to?

150
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,410
What are, so what's it capable
of and what is it doing?

151
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,630
How, what's your strategy for monitoring

152
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,790
and logging and ensuring that it's doing

153
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,200
what you thought it would, right?

154
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,470
Fundamentally, can you control it, right?

155
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,000
So the first thing your
CFO is gonna wanna know

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,530
is can you control it?

157
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,480
And the second thing they're gonna want

158
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,197
to know is is it any
good, does it work, right?

159
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,920
And you know, today more than 85 percent

160
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,390
of agents are vibe tested, right?

161
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,120
So, you know, I build an
agent and then I sit there

162
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,740
and I go, hmm, yeah, seems
to work pretty good, right?

163
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,950
Which is fine, hmm, maybe not.

164
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,190
But you know, if I said to you, hey,

165
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,840
we're gonna give up on unit testing

166
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,000
for all our computer
science from here on out,

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,430
we're just gonna have
you try the happy path,

168
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,120
see if it works well, and
then just deploy it, right?

169
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,280
Most of us would never tolerate that.

170
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,770
Or maybe we would, but
our bosses might not.

171
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:09,270
But fundamentally, if you're going

172
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,900
to go deploy these things,
you need to know whether

173
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,670
or not they work, right?

174
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,850
I wouldn't build you a
forecast, a sales forecast,

175
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,370
and then say, you know, you
say, oh, how accurate is it?

176
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,070
And I go, I don't know, it's
pretty good, isn't it, right?

177
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,650
No, I would tell you
the R-squared or the AUC

178
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,920
or some other measure of fit.

179
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,440
Well, here, we want to give
you that same opportunity,

180
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,180
that ability to, using
evaluation, drive these things

181
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,880
to a point where they can be
deployed in the path of risk

182
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,790
and where you can
communicate their performance

183
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:46,110
quantitatively to your
colleagues and others, right?

184
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,510
So let's start with Unity Catalog

185
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,610
and a quick view on Unity Catalog,

186
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,860
why Unity Catalog is important.

187
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,450
Well, I talked a minute ago about the fact

188
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,990
that not only do I want to
govern access to this agent,

189
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,250
I actually want to govern

190
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,830
every single thing this agent does.

191
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,620
If this agent looks at
data, I want to know that.

192
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,410
If this agent calls an
API, I want to know that.

193
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,360
I want to know what it's capable of doing

194
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,740
and what it did on every
single time it was used, right?

195
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,250
And so Unity Catalog does that, right?

196
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,050
We not only, not only does
Unity Catalog govern tables,

197
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,924
it governs unstructured data,
it governs embeddings, right?

198
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:30,924
It governs tools, it
governs API calls, right?

199
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,690
It can govern all of these capabilities.

200
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,970
And when I say govern,
not only can it control

201
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,550
who can go do those things,

202
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,550
but it can log every
time they're done, right?

203
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,180
And recently, oh, I should
say it can govern prompts,

204
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,080
it can govern GenAI models and
the access to those models.

205
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,330
And then, most recently, we announced

206
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,700
it can govern MCP servers.

207
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,840
So you can stand up a managed
MCP server inside Databricks

208
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,360
and have any of the
Databricks assets, right?

209
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,350
Any of the queries or the
Text-to-SQL Genie Rooms

210
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,350
or the APIs in there, or
the tools you've built

211
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,010
or the queries you've built,
all of those can be represented

212
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,900
behind an MCP server that
then your agents can call

213
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,020
and access those artifacts
within Databricks.

214
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,080
But that's not it because
we don't just want

215
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,870
to be able to govern the agents

216
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,910
that you build on Databricks.

217
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,320
If we gave you the opportunity

218
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,030
to govern just the models on Databricks,

219
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,030
then everywhere you build
models, you would have

220
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,170
to have a separate view of how to govern

221
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:43,410
and access control and monitor them there.

222
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,390
So instead, what we've
done is we've made it

223
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,210
so you can take external MCP servers,

224
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,910
maybe you have an MCP server
that's part of a SaaS system.

225
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,200
Maybe you have an MCP server

226
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,620
that someone else in a different
department built, right?

227
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,240
You can register those MCP
servers inside Unity Catalog.

228
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,680
And now anything that you want your agent

229
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,370
to go and access can be accessed,

230
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,160
even if it's a separate
SaaS system, right?

231
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,850
Those APIs or that MCP
server can be packaged up,

232
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,460
registered inside Databricks,
and now your agent,

233
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,590
instead of going off and
calling that MCP server

234
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,820
will call it through Databricks,

235
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,320
and we'll be able to log and monitor

236
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,740
every single thing it does, right?

237
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,090
This is really when I, not
long after the pandemic struck,

238
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,850
I had a meeting with the
Head of Trust and Safety

239
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,550
at one of the world's largest retailers.

240
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,070
And I said to her, hey,
when the pandemic struck

241
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,520
and all of the human
behavioral models went bananas,

242
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,970
because we all thought that
toilet paper was more valuable

243
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,140
than gold, like, how on
earth did you prioritize

244
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,913
which models to retrain when?

245
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,510
And she kind of sheepishly
smiled at me and said,

246
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,293
Craig, you think we know
where all our models are?

247
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,380
Right, there's some laughter,

248
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,190
some uncomfortable laughter
in the room, right?

249
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,430
If that model that was
built was some forecast

250
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,230
for used, you know, mystery
books, maybe I don't care.

251
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,350
But if that model had access to APIs,

252
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,790
if that model could take
actions on behalf of my company,

253
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,790
then not monitoring it very closely

254
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,680
and knowing exactly what it's doing

255
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,137
starts to become a liability, right?

256
00:12:28,137 --> 00:12:30,650
And so that's why Unity
Catalog is central to this,

257
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:35,160
is it can become that hub of
governance and monitoring,

258
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,530
not just of the agent itself, but of all

259
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,320
of the different things these
agents might want to touch.

260
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,230
Now, monitoring is the
second half of this, right?

261
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,570
Now, we run monitoring not only

262
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,450
for classical things
like tokens and latency

263
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,800
and all of these kinds of things,

264
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,010
but we'll actually run LLM
judges as a part of the monitor

265
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,390
so that you can measure things

266
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,690
like ongoing correctness, right?

267
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,900
Or you can start looking
through your logs to see, hey,

268
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,810
are there particular
subject matters that I tend

269
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,900
to get wrong more than other
subject matters, right?

270
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,660
And this can become a way in
which you can really start

271
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,900
to surgically go after the performance

272
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,700
of your system, right?

273
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,520
So that's a quick overview
of why Unity Catalog

274
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,200
is so important to all of this.

275
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,660
Now, I wanna dive into AI/BI,

276
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,760
and you can really think about agents

277
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,680
on Databricks in two ways.

278
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,760
One is we're building a
bunch of agents to make it so

279
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,370
that you can use Databricks more easily.

280
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,070
The second is, we're building tools so

281
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,680
that you can build
agents more effectively.

282
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,440
And so I wanted to talk
for a minute about AI/BI

283
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,400
because it's really central
to some of the agents

284
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,100
that we've been building
that are getting reused

285
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,960
when people build agents themselves.

286
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,780
First of all, we've seen
massive user growth,

287
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,630
five hundred percent
year over year growth.

288
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,360
And by the way, this AI/BI capability,

289
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,770
these capabilities,
they're...can't say free,

290
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,800
but they just cost you the
cost of the queries, right?

291
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,970
They don't cost you extra.

292
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,730
You don't have to go get a
separate contract to use this

293
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,380
or an addendum or anything.

294
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,090
You can just start using it, right?

295
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,740
That's part of what's driven this growth.

296
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,790
It allows you to have
text to visualization.

297
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,430
You can just say, hey, show me the sales

298
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,613
by region over the last
six months, you know,

299
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,190
you know, broken down by product

300
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,360
or something along those lines.

301
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,650
And you'll get a dashboard

302
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,040
and then you can filter this
dashboard, move these around,

303
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,170
you know, kind of do all the things

304
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,840
you would expect in a modern BI tool.

305
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,790
But you've created the entire thing

306
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,020
with natural language, right?

307
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,580
Now, we all know, I'm saying
we because I'm guessing

308
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,890
other data professionals in the room

309
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,230
that, when an executive
comes to you and says,

310
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,773
hey, can you build me a dashboard...

311
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:57,510
(exhales) that's a rough day.

312
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,000
Because not only are you
building a dashboard,

313
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,790
but you are now answering
an unlimited number

314
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,310
of deep dive questions
about that dashboard, right?

315
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,860
Dashboards don't create answers.

316
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,650
Dashboards create more questions, right?

317
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,570
Where people are constantly saying,

318
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,360
oh yeah, sales rep, why were they up?

319
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,940
Sales were down, why
were they down, right?

320
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,100
All of these questions, we
used to, when I was at Amazon,

321
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,660
we used to joke that, you know,

322
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,610
hey, I wanna know what sales were.

323
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,960
And as soon as you told
them, they were like,

324
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,720
I meant for blue things, right?

325
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,640
And so, how do you get ahead of that?

326
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,780
Well, not only can you
use natural language

327
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,730
to build these visualizations,

328
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,970
you can start talking to your data.

329
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,790
You can ask questions of your data, right?

330
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,250
You can go in and just
start saying, you know,

331
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,960
hey, what was it that drove sales?

332
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,780
I will tell you that this TXT-to-SQL,

333
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,700
or this TXT-to-SQL capability

334
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,770
or Genie Rooms, as you'll
often hear it called,

335
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,093
or Genie Spaces,

336
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,950
it has a remarkable capability

337
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,230
that's recently been announced,

338
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,210
which is it has a deep research

339
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,490
capability attached to it now.

340
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,970
So the deep research capability
won't just answer questions.

341
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,160
I mean, it will answer
questions about the data,

342
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,010
but it'll start to answer
much more complex questions.

343
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,100
Hey, describe to me where
the most efficient places

344
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,680
in my sales funnel would be for me

345
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,040
to invest incremental
marketing dollars, right?

346
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,410
And it will go through, it'll build a plan

347
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,780
for how it would go after this problem.

348
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,250
It'll check that plan with you,

349
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,620
and then it'll start
running the queries it needs

350
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,360
to across all of your tables in order

351
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,730
to start informing that plan.

352
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,060
I had an amazing moment with
a customer just two weeks ago

353
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,200
where he said they had a whole bunch

354
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,570
of supply chain data in here,

355
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,590
and he asked it for
some help understanding

356
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,720
what some of the supply chain costs

357
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,460
and risks would be on some

358
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,553
of their transpacific
transportation routes.

359
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,380
He hit enter, it came up
with a plan, he waited,

360
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,710
and then it stopped and it said, hey,

361
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,560
I don't have all the
data I need to do this.

362
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,963
I need you to give me
access to another table.

363
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,890
And I say that 'cause that's a huge leap

364
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,180
for this technology.

365
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,400
For this technology, and
we're seeing this both

366
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,400
in our system as well as in
some of the foundation models

367
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,700
that they're just not making stuff up

368
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,230
at quite the rate they were back

369
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,390
when we were talking about GPT-35

370
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,500
and what have you, right?

371
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,350
We can start to, it's
starting to get to a place

372
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,020
where we can, if we're
careful, we can start building

373
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,300
that trust a lot more effectively.

374
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,390
And so, and then finally in
private preview right now,

375
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,040
we have a data science agent.

376
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,230
Now, I'll tell you that
on that last slide,

377
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,750
that TXT-to-SQL deep dive capability,

378
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,050
that one hit home for me

379
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,493
because that was my first job in tech.

380
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,370
I was the guy who wrote really good SQL,

381
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,800
who could answer the
questions that the VP had,

382
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,930
and I could answer them
quickly and effectively.

383
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,760
And that got me a lot of credibility

384
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,193
and notoriety from the
VP, which was great.

385
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,390
That's now being done by the agent.

386
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,180
Well, now we have a data science agent.

387
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,650
This data science agent
will help you analyze data,

388
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,530
help you determine what
features might be useful

389
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,930
for predicting a problem,
and then will actually go

390
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,420
and help you train the model, right?

391
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,820
We want to make it so that you could have

392
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,440
text to machine learning model.

393
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,410
We're not there yet, now it's
a collaborative back and forth

394
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,020
with you and the system,
but we're really excited

395
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,270
about some of the things we're
seeing from this already.

396
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,910
And my guess is that
by next time this year,

397
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,670
we'll be sitting there saying
like, hey, this is as easy

398
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,500
as asking a question of your data.

399
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,663
Maybe, maybe a year and a half, we'll see.

400
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,250
And then lastly, we have a
whole series of SQL capabilities

401
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,900
that can be used to go
and run GenAI, right?

402
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,580
Things like ai_parse_document,

403
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,540
which you'll hear about
very shortly, ai_query.

404
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,130
So ai_query allows you to run

405
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,130
any arbitrary prompt as part of a query.

406
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,020
So maybe you have a table
that you wanna score,

407
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,990
every row of that table,
or you want to summarize

408
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,420
every blurb in that table
or something like that.

409
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,100
That can easily be done with a single line

410
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,980
of SQL at this point.

411
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,940
So now we move into the meat
of it, into Agent Bricks,

412
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,550
into this new way of thinking
about building agents.

413
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,930
This really evaluation-centric
way of building agents.

414
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,533
It's hard to build AI
agents today, we know this.

415
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,790
We know a lot of companies will come to us

416
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,450
and say, hey, we've
tried, we've struggled.

417
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,830
You know, we're having a hard time.

418
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,850
It's even harder to build
high quality AI agents, right?

419
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,350
And so when we think about quality,

420
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,670
it comes down to evaluation.

421
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,130
And this is just a quick
view of our eval stack,

422
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,610
but the key to this eval system,

423
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,830
so we built this long about a year

424
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,450
before we built Agent Bricks

425
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,220
and the key to this eval system was,

426
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,990
see those little red circles?

427
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,840
Those little red circles
are where the judges failed

428
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,400
that line in the eval and the key is that

429
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,160
if you click on one of
those little red circles,

430
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,520
you don't just get, you get a
description of why it failed

431
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,932
and not, you get, you know, hey,

432
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:11,550
here's why we think it failed.

433
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,130
Here's the input and the
output at the specific step

434
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,580
of the agent that we saw
that we believe failed

435
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,270
and most importantly,
here's what you should go do

436
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,870
to fix it, right, as soon
as we had that concept

437
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,980
of here's what you should go do

438
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,930
to fix it, everything changed

439
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,280
and the reason everything changed

440
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,770
is it allowed us to build Agent Bricks.

441
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,110
Now, what is Agent Bricks?

442
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,130
Well, in the market today, you
can kind of think about cost

443
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,640
or about complexity versus quality.

444
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,470
And what we have in the
market today is we have these

445
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,690
no-code builders, right?

446
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,680
Where, you know, hey,
they're super easy to use

447
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,680
and they produce kind of static,
low quality agents, right?

448
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,600
And you kind of have to put up
with whatever they produced.

449
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,460
And they're great, by the way,

450
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,770
if what you're doing is creating a system

451
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,290
that prioritizes your emails
and writes you a summary

452
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,460
of all your emails from last
night, great, go for it.

453
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,990
But if you're wanting to put something

454
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,060
in the path of risk, you
need something better.

455
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,590
And so we have these
complex, very complex kind

456
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,920
of DIY agents that are
very high quality, right?

457
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,320
We can tune them and continue to tune them

458
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,060
until we get the quality we want.

459
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,560
But they're really complex
and difficult to build.

460
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,030
Ultimately, our goal with Agent Bricks

461
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,330
is the impossible in-between.

462
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,490
We wanna make it easy for high quality.

463
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,000
We wanna make it so that
you can very quickly

464
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,530
and very easily spin up
an agent that performs

465
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,620
or that you can then
tune until you can get it

466
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,490
to perform at kind of
whatever your exit criteria is

467
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,810
for your use case, right?

468
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,960
Evaluation is difficult, so we
immediately went after that.

469
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,670
There's too many knobs.

470
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,500
And when I say there's too many knobs,

471
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,790
there's actually not a lot of knobs.

472
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,990
The problem is that the
state-of-the-art methods

473
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,640
for building these agents is changing

474
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,900
every two to eight weeks, depending on

475
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,640
what kind of agent you're building.

476
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,490
So, you know, what we
see is usually the people

477
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,310
who are building these
agents are app developers.

478
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,140
And what we see is they come in

479
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,170
and they do a great job
of building an agent,

480
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,850
but they may not be up on

481
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,420
what the latest research
was released last month.

482
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,110
And so what Agent Bricks is
designed to do (clears throat)

483
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,870
is it's designed to take
that latest research

484
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,400
and those latest techniques

485
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,280
and bring them into the system, right?

486
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,860
And then, so that you don't
have to worry about the knobs,

487
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,120
you don't have to worry about

488
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,230
how you're gonna structure
your vector search queries

489
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,940
'cause we'll just take
care of that for you.

490
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,260
And then finally, there's a trade off

491
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,580
of cost versus quality.

492
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,597
We all know that GenAI can
be a costly endeavor, right?

493
00:22:54,597 --> 00:22:58,860
And so having the ability
to be really deliberate

494
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,070
about how I'm going to spend
and how I'm going to trade off

495
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,680
cost versus quality is something
that's really important.

496
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,690
If you're all of a sudden
going to put something

497
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,540
in maybe an externally facing capacity

498
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,150
where you could end up
with, you know, thousands,

499
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,040
tens of thousands, maybe if you're lucky,

500
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,210
hundreds of thousands or
millions of queries, right?

501
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,760
And so with that, we have a series

502
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,760
of Databricks, or sorry, of Agent Bricks.

503
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,510
And those, those agent
bricks are really designed

504
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,400
as kind of templated patterns

505
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,950
that you can come in
and start using, right?

506
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,440
Hey, you need a RAG, you
need basically a RAG system

507
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,120
or a knowledge assistant, great.

508
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,240
Grab the knowledge assistant Agent Brick

509
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,650
and you're off to the races.

510
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,990
Now we start with information extraction.

511
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,990
Information extraction takes
your unstructured documents.

512
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,130
Maybe you've got receipts,

513
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,860
maybe you've got shipping documents,

514
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,250
maybe you've got contracts, right?

515
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,180
It takes those and breaks
them into structured data.

516
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,620
Literally, you go upload your documents

517
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,390
and then into Agent Bricks,
it identifies the schema,

518
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,160
says here's all the fields I'm gonna pull

519
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,300
out of these documents,
describes to you each field.

520
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,970
And then you have a choice, do
you want to keep that field?

521
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,050
Do you wanna erase it, is
it important, is it not?

522
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,110
Do you wanna add other fields
and describe them for us?

523
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,760
Right, and then we're off to the races.

524
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,150
Now with all of the Agent Bricks,

525
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,670
the idea is that once you've built it,

526
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,950
unfortunately; you're not done

527
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:35,940
'cause then what we're gonna do

528
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,950
is we're gonna start giving you examples

529
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,590
and we're gonna start
asking you for examples

530
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,330
of, hey, ask me a question

531
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,860
that you would expect
it to be able to answer.

532
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,270
Or here's some synthetic questions

533
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,430
I would expect it to be able to answer.

534
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,830
What do you think of these responses?

535
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,450
And you'll sit there
and go, well, one, two,

536
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,520
and three are good, four is not so good,

537
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,100
and five is a train wreck.

538
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,020
You know, and so we'll sit there

539
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,700
and as soon as you give us that feedback,

540
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,850
we're gonna go tune the system
and then come back to you

541
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,400
and say, hey, let's try
another few examples.

542
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,180
And we're gonna keep doing
that back and forth with you

543
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,600
until it gets to a point
where you're really excited

544
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,150
and satisfied by the outputs, right?

545
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,700
And so making it really easy to just kind

546
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,360
of take those documents and
build them into structured data.

547
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,720
Knowledge assistant,
same idea except for RAG.

548
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,730
So you have a corpus of text that you want

549
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,540
to make searchable and you wanna be able

550
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,270
to answer questions about
that text and what have you.

551
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:37,620
Great, upload the text into
Agent Bricks, start to engage

552
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,387
with the system on asking it questions

553
00:25:39,387 --> 00:25:41,130
and it giving you responses

554
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,360
so that you can give it feedback.

555
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,370
And by the way, when you say one, two,

556
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,960
and three are good, four needs work

557
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,520
and five is a train wreck,

558
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,723
we're actually gonna ask you
why are four and five bad?

559
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,660
And we're not just going to go and guess.

560
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,100
You're gonna tell us, hey,

561
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,990
four is using outdated information

562
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,240
and five, like it totally ignored one

563
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,910
of the policies we have, right?

564
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,710
And we can take that feedback

565
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,660
and we can drive that direct feedback

566
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,700
back into the system, right?

567
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,580
We can more easily reason
over our knowledge, right?

568
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,370
Automatic vector search
creation and optimization.

569
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,790
All you have to do is upload the data

570
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:20,130
and then talk to us for
a while about whether

571
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,780
or not the responses are
responses you're excited by.

572
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,070
And then multi-agent supervisor,

573
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,440
this one to me is the most exciting one.

574
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,330
Multi-agent supervisor takes
a series of other agents,

575
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:38,330
MCP servers, tools, other capabilities,

576
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,880
and is able to work large kind

577
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,080
of longer running workflows
over these MCP servers,

578
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,120
tools, and other agents, right?

579
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,920
Really allowing you to build

580
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,380
some pretty remarkable capabilities,

581
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,750
which we'll see here very shortly, right?

582
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,720
You can see here, you
know, being able to talk

583
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,170
over both data and unstruc- you know,

584
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,910
both structured and
unstructured data, right?

585
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,210
Can I ask questions of both my query

586
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,280
or both my unstructured data as well

587
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,410
as my policies and manuals, right?

588
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,590
You know, can I build tools so

589
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,970
that I can drive higher levels

590
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,430
of determinism in my agent, right?

591
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,260
And then ultimately, we
have the ability for you

592
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,120
to code your own agent as well

593
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,580
and the ability for you to kind of dive in

594
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,210
and use, you know, all of
the most popular libraries

595
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,100
and what have you, to
go build your own agent

596
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,140
if you prefer to do that.

597
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,180
So the great news is we're seeing some

598
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,220
extraordinarily high quality.

599
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,350
This is a comparison to two of the clouds,

600
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,203
neither of which we are
representing here today.

601
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:44,337
And so you can see how we were
able to beat this blue cloud

602
00:27:44,337 --> 00:27:49,320
and this rainbow cloud
in their efforts on RAG.

603
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,750
And that not only does
our performance beat them

604
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,840
because we have some of those
latest techniques built in,

605
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,810
but our performance continues
to improve as we keep

606
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,390
that continuous learning
loop going, right?

607
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,910
So how are we able to do this, right?

608
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,220
Let's say you're building that
classic kind of, you know,

609
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,560
HR chat bot with, you know, hey,

610
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,660
I want it to answer all of my HR policies

611
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,120
and someone asks it a
question about vacation time

612
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,060
and you say, you know, hey,
that's the wrong answer.

613
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,070
Wait, that's before we changed the policy

614
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,483
back in May of 2020.

615
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,450
So you tell the system, hey, I want you

616
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,520
to ignore all data before May of 2020.

617
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,830
So the system goes in and it does that,

618
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,170
it changes the what's
available in the vector search,

619
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,410
it adds, you know, parameters
to all of the tool calling.

620
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,320
It builds LLM judges to make sure

621
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,270
that moving forward, we measure

622
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,660
any time we pull data
from before then, right?

623
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,580
So that feedback we're
actually going to use

624
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,890
to build judges to ensure that we meet it

625
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,620
and then it's gonna reoptimize
the entire workflow, right?

626
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,660
This is a huge step in steerability.

627
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,650
I would argue that in a
year, probably in a year,

628
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,350
maybe a year and a half,
depending on the level of urgency,

629
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,790
I think this is the product that all

630
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,000
of the major vendors are gonna
be competing with, right?

631
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,180
How can I use natural
language to both build

632
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,210
and tune my agent, right?

633
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,100
That's the product that we all are looking

634
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,450
for and that we all want.

635
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,000
And so really excited to
be able to deliver that

636
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,190
to you today in beta.

637
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,260
With that, I'm gonna invite Nic up

638
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,273
to give us a quick demo of all of this.

639
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,850
- Awesome, thank you, Craig.

640
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,670
That is epic, for sure.
(audience claps)

641
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,680
It won't be the last time he's
up, so you can still get him

642
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,210
for Q&A at the end but he deserves

643
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,133
a round of applause, for sure.

644
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,590
All right, so I'm gonna take
you through a whirlwind tour

645
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,120
of a lot of what you just saw,

646
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,870
but to kind of tee it up, who
here is excited to go home

647
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,750
after re:Invent and
uncrumple all your receipts

648
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,273
and go start submitting
your expense reports?

649
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,150
Show of hands, all right,
security, no, I'm kidding.

650
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,880
So I'm gonna use that as an
excuse to kind of show you

651
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,040
how I built this end-to-end on Databricks,

652
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,140
starting from, I literally took a picture

653
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,570
of my receipts and all the way to the end

654
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,480
to where I have something
submitted and approved.

655
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,400
So we're actually gonna start off,

656
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,840
and Craig alluded to this a little bit,

657
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,000
but Unity Catalog really is the foundation

658
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,940
of everything across
Databricks, whether it's AI,

659
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,550
whether it's our ETL,
everything both starts

660
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,230
and ends in Unity Catalog.

661
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,770
And so, this demo's also
gonna start in Unity Catalog.

662
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:20,550
Unity Catalog can store tables, volumes,

663
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,990
functions, all sorts of things.

664
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,900
And so what you're looking
at is a Unity Catalog volume

665
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,480
that I've uploaded all
of my receipts into.

666
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,970
So, you can see I click in,
it'll give me a nice preview

667
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,610
as long as the internet's a little snappy.

668
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,890
Yeah, cool, okay, so you'll see

669
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,240
not even a great picture, right?

670
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,370
It's like kinda at a weird angle.

671
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,530
Now, if I wanna start
doing something with this,

672
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,960
I need to actually extract
all the information

673
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,080
out of this receipt, now a few years ago,

674
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,250
that might've been pretty challenging,

675
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,640
but today, especially using
Agent Bricks, it's super easy.

676
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,260
So the first thing I'm gonna do over here

677
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,050
on the bottom left, I'm
gonna click into Agents

678
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,170
and that's gonna take us
to our Agent Bricks page.

679
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,030
Now you'll see there are a lot of them

680
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,440
and we're actually gonna touch,

681
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,300
I think every single one
of them through here.

682
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,940
But we're gonna start off
with information extraction.

683
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,470
And here you'll see there's two buttons.

684
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,110
We've got Use PDFs, and
then we've got Build.

685
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,640
And that's generally
because we're gonna take

686
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,590
a little bit of a two step process.

687
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,930
So first, we need to take from images

688
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,080
and get the data from
images into an actual table.

689
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,840
So for this we can click Use PDFs.

690
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,480
It's as easy as pointing it to a volume

691
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,200
like you just saw, here's all
my receipts, can it confirm?

692
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,240
And then I just tell it
where I want it stored.

693
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,390
I gave it my destination
table, I can rename it.

694
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,940
I've already run this before, you know,

695
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,750
in the interest of time.

696
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,090
And so if I were to hit Start Import,

697
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,300
what you're gonna see is this.

698
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,340
You're gonna get now your raw parse data.

699
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,220
This is what the information
extraction was able

700
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,930
to kind of pull out of that image.

701
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:49,890
And then you're gonna get this kind

702
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,390
of semi-structured data, right?

703
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,180
You've got a block of text,
it's got the information

704
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,040
that was in that receipt, but it's not

705
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,650
in a really robust format that you can

706
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,320
really reliably start building on top of.

707
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,380
So if we go back to our agent page,

708
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,630
that's when we would
click this build button.

709
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,100
So what build is gonna take us

710
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,500
to is actually creating the second part

711
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,810
of this information extraction agent.

712
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,620
So we're gonna point it to
this table that's the output

713
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,270
of the one we just saw.

714
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,820
We're gonna tell it where the text is

715
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,190
and it'll actually auto
generate the sample

716
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,810
of what it thinks that you want

717
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,540
to actually extract out of this data.

718
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,300
Now when you hit Create
Agent, what it's gonna do

719
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,360
is it's actually gonna go
through a couple of them

720
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,030
and it's gonna extract
what it assumed you wanted.

721
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,050
And on the right hand side,

722
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,390
it's gonna give you a
whole bunch of definitions

723
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,343
for the values that it extracted.

724
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,620
You can now go and tweak these.

725
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,080
If you say, uh, you know what, location

726
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,360
for me needs to be only the city, right?

727
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,280
I don't need to know the exact restaurant.

728
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,980
And so you can kind of
come in here and tweak.

729
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,360
And then, the really cool part
is you can add new fields.

730
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,330
For example, if you might
need to know the number

731
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,180
of desserts, you can actually
add a totally new field.

732
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,790
You can describe what is in that field,

733
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,280
and this might be a little
bit foreshadowing later,

734
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,800
but it will figure out
how to pull that data,

735
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,320
using the examples you gave.

736
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,980
Now going back to what Craig
said about evaluations,

737
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,080
how do you know that this
extraction is working?

738
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,700
How do you know that the fields you wanted

739
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,040
to pull are actually being pulled?

740
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,250
We will automatically
build benchmarks for you,

741
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,760
and these benchmarks will look
at all of your extractions

742
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,400
and it'll use LLMs as judges to tell, hey,

743
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,740
this sample output
normally looks like this.

744
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,740
I'll give you an example for
this one that failed for match,

745
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,810
it says, look, the ground truth example

746
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,570
names the restaurant
name along with the city,

747
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,540
but this prediction only
has a city and state.

748
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,330
So now I can go and figure
out, oh, okay, cool,

749
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,890
I need to go update my description

750
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,860
because it doesn't know what
exactly I want it to give me.

751
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,410
I want just the city and state.

752
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,170
Once you're happy, you can
click this optimize button.

753
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,730
And I did promise that we are gonna make

754
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,100
your agents less expensive.

755
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,310
And I'll show you what the
output of that looks like.

756
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,290
Once you actually run the optimization,

757
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,120
it'll go away for an hour or so

758
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,270
and it'll run a whole bunch of
different techniques in order

759
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:15,300
to take your kind of, your
samples that you gave it

760
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,720
and the kind of relatively
big and high quality model

761
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,260
and fine tune that down to
a way more efficient model

762
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,120
while keeping the quality the same.

763
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,360
So you see that our
throughput went up massively

764
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,950
and our quality didn't even drop.

765
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,710
So it's much less expensive to run.

766
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,893
And now you can actually run
this on huge sets of data.

767
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,760
So now we've extracted this data, right?

768
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,160
We went from on the left
where we had this kind

769
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,410
of semi-structured block of text

770
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:47,130
to now this beautiful-structured
JSON on the right,

771
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,550
and now we've got all of our
receipts nicely extracted

772
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,063
and we can start figuring out
how to submit these things.

773
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,540
Now in order to do that,
we're gonna tab over here

774
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,610
to Unity Catalog again.

775
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,040
Now I said earlier, right, Unity Catalog,

776
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,900
it holds a lot of different things.

777
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,300
So if I go to volumes, you see
that we've got our receipts,

778
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,580
that's where we uploaded
all of our receipts.

779
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,733
We've got travel policies,
that's gonna come in handy later.

780
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,670
We've got some tables.

781
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,770
This is where we've parsed
those receipts out into

782
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,620
and it's also where the
information extraction agent

783
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,040
is dumping the final, beautiful JSON.

784
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,350
And we've also got functions.

785
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,140
So functions can be either Python or SQL.

786
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,990
You define them, you register
them into Unity Catalog.

787
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,960
And now what it lets you
do is really easily bind

788
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,150
these functions to your agents

789
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,610
so that your agents can call them

790
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,553
with proper authentication,
thanks to Unity Catalog.

791
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,150
Just so you can kind of take
a look at what these are,

792
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,860
they can be as simple as this.

793
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,620
So this is just a simple SQL query

794
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,660
and all it's doing is
it's grabbing the data

795
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,180
from both my receipts parse table

796
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,313
and the information extraction agent.

797
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,680
So now what we can do, we're
gonna go right back to agents

798
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,620
and we're gonna use also
my personal favorite agent,

799
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,780
the multi-agent supervisor.

800
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,760
We've got data, we've got some functions

801
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,080
that do stuff with that data.

802
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,880
We want an agent to actually do this all

803
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,260
for us, so we can hit Build

804
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,910
and now we can start
piecing together this agent.

805
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,070
Now I've kind of, I
ran this in the hallway

806
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,860
like 30 minutes ago just so
we don't have to wait here,

807
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,470
but I wanna show you first the
configuration of the agent.

808
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,750
So on the left hand side,

809
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,580
we've given it a really light description,

810
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,920
it helps users process expenses.

811
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,200
And then we've added two sub-agents.

812
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,060
These are just the two Unity Catalog

813
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,830
functions that I showed you earlier.

814
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:41,340
They allow this agent to
retrieve the parse data

815
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,920
that we looked at in the
information extraction,

816
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,570
and they allow it to
hit your expense, API,

817
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,790
whatever company you might use in order

818
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,740
to actually send the payload off

819
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,910
to your expense agency for approval.

820
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,070
So now we can tell it,
hey, can you retrieve

821
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,803
and summarize my dinner
expenses from Las Vegas?

822
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,310
So it will go through, it
calls that first function,

823
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,810
get uploaded expenses,
it'll give you a nice,

824
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,340
very clean summary, hey, you spent,

825
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,460
you know, about two hundred
dollars on dinners, awesome.

826
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,340
So I said, hey, can we go
ahead and submit these, right?

827
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,980
Naively, I thought that
in just about 10 minutes,

828
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,750
I had nailed this, so I'm like,
all right, we're good to go.

829
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,160
Yeah, go ahead and submit 'em.

830
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,250
And it said, sure, absolutely, goes ahead.

831
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,570
It knows how to do it, right?

832
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,700
And another thing that's
kind of hard to show here,

833
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,090
but in those functions,
it actually gives a lot

834
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,190
of descriptive kind of definitions

835
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,573
of what that function does.

836
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,910
Agent Bricks will automatically bring

837
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,110
that in thanks to Unity Catalog.

838
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,930
So it just knows how to use
these functions really well.

839
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,700
So it goes ahead, it submits some

840
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,470
and it tells me, hey, you're all good.

841
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,893
All three of your expenses are in, cool.

842
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,150
Let's fast forward a week, right?

843
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,450
All of a sudden, I get my
expense deposited in my account

844
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:02,253
and I'm like, that seems
a lot less than I spent.

845
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,667
So I go and I'm like, huh, I need to,

846
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,930
I need to go figure out what happened.

847
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,310
So I'm gonna go into Genie.

848
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,800
Now, Genie is our TXT-to-SQL solution

849
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,560
and I'm gonna bring in one of my tables,

850
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,470
historical expenses, so
this is where I'm pulling

851
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,330
from my expense agency just to see

852
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,420
kind of what was submitted
and what happened with it.

853
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,070
And so now I can actually ask it, hey,

854
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:27,330
can you show me if any of my
recent expenses were rejected?

855
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,910
And so it will go, it will do its analysis

856
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,730
as Craig showed earlier, it'll
even give you the game plan

857
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,740
and the reasoning that it used

858
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,940
and it came back and it said, hey,

859
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,120
you have two recent
expenses that were rejected.

860
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,200
Both were declined due to the
policy on desserts, right?

861
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,720
So if we look over here,
rejection reason, whoa,

862
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,340
more than one dessert per dinner

863
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,130
violates the travel and expense policy.

864
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,680
And I was a naughty boy in Vegas.

865
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,210
I was getting double
desserts, so let's fix that.

866
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,460
Now, it wasn't the agent's fault,

867
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,800
I just didn't give it
enough context, right?

868
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,130
It didn't know what the travel
policy was, I never told it.

869
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,710
So now we're gonna go
back into Agent Bricks

870
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,160
and we're gonna use our
knowledge assistant.

871
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,160
So if you go into Knowledge Assistant,

872
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,740
you'll see we've made a
very, very simple one.

873
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,450
We gave it a description, it's meant

874
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:22,260
to help users submit
valid expense reports.

875
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,090
And all we've done is pointed it

876
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:26,010
to our policy documentation,

877
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,530
again, in that Unity Catalog volume.

878
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,780
It figures out how to parse that PDF

879
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,130
and now I can actually ask it directly

880
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,280
hey, can you give me a summary

881
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,770
of why I can't get two desserts at dinner?

882
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,290
And, if it seems like I'm
a little upset about it,

883
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,553
trust your instincts.

884
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,510
So you'll see, it'll even
tell you what it's thinking,

885
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,430
it'll go, it'll pull all the information

886
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,200
that it needs from our policy.

887
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,310
And one thing that's really cool

888
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,900
is it'll even come with receipts.

889
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,910
So you can actually look to see exactly

890
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,320
what it referenced within our policy

891
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,310
in case you wanna double check

892
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,870
that it did everything correctly,

893
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,280
or if you wanna copy and paste it

894
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,020
and send a mean message on Slack,

895
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,823
asking somebody why this exists.

896
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,303
Now, because we have
this knowledge assistant,

897
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,920
we can go back into our
multi-agent supervisor, right?

898
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,710
And now, we're gonna add
this knowledge assistant

899
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,230
as another sub-agent that it can call.

900
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,600
And while we're at it, so here you'll see

901
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,340
that this one has a
little bit more, right?

902
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,290
We've got our travel expense agent,

903
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,270
this is our knowledge assistant.

904
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,520
We can also add that
Genie Space that we used

905
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,310
to figure out if the
expense was valid or not.

906
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:33,150
So now our agent can call
Genie to retrieve data

907
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,400
and then we still kept
our original two functions

908
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,760
so we can still pull
and submit our expenses.

909
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,093
So now when we ask it, hey,

910
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,933
can you retrieve any
rejected expenses from Vegas?

911
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,480
It will go through and
it's gonna pass that off

912
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,460
to Genie just like I did.

913
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,260
It's gonna get the two, you know,

914
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,630
expenses back that were declined.

915
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,120
It's gonna tell you
why they were declined.

916
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,500
And then I said, all
right, can we go ahead

917
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,230
and fix these by removing
the less expensive dessert,

918
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,300
recalculating the totals?

919
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,120
Sure it goes, it checks
with our travel assistant

920
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,060
to make sure that we're
following the policies correctly.

921
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,890
And we're just gonna
kinda skip through this.

922
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,090
It's telling you, hey, all right,

923
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,540
we applied these
corrections, we resubmitted,

924
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,140
and at the end, it'll tell
you, hey look, you know,

925
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,020
corrected amounts are gonna
be a little bit less, right?

926
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,330
But now they're actually gonna pass.

927
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:27,060
And so I've submitted them

928
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:31,530
and then, at the end, I can actually ask,

929
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,870
hey, can you give me a detailed breakdown

930
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,140
of my Las Vegas expenses to my Genie Room?

931
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,970
It can go, it can pull all

932
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,980
of the expenses that I've submitted.

933
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,680
Tell me that I had a total
of three dinners approved

934
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,410
in Las Vegas, all categorized as meals.

935
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:49,020
Now I'm feeling much
better, but I'm not done.

936
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,300
There's one more thing I want to do.

937
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,250
What happens if I share this

938
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,710
and now the next person comes along?

939
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,780
They're gonna run into
the same issue I did.

940
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,840
So what I can actually do is
I can go to Improve Quality

941
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,060
and I can start a labeling session.

942
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,010
Now what I can do is I can
tell it a question, hey,

943
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,920
can you process a dinner
expense that has two desserts?

944
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,360
Now, the reason I'm doing this is

945
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,840
'cause now I can give it
guidelines, I can tell it

946
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,870
whenever anything
similar to this is asked,

947
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,950
this is what you need to do.

948
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,380
You need to remove the
less expensive dessert

949
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,080
and recalculate the
totals before submitting.

950
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,630
So now I've not only fixed
the problem for myself,

951
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:28,170
but I've improved the agent
for anyone that comes along.

952
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,080
And you can imagine that as
you start scaling these agents,

953
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,430
you can have more and more people doing

954
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,660
these review sessions.

955
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,670
You can bring in your
subject matter experts

956
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,490
and you can easily merge
all of that into your agent

957
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:43,490
and I have written no code
doing this whole thing.

958
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,750
Now, obviously, I do need
to know how JSON works,

959
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,180
so it's not a totally no-code solution,

960
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,940
but it makes it so you can
iterate so much faster.

961
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,180
So with that, I think
it's time to hand it off

962
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,780
to Vikram and Marcos from Conde Nast

963
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,160
who are gonna show us all

964
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,115
the awesome things that
they've been doing.

965
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:03,865
(audience claps)

966
00:43:07,757 --> 00:43:10,170
- Perfect.
- Can everyone hear me?

967
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,310
Yes, great, fantastic.

968
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,353
I'm Vikram, this is Marcos.

969
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,820
And thank you, Craig
and Nico for having us

970
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,250
and to my incredible account team.

971
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,040
Thank you, Nassim, for
having us here as well.

972
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,160
So you've heard Craig talk a lot

973
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,940
about how TXT-to-SQL empowers businesses.

974
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,340
So we had a similar problem.

975
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,360
So earlier this year, my
CEO came to me and said,

976
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,560
look, you built this incredible
data platform on Databricks.

977
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,260
Why is it that I cannot do self-serve

978
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,390
or self-service myself, right?

979
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:48,570
So we set about trying to figure out

980
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:52,950
can we put TXT-to-SQL to work
in our specific use case.

981
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,500
So that's the objective
and that is the journey

982
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,860
that we wanna talk about
but before we get there,

983
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,130
we want to talk a little bit
about who we are as Conde Nast.

984
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,050
We are a global media powerhouse.

985
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,900
You would definitely know
us through our brands.

986
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,620
Vogue, Vanity Fair, The
New Yorker, Acquired,

987
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,960
for those of you who are looking

988
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,230
at tech deals over the
weekend, Conde Nast Traveler,

989
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,300
if you're into food,
obviously you're looking

990
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,093
at Bon Appetit, you know, and others.

991
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:26,823
We operate in 12 countries,
we have 22 global brands.

992
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:33,450
And we went through an interesting
transformation in 2019.

993
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,430
So prior to 2019, we were actually

994
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,870
two separate operating companies.

995
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,050
There was Conde Nast US and
then there was Conde Nast

996
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,070
in the rest of the world.

997
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,040
And the two of them didn't
share anything in terms

998
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,750
of process, in terms of technology.

999
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,420
So in 2019, this was prior
to me joining Conde Nast,

1000
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,680
somebody made the decision, look,

1001
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,850
we are gonna unify everything

1002
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:53,400
and we are gonna become
one global company.

1003
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,910
At that point, 70 percent of
our revenue came from print.

1004
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,160
It was only 30 percent digital.

1005
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,560
So we started the unification process,

1006
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,780
and it was more than
just the data platforms,

1007
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,050
it was a total transformation
of our entire system

1008
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,600
around our entire technology ecosystem.

1009
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,600
And today our revenue is 70 percent

1010
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,160
digital and 30 percent print.

1011
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:21,390
So in about five to six years,
we have actually reversed

1012
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,280
where our money comes from.

1013
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,840
We support multiple revenue streams,

1014
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,910
whether it's commercial advertising,

1015
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,670
whether it is subscriptions.

1016
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,970
We do live events, we
do puzzles and games.

1017
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,740
So our product line is very, very broad.

1018
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,690
So what I'm literally
trying to tell you here

1019
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:42,330
is the problem that we
were trying to solve

1020
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:45,390
with our data strategy was pretty vast.

1021
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:48,241
We needed to adapt that data strategy

1022
00:45:48,241 --> 00:45:50,280
or future proof our data strategy

1023
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,790
so we could evolve the
data strategy to keep,

1024
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,743
to enable the business as it evolved.

1025
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,720
So 2020, that's our data landscape.

1026
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,870
It was, yeah, it's completely
decentralized, obviously.

1027
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:10,350
We lacked any form of
data governance, privacy,

1028
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,780
data lineage, business
semantics, you name it.

1029
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,130
I mean, none of it really existed.

1030
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:17,880
It was purely in its infancy
at that point, right?

1031
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,250
In fact, we relied fairly heavily

1032
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,680
on a spreadsheet driven process.

1033
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,620
If you wanted to get insights or KPIs

1034
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,410
about how our brands
were performing globally.

1035
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,990
2020, we made a strategic decision

1036
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:33,390
to partner with Databricks

1037
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,903
and they've been a
tremendous partner for us.

1038
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:42,030
We remediated a lot of the challenges

1039
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,220
that are laid out previously.

1040
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,140
And what you're seeing today

1041
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,590
is a centralized data Lakehouse

1042
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:53,160
where we have connected
all of our data sources.

1043
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,590
But really what this
enables us to think about

1044
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:57,930
is how do we put this data to use, right?

1045
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:59,940
How do we drive insights?

1046
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,870
How do we drive, you know,
how do we report on KPIs?

1047
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,790
But more importantly, it has enabled us

1048
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,340
to build data products on top of this.

1049
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,210
As we think about a Customer
360, our identity is fine.

1050
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:15,450
And how do we activate
both of those, right?

1051
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:17,970
Those are very important for us.

1052
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,700
How do we plug AI and
machine learning into this?

1053
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,450
How do we drive hyper-personalized
audience experiences?

1054
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,073
How do we drive experimentation?

1055
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,670
All of this is again, built on top

1056
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:32,250
of the Databricks foundations

1057
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,463
that Craig spoke about
just a few minutes ago.

1058
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:39,600
But there's more to it, right?

1059
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,670
So this year, again, I
was asked, hey, look,

1060
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:44,040
what's the AI strategy?

1061
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,990
You know, what are we doing about AI?

1062
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,070
And I think that's a question

1063
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,200
that everybody's been asking.

1064
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,380
An answer, and really
maybe I'll try and explain

1065
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,780
this diagram a little bit
so that it makes sense.

1066
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:59,100
We ended up building our
centralized data warehouse,

1067
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,690
so you could see that in the orange.

1068
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:03,870
We've started to do things
on top of that, right?

1069
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:08,610
But on the x-axis, as
you look at how we want

1070
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,070
to democratize our data,
how we want everybody

1071
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:14,130
to use the data that's
sitting within the Lakehouse

1072
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,143
as close to the Lakehouse as possible,

1073
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,100
you know, we have a little bit
of way to go in that journey.

1074
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,020
And the same thing with activation.

1075
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,540
But the point that we also
wanna make here is that,

1076
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,950
as we transformed our, as
the business transformed,

1077
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,760
and as we transformed and brought in all

1078
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,290
of our data sources into the Lakehouse,

1079
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:38,310
we went through a fundamental
shift in a variety of areas.

1080
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:42,807
And that changed how our
KPIs were constructed, right?

1081
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,610
At the end of the day, that was important.

1082
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:50,580
We had to build trust, yeah,
and that was important.

1083
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,550
So maybe the point I'm
trying to make here is

1084
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,400
if you don't have trusted data,

1085
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,070
if you don't have a ground
truth for your data,

1086
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:04,070
your AI strategy is not gonna
be successful as it scales.

1087
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:05,970
It may work for a couple of use cases,

1088
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,800
but, you know, think long and hard

1089
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,460
about your AI strategy
independent of a data strategy.

1090
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,500
And this is our learning

1091
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,473
that we have taken from this journey.

1092
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,900
As I said previously, our,
we have multiple brands,

1093
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,080
multiple markets, different revenue lines,

1094
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,863
every brand chooses to monetize
its revenue differently,

1095
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:31,140
even within a specific brand.

1096
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,640
Sometimes, the brand will do something

1097
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,110
a little bit different, so as an example,

1098
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,450
Vogue as an app will have
a different monetization,

1099
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:41,450
monetization strategy, excuse
me, than say Vogue.com.

1100
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,100
So when we think about all of that,

1101
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,560
our data happens to be pretty dynamic.

1102
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,140
It's very, very disparate and diverse

1103
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,210
and it's pretty complicated.

1104
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,830
The volume is fairly high as well.

1105
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,523
We support both real time
and batch, as I said.

1106
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,200
And of course we have leveraged everything

1107
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,720
that the Lakehouse offers to us as well.

1108
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,290
We've centered around the
medallion architecture.

1109
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:12,240
We use the Unity Catalog
heavily for governance

1110
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,903
and everything else that
comes with the Unity Catalog.

1111
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:21,117
- Oh, and when you look at Conde Nast

1112
00:50:21,117 --> 00:50:24,243
and how our business areas are organized,

1113
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:31,130
thank you, you're gonna
see that each of the areas,

1114
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:35,010
they have their own analytics
team, they have independence,

1115
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:39,750
ownership, and they have like
a deep functional knowledge.

1116
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:43,650
And what we questioned of ourself was

1117
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,480
how can we enable collaboration

1118
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,400
and use collaboration of these teams

1119
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,830
so we can drive value faster?

1120
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:53,520
And we created like a, what we call

1121
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,910
a federated collaboration
strategy with them.

1122
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:00,360
So we partner with the business areas,

1123
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,070
with the analytics teams.

1124
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:06,150
We, they keep their
independence, autonomy,

1125
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,480
speed, and deep functional knowledge,

1126
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,220
but we try to create like a set

1127
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:16,220
of unifying tools,
frameworks, and data sets

1128
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,633
that it can use and move faster.

1129
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,073
We work with them to
unify also the semantic

1130
00:51:23,073 --> 00:51:26,580
of what they're doing,
data quality frameworks,

1131
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,410
and other things like that.

1132
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:32,310
And we moved that on, so
the areas are exploring data

1133
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:35,040
within Databricks, they
are playing with it.

1134
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,770
And then we receive the question, okay,

1135
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,800
how do we do to democratize our data?

1136
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,940
And this is where we start
keeping the same philosophy

1137
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,750
so they can build and they
can enable, we enable them

1138
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,420
and empower them to create
their own TXT-to-SQL agents.

1139
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,180
So each of these independent areas

1140
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,670
started creating their TXT-to-SQL agents

1141
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,980
and rolling that out
for their stakeholders.

1142
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,800
So we have like executives
asking questions

1143
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,540
to the data, having their
charts and playing with it

1144
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,443
and learning a lot and changing
a little bit the culture.

1145
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:16,293
After you do that, you,
so the question is, okay,

1146
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,580
we look at the log of questions, we see

1147
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:23,460
that a few questions,
they cannot be answered

1148
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:27,750
or they cannot be answered
by one specific agent.

1149
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,360
And how do we connect these agents?

1150
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,930
And this is where we go to our super agent

1151
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:36,220
or our multi-agent supervisor

1152
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:41,880
that's a Databricks app
connected to Agent Bricks

1153
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,540
that uses the different agents

1154
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,190
of the Agent Bricks that defines us.

1155
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:48,600
The multi-agent supervisor defines

1156
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,630
which agents they're gonna
use, get to the answers

1157
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:55,080
and get back with the result.

1158
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,310
We use, we also connect to
Alation, that's our catalog tool,

1159
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:02,550
using instructions and
judgment and guardrails

1160
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:05,100
on top of the multi-agent supervisor.

1161
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:09,153
And that's usually,
that's synced with Unity.

1162
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,060
And so now, if an executive
wants to access our data,

1163
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:19,320
they go to the Databricks
app, put their questions,

1164
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,440
Agent Bricks decides
which agents to engage,

1165
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,183
we get the answer and we go back.

1166
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,790
Very nice in the PowerPoint,

1167
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:28,800
but Vikram is gonna show us a little bit

1168
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,633
like how that works in real life.

1169
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:33,623
- Yes.

1170
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:38,940
(attendee coughs)

1171
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,493
- Everyone can still hear
me, so, all right, great.

1172
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,770
We start with the app screen

1173
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:47,100
and I think Nicolas pointed
out how to build apps.

1174
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,330
So I'm not gonna get into this.

1175
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,220
And again, for the sake of brevity,

1176
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:55,220
we've actually gone through
and done the work here.

1177
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,720
So I'm just gonna walk
through this very quickly.

1178
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,600
So as I said, we have multiple brands,

1179
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:05,220
every brand has different
revenue strategies.

1180
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,480
We have subscription brands,

1181
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,310
and, in this case, we are gonna talk about

1182
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,130
how the subscription brands are performing

1183
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,450
versus what is expected.

1184
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,880
As you can see at the prompt,
at the very top there,

1185
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,040
not sure, yeah, there we go.

1186
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,830
Wonder if I should zoom
in or if everyone's okay.

1187
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,830
And that is the prompt

1188
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,070
and that is then analyzed
by the subscription.

1189
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,260
So maybe a little bit of insight

1190
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,940
into how the agents themselves are built.

1191
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,240
Subscription includes everything

1192
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,700
that you want to know about the brand,

1193
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:43,440
and it includes information
such as the channels

1194
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,440
that the consumers came in on.

1195
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,340
So, and that's kind of important as we go

1196
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,470
through the demo, the second agent

1197
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:58,680
that we have speaks about
audience and audience includes

1198
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,650
how our audience is consuming our content,

1199
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,290
but it doesn't necessarily
talk about subscriptions

1200
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:06,660
or anything revenue specific.

1201
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:11,070
So when we run that, it runs through

1202
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,140
and it comes back with the
following response, right?

1203
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,370
It provides some insight into

1204
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:15,810
how the site is actually performing.

1205
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:18,090
And in this case, it's focused
on Wired and it's saying,

1206
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:22,830
look, Wired actually added 70
thousand site subscriptions,

1207
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:27,180
but in 2025, it, we've
more than doubled it.

1208
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,890
I do want to caution everybody,

1209
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,497
this is not real data, this is demo data.

1210
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:34,500
We are not allowed to share our revenue

1211
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,250
and subscription numbers publicly.

1212
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:40,380
We are a privately held company.

1213
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,970
So now, so it's important for us

1214
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:48,600
to go a little bit further,
so The New Yorker happens

1215
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,250
to be yet another subscription brand.

1216
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:53,490
So again, I went back to the agents

1217
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:57,257
and said, look, tell me
how my top two brands,

1218
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,750
subscription brands are doing.

1219
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,697
And now it comes back and says, okay,

1220
00:56:02,697 --> 00:56:06,120
The New Yorker actually has, obviously,

1221
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,260
it has more subscribers,

1222
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,300
it has about a million give or take.

1223
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,530
That's generally public knowledge.

1224
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,440
So I'm just sharing
that but then it starts

1225
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,130
to get into the comparison
between the brands, right?

1226
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,620
So here it's talking about, yeah, sure,

1227
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,440
the absolute numbers for
The New Yorker are higher,

1228
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,370
higher but Wired shows more growth, right?

1229
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:28,020
All of this is like, yeah, sure.

1230
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,090
I mean, you can get all
of this via any sort

1231
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:32,100
of dashboard, et cetera,
right, that's great.

1232
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,930
But now let's get in a little bit deeper

1233
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,580
and we are gonna ask it the question,

1234
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:39,300
what is driving Wire's year to year growth

1235
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,730
inside subscriptions, right?

1236
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,470
So again, for the sake of brevity,

1237
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,220
I've already gone ahead and run it.

1238
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:49,260
And now it comes back and says, look,

1239
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,200
you wanna look at what
the key growth drivers are

1240
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,990
and, you remember, I shared
a little bit about a brand

1241
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:59,490
and how traffic gets to
our properties, right?

1242
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:02,340
And this says, look, the
top contributing channels

1243
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,510
happen to be social media.

1244
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:04,620
We see a lot of growth there.

1245
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,830
Direct traffic, happy
to explain these terms,

1246
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:11,850
but search, you know, it's
generally okay, it's doing fine.

1247
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,770
But new channels have started to emerge,

1248
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:16,890
and this is very true for media

1249
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:18,960
and entertainment in general.

1250
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,790
This could be driven off of newsletters

1251
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:23,760
and other subscriptions
but AI traffic has started

1252
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,510
to add a little bit of volume

1253
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:31,110
and it's driving a little
bit, a few more subscriptions.

1254
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:34,170
Now we want to get a little bit
deeper into the channel mix.

1255
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:37,080
So fine, you've told me that,
hey, you're getting a lot

1256
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,210
of traffic from social
media, that's great,

1257
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:42,420
but what specifically within social media?

1258
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:47,190
And that's where we come back
with the following, right?

1259
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:51,240
So I didn't necessarily
speak about conversion rates,

1260
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,880
but I'm, again, happy to
get into all of these,

1261
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,550
but these are very specific
to media and entertainment.

1262
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:00,390
So it says, look, search
decreased significantly,

1263
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:03,090
direct traffic increased, social group,

1264
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:08,090
strategic referral group,
new channels have come in.

1265
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,180
And then it starts talking

1266
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,520
about conversion rate performance, right?

1267
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,660
Social has the most, has
shown the most improvement.

1268
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,130
Direct traffic and direct traffic

1269
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,810
for those who are uninitiated

1270
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:21,570
with the entertainment
terms is when you type

1271
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:25,980
the actual page or the URL

1272
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,830
and search is, you know,
you go to Bing or Google,

1273
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:30,750
and that's really what you're doing.

1274
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,780
But the notable declines are email, right?

1275
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,640
Okay, so we are doing something wrong

1276
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,230
with our newsletter strategy.

1277
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:39,240
Now whether we should be doing more,

1278
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,640
maybe it's a content thing,
maybe it's not a content thing.

1279
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,443
Hard to tell again, right?

1280
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,920
Display, hmm, not doing that great either.

1281
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,710
Google Discover, again, right?

1282
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:53,580
So it provides us with
a neat little summary

1283
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,860
of, hey, look, we are starting

1284
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,710
to see shifts in the way the traffic

1285
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:01,410
is consuming our audience.

1286
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,180
So now if you're the CEO of the company

1287
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:04,830
and you're looking at this, you are going,

1288
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:06,120
yeah, okay, that makes sense.

1289
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,470
Now you can start talking to the rest

1290
00:59:09,973 --> 00:59:12,450
of your leadership team about
what the strategy here needs

1291
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:14,670
to be, what we should be focusing on

1292
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:17,010
and what we should be
spending our dollars on.

1293
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:19,080
I dunno how much time we have,
we have just about a minute.

1294
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,573
So continue on?

1295
00:59:22,888 --> 00:59:25,557
- We should wrap this up.
- Yeah, so we should,

1296
00:59:25,557 --> 00:59:27,259
why don't you wrap up with the...?

1297
00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:29,676
- Okay, can I go then?
- Yeah.

1298
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:31,828
- Cool.

1299
00:59:31,828 --> 00:59:35,130
(equipment rustles)

1300
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:40,130
And what have we learned
like in this journey?

1301
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,960
One thing is that, what you probably

1302
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,380
are listening everywhere, that
if you don't have good data,

1303
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,010
you cannot, you're not
gonna have good results.

1304
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:53,730
But be open because you can
create curated data sets

1305
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:56,040
and plug in your TXT-to-SQL on top

1306
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,320
of the curated data sets and also prepare,

1307
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,600
be aware that you may need
to prepare those data sets

1308
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,463
to work with TXT-to-SQL.

1309
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:08,510
On the user questions, imagine
that the agent is gonna,

1310
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,350
if you're using TXT-to-SQL,

1311
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:13,170
is gonna provide SQL
outputs for your questions.

1312
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:16,470
So if you ask something that
could not be answered by a SQL,

1313
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:18,600
you're not gonna get the answer.

1314
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,730
And when you are building the multi-agent,

1315
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:22,320
remember that you can add instructions

1316
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,630
and guardrails to that layer.

1317
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:28,920
We forgot, so the way we know
that all the data is tweaked

1318
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,227
is because we added
instructions for the multi-agent

1319
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:34,650
and the multi-agent applies
that to all of the data.

1320
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:38,070
Some of the user questions,
they are not gonna be,

1321
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:40,200
they require additional
training or guardrails.

1322
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,240
So you can put an instruction saying like,

1323
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,470
if you don't have complete data,

1324
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:45,573
do not answer to the question.

1325
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:48,570
When you're building advanced analytics,

1326
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:51,040
you may need additional
tables and functions

1327
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:54,870
and check when you have a new use case,

1328
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:57,390
if it's gonna be like an optimal solution

1329
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:01,323
to use TXT-to-SQL or if you
need something different.

1330
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:05,643
And the final one, so what we have seen.

1331
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,230
With this, we increase
a lot time to value.

1332
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:11,880
So each of the individual groups

1333
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,940
are building their own agents,
improving their own agents,

1334
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:17,490
their own agents and moving super fast.

1335
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:21,180
We have senior executives
accessing our data

1336
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:24,330
and our agents and we look at the logs,

1337
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,190
we understand what's not being answered,

1338
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:29,010
and we use that as an
input to new requirements.

1339
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:33,180
So we create like kind of
a flywheel of adoption.

1340
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:36,900
We have like new requirements,
better data sets,

1341
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,750
better new questions,
things that we cannot,

1342
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,340
so we do a new data set.

1343
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:44,370
And that has fundamentally changed the way

1344
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:48,180
that most of our senior
executives interact with the data.

1345
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:51,090
We see that before they were
like looking at the dashboard

1346
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:53,910
as a freezing thing and
now they have the dialogue

1347
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,160
and that really generates a transformation

1348
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,910
on how we interact with
our data in the company.

1349
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:03,719
Greg, thank you guys. (laughs)

1350
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:06,552
(audience claps)

1351
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:10,400
- With that...

1352
01:02:11,508 --> 01:02:13,668
A couple quick actions, one,

1353
01:02:13,668 --> 01:02:15,607
give Databricks a try, two,

1354
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:17,310
(attendee laughs)

1355
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:21,750
conduct work to ping us and
we're happy to come onsite

1356
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:24,180
and do a workshop with
you on these topics.

1357
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,380
You know, introduce the team

1358
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,270
and kinda show them Agent Bricks

1359
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:29,520
and walk through some
of the best practices.

1360
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,830
And then three, get
some training solutions

1361
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,650
and accelerators, you know,
you can, there are training,

1362
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,420
there are online training classes as well

1363
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,730
as some accelerators attached to our blogs

1364
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:40,740
that help you get started on this.

1365
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:45,600
And four, when you fill
out your evaluation

1366
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,700
on re:Invent, give us the highest score

1367
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,760
of any session you went to, all right?

1368
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,380
So yeah, that's, that's it.

1369
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,030
Unfortunately, we are out of time,

1370
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:57,450
so we'll do some Q&A down here
for anyone who has questions

1371
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:58,680
and then when we get kicked out,

1372
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,513
we'll move out into the hall.

1373
01:02:59,513 --> 01:03:01,781
So, but thank you very
much for joining us today.

1374
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:02,894
(audience claps)
