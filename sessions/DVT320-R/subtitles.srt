1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,030
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Thank you
for coming out this afternoon

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,210
for our session on Kiro.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,210
We'll be talking about
how to build applications

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,160
and we're gonna be
building a live application

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,310
in front of you here this afternoon.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,780
So I am Ryan Yanchuleff,

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,440
I'm one of our specialist
solutions architects here at AWS.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,430
I'm part of the Next Generation
Developer Experience team.

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,530
So we work with customers who are looking

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,410
to roll out generative
AI development tools

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,790
inside of their organizations.

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,980
And with me, I have Ryan.

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,320
- [Ryan Bachman] And I am
also Ryan, Ryan Bachman,

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,950
same team, same responsibilities,

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,940
same everything that he just said.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,550
As we get into the session,
who's done a code talk before?

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,383
Anybody?

18
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,380
Anyone done a code talk before?

19
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,740
Okay. These sessions are
really meant to be interactive.

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,300
So while we are gonna
be doing live coding,

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,800
I also encourage us to
engage, learn from each other.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,920
I'll be walking around as
he's presenting and coding.

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,640
We'll have some dev time, ask questions.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,080
I'll go ahead and amplify that question

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,360
and we can kind of talk about it, right?

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,090
Whatever you want to talk about, learn,

27
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,700
we're here to talk about agentic AI

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,270
or spec-driven development
as well with Kiro.

29
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,280
So yeah, let's just feel free,

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,410
share your opinions, share your thoughts.

31
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,040
I will be polling the
audience numerous times today.

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,180
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Yeah,
we are going to be building

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,690
an application from scratch inside of Kiro

34
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,310
live on the screen.

35
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,020
And we're going to build an application

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,870
that you guys and gals recommend.

37
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,550
So Ryan's gonna poll the
audience here in just a minute,

38
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,060
and we're gonna take the
two or three best ideas

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,760
and we're gonna build them
live here on the screen.

40
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,670
We'll build the best
one live on the screen,

41
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,700
so, you know, be thinking
about that as we walk

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,140
through the next couple of slides here.

43
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,420
So before we dive into it,

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,920
wanna just kind of set the stage,

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,420
talk a little bit about what Kiro

46
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,820
is so that everybody's familiar with it.

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,240
It's a relatively new product
that we released this year,

48
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,160
and it just went general availability

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,220
about two weeks before today.

50
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,210
So with that, one of the
questions that we get asked a lot

51
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,180
is why did we build another tool?

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,130
There's a lot of them out there.

53
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,840
So why did we build another one?

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,670
And I think it's helpful
to kind of understand

55
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,640
where things have gone
and how they've evolved.

56
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,310
So if you go back a couple of years,

57
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,840
we started out with generative AI

58
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,660
that just did sort of general helping.

59
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,910
It was a glorified IntelliSense,

60
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,690
auto complete, simple chat
questions and interactions

61
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,860
and things like that.

62
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,050
And then more recently
we got into a situation

63
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,850
where we could do assistance.

64
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,440
We could say, "Hey, I want to go

65
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,630
and make a change to this function."

66
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,380
Or, "I want to go and debug
this particular log file."

67
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,700
Or, "Help me out with this thing."

68
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,370
Very specific tasks that we could, again,

69
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,430
ask the generative AI tools
to go in and help us with.

70
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,030
And then in the current age,
we have what we call agents,

71
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,760
which is where I take
more complex problems.

72
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,170
I say, "Here's what I want to do,

73
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,460
here's what I want to build.

74
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,630
I wanna build an application.

75
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,540
I want to add a new feature
to my existing application.

76
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,850
I wanna modernize this
part of my application.

77
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,850
I wanna migrate this
piece of application code

78
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,290
and I need you to help me out with that."

79
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,547
And that involves
multiple different steps.

80
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:26,250
"I've gotta run things
on the command line.

81
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,470
I've gotta talk to third-party tools.

82
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,090
I've got to generate code.

83
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,100
I've gotta modify existing code."

84
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,160
And we call this agentic development.

85
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,230
The term "agentic" gets overloaded a lot.

86
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,990
So I think it's helpful
to kind of understand

87
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,060
what we mean when we say that.

88
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,940
So the promise here was
that we get autonomy.

89
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,320
We could all go sit on the beach

90
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,810
while we let the generative AI tools

91
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,640
go and write code for us.

92
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,980
We get more collaboration.

93
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,200
We have a back and forth conversation

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,030
with this generative AI tool

95
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,370
and we chat along and we tell funny jokes

96
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,720
and we get work done,

97
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,790
just like you do with
your other coworkers.

98
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,340
And then we, of course,
get high-quality code.

99
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,740
Nobody's producing junk when we do this

100
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,330
'cause we're all professionals.

101
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,250
And so this is the promise.

102
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,360
The challenge though, that we
saw with customers starting

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,890
to use these tools in their
production environments

104
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,930
centered around three major things.

105
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,000
And it was these three major things

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,480
that we set out to solve
for when we built Kiro.

107
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,040
And these three things really

108
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,750
are laid out here for you on the screen.

109
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,290
The first one and the biggest
one is how do you scale?

110
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,480
So it's great when I
wanna build Tic-Tac-Toe

111
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,490
and I'm just one developer in a corner

112
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,080
hacking out some code.

113
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,230
But when I have an existing
production application

114
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,860
with 1.2 million lines of
code and I've got a team

115
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,220
of 150 developers who
are all working together,

116
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,730
this becomes really important
because I need my LLM

117
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,910
to be able to understand all that code.

118
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,150
I need it to be able to
understand that code consistently.

119
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,390
And I need it to be able
to produce similar results

120
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,750
for all 150 developers along the way.

121
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,080
It does me no good if the
non-deterministic nature

122
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,050
of the LLMs creates working solutions

123
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,910
for all 150 developers,

124
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,910
but it does so in very incompatible ways,

125
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,860
which is possible when you think about

126
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,280
the non-deterministic
aspects of generative AI.

127
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,990
So how do we do this at scale?

128
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,930
How do we solve for
large development teams

129
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,620
and how do we solve for
large existing code bases?

130
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,840
The other piece is the idea of control.

131
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,640
We talked about, in the previous slide,

132
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,370
about this true collaboration concept,

133
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,160
but that's not really what
we have in generative AI.

134
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,370
What we have in generative
AI is we take this prompt

135
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,730
that we kind of concoct and
and throw into the chat box,

136
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,780
we throw it over the wall and
we say, "Make me something."

137
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,900
And it goes off and it
writes a 1,000 lines of code

138
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,000
and it says, "I made you something."

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,790
And then it hands it to you
and hopefully it did it right.

140
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,380
But more than likely what happened

141
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,770
is that it got to a lot of
different decision points,

142
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,070
a lot of details that you
left out of your prompt

143
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,290
that it now has to go
and fill in the blanks.

144
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,580
And maybe it got it right,

145
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,830
maybe it chose the option
you would've chosen,

146
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,070
maybe it didn't, but now it's
up to you to figure that out.

147
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,900
And now you've got a 1,000 lines of code

148
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,120
that you've gotta go
and figure it out with.

149
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,110
And then the last piece

150
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,170
is when you take those
two factors together,

151
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,420
both of those negatively impact

152
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,130
the overall quality of the code.

153
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,920
What you're getting is code
that you don't really want.

154
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,530
It doesn't really do
what you wanted it to do,

155
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,110
and it doesn't really do it
the way you wanted it to do.

156
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,640
And it does it differently

157
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,800
for all the different
developers on your team,

158
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,510
which is not helpful.

159
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,870
So what we created for Kiro

160
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,290
and what we tightly
integrated into the solution

161
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,630
is something that we call
spec-driven development.

162
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,290
And it's a return back to first principles

163
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,610
of software development.

164
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,160
We don't bring a team of
developers into a room,

165
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,040
write four bullet points on a whiteboard,

166
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,400
and say, "Guys, we'll check
in on you in six months.

167
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,110
Let us know how it goes."

168
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,170
That would be chaos, and for good reason.

169
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,767
What we do is we step back and we say,

170
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,500
"All right, what are the requirements?

171
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,550
Let's detail those.

172
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,780
Let's bring in our stakeholders,

173
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,900
let's bring in all the key
players and lay that out."

174
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,730
Then we say, "All right, well
these are the requirements.

175
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,660
How are we gonna build this?"

176
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,617
And we build a design document and we say,

177
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:25,650
"What are all of the
different design specs

178
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,000
and the technical details?"

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,987
And we lay all of those out

180
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:30,150
and we bring in all the stakeholders.

181
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,983
And then we say,

182
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,280
"All right, well, what
is the project plan?"

183
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,230
We build one of those fun Gantt charts

184
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,910
with all of the different
tasks that we can do

185
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,210
in parallel and in serial
and we lay those things out.

186
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,920
And then once we have those,

187
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,140
then we bring the team
of developers in the room

188
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,670
and we say, "Here's what you're building.

189
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,990
Here's how you're building it.

190
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,630
And here's all the different
tasks that you need to do."

191
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,400
And we use those to go off

192
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,530
and actually do the implementation.

193
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,290
And that's how we solve for this problem

194
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,610
of building at scale.

195
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,260
So what spec-driven development does

196
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,920
is it takes generative AI and
it applies the same model.

197
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,680
It says, "Give me your
prompt that you concocted,

198
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,360
that's missing a lot of details,

199
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,060
and instead of going off and
writing a 1,000 lines of code,

200
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,060
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna
generate a requirements document.

201
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,580
And then I'm gonna
generate a design document.

202
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,890
And then I'm gonna
generate a project plan.

203
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,000
And you're gonna have the opportunity

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,050
to review all those things.

205
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,030
'cause they're just text documents.

206
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,010
And then when you're
happy with all of those,

207
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,120
then we'll start building."

208
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,060
And whether it's just you
on a greenfield application,

209
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,860
like what we're gonna do here in a moment,

210
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,980
or whether you've got a
team of a 100 developers

211
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,380
and hundreds of thousands
of lines of code,

212
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,390
we're gonna get very similar results

213
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,580
because we're working
with the same context.

214
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,920
We're working with the same details,

215
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,750
and we've had a chance in advance

216
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,820
to review all of the different details

217
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,040
that might have gotten
left out from your prompt.

218
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,810
And we can fill in the blanks

219
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,657
and we can validate them
all and then we can move on.

220
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,430
And so that's what
spec-driven development is,

221
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,433
and that's really what makes Kiro unique.

222
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,020
So if you could build an application

223
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,260
and take advantage of that, how
would you go about doing it?

224
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,880
And so this is where
we're gonna switch over

225
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,000
and we're gonna switch
to a live coding demo.

226
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,010
And so I'm gonna need some ideas

227
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,860
because I've got a blank, empty screen

228
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,630
and I need something to build.

229
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,463
- [Ryan Bachman] Yep.

230
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,640
Anybody that's been to
like an improv show,

231
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,480
I'm gonna try this out.

232
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,820
Like, you know, you shout
out like random ideas

233
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,220
and then we're gonna maybe
combine a couple or two.

234
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,320
So this is where we need the audience.

235
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,500
So, like, don't raise your
hand, just like yell out-

236
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,585
- Fitness app.
- What's that?

237
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:33,630
- A fitness app.
- Alright, a fitness app.

238
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,100
Anyone else?

239
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,385
- [Audience Member] That
focuses on the trainer.

240
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:39,717
- [Ryan Bachman] Fitness app
that focuses on the trainer.

241
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:43,265
- [Audience Member] AWS event app.

242
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:44,970
- AWS what now?
- Event app.

243
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,130
Event manager. That's my app.

244
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,140
- Is that your-
- I came up with that app.

245
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,300
- Any other-
- That's what I normally do

246
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,243
in my demos.

247
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,389
- [Ryan Bachman] I don't know
how to combine those two.

248
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:55,590
- [Audience Member] Virtual concierge.

249
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,423
- [Ryan Bachman] Virtual concierge?

250
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:58,860
- For hotels
- Oh, hotel.

251
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,870
- There you go.
- All right.

252
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,311
So we got a fitness app, concierge app,

253
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,723
and I don't know how to
combine all three of those.

254
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,880
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] All right, let's see.

255
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,713
Let's see what we can come up with here.

256
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:11,707
- [Ryan Bachman] How
about a fitness app for-

257
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:15,690
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] "I want
to build a web application

258
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,060
to manage my fitness-"

259
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,183
- [Audience Member] Track
your steps through AWS.

260
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:23,620
- There you go.
- "Activities and determine

261
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,630
if I actually did them
and how many calories

262
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,380
I burned in the process."

263
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,690
- Perfect.
- Alright, we have 40 minutes.

264
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,140
So I'm simplifying this down a little bit.

265
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,033
But, okay, so here's my prompt.

266
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,820
If you look at that prompt,

267
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,160
you can tell pretty quickly right away

268
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,400
that there's a lot of detail missing here.

269
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,280
I have specified that I
want a web application,

270
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,040
I have not specified what I want it to be.

271
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,550
Could be React, could be
Python, could be .NET,

272
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,550
could be some esoteric
language from 40 years ago.

273
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,740
We haven't really defined that.

274
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,630
We haven't specified a
lot of things in here

275
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,250
like do we want authentication?

276
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,430
That's probably a good idea
for a personal fitness app.

277
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,730
We haven't specified what
a lot of the features are.

278
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,570
We haven't defined whether
we want a full stack app

279
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,460
with a data layer and a business
layer and a front layer,

280
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,710
or whether we want to
build this all together

281
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,440
like a Next.js app, for instance.

282
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,750
We haven't said if we
want it to be mobile.

283
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,740
Well, actually we did.

284
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,990
We said we wanted it to
be a web application,

285
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,340
so we specified that.

286
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,570
But you get the point.

287
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,430
There are a lot of details here.

288
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,770
And in Kiro, I have the ability to switch

289
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,630
between two different modes.

290
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,970
So if I were to put this into Vibe mode,

291
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,650
which is what you'd get from a traditional

292
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,860
generative AI tool, and
I were to hit "Go" here,

293
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,560
it would go off and it would
immediately start building.

294
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,210
And what would it start building?

295
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,910
Well, it would figure out some strategy

296
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,140
to build a web application.

297
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,900
It might pick React, it might pick Python,

298
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,580
it might pick something else.

299
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,980
And if there were five
of us up here on stage,

300
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,620
it might pick something
different for each one of us

301
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,640
because generative AI, by
definition, is non-deterministic,

302
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,160
so we're not guaranteed the same results.

303
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,230
But I'm gonna put it into Spec mode

304
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,450
and I'm gonna kick this off.

305
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,640
And so what's gonna
happen now is that Kiro,

306
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,580
instead of going off and
actually writing the code,

307
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,700
is it's going to start
generating what we call a spec.

308
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,180
And a spec here is going
to define what it is

309
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,330
that we wanna build before we
actually start building it.

310
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,400
And so we're gonna let
this run in real-time

311
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,980
to kind of give you a
sense of how much time

312
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,510
this actually takes.

313
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,670
The spoiler alert, it
doesn't take very long,

314
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,940
assuming that our network holds up here.

315
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,300
And so it's going to create
for us a requirements document.

316
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,133
And you can see here,

317
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:54,870
it's opened it up for me on the screen.

318
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,610
And so I've got my requirements
document on the screen here.

319
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,450
And this requirements document starts out

320
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,370
with a high-level introduction.

321
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,930
So it's given me kind of a
general summary of what I put in.

322
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,520
I wrote one sentence
into the prompt box here.

323
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,240
I've gotten a paragraph of
details that are laid out.

324
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,190
I've also gotten a glossary of terms

325
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,653
so that we are clear on
what we're talking about.

326
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,290
It's laid out a lot of different details

327
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,970
like what's a user?

328
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,170
What's an activity?

329
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,570
What kind of activity types are there?

330
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,140
How do we calculate calorie consumption?

331
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,190
How do we deal with the activity logs?

332
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,080
All of these different
things here are laid out.

333
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,310
These are all important things

334
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,260
if I'm gonna go and build this application

335
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,900
that I didn't specify
in my original prompt.

336
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,760
And then we're gonna get
into the meat of this,

337
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,040
which is the requirements themselves.

338
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,710
So each requirement is
gonna have a user story

339
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,320
and it's gonna have a set
of acceptance criteria.

340
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,770
And so the user story combined
with the acceptance criteria

341
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,310
is going to detail all of the
different things that I want.

342
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,690
And you can see here that it came up

343
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,130
with seven requirements,

344
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,550
which is not bad considering
that I gave it one sentence.

345
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,930
Now, is that enough requirements

346
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,060
to build a full fledged web application

347
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,893
for fitness tracking with auth

348
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,120
and all of those other details?

349
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,620
Probably not.

350
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,570
But it does get us
quite a bit farther down

351
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,220
the road than we would've been

352
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,660
if we had just taken this prompt

353
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,250
and thrown it over the wall.

354
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,170
And one of the things that's important

355
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,970
to understand about specs

356
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,890
is that they're not really designed

357
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,590
to be used to write an
entire operating system.

358
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,510
You want to use something like a spec

359
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,220
to do feature development.

360
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,370
So our application here is
going to evolve over time.

361
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,160
There are going to be things
that we want to add to it.

362
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,130
There are gonna be things as
we show off our initial MVP

363
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,630
to our stakeholders.

364
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,227
There are gonna be things
that they're gonna say,

365
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:50,010
"Well, this is really cool,
but I want to add this thing.

366
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,560
This is really cool, but
I wanna change this piece.

367
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,633
I hate this thing.

368
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,030
I can't believe you built this."

369
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,057
And we're gonna go a couple
different routes here

370
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:03,750
and we're gonna be able
to evolve as we go.

371
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,450
So we've got our user stories here

372
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,610
and they follow a specific format.

373
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,550
They follow what we call EARS.

374
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,540
It's an industry standard
for writing requirements

375
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,250
is it's Easy Accessible
Requirements System Spec,

376
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,250
something like that.

377
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,390
I never remember what
that acronym stands for,

378
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,250
but it follows that key system,

379
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,080
which is that it creates a user story

380
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,390
and then it creates acceptance criteria.

381
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,537
And so what we can do now is we can say,

382
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:33,090
"All right, let's review this.

383
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,440
Do we like this?

384
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,120
Does it capture the things that we want?

385
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,160
Did we think of something
else in the five minutes

386
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,870
that it took to create this document

387
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,517
that we want to add to this?"

388
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:44,520
And so we can evaluate and iterate on this

389
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,200
and we can make adjustments.

390
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,720
For the sake of time, I'm
gonna leave it here as it is.

391
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,597
But it says here, like,

392
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:52,620
"As a user, I want to create
and manage fitness activities."

393
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,760
That's a good start.

394
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,980
That kind of aligns with
the prompt that I have here

395
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,100
so that I can plan and
track my exercise routines.

396
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,007
Cool.

397
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:02,610
"I want to mark the
activities as completed

398
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,350
with their actual duration,

399
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,110
so that I can track what
I actually accomplished."

400
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,900
And you can see here that each
one has acceptance criteria.

401
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,060
So when a user creates a new activity,

402
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,660
the application should store
that activity with the details,

403
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,430
with the type, with the planned duration,

404
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,960
with the planned date,

405
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,940
all of that information
should get tracked.

406
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,070
Maybe I want to add
another attribute there,

407
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,140
maybe you want to track location as well.

408
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,540
And so now is my
opportunity to come in here

409
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,410
and make an adjustment.

410
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,170
And I can say I want to
add location to my data

411
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,430
that's being stored.

412
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,120
All I'm doing here is
modifying a markdown file.

413
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,730
So once I'm happy with the requirements,

414
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,130
I move on to the design phase.

415
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,350
And I say, "All right,
well, this is great,

416
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,200
but now I wanna know how am I
actually going to build this?

417
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,150
What language am I gonna write it in?

418
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,160
What libraries am I gonna use?

419
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,140
What am I gonna do for authentication?

420
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,030
How am I gonna handle error handling?

421
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,920
What am I gonna do for testing?"

422
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,950
All of these different details
need to be captured here.

423
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,950
And so we gave it no details
except for a web application.

424
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,030
So we're all gonna find out together

425
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,580
what this thing actually decides to build

426
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,230
and how it decides to build it.

427
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,727
And this is gonna be
our opportunity to say,

428
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:15,420
"No. I don't wanna build it with Python,

429
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,980
I want to build it with React.

430
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,330
I don't wanna build it with React,

431
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,370
I want to build it with Go.

432
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,700
I want to build it with a SQL database.

433
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,170
I don't wanna build it
with a SQL database.

434
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,750
I want to build it with NoSQL databases."

435
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,690
This is my opportunity to
correct for all of these things.

436
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,090
Because at this point, if we, again,

437
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,970
just threw this over the
wall with vibe coding,

438
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,790
the LLM would make
those decisions for you.

439
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,870
It would say, "You didn't tell me

440
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,430
what kind of database you wanted.

441
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,010
I feel like SQL today,
I'm going that route."

442
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,680
And if you wanted NoSQL,
you're out of luck.

443
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,550
You're gonna have to go back

444
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,820
and rebuild that code after the fact.

445
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,660
And so that creates
complications and it takes time

446
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,970
to evaluate for all of those things.

447
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,180
So at this point, we're
gonna get an evaluation.

448
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,160
And you can see here one of the things

449
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,930
that it's doing is it's saying

450
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,670
that it's formalizing the requirements

451
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,410
for correctness properties.

452
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,260
What this is, so Kiro has a feature in it

453
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,080
called property-based testing.

454
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,590
And property-based testing
is a really fancy term

455
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,650
for essentially testing with edge cases.

456
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,960
But it's going to evaluate my requirements

457
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,793
and it's going to say,

458
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:25,710
what are the things that
need to be checked for?

459
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,970
How am I going to check for them?

460
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,800
And not just the happy path,

461
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,690
but what are all the edge cases?

462
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,892
You say that you want to know

463
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:36,450
what your planned duration
is for your activity.

464
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,970
Well, what happens if you enter a bunch

465
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,950
of letters into that field?

466
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,820
What's it gonna do?

467
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,900
Is it gonna give you an error?

468
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,860
Is it gonna crash?

469
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,180
Is it gonna blow up?

470
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,710
How's it gonna handle that?

471
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,660
So that's just one example.

472
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,560
But you can see here that it's looking

473
00:18:53,072 --> 00:18:54,820
at the different prompts there

474
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,277
or the different
requirements and it's saying,

475
00:18:57,277 --> 00:18:58,560
"All right, well, what do we need to do

476
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,940
to test for all of that?"

477
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,300
And so when we go now and we
look at the design document,

478
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,270
what we have here is
another summary at the top

479
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,160
with all of these details.

480
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,900
We have more architecture.

481
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,230
So we have a foundation layer,
we have a business layer,

482
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,120
we have a data access layer,

483
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,570
we have our browser's local
storage, we have a tech stack.

484
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,660
It looks like it's using
React with TypeScript here.

485
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,950
That's what it's settled on.

486
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,850
It's gonna use the React context
API for state management,

487
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,060
it's gonna use Tailwind for my UI.

488
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,130
So a lot of different things
here are being specified.

489
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,740
And, again, if I don't
like any of those things,

490
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,730
it's pretty simple.

491
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,540
I just go in and modify
this document here,

492
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,100
and I'm good to go.

493
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,810
So it's gonna lay out, again,

494
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,290
the stack for all of the
different models that I have.

495
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,080
We're gonna get into the data layer,

496
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,080
we're gonna get into the
correctness properties

497
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,420
and all of the different ways
in which we're gonna do that.

498
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,190
So what happens if I have a planned and...

499
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,210
Stop that.

500
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,570
What happens if we have a
planned and actual duration?

501
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,850
Do they both get preserved?

502
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,470
So how are we gonna calculate that?

503
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,340
What are we gonna do for
triggering the calorie calculation?

504
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,840
A whole lot of different details there.

505
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,080
Then we get into error
handling, input validation.

506
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,970
We get into business logic errors.

507
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,060
We get into testing
strategies, including employing

508
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,860
all of those different
property-based tests

509
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,480
that we outlined above.

510
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,650
What do we do for unit testing

511
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,840
and integration and test execution?

512
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,630
So there's a lot of detail
here that's captured.

513
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,280
You got some questions over here?

514
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,040
- Go ahead.
- So the question

515
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,050
was two things.

516
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:44,020
The MCP servers, is that the
default or did you add those?

517
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,770
I saw agent steering.

518
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:48,390
What is that?
- Okay.

519
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,760
So just, I mean, for the room too,

520
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,770
so the questions are we
have some MCP servers

521
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,860
that are configured, you
can see in this video

522
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,420
and then also agent steering.

523
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,890
What is agent steering?

524
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,460
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Yeah. So
the MCP servers I installed.

525
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,680
So by default Kiro doesn't come installed

526
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,330
with any MCP servers.

527
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,210
It has support though
for local MCP servers

528
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,340
and for remote MCP servers.

529
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,340
So you can go through the
remote MCP server flow,

530
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,550
you can do OAuth to connect
to your remote MCP servers

531
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,810
if you want to do that.

532
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,820
Or you can install local MCP servers

533
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,470
and you can configure them.

534
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,780
I have these installed at the user level,

535
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,950
which means that they work

536
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,260
for all the different
projects that I open.

537
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,260
You can also install MCP
servers at the project level,

538
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,260
so they're only relevant
to the specific project.

539
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,120
So these MCP servers here

540
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,433
happen to be installed
locally on my machine.

541
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,640
I don't know that we're
necessarily gonna use them

542
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,520
over the course of our demo here,

543
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,530
but you can install whatever you want.

544
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,810
They don't come pre-installed.

545
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,090
Now the question about agent steering.

546
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,940
So over here on the left hand side,

547
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,640
this is my Kiro panel here
on the left hand side.

548
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,520
I get to it by clicking
on the little ghost here.

549
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,570
Kiro by default is a a VS Code fork.

550
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,747
So if you're looking at this going,

551
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:06,240
"This looks pretty familiar,"

552
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,310
it's because it's a VS Code fork.

553
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:12,000
And so a lot of the UI and elements here

554
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,460
are gonna be very familiar to you.

555
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,890
But there's a section here at the bottom

556
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,320
with the little ghost
that brings up the details

557
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,060
that are unique to Kiro.

558
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,770
And you can see here at the top,

559
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,200
the spec that we're
working on is listed here.

560
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,400
And so I can see the
spec that I have here.

561
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,920
I can create as many specs as I want.

562
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,900
So I'm not limited to one spec.

563
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,350
I don't have to try and build
my entire project in one go.

564
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,817
I can create multiple different specs

565
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:41,310
and I can track them all as I go along.

566
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,460
We'll finish this one
out here in a moment.

567
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,710
But down here I have Agent Steering.

568
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,420
So what is Agent Steering?

569
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,000
Well, if you've used other
generative AI tools before,

570
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,700
you're familiar with the idea of context,

571
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,100
or you're familiar with the idea of rules.

572
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,430
So in Q Developer, for instance,
we have the idea of rules.

573
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,670
What a rule is, is essentially
just a piece of context

574
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,330
that sort of provides guidelines
for the LLM to follow.

575
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,560
Whenever you document or
whenever you write a function,

576
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,180
I want you to include a comment block

577
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,690
that looks like you know,
X, Y, Z at the top of it.

578
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,320
And so that's a rule, I want
Kiro to to do that for me.

579
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,230
Steering documents though,
and particularly this button

580
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,690
called Generate Steering Documents,

581
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,030
deal with one of the challenges

582
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,070
that we talked about in
the slide presentation,

583
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,680
which is how do I deal with projects

584
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,480
that have existing code?

585
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,650
How do I deal with a project

586
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,140
that has hundreds of
thousands of lines of code?

587
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,750
Well, in order to do
that, what I need to do

588
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,210
is I need to document that somehow,

589
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,430
I need to create some context around it,

590
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,990
I need to summarize it,

591
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,150
and I need to make that
available to the LLM

592
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,480
in the form of rules or
context or something like that.

593
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,700
And so what Generate
Steering Documents does

594
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,110
is that the first time I...

595
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,110
Or whenever I open up a
new code base in Kiro,

596
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,030
and by "new" here, I mean new to Kiro.

597
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,970
So maybe I've been working
on this project for 10 years,

598
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,760
but I'm gonna open it up in
Kiro and I'm gonna go down

599
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,280
and I'm gonna hit that Generate
Steering Documents button.

600
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,110
And what it's gonna do for me

601
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,290
is it's going to reverse
analyze that code for me.

602
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,177
So it's gonna go through
all of that source code

603
00:24:18,177 --> 00:24:20,610
and it's going to summarize it for me.

604
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,640
and it's gonna say, "All
right, here are the details

605
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,240
that I need to be aware of when you ask me

606
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,860
to make a change to this code."

607
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,600
And so it's going to create
a file called product.

608
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,210
And the product file is a natural language

609
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,470
summary of the code.

610
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,230
It's a layout of what is this code doing

611
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,720
that I as as a reader, as a human,

612
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,137
could quickly pull up and say,

613
00:24:44,137 --> 00:24:45,240
"All right, give me a summary

614
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,140
of what this 800,000 line
code project is doing,"

615
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,373
and I can read through that.

616
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:52,260
Then it's gonna build a tech file.

617
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,270
And the tech file is really gonna mirror

618
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,640
what our design document
file looks like here.

619
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,290
It's gonna be the tech stack.

620
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,550
What language is it written in?

621
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,260
What libraries is it using?

622
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,180
What's its strategy for error handling?

623
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,130
What's its strategy for testing?

624
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,760
What are the commands necessary
to boot the dev server?

625
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,580
What's the command necessary
to run the test suite?

626
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,720
All of those different things

627
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,670
are gonna get captured in the tech file.

628
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,790
And then it's gonna build the...

629
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:19,873
I'm blanking on the last name.

630
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,630
The product file, I
think is the last file,

631
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,010
is essentially the roadmap.

632
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,220
And so the roadmap file is gonna lay out,

633
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,320
here's the directory
structure of this project,

634
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,290
here's all of the different
directories, here's the code,

635
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,480
the files that are in
each of these directories.

636
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,940
Here's what's relevant about
each of these directories

637
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,230
in each of these files.

638
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,870
Here's the major classes and modules

639
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,310
and elements inside of these.

640
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,290
And equally as important,

641
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,500
if I ask you to make a change
to this particular module,

642
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,240
what's the blast radius?

643
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,370
So I ask you to make a change

644
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,810
to the authentication component
in my 800,000 line project.

645
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,580
If I go in and modify that,

646
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,110
how many other things in this project

647
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,660
are gonna be impacted by that change?

648
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,520
And in order to know the answer to that,

649
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,640
I need to know what the
spiderweb looks like

650
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,220
of how these different modules
interact with each other.

651
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,670
And so Kiro is gonna capture
all of that information for me

652
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,310
in the form of these three steering files.

653
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,500
And it's gonna do that
for me automatically

654
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,120
when I press that button.

655
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,120
But that steering directory is open-ended,

656
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,540
so I can add whatever other
things I want to add there.

657
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,750
So if I have a rule about how
I do software development,

658
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,840
I can generate that and add
it to the steering directory.

659
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,550
If I have a rule about...

660
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,810
Or if I have information

661
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,510
about a third-party API that I talk to

662
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,640
and I want to be able to be aware of that,

663
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,180
I want the LLM to understand
how do I use that API,

664
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,070
what does it do, how does it work?

665
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,950
I can document that and add
it to the steering directory.

666
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,140
And all of these files they live,

667
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,210
if we go back to the File Explorer,

668
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,370
they live inside of this .kiro directory

669
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,200
at the root of my project.

670
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,930
So you can see here, we're
starting out from scratch.

671
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,940
I don't have anything
in my File Explorer yet

672
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,980
except the specs that I created.

673
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,260
But as we start generating out more code,

674
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,830
this will all get captured
in here as we go along.

675
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,760
So does that answer your question?

676
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,249
- Yes. Thank you.
- Perfect.

677
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:18,480
- [Ryan Bachman] There's a question.

678
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,250
- [Audience Member] Yeah. So you mentioned

679
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,727
that we're not gonna
build an OS ever in life

680
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:25,290
in this sort of like
single prompt fashion,

681
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,530
which like from a process
perspective probably makes sense,

682
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,630
small increments and like a human needs

683
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,764
to also understand the
instrument they're working on.

684
00:27:33,764 --> 00:27:35,163
Like technical limits.

685
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:38,246
We are blurting out a lot of context.

686
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,040
Is there going to be a technical limit?

687
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,140
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Yeah.
So the question there is,

688
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,270
is there a technical context limit

689
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,530
that we need to be aware of?

690
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,425
And just like every LLM
there are context...

691
00:27:53,425 --> 00:27:55,563
There's a context window that applies.

692
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,230
Kiro has a 200,000 character
context window at the moment.

693
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,243
- [Ryan Bachman] Token.

694
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,350
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Yeah, token.

695
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,103
Sorry, what did I say, "character"?

696
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:09,303
- Character.
- Sorry. Token window.

697
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,310
We have some plans to
release bigger token windows.

698
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,400
As the models are evolving, the
token windows are expanding.

699
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,700
And so the product is kind
of evolving along with that.

700
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,700
If you get to a point where
your token window is full,

701
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,350
Kiro will ask you if you want to compact

702
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,860
your current session down
and start with, you know,

703
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,010
essentially reset your context window.

704
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,930
But one of the things about using specs

705
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,270
and using them with steering documents,

706
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,190
to the question that was asked earlier,

707
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,510
is that the combination of steering files

708
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,120
and spec files is a really
powerful combination

709
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,010
in the sense that all of this information

710
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,820
is already documented, largely,
in these markdown files.

711
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,460
So if I need to reset my session,

712
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,760
if I want to go on vacation
and come back on Monday,

713
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,070
I can do that and I
haven't lost a whole lot

714
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:07,020
because I'm detailing everything
here in these static files

715
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,660
and I can share these
files across the team.

716
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,490
So if somebody else needs to come in

717
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,560
and pick up where I left off

718
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,420
and do it from their own machine,

719
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,180
we don't need to worry about transferring

720
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,150
the session details because we've captured

721
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,900
all of the major important
points in these markdown files.

722
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,600
And so that's a big part
of why we're doing this

723
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,600
is because, again, we want
to work on collaboration.

724
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,880
We wanna be able to make
sure that every member

725
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,700
of the team is working
with the same context

726
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,590
and moving in the same direction

727
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,350
so that we cut out all of those variables.

728
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,230
So to keep things moving here,

729
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,630
I'm gonna move from
the design document now

730
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,910
and I'm gonna move on to
the implementation plan.

731
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,230
And while it's doing that,

732
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,440
if we have more questions, I
can certainly answer those.

733
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,588
- [Audience Member]
Yeah. I have a question.

734
00:29:53,588 --> 00:29:56,205
So let's say we have team

735
00:29:56,205 --> 00:29:58,988
where we have business
analysts that use Jira

736
00:29:58,988 --> 00:30:01,238
to enter the spec and that.

737
00:30:08,777 --> 00:30:09,840
- [Ryan Bachman] So the question is

738
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,870
how does this interact
with something like Jira

739
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,090
for like product management
and stuff like that?

740
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,640
Like, what's the interaction look like?

741
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,670
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Yeah.
So as an organization,

742
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:25,200
my product managers are writing
their user stories in Jira,

743
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,200
and I want to be able to use
spectrum and development,

744
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,170
but I don't want to create
multiple sources of truth.

745
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,090
I don't want to take what's in Jira

746
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,070
and replicate it into my repo

747
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,657
and then have to deal with drift

748
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:39,840
and the potential of
things splitting apart.

749
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,353
And so the way in which you
solve for that is twofold.

750
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,780
One, you can install an MCP server.

751
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,510
So I can install the Jira MCP server

752
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,210
and I can integrate that
with my Jira project.

753
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,290
I can enter my credentials,

754
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:58,263
I can use a remote MCP
server, I can use a local one.

755
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,370
And I can enter the details
for my Jira project.

756
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,937
And then in the prompt here I can say,

757
00:31:03,937 --> 00:31:07,317
"Hey, go get the user story ABC."

758
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,990
Or "Go get the user story

759
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,570
for adding the authentication module

760
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,240
to my application and poll that in."

761
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,590
And so what that does is it goes in,

762
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,690
it gets the information from Jira

763
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,827
and it polls that information in

764
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:21,360
and it reads that information

765
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,480
and it uses that to create the spec.

766
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,480
And so that's how I bridge
that gap from Kiro to Jira.

767
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,150
But that doesn't necessarily
entirely solve my problem,

768
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,190
it does get me access to that information.

769
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,800
It helps me build the spec
so I don't have to write

770
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,950
or copy paste all that
information into the prompt block.

771
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,750
But what happens if I make a change

772
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,780
to the design document or what
happens if I make a change

773
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,040
to the requirements document?

774
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,890
I say, "I want to tweak
one of these user stories."

775
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,000
Or, "I wanna make an adjustment

776
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,160
to one of these acceptance criteria."

777
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,320
I want to be able to
reflect that information

778
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,580
back into Jira so that my
data is staying in sync

779
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,190
so that I'm not creating
that drift situation.

780
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,690
And the way in which I do that

781
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,320
is using the last feature of Kiro

782
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,040
that we haven't talked about
yet, which is Agent Hooks.

783
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,780
And so what Agent Hooks are,

784
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,840
and I'll create one for
you here in a moment.

785
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,610
But what an a what an Agent hook is

786
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,100
is essentially an event-driven prompt.

787
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,067
So I take a prompt and my
prompt in this case would be,

788
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,510
"Whenever there's a change
to my requirements document,

789
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,880
I want you to summarize that change

790
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,993
and reflect it back to the
appropriate user story in Jira.

791
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,460
And I want you to run
this prompt automatically

792
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,360
whenever there's a change
to a requirements.md file.

793
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,060
So whenever you detect a file save event

794
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,670
on a requirements.md file,

795
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,250
summarize the change and push it back

796
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,620
to the appropriate Jira user story."

797
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,630
And so what this does now

798
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,460
is it creates a circular feedback loop.

799
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,070
So in the prompt I say,
"Go get the details

800
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:03,390
for the user story
related to my auth module

801
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:07,200
and poll that in and
generate the spec for it."

802
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,970
And then when I go and I make a change

803
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,730
to one of the acceptance
criteria in that spec,

804
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,577
my Agent Hook says,

805
00:33:12,577 --> 00:33:15,090
"I detect you made a file save event

806
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,010
in your requirements document.

807
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,450
I'm gonna go and summarize that

808
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,970
and push that change back to Jira."

809
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:21,960
And that's all happening,

810
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,840
that connection there is
happening via the MCP server.

811
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,900
The MCP server doesn't just
allow me to read information,

812
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,400
it also allows me to write,

813
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,917
assuming I have the correct
permissions to do so.

814
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:34,200
And then it summarizes
it and it pushes it back.

815
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,950
And so now I have my user
stories are staying in sync

816
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,200
with my third-party tools.

817
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,743
So things like Jira can
be managed that way.

818
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,660
A lot of companies have
their design standards

819
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,670
or their software development standards

820
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,100
documented in something like Confluence.

821
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,210
They have an internal Wiki

822
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,910
or they have a SharePoint
server that lays out

823
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,160
how we do design, how we
do software development,

824
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,660
how we do all of those things.

825
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,250
And we can solve for that as well

826
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,550
with an MCP server that connects to that.

827
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,057
And then a steering file that says,

828
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:09,780
"Hey, whenever you
generate a design document,

829
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,420
make sure you go and refer
to our design standards

830
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:16,710
or our architecture standards
available at this MCP server

831
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,290
and use that information
so that you're not just

832
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,340
inventing some standard
for how you want me

833
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,160
to do software development.

834
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,280
Use the standards that
I've already established."

835
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,040
So that's how you would go about

836
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,830
kind of creating that feedback loop.

837
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,320
So we can see here now that
we've created our requirements,

838
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,490
we've created our design,

839
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,800
and now we've created our task list.

840
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,950
So our task list here is
essentially the project plan.

841
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,780
What are the things that I need to do

842
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,180
to go and implement these requirements

843
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:52,020
to this particular design standard?

844
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,090
And what Kiro comes back
with is it comes back

845
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,700
with this list of things
that need to be implemented,

846
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,560
and it's fairly exhaustive.

847
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,270
We have, let's see, 17,
18 tasks in this list.

848
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,850
And you can see that some
of them are grayed out,

849
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,670
some of them are bold and
some of them are grayed out.

850
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,070
And some of our tasks have sub tasks,

851
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:16,070
like task two has a task
2.1 and a 2.2 and a 2.3.

852
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,613
Some of them are grayed out.

853
00:35:17,613 --> 00:35:21,030
What that means is that some
of these tasks are optional.

854
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,160
So Kiro's gonna make a
distinction here for me now

855
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,993
and it's gonna say,

856
00:35:23,993 --> 00:35:25,640
"All right, well are you building an MVP.

857
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,360
Do you just want something quick and dirty

858
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,750
that you can kind of test out
and see what it looks like?

859
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,970
Or are you building a
production grade application?

860
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,130
In which case we need
to make sure we cover

861
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,930
all the bells and whistles?"

862
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:41,347
And so it's gonna ask me
here in the execution log,

863
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,420
"Which one are you making?

864
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,670
Are you making a quick MVP?

865
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,340
Or are you making a
comprehensive production app?"

866
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,840
Since we're pressed on time here,

867
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,180
I'm gonna say we're gonna make a MVP,

868
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,790
and I'm gonna leave those things optional.

869
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,890
And, really, those
tasks are around testing

870
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,660
and they're around documentation.

871
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,410
Our quick and dirty MVP application here

872
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,630
doesn't need a robust unit testing

873
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,300
and documentation strategy for it.

874
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,520
We just want something
that we can test out

875
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,410
and give it a try.

876
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,710
And if we look at these
individual tasks here now,

877
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,740
we can see that each task
has a checkbox next to it

878
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,453
that's gonna track our progress.

879
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:21,720
It's gonna tell us, "Is this task done?

880
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,770
Is it in progress?

881
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,330
Has it not been started yet?"

882
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,160
It's gonna lay out some of the details

883
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,660
that that task involves.

884
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,097
And then in blue there at the
bottom, it's going to say,

885
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:33,210
"Well, which of the
requirements are we fulfilling

886
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,190
by doing these particular tasks?"

887
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,110
So we're gonna get some traceability here

888
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,440
from the requirements to
the actual implementation.

889
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,290
So the first task here has
a button at the top of it

890
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,570
that says "Start Task."

891
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,850
And when I click that "Start Task" button,

892
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,010
it's going to go now
and it's going to switch

893
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,220
from Spec mode and it's
gonna switch into Vibe mode.

894
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,320
So when I click the "Start Task" button,

895
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,360
it's actually gonna go
and it's gonna start

896
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,050
actually producing the
code to implement this.

897
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,180
So this is gonna involve running commands,

898
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,610
it's going to need to
be able to set up React,

899
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:08,610
it's gonna need to be able
to configure TypeScript,

900
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,530
it's gonna have to
install the dependencies.

901
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,000
And you can see here now

902
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,800
that it's gonna get started on that.

903
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,970
So it's going to start out

904
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,520
by running the create vite command,

905
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,120
and it's gonna ask me for
my permission to do so,

906
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,640
'cause it's about to run a
command on my command line,

907
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,430
so it's gonna make some
changes to my local code

908
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,960
or to my local environment,

909
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,697
and I'm gonna have to approve this.

910
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:32,040
And so I can either accept this command,

911
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,760
I can add this command to
a trusted list of commands,

912
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,520
essentially saying, "I'll
give you permission to this

913
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,620
and don't ask me about this again.

914
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,690
So the next time you come across a command

915
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,420
that looks like this, go
and do it automatically,

916
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,040
don't ask me."

917
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,960
I can reject the command or
I can modify the command.

918
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,210
So here, to keep this simple,

919
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:59,210
we're gonna go ahead and
tell it to run the command.

920
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,603
And we can see right here
it ran into a problem.

921
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,290
I have Node installed.

922
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,330
Why is it not...

923
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,030
All right. In its effort
to be helpful here,

924
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,490
it's gonna try and figure out
how to do this automatically

925
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,690
without the fact that
I have Node installed.

926
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,530
We're gonna let this run
and we'll see how it goes.

927
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,590
But essentially what it's gonna do here

928
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,690
is it's going to kick off and you can see

929
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,533
that it's running in the terminal
window here at the bottom.

930
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,560
And it's going to start to generate

931
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,480
the files that are necessary.

932
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,700
So it's creating the vite config file,

933
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,250
it's creating the TypeScript config file,

934
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,520
it's creating a git ignore
file and the package.json

935
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,340
and all of the different
things that are necessary here.

936
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,570
So it's creating our main file,
our app.tsx file, our index.

937
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,890
So it's going to go through and it's going

938
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,110
to create the structure
for my application.

939
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,870
And if we switch over to
the File Explorer here,

940
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:13,110
we can see that it is generating
all of the different files

941
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,940
in our repository here.

942
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,580
So we're getting all of
these things built out for us

943
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,053
as it goes along.

944
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:21,900
And we'll figure out why

945
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,810
it can't find Node here in a moment.

946
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,920
But it's gonna go through this.

947
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,470
And you can see in the task list here

948
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,780
that it marks this as task in progress.

949
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,750
And we've got a little
hash here in the checkbox

950
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,390
denoting the fact that
this is in progress.

951
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,760
And we can view the changes here

952
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,200
that are happening in a git diff.

953
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,150
So if I click on this,

954
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,910
I can see all the different
files that are being modified

955
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,740
and the changes that
are being made to them.

956
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,660
And since we're starting
everything from scratch,

957
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,830
this is not gonna be a
particularly exciting diff

958
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:56,280
to look at, but you can see
here exactly what's happening.

959
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,240
And when it finishes,

960
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,120
we'll be able to look at
the execution log as well.

961
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,640
So now you can see that
the task is completed,

962
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,730
we can view the changes and
we can view the execution log,

963
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,740
which means we can come
back and we can see

964
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,230
what exactly happened
in the execution log,

965
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,880
what commands did it run,

966
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,250
and what were the results
of those commands.

967
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,740
Notably, we'll figure
out that surprisingly,

968
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,560
I don't have Node installed on my machine,

969
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,930
and the issue that that created.

970
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,670
And so it works through that.

971
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,720
At the end of this too,

972
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,880
it also tells me how many credits it used,

973
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,130
and how much time it took to run.

974
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,130
So this particular command,
or this particular task

975
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,520
took 2.3 credits, you'll
note the decimal there.

976
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,790
Credits can be consumed
in partial fractions.

977
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,920
So it's not going to charge
me for three credits,

978
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,860
it's gonna charge me for 2.3 credits

979
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,180
rather than rounding up.

980
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,763
And it took two minutes
and 59 seconds to complete.

981
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,370
And so we've got our task here.

982
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,070
And so the task now,

983
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,450
if we come back to the File Explorer,

984
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,120
these files are captured in the repo.

985
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,190
So now I can go and I can do a git commit

986
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,250
and I can check this
code into my repository

987
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,580
and I can say, "All
right, here are the specs

988
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,750
that I'm working from."

989
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,487
And so if I have multiple
developers, I can say,

990
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:12,540
"All right, well, I want this
developer to do task one,

991
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,550
and I want this developer to do task two,

992
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,100
and I want this developer
to do task three."

993
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,990
And I can divvy out the workload,

994
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,360
but they're all working from
the same requirements document

995
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,290
and the same design document
and the same task list.

996
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,000
So we're all moving in the same direction.

997
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,460
And if we had an existing code base here,

998
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,320
we could say they're all working

999
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,180
from the same steering documents as well.

1000
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,310
So they all have the same understanding

1001
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,900
of that core code base.

1002
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,830
We're not relying on three
different inferences of the LLM

1003
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:44,580
to draw the same conclusions
about that existing code.

1004
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,890
It's all happening and it's documented

1005
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,870
and it's shared across the team.

1006
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:51,030
So we get that collaborative nature

1007
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,890
that we were talking about.

1008
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:57,543
Now somebody asked about what
do we do with Agent Hooks?

1009
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,330
And so with an agent hook,

1010
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,532
I can come in here and I can say,

1011
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:03,450
"All right, I'm gonna
create an agent hook."

1012
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:07,810
I'm gonna say, "Whenever a change is made

1013
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:13,820
to a requirements.md file,

1014
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,220
summarize the changes
and reflect them back

1015
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,467
to the associated Jira user story."

1016
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,050
And I'm gonna kick this off.

1017
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,840
And what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna tell Kiro

1018
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,870
to go and create a hook that does this.

1019
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,420
Now I specified what
I want the hook to do.

1020
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,920
I want it to summarize changes

1021
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,020
and reflect them back to Jira.

1022
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,150
And I told it what files I care about,

1023
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,640
namely the requirements.md file.

1024
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,140
It's gonna go off and it's
gonna do the rest here.

1025
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,520
(audience laughing)

1026
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,960
- [Audience Member] Looks great.

1027
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,640
- [Ryan Bachman] Looks good.

1028
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,090
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] That looks-

1029
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,190
- [Audience Member] Looks accurate.

1030
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,893
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] I love live demos.

1031
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,690
- [Ryan Bachman] Obfuscated code.

1032
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,290
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] So we can
see here in the hook panel,

1033
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,947
it's created a hook here with the title,

1034
00:43:05,947 --> 00:43:08,550
"Requirements to Jira Sync."

1035
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,750
It's created a description.

1036
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,450
This is gonna monitor
the requirements.md files

1037
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:15,600
and it's going to automatically
summarize those changes

1038
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,930
and reflect them back to
the associated Jira story.

1039
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,540
It's going to look for a file save event.

1040
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,100
There's a couple of
different options in here.

1041
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,260
I've got File Created, File Saved,

1042
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,990
File Deleted, or a manual trigger.

1043
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,940
Essentially that's just a saved prompt.

1044
00:43:30,893 --> 00:43:33,180
A manual hook is essentially
just a saved prompt

1045
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,883
that I can run whenever
I want to kick it off.

1046
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,510
It's gonna tell me the
file paths to look for.

1047
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:43,050
It's gonna look for anything
that's called requirements.md.

1048
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,460
I could tell it to look for any file

1049
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,990
in a particular directory.

1050
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,550
I could add multiple different things

1051
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:50,550
that I want it to look for.

1052
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:53,130
And then we get the actual prompt itself.

1053
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,380
This is the prompt that it generated

1054
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,170
based on that input that I gave it.

1055
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:02,010
So a requirements.md
file has been modified,

1056
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,560
please analyze the changes,

1057
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,710
summarize the changes in
clear and concise way,

1058
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,320
identify the associated Jira story,

1059
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,290
and then push the changes
up to that Jira story

1060
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,670
when you're done.

1061
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,650
And so we've gotten now an Agent Hook.

1062
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:20,040
And just like my specs
and my steering files,

1063
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:24,570
these hooks get stored inside
of this .kiro directory,

1064
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,763
so I've got my hooks here as well.

1065
00:44:26,763 --> 00:44:29,970
What that means now is that all the users

1066
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,400
on the team have the same hooks.

1067
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,520
All the developers now
have the same specs,

1068
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,520
they have the same steering
files, they have the same hooks.

1069
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,810
And so everybody is working

1070
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:44,910
from the same set of information.

1071
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:48,330
And this is how we
solve for, again, scale.

1072
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:50,460
It's how we solve for collaboration

1073
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,770
and it's how we solve for visibility

1074
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,950
into the actual
understanding of what the LLM

1075
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,140
is going to do.

1076
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,010
So how is it going to behave?

1077
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:01,440
What are the things that
it's going to perform?

1078
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,120
And how is it going to go about

1079
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,420
and actually perform them?

1080
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,710
Wanna open it up for some more questions?

1081
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,528
- [Ryan Bachman] Yeah, yeah, we got-

1082
00:45:12,528 --> 00:45:13,361
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] We are unfortunately

1083
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:14,790
not going to have enough
time to actually build

1084
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,193
this entire application
in the next 15 minutes.

1085
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:23,010
And Kiro is spitting a little
bit of gibberish here anyway.

1086
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,480
- [Audience Member]
Deterministic this process is

1087
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,310
because it has to be repeatable, right?

1088
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,930
For everybody?

1089
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:28,763
- [Ryan Bachman] Yeah. So the question is

1090
00:45:28,763 --> 00:45:31,680
how deterministic is this process?

1091
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,300
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] So LLMs are,

1092
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,890
as we've said a couple times now,

1093
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:37,503
LLMs are by definition non-deterministic.

1094
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,040
The way in which you make
them more deterministic

1095
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,230
is to provide more context.

1096
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:47,010
So the more guardrails and guidelines

1097
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,560
and context you can provide,

1098
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,770
the more consistent the output you'll get.

1099
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,577
So if I say, for instance,

1100
00:45:54,577 --> 00:45:57,660
"Generate a web application,"
and that's all I say,

1101
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,823
and I ask that five times,

1102
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,510
I'm gonna get a React
application, a Python application,

1103
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,690
a Rails application, maybe
another React application.

1104
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,060
I'm gonna get a lot of variability there.

1105
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,927
But if I add context and I say,

1106
00:46:10,927 --> 00:46:13,110
"Generate a React application,"

1107
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,520
all five times it's gonna generate

1108
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,260
a React application for me.

1109
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,350
So the point being, the
more context I provide,

1110
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,330
the more detail I lay out,

1111
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,880
the more deterministic the output will be.

1112
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,910
And the challenge with
that is that, historically,

1113
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:31,910
writing the context of
these three spec files

1114
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,123
into the prompt every time
I want to do something,

1115
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,990
it's not particularly scalable

1116
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:43,230
because the more expansive
I'm trying to build,

1117
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:45,750
the more details there
are and the more gaps

1118
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,000
I have to fill when I
generate that prompt.

1119
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,700
And I have to rely on every
member of the team to do that,

1120
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,200
which is not realistic.

1121
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,910
So what we're trying to solve for here

1122
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,650
is we're trying to solve for...

1123
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,650
Or we're trying to provide
that context upfront.

1124
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,330
We're trying to give everybody visibility

1125
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:03,240
into what that context is
and give them the opportunity

1126
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,270
to change that context if
they so deem appropriate

1127
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,710
before we've gone off and
actually done the work.

1128
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:12,300
But once we have that design file,

1129
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,250
once we have those requirements files,

1130
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,290
once we've laid out what the tasks are,

1131
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:18,840
once we've coupled that
with our steering files,

1132
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,110
we've got a fairly high
deterministic output

1133
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:25,050
in the sense that we've
covered all the gaps,

1134
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,180
we've closed a lot of the variables

1135
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,250
that the LLM would normally have to go off

1136
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,783
and figure out for itself.

1137
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,430
So it's still not 100% deterministic.

1138
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,860
There's still room for variability.

1139
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,880
And that's why we don't want it

1140
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,373
to remove the human in the loop.

1141
00:47:43,055 --> 00:47:44,520
We don't want Kiro to just take this code

1142
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,520
and deploy it into
production sight unseen.

1143
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,677
We still wanna do our poll requests,

1144
00:47:49,677 --> 00:47:52,560
our code reviews and
those types of things.

1145
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,650
But what we are trying to solve for here

1146
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:00,243
is a lot of wasted time reviewing code

1147
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:02,910
that is obviously wrong
because the context

1148
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,680
wasn't specified upfront.

1149
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,930
And so by doing this work upfront,

1150
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:10,650
we can cut down on the amount
of wasted code generated

1151
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:12,660
and we can improve the likelihood

1152
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,080
that a particular poll
request can be approved as is

1153
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,180
and merged in.

1154
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,410
- [Ryan Bachman] Yeah. And
the other thing I'll say

1155
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:23,730
to that too is the actual
code that's written, right?

1156
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,470
If he were to take the spec file,

1157
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,690
these requirements, and
blow away all the code

1158
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:28,920
and regenerate it,

1159
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,310
it's gonna look different
each time he does it.

1160
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,170
But that's implementation details, right?

1161
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:35,970
The requirements stay the same.

1162
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:38,070
How those requirements are satisfied

1163
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,900
is strictly implementation details.

1164
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,040
And what we're doing here,

1165
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,020
I think in essence is abstracting away

1166
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,700
the details of the code

1167
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,890
and focusing on the business requirements

1168
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,210
and acceptance criteria.

1169
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:51,180
'Cause the actual specifics
of the code implementation

1170
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:54,030
while able to change is not as important

1171
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,430
as satisfying the requirements.

1172
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,930
And that's where you're
gonna see the consistency.

1173
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,880
I haven't come to this side of the room,

1174
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,713
so I'm gonna start over here

1175
00:49:03,713 --> 00:49:05,220
'cause they've been ignored so far.

1176
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,053
What you got?

1177
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:06,886
- [Audience Member] How do you share

1178
00:49:06,886 --> 00:49:09,780
things like hooks across across projects?

1179
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,100
- [Ryan Bachman] Hooks across projects?

1180
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,000
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Hooks across projects

1181
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,900
are shared by the fact that
they're checked into the repo.

1182
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,140
Oh, sorry, you asked how do
you share them across projects,

1183
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,670
not across developers.

1184
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:23,880
So the way in which you
share hooks across projects

1185
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,070
at the moment is that you have to copy

1186
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,650
that hook into another project.

1187
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,030
You take that JSON file

1188
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,160
and you copy it into another project.

1189
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,370
That's not a particularly
scalable approach.

1190
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,530
And we do have some things on the roadmap

1191
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:41,620
and in the pipeline to make
those things more manageable

1192
00:49:42,943 --> 00:49:46,240
at the organization level to
be able to push those down

1193
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,630
from an administrative level.

1194
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:51,780
But today, in order to
share hooks across projects,

1195
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,540
you need to replicate the JSON file

1196
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,613
into the appropriate repo.

1197
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,910
- [Audience Member] My question
is Kiro ran into some issue.

1198
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,080
How reliable is this?

1199
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,000
How often do we run into this?

1200
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,100
- [Ryan Bachman] How reliable is Kiro?

1201
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,450
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] How reliable is Kiro?

1202
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:14,130
Well, normally I would tell
you that it's very reliable.

1203
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,490
Now obviously it struggled
on the generation

1204
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:18,723
of that Agent Hook.

1205
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:22,680
The issue with Node I think
is actually a local problem

1206
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,680
on my machine, which I will
figure out after this session.

1207
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:29,310
But generally speaking,

1208
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,650
Kiro is fairly reliable in the sense

1209
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:34,530
that it has a good
understanding of the source code

1210
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:38,250
and it generates source
code fairly reliably.

1211
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:41,430
You'll also find as in many cases

1212
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:42,930
when it does run into a challenge,

1213
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,000
and you could see this
actually in the task

1214
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,407
that we completed, it ran
the command and it said,

1215
00:50:47,407 --> 00:50:49,560
"Oh, you don't have Node installed."

1216
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,330
And so it actually self-corrected there

1217
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:53,250
and it said, "Well, let
me try something else."

1218
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,070
And it tried that and
that didn't work either

1219
00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:00,210
'cause I don't have NPX
installed either, apparently.

1220
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:01,043
And so then it said,

1221
00:51:01,043 --> 00:51:02,010
"All right, well now I'm gonna go

1222
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:04,560
and I'm just gonna generate
the code for you manually.

1223
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,780
And so I'm gonna skip that
step and I'm gonna keep going."

1224
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,970
And the point that I wanna make there

1225
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:13,080
is that these LLMs are designed
to be helpful by nature.

1226
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,240
So they want to produce results for you.

1227
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,810
And so given the context that's there,

1228
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:22,320
they're getting increasingly
intelligent in how they work.

1229
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,750
And so they're gonna try
a particular strategy

1230
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,370
and if that strategy doesn't work,

1231
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:28,350
they're gonna move on
to a different strategy

1232
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:31,860
and they're going to
problem solve along the way.

1233
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,290
And so generally speaking,

1234
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:38,377
Kiro is pretty effective
in that regard in saying,

1235
00:51:38,377 --> 00:51:40,950
"Hey, this is the approach
that I want to take.

1236
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:42,780
Wait a minute, this approach didn't work.

1237
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,340
Let me try a different approach

1238
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,080
and see if that solves the problem.

1239
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,250
And I'm gonna keep going."

1240
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,440
And at any point I can
step in and I can intervene

1241
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,300
and I can say, "You know what?

1242
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,670
You're right, I forgot to install Node.

1243
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:56,160
So let me pause you right
here and go take care of that

1244
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,480
and then pick it back up again

1245
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,770
and have you keep going

1246
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:00,630
rather than trying to solve for something

1247
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,967
that I obviously know is not right."

1248
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,750
So generally speaking,

1249
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,993
KIRO is pretty reliable in that sense.

1250
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,313
This particular example notwithstanding.

1251
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,010
- [Audience Member] So if
I want to make a change

1252
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,772
to a requirements document,

1253
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:26,745
do I directly do it in that
document or do I ask Kiro?

1254
00:52:26,745 --> 00:52:29,250
If I'm directly making the change,

1255
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:33,667
does Kiro check whether it
will break any other part?

1256
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,900
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Yeah.
So the question there was

1257
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,120
if I need to make a change
to the requirements document,

1258
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,090
so in this particular
case, we have this spec

1259
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,310
and we've actually
started building the code.

1260
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,190
So we actually have
already run the first task

1261
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:47,790
in the task list.

1262
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:51,510
So what happens now, as is common in life,

1263
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:52,687
somebody comes back and they say,

1264
00:52:52,687 --> 00:52:54,690
"Hey, you know, this requirement change,

1265
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:56,580
we don't want red, we want blue.

1266
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,500
And we need to make an adjustment."

1267
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,720
What do I do? How do I
actually implement that?

1268
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,070
There's two ways you can do that.

1269
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:04,530
You can actually come back into the prompt

1270
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:05,557
and you can say,

1271
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,710
"Kiro, I need to make an
adjustment to this spec.

1272
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,600
I need to change it from red to blue."

1273
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,540
And Kiro will go off and it
will make that change for me.

1274
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,390
Or I can change it manually.

1275
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,070
I can say, "You know what?

1276
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:21,220
I wanna get the planned date here

1277
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,130
and also a planned location."

1278
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:32,340
And if I put that change in
there manually like that,

1279
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:36,000
what I can do is I can hit
the "Refine" button up here.

1280
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,260
And when I hit the "Refine" button,

1281
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,440
what Kiro does is it actually goes

1282
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,570
and it evaluates the
change that I just made

1283
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:44,070
to that requirements document.

1284
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:45,270
And not only is it going

1285
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,070
to refresh the requirements document

1286
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:49,590
to make sure that this
is logically consistent

1287
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:52,440
because I only changed it
in one acceptance criteria,

1288
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,940
the likelihood is that this is probably

1289
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,990
gonna need to be reflected

1290
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,630
in a couple different acceptance criteria.

1291
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,217
It's also gonna make changes
though to the design.

1292
00:54:00,217 --> 00:54:01,920
So in the design document,

1293
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,770
we laid out what the models looked like,

1294
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:06,300
what the database tables looked like,

1295
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,860
all of those different things.

1296
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,690
Well, now we've gone and
added a new attribute,

1297
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,870
so we're gonna need to make
an adjustment to that model.

1298
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,750
So we need to reflect
these changes downstream.

1299
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,150
So we need to make the change
not only in the requirements,

1300
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,010
but also in the design document.

1301
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:24,600
And potentially, you
know, what this involves,

1302
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,670
if we had gotten far
enough in the task list

1303
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:29,220
that we'd actually implemented
those tables already,

1304
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,320
we'd actually written the code for them,

1305
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,390
we would then need to create another task

1306
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:35,400
to go in and modify those tables.

1307
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,100
And so we wanna reflect that
in the task list as well.

1308
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,100
So what Kiro does when we
hit the "Refine" button

1309
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:41,933
is that it says,

1310
00:54:41,933 --> 00:54:44,463
"All right, I can see
that you've made a change.

1311
00:54:45,505 --> 00:54:47,910
I've gone through and I've
validated the requirements.

1312
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,770
Now I'm gonna move on to the design phase

1313
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,450
and I'm gonna make the adjustments there,

1314
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,130
and I'm gonna carry that downstream.

1315
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,200
And if I need to create more tasks

1316
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,603
because we've already implemented
this piece of the code,

1317
00:54:57,603 --> 00:54:59,280
then I'll add some new tasks."

1318
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,020
If we haven't implemented this yet,

1319
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,857
then I can just modify
the task and I can say,

1320
00:55:02,857 --> 00:55:06,480
"Hey, do it the the new way
when you go and implement it."

1321
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,070
So I have a couple of
different strategies there

1322
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,660
for how to deal with this.

1323
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,570
But generally speaking that's
how you would adjust for that.

1324
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:13,500
You'd make the change.

1325
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,020
You can either ask Kiro
to make the change for you

1326
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,490
in the prompt or you can do it manually

1327
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:19,050
and then hit the "Refine" button

1328
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,270
and let Kiro run it through downstream.

1329
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,008
- [Audience Member] In both cases,

1330
00:55:23,008 --> 00:55:24,707
Kiro does all these processes?

1331
00:55:24,707 --> 00:55:26,130
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Correct.

1332
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,473
And it's gonna trace that downstream.

1333
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,522
- [Audience Member] I see that it created

1334
00:55:35,522 --> 00:55:37,939
a few architectural diagrams.

1335
00:55:39,178 --> 00:55:42,252
Can it understand these backgrounds

1336
00:55:42,252 --> 00:55:44,419
if I provide mine for him?

1337
00:55:45,347 --> 00:55:46,230
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Yeah.

1338
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,240
So two strategies there.

1339
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,340
It created architectural diagrams

1340
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:55,340
in the design document
using ASCII text here.

1341
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,560
And so you can provide ASCII text files

1342
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,983
that have similar design
diagrams and it can infer those.

1343
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:06,960
You can also just draw a design
document on a whiteboard,

1344
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,920
take a picture of it and
upload it as an image file,

1345
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,753
and then have it say,

1346
00:56:11,753 --> 00:56:15,270
"Go and implement this
architecture diagram

1347
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,560
based on this image,"

1348
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,080
and it will evaluate the image file,

1349
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,210
infer the contents of that image

1350
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:24,240
and go off and actually do the spec

1351
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,920
or the implementation based on that.

1352
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,550
So you can do it based
on either ASCII text,

1353
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,590
those types of implementations,

1354
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,780
or you can do it based on an image file

1355
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,503
like a PNG or a GIF or
whatever the case may be there.

1356
00:56:38,523 --> 00:56:40,549
- [Audience Member] If
I have a Lucid chart?

1357
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:42,233
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Yeah.
If you have a Lucid chart,

1358
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:44,970
you can do that, most
likely with a screenshot

1359
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:49,893
uploaded of the Lucid
diagram and then use that.

1360
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,493
- [Audience Member] I have a question.

1361
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:54,900
You said that a project can
have more than one spec.

1362
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:55,823
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Correct.

1363
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,250
- [Audience Member] How
do you define a spec?

1364
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,473
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] What do you mean

1365
00:57:03,473 --> 00:57:05,415
"How do you define a spec?"

1366
00:57:05,415 --> 00:57:06,473
- [Audience Member] In this
particular example (indistinct).

1367
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:11,294
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Yep.

1368
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:15,461
- [Audience Member] (indistinct).

1369
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,327
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] So I want to say,

1370
00:57:22,327 --> 00:57:25,930
"I want to add an authentication layer

1371
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:31,790
to my fitness tracker app to keep track

1372
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:38,100
of which user is doing the activity."

1373
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,547
I'm gonna, again, put this into Spec mode.

1374
00:57:39,547 --> 00:57:42,840
I'm gonna type in my prompt
here and I'm gonna hit "Go."

1375
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,700
And what it's gonna do here

1376
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,580
is that it's going to
create another spec for me.

1377
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,950
And so...

1378
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,060
I've got a couple things running here.

1379
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,210
It's gonna go and it's
gonna create another spec.

1380
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,420
So the specs here are laid out.

1381
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:06,360
I've got a spec directory and
I've got a subdirectory here

1382
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,073
for the fitness activity tracker.

1383
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:14,310
And so that subdirectory
there has my design file,

1384
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:17,520
my requirements file,
and my task file in it.

1385
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:22,390
Now I've kicked it off and
I've asked it to generate

1386
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,800
a new spec for my authentication layer.

1387
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,540
So now I'm gonna add a new feature

1388
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,340
to my existing application.

1389
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,900
And so now what it's going to do

1390
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:35,900
is it's going to start
building out a new spec for me.

1391
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,630
And it's going to say...

1392
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:46,950
It's actually making changes
to the existing spec for me

1393
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,750
'cause I haven't implemented it yet.

1394
00:58:49,915 --> 00:58:51,690
If it were to build another spec,

1395
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,300
it would just create
another subdirectory there

1396
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,330
with three new files, a requirements file,

1397
00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:00,960
a design file and a tasks file.

1398
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,307
- [Audience Member] My
question is (indistinct).

1399
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:09,758
Requirements for the spec, right?

1400
00:59:09,758 --> 00:59:13,008
And how do you maintain best practices?

1401
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:17,003
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Sure.

1402
00:59:17,003 --> 00:59:19,620
The question is around best practices.

1403
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,390
What's the best way to think about a spec

1404
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:22,830
or how to treat it?

1405
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:25,470
Generally speaking the way...

1406
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,390
And, Ryan, you may have
different opinions on this,

1407
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:30,240
but generally speaking,
the way I treat a spec

1408
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:35,240
is I treat it as a bounded feature.

1409
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,460
So in this case an authentication layer.

1410
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:42,540
And that feature has a
specific set of things

1411
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,860
that I want to get done.

1412
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:45,780
If those things are not done yet,

1413
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,090
so in this case, we've
got a whole lot of tasks

1414
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:51,510
that haven't been implemented
yet, and something changes,

1415
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:52,980
I need to add another field,

1416
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,423
I need to change a color,

1417
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:58,830
then it makes sense to go
in and modify that spec.

1418
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,960
You know, add that feature, whatever.

1419
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,540
If that spec is done,
all the tasks are done,

1420
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:06,480
they're finished and
we've completed that spec,

1421
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,047
and now you come to me and you say,

1422
01:00:08,047 --> 01:00:10,080
"Hey, I want to add another thing to it.

1423
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,520
I wanna make a change."

1424
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,260
Generally speaking, what I would do

1425
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,900
is create another spec there.

1426
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,910
So that spec is done, it's finished,

1427
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:18,870
we're gonna put a bow on it,

1428
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:20,550
we're gonna slide it over to the side,

1429
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,790
and now we're gonna create a
new spec for this new thing.

1430
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:24,690
Whether it's a change,

1431
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:27,540
whether it's a new feature,
we're gonna create a new spec.

1432
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:30,360
So I generally try to treat my specs

1433
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,440
as kind of contained entities.

1434
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,330
So when I've done the work there,

1435
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:38,580
I slide it over, I say, "This is done."

1436
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,960
If I need to make any more changes,

1437
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,240
I'm gonna create a new spec
and I'm gonna deal with it

1438
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:46,470
there so that I have this
kind of running list of specs.

1439
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:51,150
You, technically, can go back
and modify an existing spec,

1440
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,010
even if all the tasks are done.

1441
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:55,260
But I find that that makes it really muddy

1442
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,060
to be able to keep track
of the work I've done

1443
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,730
and how I've done it and
to manage it that way.

1444
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:02,460
So I don't know if you have any
other thoughts on that, but-

1445
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,260
- [Ryan Bachman] No. I
mean, I definitely think

1446
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,030
it's more art than it is science.

1447
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,950
I mean, there's obviously
gonna be general...

1448
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:09,720
Don't put too much into it, right?

1449
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,640
Like, you have to get a sense.

1450
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,440
I think what you put into spec

1451
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,930
also influences how you
organize around that spec.

1452
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:18,360
While there is
collaboration aspects of it,

1453
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,030
I don't think I can divvy up a spec

1454
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:23,010
to three different teams, right?

1455
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:25,680
So think about boundaries
of the way you work,

1456
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,290
how you work, and the other,

1457
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:29,970
I think to emphasize your point

1458
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:32,250
is clear exit criteria, right?

1459
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,230
Like, it's not an ongoing thing.

1460
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:36,540
It's a defined thing that we know

1461
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:40,170
we have concrete, discrete
acceptance criteria

1462
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:43,290
that we can call done, essentially,
the acceptance of done,

1463
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:45,390
and then ship it before
we create another one.

1464
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:46,920
So they're not long-living,

1465
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,140
they're organized around
how we are organized.

1466
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:52,170
And, I mean, I don't know, Fibonacci,

1467
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,810
I wouldn't put in more
than, I don't know, 21?

1468
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,130
Is 21 Fibonacci.?

1469
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,660
I don't know, I'm just
making that number up.

1470
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:58,773
Nothing too big.

1471
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,090
- Question?
- Developers?

1472
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,770
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] Yeah. What
do you do with the developers

1473
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:07,227
who are using something other than VS Code

1474
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:12,227
and who would rather die
with their VIM application

1475
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:14,313
than migrate to something newer?

1476
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,813
It's a fair question and there
isn't a great answer for it.

1477
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,580
Q Developer has a number
of different plugins

1478
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,480
that can be installed.

1479
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,603
We have a JetBrains
plugin for Q Developer.

1480
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,610
What we have found though is
trying to maintain plugins

1481
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:35,940
for every conceivable IDE under the sun

1482
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,280
is a very complicated
process and you end up

1483
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,990
with a lot of leapfrogging

1484
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,690
and a lack of parity between them.

1485
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:45,150
So the strategy that we
have generally gone to there

1486
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:46,833
is to recommend the CLI.

1487
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,280
So the CLI allows you to do a lot

1488
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,100
of these things directly from the terminal

1489
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,570
and you can open up a terminal window

1490
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:58,980
in JetBrains or in Eclipse or in VS Code,

1491
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,910
the native version of VS
Code or in Visual Studio

1492
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,360
and you can do whatever
work you want to do there

1493
01:03:06,602 --> 01:03:10,170
and benefit from the generative
AI capabilities there

1494
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:11,220
in the CLI.

1495
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,810
And that's generally the strategy

1496
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,130
we would we propose there.

1497
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:16,710
And understanding that that's not entirely

1498
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,870
the same experience as what you have here,

1499
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:21,750
but it allows you to
keep your preferred IDE

1500
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,880
and still get some of those benefits.

1501
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,851
- [Audience Member] So
it does come with a CLI?

1502
01:03:25,851 --> 01:03:28,200
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] It
does come with a CLI.

1503
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,033
Yes?

1504
01:03:31,142 --> 01:03:32,060
- [Audience Member] How do you prevent

1505
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:34,439
Kiro from hallucinations?

1506
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:35,272
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] How do you prevent

1507
01:03:35,272 --> 01:03:37,980
Kiro from hallucinations?

1508
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,780
So hallucinations really
are a product of the model

1509
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,690
and how good the model is and
the training data in the model

1510
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:49,590
and then the context that the model has

1511
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,123
in responding to the prompt.

1512
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:54,873
The models that we are
using have all been vetted.

1513
01:03:56,010 --> 01:04:00,990
Kiro doesn't have a a bring
your own API key strategy to it.

1514
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:03,420
So we have a predefined set of models.

1515
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:07,980
We have support right
now for Sonnet 4.5 and 4.

1516
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:10,200
We have support for Haiku,

1517
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,203
and we have support for Opus, yeah.

1518
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:16,920
So those models are there
and we've vetted them

1519
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,440
and we've made sure that
they generally understand

1520
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,820
the context well.

1521
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:23,040
And then the steering
files and the spec files

1522
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,870
add the necessary context.

1523
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:27,690
It doesn't guarantee that
you won't see hallucinations,

1524
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:31,683
but it does reduce the
load fairly substantially.

1525
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:33,879
- [Audience Member] The second part was

1526
01:04:33,879 --> 01:04:37,200
are you gonna open it
up for like local LLMs?

1527
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,480
- [Ryan Yanchuleff] We
are looking at local LLMs,

1528
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,690
but if we do that, they will be defined

1529
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:45,870
the same way we define
our remote LLMs as well.

1530
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:48,330
So there'll be a defined set of LLMs

1531
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:51,783
that you can use that would work there.

1532
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:55,770
All right, I think we
have run out of time here.

1533
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:59,400
But I appreciate everybody coming out.

1534
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,350
Hopefully you found this useful.

1535
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:04,470
We didn't succeed in building
a fitness application,

1536
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:05,490
but hopefully you get a sense

1537
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:07,140
for how you would approach that

1538
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,180
and walk through that process.

1539
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:12,693
And I will make sure I have
Node installed next time.

1540
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:14,862
Thank you, everybody.

1541
01:05:14,862 --> 01:05:17,380
(audience applauding)
