1
00:00:02,588 --> 00:00:03,649
Thank you everybody.

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:06,269
Well, it's exciting to see at least some people

3
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:07,868
stayed around for a Thursday session.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,648
I love it. This is like the perfect day and time

5
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:13,470
because it actually allows me to try out some new material,

6
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:15,868
maybe set land some jokes, land some

7
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:17,969
commentary. It's gonna be fantastic.

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,429
So instead of doing slides and

9
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:22,690
boring you with more slides, what I thought I'd do

10
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:24,289
is walk you through a journey

11
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,329
of what's happening and why we created

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,850
these solutions.

13
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,649
Let's take ourselves back, put ourselves as

14
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:32,289
a producer for a sports league,

15
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,389
as an executive for a sports league.

16
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:37,039
What is one of the fundamental problems that they have?

17
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:38,950
And we've heard it over and over again.

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,609
They have tons and tons of footage.

19
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:44,209
How do you actually use all of your footage? How

20
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:46,478
do you make and monetize that as they go forward?

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,889
How do you coalesce those across MAMM systems?

22
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,520
MAMs are media asset management platforms.

23
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:53,969
How do you use your S3 archives effectively?

24
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,000
And then how do you bring and

25
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:58,340
start to talk about how you monetize that as you go

26
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,918
forward

27
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,579
and like many organizations they struggle

28
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:04,239
with how to break down those content silos

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,599
to create monetization and opportunities

30
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,859
to create opportunities and for their

31
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:09,900
businesses to grow.

32
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,609
Nothing was talking to each other. Nothing actually moves

33
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:15,778
together, and at the same time,

34
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:17,969
they can't even see how they use their

35
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:18,808
content effectively.

36
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,448
So this creates a big problem

37
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:24,189
and when we ask that question what if

38
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,569
what if your content was connected?

39
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,088
What if your solutions were

40
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:31,448
connected with each other? What if your content

41
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,209
had context in order to make it forward

42
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,000
and how do we break down the barriers of simplicity,

43
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:39,308
intelligence and create value across our

44
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,028
ecosystem?

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,620
So let's step back and walk through

46
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,480
what that journey would look like.

47
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,739
So with all that decades of footage and archived

48
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:49,909
assets, one of the biggest challenges and problems is

49
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,260
how do you move that all into a cloud archive? How

50
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,459
do you move it into a storage mechanism?

51
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,698
It's very difficult and it's very expensive,

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,308
so there's a barrier right there.

53
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,659
But more importantly,

54
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,838
how do you organize that data from

55
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,599
what you're looking at from metadata?

56
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,138
Metadata is a fancy word for tagging, and

57
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:07,278
how do you look at that from

58
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,879
disparate information sources?

59
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,419
When I was at other companies we would have hard drives

60
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,399
filled with content.

61
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:16,169
They'd be like Pokemon cards, you'd actually distribute

62
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,639
and deliver out to everybody else.

63
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,008
Nobody know where anything was, was there.

64
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:22,149
The problem is

65
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:23,699
once you look at that,

66
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:25,808
you can't ask the question of

67
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:29,229
how do I create a play, how do I create a, create

68
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:31,270
content, how do I create excitement with

69
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,349
that footage because it's gonna take

70
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:35,429
345 hours to

71
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:37,210
find that particular type of content.

72
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,669
You can't launch a new fan experience. You heard from the

73
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:40,508
demo the first day,

74
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:42,409
the keynote the first day, condo.

75
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,949
How do you tie your fans to your experience, to your

76
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:45,929
content, to your creators?

77
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,580
It's a big opportunity and it's a missed

78
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,618
opportunity that they can stop and they can't

79
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:52,139
sell their archives and their footage.

80
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:54,159
It's called content chaos.

81
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,990
But we wanna actually start to simplify

82
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,808
and transform that as we go forward

83
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:00,429
and what that looks like

84
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,129
is building that central

85
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,449
content repository of that brain

86
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:07,050
we actually look at how we take and simplify

87
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,778
the fragmented content and the disconnected assets

88
00:03:09,778 --> 00:03:11,129
that are looking at the left hand side,

89
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,389
create pipelines and agents to

90
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:16,469
understand what is actually that

91
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:17,110
content doing,

92
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:19,550
what agents you need to kick off and how you need to

93
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,610
process that. And then all the way on

94
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,429
the left hand side as you're looking at the screen,

95
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:26,008
you're actually getting that content intelligence, that

96
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,288
unified knowledge of how your

97
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:30,069
content and how your information is put together.

98
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:35,868
What this provides for you is it

99
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:37,169
provides for you the ability

100
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:39,469
to unify and execute your content.

101
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,538
So let's walk through these individual stages,

102
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:43,639
and I'll talk through each of them

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,550
individually.

104
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,020
Think about ingest.

105
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,038
Whether you're an HR department, whether you're a medical

106
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:50,960
records company,

107
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,399
whether you're looking at sports content and

108
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,740
footage that I talked about earlier.

109
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,639
You need to figure out where your content is. You need

110
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,819
to ingest that, and you wanna do it without

111
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,520
humans because more humans are involved,

112
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,179
the more error, the more challenges you get with

113
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:05,669
your individual types of content.

114
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,058
So the ingest allows you to structure your

115
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:10,399
content, but more importantly, as I talked about earlier,

116
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,580
build the right pipelines. Are you looking at sports

117
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,758
content? Are you looking at flat files? Are you looking at

118
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:16,798
spreadsheets?

119
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,230
How do I tie them all together and ingest them so the

120
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,819
data has meaning?

121
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:23,910
The next part is really around the enrichment

122
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,338
and enrichment is a fancy word for how do we

123
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:28,329
tag and coordinate data,

124
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,709
and this is an area where you want to start to build

125
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,920
your experimentation with your tagging.

126
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,230
And part of the problem is which models do you

127
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,209
use, as you heard from a lot of the sessions here,

128
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:39,699
we wanna simplify that. So we've built a

129
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:40,569
simple platform

130
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:43,230
to allow you to actually bring all of your models

131
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,470
in and start to experiment to see which

132
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,088
ones

133
00:04:46,548 --> 00:04:48,548
produce the right level of content and information that

134
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:50,709
you need. It's not complex. It's

135
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:52,829
not easy. It's built from a console, so

136
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:55,028
you can actually simply start to put models in

137
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,209
and start to leverage that to enrich your data.

138
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,670
They handle all the simple pieces of that

139
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,759
structure. What you get out of

140
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,819
it, going back to my analogy from a sports team,

141
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:07,338
think about a dunk.

142
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,139
When you see a dunk on, on, on film.

143
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,129
It's just a dunk.

144
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,678
It loses its context. It's, it loses its

145
00:05:14,678 --> 00:05:15,879
contextual awareness.

146
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:18,389
What we're able to do is now put the con

147
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,079
conte, the content,

148
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:22,600
the dunk in context of what actually happened.

149
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,040
So the dunk becomes he got the dunked

150
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,798
on who?

151
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,209
What was the defender?

152
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,569
What was the time? What was the scoring position?

153
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:31,959
How did all those things come together to

154
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,600
create that?

155
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,040
And now you've taken your simple vector

156
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,769
searches and created a multimodal

157
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:40,048
search to allow you to understand that

158
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,129
content as you go forward.

159
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,850
The last part is activate.

160
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:46,149
Think about it this way. I talked about a sports

161
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:48,309
team, but I'm gonna draw the analogy to a large brand

162
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:49,608
or retailer.

163
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:52,108
You work with them. It takes 39 weeks to

164
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:54,108
put together an overall marketing campaign

165
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:55,088
as you look at that.

166
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:56,750
Take care. Bye bye.

167
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:02,410
It's OK when you want to activate it.

168
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:05,009
So now you take and compress that 39

169
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:06,730
weeks by being able to find that content,

170
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:09,329
activate that content effectively, while

171
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,850
allowing your creative studios and creative authors

172
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,048
to still be able to use and leverage that

173
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:15,069
content as it goes forward.

174
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,040
Again, what we did is we didn't make things

175
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,639
harder.

176
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,000
We used AI and the agents to simplify

177
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,420
and uplift their workflow and their processes

178
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,160
to make it simpler, easier and effective

179
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,338
for them to work.

180
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:34,230
How this actually happens, if you think about it from a technical

181
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,420
thing, remember that dunk that I talked to you about.

182
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,028
Now we've built a knowledge graph. Amazon

183
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:41,509
has really great platforms with their Neptune database

184
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,769
to start to put context and information

185
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,809
for how all the content works together.

186
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,850
So that dunk now becomes a web

187
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,660
of meaning.

188
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:52,629
The player, as we talked about, the defender,

189
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,298
what kind of play, what happened before the play,

190
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,778
what was the scoring opportunity that they looked at?

191
00:06:58,108 --> 00:06:59,879
You're starting to build a method

192
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,119
to understand

193
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,579
how to leverage and use your content effectively.

194
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,939
So now you can ask those complex questions in

195
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:08,259
the activation phase of show

196
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,750
me every left-handed dunk.

197
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,119
scored in the last 5 years where the player

198
00:07:13,838 --> 00:07:14,819
where the score was tied.

199
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:17,588
It's not something you can do today

200
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:20,088
in our complex query system, and it's something

201
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:22,220
that people and producers for sports

202
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,449
content want to effectively use quickly,

203
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:25,829
rapidly and easily.

204
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,250
This is a tool that allows you to do that

205
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,889
in a very simplified manner.

206
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,920
What this does is it takes it from 3

207
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,000
hours, 4 hours to a matter of

208
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,600
seconds.

209
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:39,028
So think, think of yourself,

210
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:40,939
how you actually use this,

211
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:43,410
right? You actually have to understand the request

212
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,750
and I'm gonna show you a quick demo hopefully here shortly

213
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:47,928
of how this all comes together in our platform

214
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:48,910
as an accelerator.

215
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,209
But you understand the request, you break it down,

216
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:53,588
you build the right agents as we saw, you could actually

217
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:55,750
build a word agent. You could build a transcription agent.

218
00:07:55,988 --> 00:07:58,269
It takes that information, breaks it down for you.

219
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,778
It leverages the inert tools

220
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:01,970
across AWS

221
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,389
to parse that information, pull the right

222
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:05,129
clips together.

223
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:07,709
So if you're saying I want 20 seconds' worth of

224
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,910
footage of dunks over the last 3

225
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,988
weeks, it pulls the right footage, it pulls

226
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:14,269
the right information, and it starts to assemble

227
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,329
that quickly and efficiently.

228
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:17,600
I call it being

229
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,059
a technical director in a box. It's

230
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,178
not for those big leagues, but if you're

231
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:24,420
in a break or a commentary section, you

232
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,519
can actually push a button,

233
00:08:25,858 --> 00:08:28,178
get your highlights, get your clips, and start working

234
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:28,879
forward from that.

235
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,489
So let's, let's take a break here for a second.

236
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,830
Let me show you the power of this because

237
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:38,168
PowerPoints don't convey the real message of

238
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:38,889
what's happening.

239
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,279
Right, think about here. This is the platform

240
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,320
that we built. It's an accelerator. It's a

241
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,979
tool that you can use as you go forward.

242
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,519
All of this content could be random content

243
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,190
that you've brought into your archive.

244
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:53,769
Right, from skateboarding content to

245
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:55,849
news clipping to footage

246
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,229
and what do you do with this? How do you

247
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:00,489
process this? How do you use this? How do you add context

248
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,928
to what's going forward?

249
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,928
Oh. So what do you see

250
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:06,989
here when we process this content for vod

251
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:09,000
content? You're gonna see a

252
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,379
whole set of information

253
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:12,479
that you're gonna naturally look at.

254
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,000
You're gonna look at the tags and the information on the left-hand

255
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,080
side. Those are great for simply

256
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,500
doing standard searches.

257
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,139
Now if you want to take it to the next level,

258
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,960
we need to take this and leverage and build context.

259
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:26,928
So now using those tags and that level

260
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:27,808
of information.

261
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:30,808
You can see we're starting to put time frames

262
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,168
to the context to the information

263
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:35,219
so now you know when a play happened,

264
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,830
who the play happened with,

265
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:39,349
what was the context around that, and allows

266
00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:41,619
you to start to build complex queries and

267
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:43,989
information so you can start to assemble your

268
00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:45,649
content and and move very effectively.

269
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:47,690
Now we didn't do this in a vacuum.

270
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:50,190
We added a human in the loop so as we

271
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,308
heard earlier, we want to keep training our models

272
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,710
if the information isn't correct by the AI

273
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,090
and the AI that's generated.

274
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,788
You can start to put a human in the loop to start

275
00:09:58,788 --> 00:09:59,950
processing that information,

276
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:02,269
and then the model will continually learn as

277
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,048
they go forward.

278
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:06,678
So

279
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:09,298
what do we have here? Remember I talked about earlier

280
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:10,918
you wanna do a simple search, right?

281
00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:13,619
So you can actually say fumbles. So

282
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:15,259
what this tells you is that in my

283
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:16,710
limited library

284
00:10:17,038 --> 00:10:19,099
what you have is all the fumbles over the

285
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:21,259
last couple of weeks or months or whatever stored

286
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:23,489
in your petabytes or terabytes of

287
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,619
content. This helps you a little bit.

288
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,769
It isolates you,

289
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:29,259
but as a user, you still have to go back and start

290
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:31,700
to figure out where specific things happen

291
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:33,899
in that context of that frame. This could

292
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,899
take you hours. It could take you days. It

293
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:36,918
could take you months.

294
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:39,389
I remember the first question I asked, can I put together

295
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,519
a 22nd clip

296
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,719
of all the dunks?

297
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:44,229
This doesn't allow you to do that.

298
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:45,440
But

299
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:47,969
with the power of putting the agents together and the

300
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:48,879
searches together,

301
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,879
right? Allows

302
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,940
you to start to build.

303
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:57,739
Build together specific moments in time.

304
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:01,259
So I can't type and talk at the same time.

305
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:03,109
Thank you.

306
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:05,330
So what this is actually doing,

307
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:08,029
remember I talked about the agents, the tools and the power.

308
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:10,908
So we're actually going back and looking at that clip library

309
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:13,259
we're building the understanding of the, the architecture

310
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:14,739
to understand what the query is.

311
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,599
We're pulling out the specific terms,

312
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:19,259
so Northwestern or fumble and identifying

313
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:20,298
what you wanna see.

314
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:22,928
We wanna see. A moment in time of when something

315
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:24,710
happened and immediately

316
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,379
in 34 seconds

317
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,009
you see the power of what took 3 or 4 hours

318
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,649
naturally displayed leveraging AWS

319
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,269
leveraging the scale that you have

320
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,649
to instantly give you highlights

321
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:37,769
and clips that allow you to move your business

322
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:38,308
forward.

323
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,849
Think about the power of how that simplicity

324
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:43,109
happened and the agents happen to create

325
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,129
and optimize us.

326
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,710
This could work for an HR system. This could work for

327
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,750
a doctor, for example. Think about a

328
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,928
doctor in a medical facility that has tons of

329
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:52,668
MRIs and information

330
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,308
that they're processing through.

331
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:56,609
Patient comes in with an abnormal

332
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:57,950
cardiac arrhythmia.

333
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:00,379
They can immediately use and leverage the

334
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,908
information, search that, and provide a diagnosis

335
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:04,529
to prevent potentially a heart attack.

336
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:07,330
So you can see the power and the

337
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,928
the ease of use that you have here.

338
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:11,450
And one of the things that we wanted to show by this.

339
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:14,279
As we've lowered the barrier for using AI.

340
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:16,678
We've created the simplicity, we've created the

341
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:18,678
opportunity to start using it and playing

342
00:12:18,678 --> 00:12:21,058
with it. So it's not a fear,

343
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,239
it's a lift to drive your productivity

344
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,009
going forward.

345
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:28,558
Hopefully that makes sense for everybody that's

346
00:12:28,558 --> 00:12:29,229
looking at this.

347
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:31,489
Let's go back to our, our, our

348
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,509
content here where we're looking at this going forward.

349
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,139
Right. So we've talked a little bit about the explosion

350
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:38,418
and information here.

351
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:40,158
If you think about

352
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:42,779
how we put this into action and the monetization as

353
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:43,599
we go forward,

354
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:46,359
right, real world impacts, what we can

355
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:48,590
see now is that once you can do this,

356
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:51,759
you can start to build sponsorship opportunities.

357
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,058
I can go back to a sponsor if you're an

358
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:56,109
NFL team or if you're a basketball team

359
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,250
and you can basically say,

360
00:12:57,538 --> 00:12:59,798
hey, show me where Michael Jordan did his dunks

361
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:00,940
displaying

362
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,320
his, his signature red shoes.

363
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:06,090
I wanna show that or you're creating a brand

364
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,349
awareness moment where something is happening over

365
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:09,330
a period of time.

366
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:12,009
Now you can actually simply easily undo that.

367
00:13:12,298 --> 00:13:14,308
I was, I was with a major brand before I came

368
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:15,009
to Presidio.

369
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:17,450
What took us 39 weeks to actually put together

370
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,750
an entire campaign can take you 17

371
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,869
hours while still maintaining

372
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,489
the level of creativity and the autonomy

373
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:26,769
across those content silos to create these

374
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:28,048
great opportunities

375
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:29,450
and more importantly.

376
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:31,989
You can start to take this and associate this

377
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,629
with your CRM systems to create that magic

378
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:35,288
personalization

379
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:37,788
that everybody wants when you talk about marketing and in

380
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:38,469
retail.

381
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:40,849
So I want to talk about how I want to give

382
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:43,590
somebody a a specific dunk or a

383
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,750
specific layer of content.

384
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:47,168
You can do this now effectively and easily

385
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:49,418
with a simple point and click and do

386
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,928
simple publishing out to Facebook

387
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:54,389
and TikTok and other social media platforms,

388
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:56,548
or even put it directly into the subscriber's

389
00:13:56,548 --> 00:13:58,739
inbox or put a push notification

390
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:00,750
in. It also

391
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,070
allows you to think about coaches on your staff

392
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:05,428
whether you're a coach internally or a coach

393
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,788
at HR or a coach as an adviser

394
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:08,849
at a higher ed institution.

395
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:11,769
You can start to build that pathways to say

396
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,190
how do I understand what a student is doing? Here

397
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,229
are all his class grades. Here's all the

398
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:18,229
pieces that he's going to here are his test scores

399
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:20,109
here are all these despair pieces of information.

400
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:22,609
I'm gonna apply my AI and ML model

401
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,399
to understand which ones are in trouble,

402
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:26,739
which ones classes they need to look forward to,

403
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,519
and how to help them as they go forward.

404
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:30,830
So it's not only just a productivity tool for

405
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,820
sports and agents,

406
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:34,489
but it's a productivity tool across

407
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:35,609
organizations as you go forward.

408
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,649
And I'll, and I'll start to leave you with.

409
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:42,139
What is an accelerator? Cause

410
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,918
everybody that comes up to me talks about, well, Presidio is

411
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,200
developing accelerators. What are you actually doing?

412
00:14:47,969 --> 00:14:50,139
We're making it easier as I talked about

413
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,558
we're lowering the bar we're creating simplicity

414
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,558
we're creating the ability for you to start

415
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:56,639
to pull in information

416
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,779
without having the fear that it goes forward,

417
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
right? We take time, right?

418
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:03,298
So we've built the components, we've built the agents.

419
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
You can start to use that to drive faster time

420
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,158
to value.

421
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:08,639
You can build cost optimization and, and

422
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,500
more importantly,

423
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:12,149
it specifically aligns with what AWS

424
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:13,000
is looking for.

425
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,519
So we've started to introduce a managed service. So

426
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,609
if you have the complexity here and you started looking at,

427
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:20,139
well, I don't know how to deploy this, how do I support this

428
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:20,940
as we go forward,

429
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,359
we're gonna put a managed service in there for you so

430
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,580
that as changes happen, as things are,

431
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:27,798
uh, moving forward, you can

432
00:15:27,798 --> 00:15:30,139
get the new models, you can get the new frameworks.

433
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,359
And you can get the new information.

434
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:34,960
So if this is interesting to you, which it

435
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,700
is to me,

436
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:38,239
Presidio is a leader as we think

437
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,379
about how we think, think about working with our

438
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,168
SI. We're here to help

439
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,658
drive and augment you as you go forward

440
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:47,479
and hopefully you can see the power and the simplicity

441
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,658
we provide to your organization.

442
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,710
So if you have more questions, our booth is over in 12:10.

443
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,200
Come visit us. Come learn more about how we're

444
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,279
using accelerators going forward and how we

445
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,149
can help your business accelerate itself.

446
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,239
Thank you very much.
