1
00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:02,493
- My name is Meena Vembusubramanian,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,280
and I lead product management

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,190
for AWS Transform for Mainframe.

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,110
We are here today to talk about de-risking

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,780
your mainframe exit through refactoring

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,910
by leveraging agentic AI.

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,440
Joining me this afternoon,

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,600
you'll hear directly from Frank Uslaub,

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,470
who is the vice president of
transformation programs at BMW

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,990
and Vimal Brahmbhatt, who's
the senior vice president

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,703
of technology at Fiserv.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,600
We'll start the day
today with some context

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,820
that if you found your
way here this afternoon

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,070
might be a little bit familiar to you

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,060
on the challenges associated
with mainframe modernization.

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,510
We'll talk about AWS Transform's
agentic AI capabilities

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,850
with that context in mind.

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,860
Next, we'll get to the
really interesting stuff

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,447
and hear directly from Frank

20
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:56,447
and Vimal on their organizations'
transformation journeys.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,260
We'll end our conversation today

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,880
with the key success patterns

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,100
that we're seeing from
both customers here today,

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,900
as well as across the board

25
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,093
on the refactor pattern and beyond.

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Standing here towards
the end of 2025 today,

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,070
there are still over 220 billion lines

28
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,200
of COBOL in production,

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,270
and these lines of COBOL actually power

30
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,840
70% of critical enterprise applications.

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,380
We're hearing from customers
constantly that their teams

32
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,710
that operate these
applications are restricted

33
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,330
from their ability to be agile

34
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,610
and really adapt these applications

35
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,380
to the changing business requirements

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,450
as quickly as they would like to do.

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,960
And when they do address
the transformation process,

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,300
what they find is that they're encumbered

39
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,800
by multi-year efforts

40
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,920
and a lot of risk in terms of
validating these applications

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,570
and getting them across the line.

42
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,220
These teams well understand the benefits

43
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,830
associated with modernization.

44
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,110
They know that they'll
see better costs often,

45
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,750
particularly as their applications scale.

46
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,180
They'll have access to modern

47
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,170
as well as open source
technologies to innovate quickly.

48
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,990
They also know that the
talent conversation becomes

49
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,660
a little bit easier and
they have more flexibility

50
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,060
as they start looking at a variety

51
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,983
of different stacks moving forward.

52
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,340
And with this combined,
they're able to keep up

53
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,510
with the business changes

54
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,063
and innovate quickly with
their technology stack.

55
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,980
However, despite all of these
benefits teams often find

56
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,830
that the balance is
outweighed by the risks

57
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,323
associated with the modernization process.

58
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,980
Modernization requires
investing in not just

59
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,130
the transformation process and validation,

60
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,020
but in parallel, continuing to invest

61
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,370
in the day-to-day operations

62
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,800
of running your existing workloads.

63
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,950
Teams know that there is a lot
of risk given the criticality

64
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,800
of the business applications
we're talking about here.

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,450
In doing that validation

66
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,050
and switching over to that
modernized application.

67
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,160
And this process requires
a unique skillset,

68
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,960
you're looking for individuals

69
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,180
that understand the legacy application,

70
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,430
understand what the
architecture should look like

71
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,990
in the modernized world,

72
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,710
as well as people at that
intersection who understand both

73
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,353
and can really drive
that migration process.

74
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,720
My background personally before AWS

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,530
is in robotics and automation
in the context of factories

76
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,840
and Amazon's fulfillment centers.

77
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,630
The thing I loved in that
context was that ability

78
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,300
to leverage robots for what they do best,

79
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,140
high precision tasks, lifting heavy loads

80
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,210
and highly repetitive tasks.

81
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,910
While combining humans into that process

82
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,270
to do what human beings do
best, the high judgment tasks

83
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,700
and the tasks that require fine dexterity

84
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,580
and judgment at every step along the way.

85
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,340
So in the factory context,
you might have a robot

86
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,920
that is able to maneuver a heavy car door,

87
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,260
but you bring the human being in

88
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,980
in order to install a minute wiring panel

89
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,950
so that your end product
is at a high quality

90
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,410
and the process end to end is efficient.

91
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,770
The thing that's been resonating
with me in the past year

92
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,920
is this ability with agentic AI

93
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,760
to combine different approaches
fluidly in one workflow.

94
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,470
So what we're able to do now,

95
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,010
which is starting to change
the game, is leverage agents

96
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,380
that have deterministic processes

97
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,860
for specific tasks like
extracting dependencies

98
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,860
from source code or doing
like for like transformation

99
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,060
of code from COBOL to Java

100
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,190
in order to achieve
functional equivalents.

101
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,550
We can combine those with LLM-based agents

102
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,800
for understanding the source code

103
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,050
and producing natural
language documentation

104
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,910
for teams to move forward with.

105
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,270
All of this can happen
fluidly in one workflow,

106
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,800
bringing in humans in the loop

107
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,290
to make the high judgment decisions.

108
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,900
Things like figuring out
how to draw the lines

109
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,880
between different business domains

110
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,900
to decompose your monolith
into distinct applications

111
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,370
that you wanna move forward with

112
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,963
in your modernization journey.

113
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,320
With this, we're starting to see

114
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,110
the balance shift over the past year.

115
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,990
Connecting the ability to
understand legacy systems

116
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,410
to understand the business
logic associated with them,

117
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,210
communicate that in natural language

118
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,290
to both your business users as
well as your technical users

119
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,560
now really reduces the time
that teams have had to spend

120
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,600
in this understand phase of figuring out

121
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,240
what that application does to begin with.

122
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,250
This also really helps the experts

123
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,200
that are working on this get a lot further

124
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,500
and be a lot more effective
in the amount of code

125
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,150
and the number of
applications they're able

126
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,970
to process in the same amount of time.

127
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,610
Enabling agents to
interact with each other

128
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,980
and constantly learn and improve

129
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,852
and iterate on the process

130
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:57,690
through a understand, transform, test loop

131
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,960
that then again iterates on the process,

132
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,660
is helping us get a lot more efficient

133
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,880
and reduce the risk associated

134
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,860
with the output and the
risk that's handed over

135
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,810
to that final validation team

136
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,020
before you approach the cut-over process.

137
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,350
In combination, this AI first
approach has really helped us

138
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,830
transform modernization into
something that is trackable

139
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,943
for many more teams across organizations.

140
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,630
I wanna tell you a little bit today about

141
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,901
what we've been investing
in with AWS Transform.

142
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:33,630
AWS Transform for mainframe,

143
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,900
our hypothesis here is to
bring this hybrid approach

144
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,760
that leverages the right technology

145
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,301
for every step along the way.

146
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,230
With that in mind, we're gonna automate

147
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,600
the entire transformation process

148
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,470
from initial analysis and
planning through that refactoring

149
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,420
and that heavily intensive testing

150
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,520
and validation phase as well.

151
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,580
Our goal here really is to
bring those multi-year efforts

152
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,500
down to the order of months,

153
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,200
and that's what you'll hear
from Vimal and Frank about today

154
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,150
in terms of how that's
translating in their organizations

155
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,430
and in addition to this

156
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,640
like for like functionally
equivalent refactoring

157
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,680
that we'll hear from these teams on,

158
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,680
we're bringing LLMs into the
picture to improve the quality

159
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,880
of that refactored code
that forward looking teams

160
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,830
are going to be managing.

161
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,590
We do this by leveraging
a multi-agent process

162
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,070
to what we're calling
reforged refactored code,

163
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,390
to make it more readable

164
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,240
and more easy to maintain for your teams

165
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,943
that will be operating these
modernized applications.

166
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,930
Let me tell you a little bit about

167
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,540
what the AWS Transform journey looks like.

168
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,330
At a high level, there's three phases.

169
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,950
At the first phase, you're really looking

170
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,040
to understand the legacy application.

171
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,590
This begins with code analysis

172
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,590
to get a static view of the system.

173
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,910
Next, we recently introduced
an activity analysis agent,

174
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,270
which looks at the SMF
records in an organization

175
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,490
to get a dynamic view of the system

176
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,410
to understand things like the frequency

177
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,920
at which applications are
run, what the CPU utilization

178
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,800
for applications looks like, and so on.

179
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,965
Our goal here with this activity
analysis is to give teams

180
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:21,270
the information they need
to prioritize workloads

181
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,030
as well as to make architecture decisions.

182
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,540
For example, if you have a
medium frequency application

183
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,970
that's very short-lived process,

184
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,760
that's very short-lived, that
might be an ideal candidate

185
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,030
for an event driven
architecture moving forward.

186
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,510
The final part of analysis
involves data analysis

187
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,730
where we look at, for every data source

188
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,380
in your legacy system,

189
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,080
we look at what the
interdependencies look like

190
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,480
and we look at what
different programs might act

191
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,490
on the same data sources.

192
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,560
In addition, we provide a data dictionary

193
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,560
that helps you at a field level understand

194
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,063
what each data type is
and what the function

195
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:01,983
of each data source and fields looks like.

196
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,560
Next, we take all of this

197
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,030
and leverage our AI-based
agents to extract business logic

198
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,050
as well as technical documentation
based on the user persona

199
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,840
that's working on the
project on your team.

200
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,390
All of this information together goes into

201
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,390
an automated decomposition process

202
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,420
that your teams can bring
their own business context

203
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,200
and input into to help
decompose into distinct domains

204
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,510
and create a migration plan.

205
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,640
Following this understand phase,

206
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,224
we get into the transformation journey.

207
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:39,090
AWS Transform supports multiple
patterns for transformation.

208
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,150
Some teams might have time constraints

209
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,550
or particular data center exit timelines

210
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,620
and are looking to move very quickly.

211
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,440
They might choose to
re-platform workloads.

212
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,330
Next, what we're gonna hear about today

213
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,090
and spend more time on is
the refactoring process

214
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:54,930
where teams are working

215
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,330
on highly business critical workloads

216
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,820
and have a very keen need

217
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,700
for functional equivalence of
that modernized application

218
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,070
as compared to the legacy system.

219
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,730
This refactor process is
augmented by a reforge capability

220
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,920
that I'll talk about in more detail.

221
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,820
Finally, we also support
reimagining applications

222
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,060
where your starting point is
that business rules extraction,

223
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,680
which can go into a spectrum
forward engineering process,

224
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,513
leveraging smart IDs like Hero.

225
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,960
The last leg of the journey is
often the leg of the journey

226
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,660
that teams see the most
risk and most effort

227
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,840
and cost go into, which is in
that testing and validation

228
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,710
before you're finally able
to deploy into your cloud

229
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,570
or final destination.

230
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,060
Here for testing, we've
introduced a few capabilities

231
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,400
this year that we're
gonna continue to add to.

232
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,840
The first thing we've introduced

233
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,123
is automatic test plan generation,

234
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:53,511
which early in the process
lets you get an understanding

235
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:57,210
for every given application
what that testing scope

236
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,303
and what the effort
associated with it might be.

237
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,280
I wanna talk about a
couple of the capabilities

238
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,280
that Vimal and Frank's teams
have been using extensively

239
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,610
to provide the context

240
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,520
before you see the results
from these organizations.

241
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,113
The first piece of it is
this reforge functionality.

242
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:21,570
After code is refactored,
we run it through

243
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,210
a multi-agent process called reforge.

244
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,870
Much like melting metal and
reforging it makes it stronger

245
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,580
and improves its properties,

246
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,930
our goal here is to analyze
that refactored code

247
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,780
to identify any COBOL
semantics and structure

248
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,930
that have been carried forward.

249
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,800
We then improve on this
code using LLM-based agents

250
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,800
to restructure it into more
native feeling Java classes,

251
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,120
improve on things like variable names

252
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,850
that might in the past
have COBOL semantics

253
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,360
to reflect more business context terms

254
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,280
for these variable names.

255
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,120
The end result is code that
looks much more intuitive

256
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,390
and much more familiar
to a Java developer.

257
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,090
They're able to read the
code and make connections

258
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,490
to what the business logic being executed

259
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,070
by that code actually looks like.

260
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,250
The other thing we added
recently is functional testing

261
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,060
within this loop of reforging code.

262
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,010
So our goal there is to ensure

263
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,960
that when you have reforged code,

264
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,530
we're not introducing any
additional functionality changes

265
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,030
that might encumber your path

266
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,030
to getting to that functional
equivalence proof point

267
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,580
and finally getting your
application in production.

268
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,320
The next piece of what we introduced is

269
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,560
around accelerating
functional testing itself.

270
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,320
We talked about that test
plan generation upfront,

271
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,410
which helps teams very early
in the process understand

272
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,830
what the costs associated
with testing might be

273
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,670
and helps them also make
prioritization decisions

274
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,460
based on how many test cases

275
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,770
and how detailed these
test cases associated

276
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,920
with specific applications
might look like.

277
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,530
The other two pieces we
introduced today are scripts

278
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,830
that help accelerate specific
steps in the process.

279
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,200
The first one addresses something

280
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,880
that we know takes teams a lot of time,

281
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,000
which is gathering the test
data from the mainframe.

282
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
When you have a test plan that
was automatically generated,

283
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,600
we also help you create
test data capture scripts

284
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,550
that correspond to this test plan.

285
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,650
So what that looks like is JCL scripts

286
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,120
that you can run on your mainframe

287
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,660
to capture the very specific
form of test data that you need

288
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,780
to correspond to the test
cases you've identified.

289
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,230
Finally, we also provide
fully automated test scripts

290
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,080
to execute these tests on the mainframe

291
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,003
and on your modernized environment.

292
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,020
Today so far we've talked
about the discovery process

293
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,780
and the acceleration we're bringing there

294
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,600
to extract the broadest set of insights

295
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,210
in the deepest manner possible.

296
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,950
Next, we talked about reforge,

297
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,530
which is our capability

298
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,490
to combine the deterministic
refactor process

299
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,780
with LLM-based agents in order
to produce more readable,

300
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,210
highly maintainable Java code.

301
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,910
Finally, we also talked about

302
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,790
our test acceleration
capabilities that we've seen

303
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,550
real results from our customers thus far,

304
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,400
and it's something we'll
continue to invest in.

305
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,620
Now let's hear about
some real world examples

306
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,170
on how these features are
being used in the context

307
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,000
of real organizations.

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm gonna call up Vimal to come
tell us the story at Fiserv.

309
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,373
- Thank you Meena.

310
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,260
Good afternoon everyone.
Thanks for joining us.

311
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,320
Before I start, let me ask a quick poll.

312
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,500
Raise your hand if you
have finished 10,000 steps

313
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,330
to make it to this conference.

314
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,563
Awesome. Love it.

315
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,821
If you can navigate these

316
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:02,190
re:Invent sessions, I guess we can get

317
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,510
through the modernization
of mainframe. (chuckles)

318
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,910
Quick introduction, Vimal
Brahmbhatt, I work for Fiserv.

319
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,140
How many of my colleagues here

320
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,300
who are from financial institutions?

321
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,920
If you don't mind. Awesome, awesome.

322
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,020
So this will be more relatable to you all.

323
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,750
I'm joined by my colleague Amir Mahmoud,

324
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,010
then AWS and HCL here in this room.

325
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,910
Amir is running this
modernization for all of us.

326
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,673
So let's get into the detail right away.

327
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,850
Let me talk about Fiserv,
what we are, who we are.

328
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,560
I'm sure some of you have
heard about this company.

329
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,210
Maybe some of you may not know.

330
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,880
So let's talk about who we are.

331
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,693
So Fiserv is a financial
payments processing organization.

332
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,210
Unbeknownst to some of you
we process pretty much,

333
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,900
in the US, third of the
economy in United States.

334
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,160
We are also a global company.

335
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,800
We have APEC AMEA presence

336
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,410
where we help out our customers.

337
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,480
Let me draw your attention
to some of these numbers.

338
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,240
We support 6 million plus merchants

339
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,190
and when I talk about
merchants, think about them

340
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,880
as like starting from
Amazons all the way up

341
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,590
to the mom and pop shop at the corner

342
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,640
and anything in between.

343
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,970
We support about 1.6 billion issued cards.

344
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,430
This is through our
partnership with the banks.

345
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,790
We also have 10,000 banking institutions

346
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,760
who uses our software to
run their banking course.

347
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,470
And at our peak we process close to

348
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,500
about 25,000 transaction per second.

349
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,930
And I want you all to pause for a moment

350
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,893
and think about the scale
I just talked about.

351
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,120
At this scale, transforming
mainframe into AWS

352
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,370
or any cloud processing
is not a small feat.

353
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,800
It's complicated and I'm
sure all of you are here

354
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,050
because somewhere you have
mainframe in your world

355
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,400
and you understand the complexity.

356
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,950
I have coded on some of
these platforms myself

357
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,780
many years back, so I have utmost respect

358
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,520
and understanding for this.

359
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,100
But those of you who do not know about

360
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,080
what I'm talking about from
the number perspective,

361
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,263
let's talk about the what it
means in our day-to-day life.

362
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,770
So here I have, these are
just illustrative examples.

363
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,800
Of course, we all have
been here at AWS re:Invent

364
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,580
for 3, 4 days so this does not
depict our re:Invent journey,

365
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,360
but whenever you go
back, this kind of shows

366
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,370
our journey of everyday life.

367
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:30,060
You get up, you are on your phone,

368
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,320
you need to buy something,

369
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,960
you make a purchase at online retailer

370
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,370
and then you're ready to go to office.

371
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,480
We are five days in office,

372
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,280
so I have to go to office every day.

373
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,210
You get your coffee on the
way, you get your car charged

374
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,220
or you get your gas, you make a payment

375
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,650
through either your mobile
phone, tap your card,

376
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,500
insert your card, whatever
it is, and then after that,

377
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,240
you are in the office.

378
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,460
So that subscription pops up

379
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,770
that I have to pay for my subscription.

380
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,280
You pay in a purchase,
then the lunchtime comes.

381
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,100
You order your food, gets delivered.

382
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,960
Of course your kids
wanted the new PS5 or 6.

383
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,400
You order that.

384
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,957
Before you go home, spouse calls you that,

385
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,500
"Hey, get some groceries
from the grocery store."

386
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,810
So you order ahead or you
go to the grocery store

387
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,750
and get your grocery.

388
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,390
You reach home, now you're
so tired you decided

389
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,150
that I want to treat
family with a good dinner.

390
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,580
So you take them out,
you go to the restaurant,

391
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,720
there's the clover device,

392
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,190
the white box which is shown there.

393
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,180
We also have point of
sale solution which we...

394
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,037
A lot of businesses, if
you are at a coffee shop,

395
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:38,820
one of the famous coffee shop which was

396
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,550
on the previous slide,
they use this device.

397
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,260
So you would know what I'm talking about.

398
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,260
In general, I'm just
explaining what we all do

399
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,900
every single day in our
life and that happens

400
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,683
about 350 to 400 million
times every single day.

401
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,320
350 to 400 and during the peak season

402
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,600
we just are in the peak season as we call

403
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,100
in financial industry.

404
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,220
We have Black Friday. We
have day before Thanksgiving.

405
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,510
We have Cyber Monday.

406
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,810
These are the days where we considered it

407
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,460
as a peak season for all of us.

408
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,220
So I hope this kind of gets the idea about

409
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,470
what I'm talking about
payments processing.

410
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,020
With that as a context, let's talk about

411
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,503
how we got here in our
journey with Amazon.

412
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,277
So as a company we
decided to kind of pivot,

413
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:28,680
and we said that well
we want to be on cloud.

414
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,620
And we partnered with Amazon
AWS a couple of years back.

415
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,950
We started thinking about,
how do we net new build outs?

416
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,630
We will do all on cloud.

417
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,415
There are certain application
we'll start migrating

418
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:41,190
onto the cloud, and there are some

419
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,890
which are kind of lift and shift as well.

420
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,174
So we have done all of
this, flavors of this.

421
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:47,940
So think about this,

422
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,760
we have a lot of applications
running in AWS as we speak.

423
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,030
A lot of them are net new,
a lot of them are migration.

424
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,850
And this last couple of years journey

425
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,010
has given us an opportunity

426
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,650
to now think about doing this at scale,

427
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,800
which is, as I explained,
unparalleled to anything.

428
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,410
I used to work for another
bank before I joined here

429
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,880
and some of these big institutions

430
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,280
have huge mainframe presence

431
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,183
and a lot of big workload
processes on mainframe.

432
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:17,880
And the kind of people does the innovation

433
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,520
around the mainframe,
but not on the mainframe.

434
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,770
So what you will do, you
will take your DB2 data,

435
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,900
resend it, replicate it somewhere

436
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,240
and build the services off of that.

437
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,700
But nobody really touches the mainframe

438
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,290
because it's hard, it's complicated there.

439
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,880
A lot of institutional knowledge is there.

440
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,100
We don't have people who understand this.

441
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,630
So that's the journey.

442
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,770
So now let's talk about

443
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,070
what particular application
we are transforming here

444
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,410
called HDC, host data capture.

445
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,570
I explained how payment works,

446
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,360
but let me draw your
attention to whenever you use

447
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,820
your credit card debit card, in-app tap,

448
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,080
these are like a four pillars

449
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,170
of how transaction flows through.

450
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,290
So all of us who are customers
here in the first box,

451
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,430
you initiate your payments
either for purchasing online

452
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,563
or card present, which is the in store.

453
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,020
Then of course, wherever you are,

454
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,060
whichever entity you are
buying your stuff from,

455
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,770
that's called merchant.

456
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,190
Then acquirer is where
we are focused today.

457
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,290
Fiserv plays actually in
acquiring network and issuing,

458
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,200
but we are focused on
acquirer code switching

459
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,340
and pre-settlement processing.

460
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,560
Then comes the Visa, MasterCard, Amex,

461
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,300
Discover, StarX, (indistinct).

462
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,430
These are all the credit debit networks

463
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,100
and at the end, the card
you have in your pocket,

464
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,400
if it's a JP Morgan Chase issued card,

465
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,840
Bank of America issued card,

466
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,510
Goldman Apple issued card,

467
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,690
that's where the final decision happens.

468
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,420
So in this entity we are
focused on the middle box

469
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,220
where it says pre-settlement processing.

470
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,680
So think about this, when
you buy something online

471
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,240
and you go to your bank,

472
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,880
it shows that you have
a pending transaction.

473
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,530
You would've noticed
that on your mobile app

474
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,770
or your statement which
says pending transaction.

475
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,930
And the next time when you look
at it that pending goes away

476
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,310
and it shows up on your statement

477
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,647
that this is the card.

478
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:03,030
We are talking about that journey only...

479
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,960
We are not even,

480
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,670
just a small journey between pending

481
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,050
and how it gets cleared.

482
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,420
So that's the focus here we have today.

483
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,310
So let's look at the application
itself, what it does.

484
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,010
The application name,
we are host data capture

485
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,020
as name might suggest that this is

486
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,450
a pre-settlement processing application.

487
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,530
It powers the ingestion

488
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,713
and the pre-settlement
processing for high volume data.

489
00:22:28,982 --> 00:22:31,290
This application runs 24 by seven.

490
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,670
So let me also give you a perspective.

491
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,410
When you buy something online

492
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,943
before your order ships,

493
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,840
a merchant needs to get paid

494
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,940
before they will ship your order.

495
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,270
So when you make the purchase,

496
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,010
there is an offline
processing which happens

497
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,807
where your order came in and now we have

498
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:50,310
the merchant is asking for money.

499
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:53,640
So we have to match and
flag your original purchase

500
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,830
with the merchant asking
for money, flag them

501
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,170
and make sure that it is all reconciled.

502
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:02,670
So that's what the reconciliation
mean here, 24 by seven.

503
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,690
Just to give you an idea,

504
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,030
the numbers you see on
the right hand side,

505
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,550
this application is
responsible for processing

506
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,520
close to 10 billion plus dollar

507
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,593
payment processing every single day.

508
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,983
B with capital letter B, $10 billion.

509
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,380
Between 150 to 200 million
transaction every day,

510
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,990
goes without saying it's 24 by seven.

511
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,760
So this is the scale of the application

512
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,960
we are talking about,

513
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,440
where we have embarked the
journey of modernization.

514
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,110
Given those stakes, we
also have to appreciate

515
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,870
and understand where it's running today.

516
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,740
So it is running on
mainframe, 20, 30 years

517
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,720
of hardened mainframe,
millions of lines of COBOL code

518
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:47,670
and I'm sure some of you
are actually developing

519
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,630
on mainframe today.

520
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,610
So you appreciate and understand.

521
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,960
Guess what these applications
have done for us.

522
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,680
Non-functional requirements,

523
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,230
response time is utmost critical for us

524
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,080
because those merchants
want to get paid on time.

525
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,960
There is no delay we can tolerate there.

526
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,570
The capacity and the
availability of these platforms.

527
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,120
This platform has served us really well.

528
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,880
So before we really migrate away from this

529
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,475
and go on to the cloud
journey, our standards,

530
00:24:15,475 --> 00:24:18,030
the table stakes are we need to make sure

531
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,430
that at a minimum this
functionality remains as it is

532
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,880
and we do not break anything.

533
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,420
The reason for....

534
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,890
So there's an interesting,

535
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,900
I've been in an industry
where there are a lot

536
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,750
of mainframe application and
there are a lot of new builds

537
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,990
and the culture friction between

538
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,460
those who are building new

539
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,770
versus those who are on this
mainframe type application.

540
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,530
It's very stark difference, right?

541
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,390
Because everyone is a
developer, everyone thinks

542
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,090
that I'm the best and I
know what I'm talking about.

543
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,070
Where we are missing out,
in a leadership position,

544
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,700
I personally feel like if
we do not really innovate

545
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,740
and if we do not transform,
we are going to miss out

546
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,190
on this whole agentic AI,
what AI has to promise.

547
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,160
And this is the critical aspect

548
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,950
of why we are embarking on this journey.

549
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,250
Quality has to remain as well.

550
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,900
So the conventional path helps,

551
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,770
but at this scale it really
creates the bottlenecks.

552
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,760
So what we did was, as
Meena actually describes,

553
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,870
I won't go in a lot of details,

554
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,840
but we started working with AWS about

555
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,410
seven or eight months back
where AWS has this product.

556
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,900
Now it's called refactor.

557
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,470
We called it Blu Age to
convert your COBOL code

558
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,490
into Java code and one of my goals is

559
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,170
to make sure that I have those

560
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,930
who are on a a COBOL
mainframe application,

561
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,850
I want to make sure
that I keep them around.

562
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,980
I keep them interested
in what we are doing.

563
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,240
I also want their expertise

564
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,820
because a lot of that
knowledge is in their head.

565
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,907
So what we did was we said,

566
00:25:45,907 --> 00:25:48,510
"Okay, we are going to
convert COBOL into Java,"

567
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,030
which kind of looks and feels like COBOL

568
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,570
for divisions identification,
procedure, data, whatnot.

569
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,840
So when you read Java code they
understand what it's doing.

570
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,030
Soon we realized that once we do that,

571
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,800
we would have to spend
another 12 plus months

572
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,140
to really make it modern application.

573
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,920
The API-based application
event driven architecture

574
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,390
framework-based Java code,
this is where Meena and team

575
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,247
actually came to us and said that,

576
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:15,750
"Well, we have this product
before it becomes GA,

577
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,700
we would like you to see
if you are interested

578
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,410
in trying this, which is called refactor.

579
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,990
Which is the one of the agentic AI process

580
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,690
where it takes the refactored Java code

581
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,500
and then it builds the
modern Java application

582
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,020
by using this AI.

583
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,360
And because we were
embarking on this journey,

584
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,920
we decided that, we believe that,

585
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,880
I think this is the right step.

586
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,880
We decided to use reforge
to really change it from

587
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,893
COBOL looking like Java to real Java.

588
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,770
So we combined those two steps

589
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,510
and this is where again I think Meena

590
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,920
covered a lot of these things.

591
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,800
Our original journey would've
been about 30 months.

592
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,460
So we took this back, we
said, "Okay, well let's decide

593
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,720
how we want to do this."

594
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,880
Amir and team actually got together.

595
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,860
We said we will take a
piece of application.

596
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,420
Of course there are multiple modules,

597
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,300
many, many lines of code.

598
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,500
So we took one piece of application.

599
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,530
We took that refactored code,
ran it through the reforge.

600
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,950
We basically made sure that
current team also understands

601
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,920
and automation, the testing
piece, the automation piece,

602
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,410
continue to make sure that
we can test the functionality

603
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:24,210
and not drift from the functionality.

604
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,340
So all the results look so promising

605
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,290
so far we are in about two or three months

606
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,725
of the journey here,

607
00:27:29,725 --> 00:27:34,110
but we feel confident that
this 30 plus month journey

608
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,020
we might be able to finish
it in about 18 months.

609
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,670
And we are three or four months into this.

610
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,160
So we are quarter of way there,

611
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,770
some ways to go but we
are very, very excited

612
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,090
about this journey.

613
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,040
So before I show you, and I think...

614
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,110
Did you show the code? No,
you didn't show the code.

615
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,250
So before I show you the code,

616
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,230
how it looks like it's maybe on our chart,

617
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:57,150
let's talk about a little
bit of a tech portion of it.

618
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,142
All of you know that we
have COBOL, VSAM, DB2,

619
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:02,730
Flatfile, (indistinct) database.

620
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,310
We are converting that
into Springboard CICS.

621
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,850
If your online application
goes into the Apache Tomcat,

622
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,800
JCL gets into Groovy.

623
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,360
Again, I think our principle was

624
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,370
business logic must be preserved,

625
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,230
functional equivalence guaranteed.

626
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:20,940
So that is like table stakes.
We cannot change what it does.

627
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,010
We cannot change from 10 billion

628
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,630
to 8 billion processing every night.

629
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,890
We have to keep up 10 billion

630
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,260
and make sure that we can
process 20 billion tomorrow

631
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,900
after this application is migrated.

632
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,404
And of course leverage AWS's services

633
00:28:34,404 --> 00:28:36,963
once we are on the
other side of the fence.

634
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,730
Hope to remove the legacy
tech dependencies there.

635
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,400
Another thing, so we have
some operational users

636
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,620
who uses the output of these applications

637
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,670
to do the charge back to
reconcile some of the data.

638
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,080
So they have screens and they have

639
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,120
standard operating procedures.

640
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,980
We don't want to change that.

641
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,140
We don't want to retrain
the entire organization

642
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,610
just because we are modernizing our app.

643
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,550
So that's another aspect
that we are keeping up

644
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,470
with this transformation.

645
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,060
So let's look at the code quickly.

646
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,640
I know our chart may not be as visible,

647
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,430
but what I'll say is on the left hand side

648
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,020
is what you see, the refactored code.

649
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,350
This is using the Blu Age.
This is where we started.

650
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,720
And if I show you the whole code,

651
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,640
it basically feels like
COBOL returned in Java.

652
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,650
It was good when when
we started the journey,

653
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,300
we did not have reforge at that time.

654
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,593
So reforge is there now.

655
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,690
Now the right hand side of
the code is the reforged code

656
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,520
and the beauty of the reforged code is

657
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,940
that if you're a Java developer
who has never coded in COBOL

658
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,130
and start writing the code here,

659
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,900
they would kind of
understand the right side

660
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,830
of the code much better

661
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,080
because I think it does a tremendous job

662
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,450
of building the modern Java

663
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,550
with the variable names are meaningful,

664
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,980
unless on the left side
you really need to know

665
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,540
what you're looking at.

666
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:59,540
So idioms are there, the data
classes are there as well.

667
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,560
So this is what it looks like

668
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,980
and I think we really want to go

669
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,440
to the reforge code because here's one

670
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,940
of the other challenge we
have is talent challenge.

671
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,090
I'm not getting any college
grad, coming out of college

672
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,733
to come and code on a
mainframe application.

673
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,830
I hope that's the same challenge

674
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,540
all of you're facing as well.

675
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,290
So we have to spend time on
training them, less interest,

676
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,650
but if I get a college grad
to come and work on the code

677
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,250
which is on the right hand side,

678
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,670
they all are familiar with it.

679
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,220
This is what schools
are teaching them today.

680
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,290
So I think there are a lot of benefits

681
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,233
of refactoring this whole code.

682
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:46,530
With that, so I'll
conclude the presentation.

683
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,690
Our expectations when we are done

684
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,900
with this whole transformation, as I said,

685
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,730
our expectation is that
we want to continue

686
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,340
to do 10 billion while our
goal is to do 20 billion

687
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,740
because now I can put in multi regions,

688
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,250
I can now spin up all the
lambdas whenever I need.

689
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,270
I don't have to rely on MIPS utilization.

690
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,960
So continue to make sure that
there are zero disruption,

691
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,290
tech stack, tech stack
will be modern tech stack.

692
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,990
Now we can leverage all the
services, all the tooling.

693
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,900
We can also be innovative in using the AI

694
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,150
as well in payments
processing, which by the way

695
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,210
payment processing, there are
some use cases for AI in fraud

696
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,120
and risk, not in actual
payment transaction processing.

697
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,800
We are, I think we are looking at

698
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,600
some of those as well here.

699
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,390
Modern developer
experience, you can use IDE

700
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,210
for example versus you
have to code on VX code

701
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,250
on the mainframe.

702
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:42,600
So a lot of good uplift as
part of the transformation.

703
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,690
Of course number of months
we will be looking to,

704
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,010
because we are using reforge

705
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,460
and again I think I cannot
thank enough to Meena

706
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,770
and team about introducing
this reforge to us

707
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:57,770
that cuts down our journey by
almost like 12 plus months.

708
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,480
And when it's all said
and done had we stayed

709
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,080
with the refactored code
versus going to Reforge,

710
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,460
Reforge is going to uplift
our maintainability by 40%,

711
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,810
which is another huge thing, right?

712
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,480
So we had choice of either
staying with refactor

713
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,460
or go to Reforge code, 40%
is a huge humongous uplift.

714
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,840
So that's where we are, I'm
sure no transformation is easy.

715
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,640
I've done a lot of this in my career,

716
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,650
of course not at this scale.

717
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,060
I've worked on this platforms

718
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,290
but this is the first time we are

719
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,760
embarking this journey.

720
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,160
So I don't expect this to be flawless.

721
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,260
There will be bumps,
there'll be challenges,

722
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,000
we will have a lot of lessons learned.

723
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,300
We'll continue to share that
with our partners as well.

724
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,630
So in short, I think we had a car,

725
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,880
we changed everything around that car.

726
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,520
Now we are changing the
engine while car is running

727
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,310
and making sure that
nobody spills their coffee

728
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,770
at the checkout while car is running.

729
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,100
Speaking of car, I have
Frank here who is going

730
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,210
to talk about journey for a
car manufacturing company BMW.

731
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,749
So I'll hand it over to
Frank. Thanks everyone.

732
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:05,749
(audience applauds)

733
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,500
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

734
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,160
Quite impressive number
we've seen from Fiserv.

735
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,520
So now let's jump from
finance to automotive.

736
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,460
So first of all I would
like to introduce myself.

737
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,460
So I'm Frank Uslaub, leading
our BMW group IT's cloud

738
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,790
and modernization journey.

739
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,590
So before I jump to our
challenges on the mainframe,

740
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,420
I would like to give you some insights

741
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:37,500
into what makes us focus on these topics.

742
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,030
And I would like to start

743
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,330
with some insights from
a product perspective.

744
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,793
So I think most of you know
BMW and our fantastic products,

745
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,240
but now with our NEUE KLASSE
we are not just taking

746
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:55,683
a step ahead, we are
entering a new dimension.

747
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,380
The new design is clean,
modern and instantly BMW.

748
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,380
The fully electric performance
enables up to 400 miles range

749
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,390
and inside the panoramic iDrive

750
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:13,210
and the completely new
electronic architecture

751
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,250
creates a smart and more
intuitive digital experience

752
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,700
and with around 30% less lifecycle CO2

753
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,060
and a higher share of secondary materials,

754
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,610
the NEUE KLASSE also sets new benchmarks

755
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,583
on sustainability and circularity.

756
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,690
As a first model of ENEUE
KLASSE, the BMW iX3,

757
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,220
it showcases the innovations

758
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,420
that will shape the entire BMW
lineup, marking the beginning

759
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:50,420
of a new era that will
expand to 40 models by 2027.

760
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,060
So if you look at that
change on the product side,

761
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,533
it's quite clear that

762
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:01,503
that also means a massive
change on the IT side.

763
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,790
That new era on the
product side is enabled

764
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,390
by further digitalization of
our end-to-end value chain.

765
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,680
So we integrate AI into our core processes

766
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,010
on the engineering side,
on the production side,

767
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,683
on the sales side and
on financial services.

768
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,840
That's based on a cloud first strategy

769
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,020
where we have built new
applications in the cloud

770
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,370
and modernized and migrated
our existing applications

771
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,813
to move them into the cloud.

772
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,180
We started transformation
program in order to do it

773
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,160
and we tried to be as fast
as efficient as possible.

774
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,030
And in order to do that, we
copied a lot of approaches

775
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,310
which we have from our factories

776
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,610
and started actually a
transformation factory.

777
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,210
And our clear ambition
is to use automation

778
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,573
and especially AI as an accelerator.

779
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,260
So we have been pretty successful so far.

780
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,430
So the majority of our
applications is running already

781
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:16,144
in the cloud and we also
modernized our SAP landscape

782
00:36:16,144 --> 00:36:17,830
and put it into the cloud

783
00:36:19,189 --> 00:36:23,280
and we have more than 600
productive AI use cases

784
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,473
running on a daily basis.

785
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,250
But in addition to our
modern IT landscape,

786
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,500
we also have some legacy applications.

787
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,490
So typically in areas where
there was no process change

788
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,360
in the last couple of years,
so there was no need to update

789
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,920
or to migrate these applications.

790
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,393
So we just keep them stable.

791
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:47,340
But now basically, if you want to optimize

792
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,140
your end-to-end processes

793
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,960
and you want to embed AI at some stage,

794
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,130
you also touch these legacy systems

795
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,420
and that's where the challenge comes up,

796
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,780
and it's really difficult
to keep the process

797
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,220
and IT knowledge

798
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,130
for these legacy applications
if things have not been

799
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,500
changed in the last couple of years.

800
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,200
So that's why we made the clear decision

801
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,290
to modernize our application landscape

802
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,573
and to migrate away from our mainframe.

803
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:22,290
What is quite important for us is that

804
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,290
with a topic we also want to
master one of the challenges

805
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,880
we see on the talent side.

806
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,050
Yeah, so it's not so easy for us,

807
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,630
it's quite easy actually
to get COBOL engineers,

808
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,460
but it's not so easy really to get people

809
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,750
who also have proposed this knowledge

810
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,100
combined with the technology.

811
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:43,050
So that's one of the
big motivations for us

812
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,763
to drive the change.

813
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:50,610
When we started looking
at how are we going

814
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:55,050
to do the migration, we first
analyzed our applications

815
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,000
and found out they are quite complex

816
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,920
and we have a lot of dependencies

817
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,860
and also documentation was not up to date,

818
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,710
and we did not have proper test cases.

819
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,920
So we came to the conclusion
that we will only be able

820
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,690
to master that modernization

821
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,810
and to master the migration
if we can do it really

822
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,933
in the smarter way with benefiting
from capabilities of AI.

823
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,580
So how does it look like?

824
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,690
We have explored a couple of ideas

825
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:28,650
and at the end we defined
our modernization approach.

826
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,090
In general, we try not to combine changes,

827
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,790
technical changes with functional changes

828
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:40,790
since that increases complexity
and also slows you down.

829
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,350
But there are a couple of areas

830
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,720
where it's just the need to do so.

831
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,720
In that cases we used AWS
Transform together with Kiro

832
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,050
taking over the existing
business logic as a basis

833
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,153
and then adjusting it to be future ready.

834
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:02,250
In the other areas we focused
on the technical change,

835
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:06,840
with refactoring, of course
we did some code improvements

836
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,763
and also performance optimization,

837
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,820
but we kept the opportunity to compare

838
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,300
the actual test result of
the refactored application

839
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,100
with our original application.

840
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,010
Because we've seen a huge advantage

841
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:23,340
in safeguarding the refactoring approach

842
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,783
based on that technology.

843
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:30,930
In general, getting testing
on a new level was needed

844
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,280
to really speed up.

845
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,390
So doing like a code
conversion in a very short time

846
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,640
and then ending up with needing months

847
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,990
for proper testing is
nothing which looked for us

848
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,343
to be a right way forward.

849
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,340
And it was not an option.

850
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:52,305
So we really focused on
speeding up with the test,

851
00:39:52,305 --> 00:39:56,130
with all the testing activities
from test plan generation

852
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,453
to test integration.

853
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,443
So how does that look like in detail?

854
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,670
Let's look at one of our applications

855
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,710
and it's actually a pretty small one.

856
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,590
In the past only the
process and the IT experts

857
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:13,020
have been able to tell
us what's really going on

858
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,970
in the application and
what kind of variance

859
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,920
do we need to test.

860
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,340
So for that application, it
took the teams about 10 days

861
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,430
to prepare 137 test cases

862
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,990
and in addition about two days

863
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,943
to prepare the corresponding test data.

864
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,230
And the experts even
missed some of the variance

865
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,423
which later caused issues in production.

866
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:40,050
With AWS Transform, the business
logic could be extracted

867
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:44,280
from the actual source
code and the test cases

868
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,470
have been created in
just a couple of hours,

869
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:50,700
including validation and also the creation

870
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,703
of the test data could be
done in an automated way.

871
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,960
That helps us to speed up the migration

872
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,940
and also to safeguard the go live

873
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,773
of our migrated applications.

874
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,333
Looking at our landing zones.

875
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,350
So for us it was quite
important to get really rid

876
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,690
of all of the dependencies
we had previously

877
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:16,980
on the mainframe, so that was
already a huge benefit for us.

878
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,190
But in addition, we found
quite a good way forward

879
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:25,080
to run these applications on
our standard cloud platforms

880
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,213
based on the template architecture.

881
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,200
So we only needed to use a
couple of specific topics,

882
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,180
so like Glue jobs and Step Functions

883
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,523
to take over some of
the batch functionality.

884
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,920
But like Fiserv, we also
made the use of opportunity

885
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,760
to optimize some of our
coding with reforge.

886
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,270
For us now, after
refactoring the applications,

887
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,600
that's really a good starting
point for further improvements

888
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,720
and functional enhancements
including embedding AI

889
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,163
in these kind of processes.

890
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,380
So what have been our results,
if you're looking at facts?

891
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,180
So we've been able to
significantly speed up

892
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,770
everything around testing.

893
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:12,600
So it saves us about
75% on the testing side

894
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,323
due to reduced time
for test case creation.

895
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,730
The test coverage could
be increased by up to 60%,

896
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,330
which is a significant number

897
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,920
and of course that leads in total also

898
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,773
to a shortened timeline
for all of your migrations.

899
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,940
On the other hand, we've
seen that we've been able

900
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,360
to improve the code quality

901
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,210
and that also leads to
better maintainability

902
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:43,320
of our refactored applications
from a 2.8 star rating

903
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,133
to a 4.1 rating, which is
a significant improvement.

904
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,953
So what do you learn from it
or what did we learn from it?

905
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,450
I think although AI did
a lot of heavy lifting,

906
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,510
a lot of groundwork, we
think it's still important

907
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,530
that you have a good plan

908
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,453
when you start doing your migrations.

909
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,270
So we think it's important

910
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,180
that you choose your
migration patterns wisely

911
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,434
and align that with your business owners

912
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:12,843
and your stakeholders.

913
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,650
If possible, I would recommend

914
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,450
go with technical conversion first

915
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,940
and then do functional enhancements.

916
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,460
And use the AI to first understand

917
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,020
where are your dependencies

918
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,870
and use it also to get a proper
documentation that helps you

919
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,523
to make informed decisions.

920
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:34,547
Taking over elements for us
from our production factories

921
00:43:34,547 --> 00:43:38,940
with a high focus on continuous
improvement on standards

922
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,291
and efficiency has been
a key success factor

923
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:44,310
for our migration.

924
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:48,060
The team learned very fast
and improved the approach

925
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,303
and the tools with every single
step within the migration.

926
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,300
The close collaboration with
AWS helped us a lot to speed up

927
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:01,230
and we've seen that the agents
are developing very fast,

928
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:04,770
so there is even a huge potential
for further improvement.

929
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:08,520
So to sum it up, we are now able to solve

930
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,950
one of the biggest challenges in IT

931
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:14,700
to master mainframe migration
and that's really exciting

932
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,910
and I think what we should
not forget is at some stage

933
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,190
when we mastered all of the big migrations

934
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,830
that we also celebrate their success.

935
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,889
So thanks a lot and back to you, Meena.

936
00:44:25,889 --> 00:44:28,972
(audience applauds)

937
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,450
- Thank you, Frank.

938
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,680
Well, I'm gonna close today

939
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,260
by connecting some of what
we heard from Frank and Vimal

940
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,980
with what patterns we're seeing
across multiple customers.

941
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,770
The first piece of it, yes,
we wanna embrace automation,

942
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,780
embrace intelligence where we can,

943
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,340
but using the right technology

944
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,250
for the right task is critical to success.

945
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,390
This is both the, you know,

946
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,240
this to me is true day to
day within AWS Transform

947
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,010
and each agent we're introducing,

948
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,960
each problem we're looking to solve.

949
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,660
But in your organizations,
as Frank just mentioned,

950
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,940
depending on what you're trying to achieve

951
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,460
with each phase of your
modernization journey,

952
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,650
it's important to select the right pattern

953
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,180
that maps to what that business,

954
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,140
what that team needs at
a given point in time.

955
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,290
The next piece of it is
testing is not something

956
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:21,780
that comes at the end as one big bang.

957
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,690
It's something that needs to
happen through the process.

958
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,960
Now at this re:Invent, we've
all heard the word agent

959
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,940
a couple times a day at least.

960
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,330
What to me, agentic AI
means in this context

961
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,120
really comes to light in
the context of reforge.

962
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,410
Last year, reforge was one
step took your refactored code,

963
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:42,630
improved it using your AI.

964
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,780
This year, reforge is
truly an agentic process

965
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,670
that not only does that
uplift of the refactored code,

966
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:54,330
but also tests that code to
confirm functional equivalences.

967
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,850
When it notices errors,
goes back and modifies

968
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:00,120
that initial uplifted code to test again

969
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,550
and continuously gets you to a point

970
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,590
where the human being
is three cycles ahead.

971
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:07,380
The ball goes as far down
the field as possible

972
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,080
before you need to bring a
human being into the process.

973
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,893
That to me is the acceleration
we're seeing with agentic AI.

974
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:18,330
Finally, we know that modernization

975
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,920
as much of a technology problem

976
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,220
and perhaps more so of a
people and process problem.

977
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,510
Bringing the team along

978
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:28,530
and ensuring that you are
bringing humans into the loop

979
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,480
and making the right decisions

980
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,260
with the combination of technical input

981
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,910
as well as this business context

982
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,953
is what sets teams up for success.

983
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,550
Through all of this, we are optimistic

984
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:42,810
and we're seeing early signs

985
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,030
that we can see over 70% reduction

986
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,820
in what that total time
looks like for teams.

987
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,580
And again, this is now
bringing the conversation

988
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,550
from multi-year scoping
down to the order of months

989
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:57,300
where you can see results
within a calendar year.

990
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,700
And what I'm hearing
from teams is actually

991
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,240
making the challenge or bringing
this up to the CIO's office

992
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,890
and bringing this to decision makers

993
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,710
a lot more tractable across the board.

994
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:11,880
And, like we say at AWS,
it is definitely day one.

995
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,530
Even in the modernization journey,

996
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,180
you'll see continuous improvements

997
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,760
as your teams are working on things

998
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,920
and agents are able to
bring in that learning loop

999
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,570
to improve along the way.

1000
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:24,720
Similarly, what these agents
can do is also gonna continue

1001
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,510
to improve month over
month, week over week

1002
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,093
at the rate that technology
is advancing right now.

1003
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:36,180
Finally, our goal is we're
still gonna need experts,

1004
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,100
but we're gonna reduce the dependency

1005
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,280
on the process as a
whole, on these experts.

1006
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,950
So previously you might
have needed experts for 60%

1007
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:46,680
of the journey to really
understand the code

1008
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,830
and to elicit details from the code

1009
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,840
and the legacy systems along the way.

1010
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,750
Now AI can get them two
thirds of the way there,

1011
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,900
so your same team of
experts can do a lot more

1012
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,290
across projects than they've
been able to in the past.

1013
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:04,560
So our goal here really is to
leverage the AI to accelerate

1014
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,092
what these experts on
your teams can accomplish.

1015
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,540
(audience applauds)

1016
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,610
Thank you again for joining us today.

1017
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,590
I wanna close with thanking, again,

1018
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,680
thanking Vimal and Frank again
for telling their stories

1019
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,370
and leave you with couple pointers

1020
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:23,820
on how you can learn
more about AWS Transform.

1021
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,700
If you feel that your teams
are ready for the mobilization

1022
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,790
to start exploring modernization projects,

1023
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,370
I recommend that you
get in touch with teams

1024
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:35,640
to schedule an experience-based
acceleration process,

1025
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,950
which is a one to two
day workshop that we do

1026
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,410
where we work with your teams
to do an initial assessment,

1027
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:41,460
pick an application,

1028
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,190
and run through this
transform process with you.

1029
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:47,283
Thanks again for your time and
for joining us at re:Invent.
