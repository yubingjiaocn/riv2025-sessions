1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,040
- My name's Michael Grinich.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,950
I'm the founder and CEO of WorkOS.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,080
We are a company that helps developers

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,020
with authentication, identity,

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,400
really all the enterprise features

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,100
that you need to add to your product

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,620
as you take it up market and
sell it to bigger customers.

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,660
But today I'm not here to talk about that.

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,670
I'm here to talk about something else,

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,740
this little thing called agents.

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,540
How many of you are
building things with AI

12
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,750
or experimenting with AI agents today?

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,210
Amazing, it's a ton of hands going up.

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,520
What's crazy is I gave a
very similar talk to this

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,900
about six months ago,

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,350
and there were like two hands
that went up in the audience.

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,970
So it feels like agents
on this growth rate

18
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,560
is starting to take over.

19
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,000
And what I'm gonna talk about here

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,740
is actually security and permissions

21
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,370
and really identity as it applies

22
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,420
to this new world of agents

23
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,700
and how that's different

24
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,200
than what we've been doing
in the past for people.

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,900
All right, so let's
jump in and get started.

26
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,240
And I'll start here with a story.

27
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,160
So imagine that you are building

28
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,210
the next great LLM chatbot for your team,

29
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,100
kind of like an internal chat GPT

30
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,890
that your team can use
to do specific actions,

31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,880
can handle specific tasks,
maybe answer questions.

32
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,530
And for this example,

33
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,750
say that it's like an AI onboarding agent.

34
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,180
So it's helping your team with IT support.

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,000
So you've hooked it up
to internal systems.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,240
Maybe you're using MCP,
the model context protocol

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,880
or some other agent
framework to connect it.

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,740
And for this AI onboarding agent,

39
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,190
you need to give it access
to a production database.

40
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,840
So it can actually read
data about your company

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,790
and do specific actions, right?

42
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,967
So you just connect it to Postgres

43
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:39,090
or Aurora or whatever you have,

44
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,390
just like your normal app.

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,187
And a user logs in and says,

46
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:43,687
"Okay, what should we build today?

47
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,667
"Well, let's delete some unused files

48
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:46,920
"to clear up some space."

49
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,607
The LLM is like, "Great idea.

50
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:51,157
"I went ahead and deleted
the production database."

51
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,580
Not great.

52
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,700
And this might seem like
kind of a fake example

53
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,210
or something that's hypothetical,

54
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,810
but this actually happened
almost exactly like this

55
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,960
a few months ago on one of
these new vibe coding platforms

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,550
where a developer was building an app

57
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,110
through peer prompting,

58
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,660
chatting with one of the
new foundational models

59
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,420
that's very smart and
great at writing code,

60
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,220
but then decided to drop the
entire production database.

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,503
So you might wanna lock this down.

62
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,890
But what about if you're
connecting something like,

63
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,030
you know how to lock down a database,

64
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,050
maybe row-level security,

65
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,720
but what if you need to connect it to Jira

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,470
or then connect it to Salesforce
or connect it to Slack?

67
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,303
Where do you draw the line

68
00:02:35,303 --> 00:02:37,740
in terms of permissions for these systems?

69
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,420
These AI systems are only valuable

70
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,820
if you connect it to
all your stuff, right?

71
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,140
It can't do anything unless it's connected

72
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,360
to all of your data systems.

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,500
And at the end of the day also,

74
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,040
if this agent deletes
a production database,

75
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,960
who's responsible?

76
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,200
So these are questions that are really new

77
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,060
in the world of AI agent development.

78
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,220
In the past, a person
might have been responsible

79
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,080
or you could scope down privileges,

80
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,520
but it's very different with agents.

81
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,830
You have to give them broad
access to lots of things,

82
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,200
they have to have lots of
different capabilities,

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,050
and they can do stuff really quickly.

84
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,670
The shift here is that we really
need to think about agents

85
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,810
as first-class identities,
first-class identities.

86
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,970
So not just people as identities,

87
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,290
but actually agents in these systems

88
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,600
as identities.

89
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,700
And it's complicated because
agents aren't just machines.

90
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,020
There's been a lot of
research and a lot of work

91
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,080
on machine identity, doing
certificate, mutual TLS.

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,150
You probably all have
seen systems like that.

93
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,360
But agents kind of behave a
little bit more like people.

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,580
They collaborate with
people in similar ways.

95
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,940
They go use other
applications like people.

96
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,310
They might interface through an API,

97
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,980
but they also might interface
actually through a browser.

98
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,240
'Cause a lot of these products
that agents will go and use

99
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,350
maybe don't have APIs, or
the API is not as natural.

100
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,180
Imagine an API going and
using something like Figma.

101
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,190
It kind of has to go click

102
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,900
in the UI to be able to do stuff.

103
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,460
And so this is a major shift

104
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,160
around how we think about
identity authentication,

105
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,130
and really this new
paradigm for both engineers

106
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,130
building this, as well as enterprise IT,

107
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,220
who's gonna be responsible
for ultimately securing this,

108
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,580
and they're on the line,
they're on the hook

109
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,953
if things get deleted.

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,590
So really what I'm gonna talk about here

111
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,930
is this problem around
identity for agents.

112
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,730
Some ideas that we have around it,

113
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,830
some things that I've
seen around research.

114
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,400
But this is, I'm just gonna
tell you now, it's unsolved.

115
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,870
It is a brand new thing.

116
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,360
And my ask to all of you is
that we need to come together

117
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,643
to work on a new standard
for agent identity.

118
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,400
Okay, well let's jump in
and talk more about this.

119
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,600
So this growing trend is really about

120
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,270
agents interacting across different tools.

121
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,520
They're acting on behalf of users.

122
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,770
So agents can be standalone,

123
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,260
kind of synthetic individuals,

124
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,300
but really often they're more similar

125
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,170
to people I mentioned.

126
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,260
And in many cases, they actually need

127
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,510
a different type of data access.

128
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,890
So in some cases you would think,

129
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,150
let's just scope down the agent,

130
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,770
but in other cases you
need to actually connect it

131
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,580
really broadly to a lot
of different systems.

132
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,410
You know, if you have like
a super support agent,

133
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,243
you gotta connect it to everything for

134
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:12,720
it to have the context.

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,663
Really this is about context,

136
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:15,933
to be able to make decisions and do stuff.

137
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,420
And I think the implication
here is really that

138
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,070
identity in the applications
of what you're building,

139
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,290
they need to support
this machine identity,

140
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,510
this agent identity natively.

141
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,673
The machine-to-machine
system is not a fit.

142
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,700
And if you're thinking like,

143
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,890
okay, maybe six months
ago this wasn't a need,

144
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,800
your hand didn't go up
around building agents,

145
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,850
you're not convinced,

146
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,140
this is so, so powerful for new products

147
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,850
that if you don't incorporate this way

148
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,060
of building new applications
into your workplace,

149
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,110
you're not gonna be competitive.

150
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,000
Your products won't be
able to keep market.

151
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,590
Someone else that's able to harness

152
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,110
this power of agentic software development

153
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,400
will disrupt you.

154
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,310
So there's also a lot of
problems that we need to solve,

155
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,050
but I wanna reinforce
there's a lot of urgency

156
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,983
around doing this.

157
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,873
You know, one month in the
AI world feels like 10 years.

158
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,513
And it's just accelerating.

159
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,740
So we need to quickly find solutions here.

160
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,580
Okay, well, why is it fundamentally hard?

161
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,470
Like, why can't we just adapt

162
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,120
some existing patterns to agents?

163
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,800
Well, it makes this different

164
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,560
than maybe the previous
ways that we've done

165
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,970
authentication or identity for people,

166
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,280
or authentication and
identity for machines,

167
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,130
machine identity.

168
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,500
Well, the first thing is like,

169
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,110
the way that agents
work with these systems

170
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,433
is like headless.

171
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,730
So an agent might need
to log into a browser

172
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,563
and do something,

173
00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:40,560
but it's not really clicking around

174
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,270
and using the browser necessarily.

175
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,400
They need to have this sort
of like token persistence

176
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,930
over long periods of time,

177
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,460
long periods of invocations.

178
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,510
You don't want an agent needing to

179
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,400
sign in every single day.

180
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,010
I think the joke is always
about single sign-on.

181
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,650
You have to do it every 24 hours, right?

182
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,540
Agents, you need it to be
long-lived and durable.

183
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,840
And so we can't just adapt
the existing patterns

184
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,760
around sessions or identity to agents.

185
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,690
We actually have to do something

186
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,033
that's gonna be a long-lived credential.

187
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,220
And we need to be able to verify

188
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,000
that it's authentic
over this period of time

189
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,540
without a login page.

190
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,280
It's kind of like an API token.

191
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,110
How do we do these long-lived sessions?

192
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,000
Where do those credentials live?

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,370
How do the agents store it securely?

194
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,140
These are all questions
that are not answered yet.

195
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,760
That's one of the things
that makes this hard,

196
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,310
is agents need to operate
in a way that's headless.

197
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,060
The second which I touched
on a little bit here

198
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,650
is least privilege.

199
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,140
So we all know probably this pattern,

200
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,540
it's best practice around security.

201
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,480
It's having least privileges.

202
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,870
Taking a system and its access control

203
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,003
and scoping it down to only what it needs.

204
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,610
On the one hand, you wanna do this,

205
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,933
but on the other hand, if
you're building an agent

206
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,990
that needs to go off and
have some cross-system access

207
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,280
or cross-system behavior,

208
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,680
you actually need to have
sort of a most privileges.

209
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,570
You need to actually expand it.

210
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,300
What happens when the
agent needs to do something

211
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,950
it doesn't have a permission for?

212
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,370
How do you escalate that?

213
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,870
In a company, if a person does this,

214
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,260
they would escalate it to the IT team.

215
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,980
They would create a ticket,
ask for the permission,

216
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,980
be escalated, and then hopefully,
if it's a mature IT org,

217
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,590
that would be de-escalated at some time.

218
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,880
Become an admin in a certain tool

219
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,890
and then have it drop down later.

220
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,130
For an agent, you might
need this to be done

221
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,230
hundreds of times an hour.

222
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,630
Probably can't be a manual approval flow,

223
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,520
but still has the same need to be audited

224
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,620
and logged and secure.

225
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,440
So permissions here need to be dynamic,

226
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,660
including permission escalation.

227
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,440
Least privileges model is
really about static permissions,

228
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,253
not about dynamic permissions.

229
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,003
So it's another thing that makes it hard.

230
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,813
Third, compliance.

231
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,547
There's an old saying, "To err is human,

232
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:53,437
"but to screw up 10,000 times per second,

233
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:54,867
"you need a computer."

234
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,830
And I think this is the
case also with agents.

235
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,700
Who did what?

236
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,450
What agent went off the rails
and built a ton of stuff?

237
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,950
Exfiltrated your data?

238
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,540
These LM systems, there's a
lot of risk and prompt jacking.

239
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,100
People being able to
take advantage of them

240
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,740
and have them do things that are unsavory.

241
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,620
So we talked about in terms
of the privilege model,

242
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,610
but in terms of compliance,

243
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,320
you need to have a full, deep audit log

244
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,570
of who did what and when.

245
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,990
Today, audit logs are mostly
around people activity,

246
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,823
humans doing things.

247
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:27,120
And there's just a
limit to how many things

248
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,370
people can do inside of a company.

249
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,720
But as soon as you start having agents,

250
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,240
hundreds, maybe thousands of these,

251
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,860
it's gonna get a lot more challenging.

252
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,960
So compliance is actually, I think,

253
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,820
one of the biggest problems
that's not being discussed

254
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,070
when people building agents.

255
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,320
There's a lot of agent frameworks.

256
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,930
There's a lot of new tools
and techniques for this

257
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,450
that people are giving talks around.

258
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,000
No one's talking about
compliance, but we are here.

259
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,730
If you even think about something

260
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,760
like a log aggregation
system, like a SIEM,

261
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,730
if you've ever used something
like Splunk or Panther

262
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,430
for this, those need to
be adapted to agents.

263
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,020
So just to show you, we
need to go all the way

264
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,843
through the full ecosystem
to be built for this world.

265
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,933
Okay, so those are a few things
that make it challenging.

266
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,610
Now I wanna switch gears and talk about

267
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,850
some architectural
patterns that I have seen

268
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,760
other people start building.

269
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,440
These are really just some kind of ideas

270
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,060
as people are thinking about identity

271
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,860
for agents that have emerged.

272
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,130
None of these are necessarily
like standards yet.

273
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,270
They're really just ways that people

274
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,590
have been approaching this problem.

275
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,360
Then they have advantages
and disadvantages.

276
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,650
I'll talk through each of them,

277
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,773
just to give you a flavor
of what's out there.

278
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,600
The four are persona
shadowing, delegation chains,

279
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,440
capability tokens, and
escalation to humans,

280
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,373
human in the loop.

281
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,120
So let's start with persona shadowing.

282
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,470
So what does this mean?

283
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,783
Well, it's kind of like impersonation.

284
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,690
So you've probably seen
this with a SaaS product

285
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,760
where you can go impersonate
one of your users.

286
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,290
You can log into the tool as them

287
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,080
and see the product as
the user would see it.

288
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,750
But really, what persona
shadowing here is about

289
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,870
is actually giving an agent
an independent identity.

290
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,490
So it's not acting as you,

291
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,400
it's actually sort of a reflection of you

292
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,780
that shadows a user.

293
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,040
Inside of an identity system,

294
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,140
this could be like a secondary user

295
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,660
or maybe something like a service account

296
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,700
that has a subset of those privileges.

297
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,440
And what this lets a system do

298
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,290
is sort of enforce stricter limits.

299
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,200
And it can trace agent
access to those actual agents

300
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,510
that are doing the
things versus the people.

301
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,910
Today, a lot of agent activity,

302
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,650
like scripts that people hack together

303
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,210
or systems that people are using,

304
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,490
they actually just use your identity.

305
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,790
They'll use your actual
login into these systems.

306
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,460
And so any activity the agent does

307
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,750
looks like it was actually you doing it.

308
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,160
This is one step away from that,

309
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,590
where it's kind of taking
your persona and shadowing it

310
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,170
and building sort of
derived identity from it.

311
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,430
So you still stay, if you're
Matt, you stay Matt prime,

312
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,900
but you might have like Matt agent one,

313
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,550
Matt agent two, Matt agent three.

314
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,630
So this provides this
isolation and accountability.

315
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,100
Every action is actually
explicitly tied to an agent.

316
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,043
And it's distinct from the delegated user.

317
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,750
The problem with this
is that impersonation

318
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,300
generally gives too much power.

319
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,480
And if you're doing this
kind of like shadowing,

320
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,760
it's very hard to scope
down the roles enough.

321
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,020
And again, I keep going back to this,

322
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,330
like where's the permission boundary?

323
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,090
Too wide, too narrow,
too wide, too narrow.

324
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,550
That's the challenge of persona shadowing.

325
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,050
But it's kind of the
first one people reach for

326
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,600
'cause it feels pretty natural.

327
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,430
All right, let's keep going.

328
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,863
Two, delegation chains.

329
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,020
So AI agents often will
call other services.

330
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,600
So you'll have an agent
that starts doing one thing.

331
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,500
And then what it'll actually do

332
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,510
is it'll go call out to sub-agents

333
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,860
or connect to other systems.

334
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,740
And the idea of a delegation chain

335
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,530
is that there's actually
a way for that identity,

336
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,480
that agent system, to be passed
from one system to another.

337
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,690
Kind of like a credential,

338
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,510
kind of like handing
somebody your AWS badge,

339
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,220
which you shouldn't do.

340
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,230
But that idea of it getting passed around

341
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,580
so other people can access things.

342
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,350
Or handing somebody maybe
your Costco membership,

343
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,880
which you also shouldn't do.

344
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,963
(laughs)

345
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,000
This preserves this end-to-end trust

346
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,883
and through the context of these hops.

347
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,030
And the design here is that this agent

348
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,650
must actually be caring for

349
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,930
the user's original authorization.

350
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,700
So their original kind
of set of permissions

351
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,740
are carrying it forward step-by-step.

352
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,080
And it needs to be verified
by these different agents.

353
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,640
So you kind of need like a third party

354
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,600
that you can check the permission against.

355
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,340
If you've ever used things like JWTs,

356
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,660
which are cryptographically signed

357
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,190
and have some information within,

358
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,810
and that can be passed
from different systems.

359
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,910
You can check, just check the signature.

360
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,950
The signature and date is valid.

361
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,783
It's good to go.

362
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:59,540
That's kind of a version
of delegation chains.

363
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,080
And so this is another
idea that people have

364
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,540
around identity for agents.

365
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,360
Is creating the agent, but
not naming the agent itself,

366
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,150
but giving it a credential
that can then be passed around.

367
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,460
Sub-agents are becoming
a very, very popular

368
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,040
kind of like programming model.

369
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,900
It's a model for building
agentic experiences.

370
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,300
It lets you manage context.

371
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,000
You can give a whole talk
about context management

372
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,823
for AI systems.

373
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,790
One of my favorite
AI-based coding products

374
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,220
actually does this, where you
ask it to build something.

375
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,130
And it says, I'm gonna
go consult the architect.

376
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,600
And there's a sub-agent that acts

377
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,460
as like an architectural consultant

378
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,170
and then brings it back in, right?

379
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,370
And so if you wanted this idea

380
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,750
of having a credential
that's passed around,

381
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,730
you could do it through delegation chains.

382
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,300
This is another pattern in
bringing identity to agents.

383
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,820
It's kind of like shadow
users are essentially,

384
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,670
shadow users kind of
getting passed around.

385
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,100
This is actually supported today

386
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,690
in some of the things
I mentioned around JWTs

387
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,720
and some things like OIDC, OpenID Connect.

388
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,700
It's been a pattern
that's existed previously

389
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,890
in web engineering, but being applied now

390
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,443
for agent identity, agent engineering.

391
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,720
Cool.

392
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,213
Three, capability-based tokens.

393
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,560
So previously what I
was talking about was,

394
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,040
having kind of a single
identity given to an agent

395
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,930
or a single credential given to an agent.

396
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,480
You kind of mint it
once, the agent gets it,

397
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,400
it goes and does stuff with it.

398
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,020
There's another way of doing this,

399
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,890
which is giving credentials
for one specific task.

400
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,350
So you really can scope
it down to a single thing

401
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,460
that it's trying to do.

402
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,520
It's kind of like a stamped
ticket for one action.

403
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,893
And this is like a capability-based token.

404
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,540
Example of a capability-based
token would be like,

405
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,710
agent X can read Bob's calendar
for the next 60 minutes.

406
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,543
That's it.

407
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,060
So that token is not actually
an identity for that agent,

408
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,150
it's a credential that it
can use to go do something.

409
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,140
And again, like the
permissions are tied in

410
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,633
to the token itself.

411
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,130
It's kind of like a secure
voucher for like one resource,

412
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,990
or even one action.

413
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,630
You can imagine a capability-based token

414
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,223
being used for one API call.

415
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,100
You're gonna use it
once and throw it away.

416
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,300
Maybe a payment, like
a single payment link.

417
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,020
So unlike a human which might

418
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,460
log in with broad permissions,

419
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,540
an agent could be given this
different capability token

420
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,600
for each task or resource.

421
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,770
You can even imagine a service

422
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,270
that's vending these things out.

423
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,710
That's saying, you wanna do this thing?

424
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,080
Okay, I'll let you do it, but just once.

425
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,540
So it lets you create
this really scoped down

426
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,530
set of privileges.

427
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,480
These tokens can be like time-bound,

428
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,890
they can be self-contained,

429
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,960
they can be very easy to verify.

430
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,640
But the problem again,
it's kind of the opposite

431
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,170
of what I was talking about earlier.

432
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,010
You gotta keep getting 'em.

433
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,000
You gotta keep checking 'em out.

434
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,370
You have to have a service
that can keep generating these.

435
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,270
And you sort of centralize
the permission creation moment

436
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,090
into some service that's creating these.

437
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,670
But this is a pretty powerful pattern.

438
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,280
I actually think this
will emerge more and more

439
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,420
within internal IT systems,

440
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,557
where you wanna have a centralized log

441
00:16:58,557 --> 00:17:01,680
and a centralized kind of
credential management system,

442
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,650
and you're sort of checking
out the ability to do stuff.

443
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,740
And the agents are kind of calling in.

444
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,113
In a way, it's almost like doing a RPC.

445
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,660
You're not actually
doing the function call,

446
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,710
the procedure call,

447
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,240
but you're sort of getting the voucher,

448
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,040
the token, to be able to do that.

449
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,230
It's as good as calling the thing, right?

450
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,830
Getting the permission to
do that one function call.

451
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,950
Today, the tokens that exist
inside of typical OAuth scopes

452
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,120
are not this granular,

453
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,770
but there are some examples of people

454
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,510
kind of hacking it to do this.

455
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,400
If you've ever OAuthed with a service,

456
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,140
and there's a dropdown where you can say

457
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,060
how long the token's gonna be valid,

458
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,370
you can say forever, or
you can say one hour.

459
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,203
That's sort of an example

460
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:45,720
of a capability-based
token out in the wild.

461
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,553
But again, with agents,

462
00:17:46,553 --> 00:17:47,430
'cause they're gonna do so much stuff,

463
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,130
we have to really scope them down.

464
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,490
Okay, capability-based tokens.

465
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,750
The last one here, for
the humanists in the room,

466
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,073
is escalation to humans.

467
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,860
We are still in control.

468
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,353
If all else fails, bail
out, call the human.

469
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,950
Actually have the human
give the permission check.

470
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,380
Run the inline, actually,
experience of approval.

471
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,870
This is really about approval flows.

472
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,900
And I think this will always be part

473
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,850
of how people bring
identity and permissions

474
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,470
and authorization to agents,

475
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,030
'cause ultimately, there
will still be things

476
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,980
that you want to be in the loop for.

477
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,060
There will always be something

478
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,030
that you want the agent to not do.

479
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,610
Even if designed to do that thing,

480
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,160
you say confirm with me before
you actually go do that.

481
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,920
Confirm with me before you
send the wire transfer,

482
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,200
before you file my taxes,

483
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,240
before you sell my car,
or whatever, right?

484
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,550
So human in loop will still be a thing.

485
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,780
And the idea here is
the escalation to human

486
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,210
can really kind of add
these consent checkpoints.

487
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,650
Now, again, the downside of this,

488
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,270
if you have agents going
out and doing everything,

489
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,770
they can't ask you every time.

490
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,950
And what I've seen, even in the world

491
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,830
of like Chats GPT and MCP stuff,

492
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,570
is you get this consent fatigue.

493
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,210
If you keep asking the
user, hey, are you sure?

494
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,043
Are you sure?

495
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,177
Guess what users do?

496
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,070
Click, click, click,
click, get out of my way.

497
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,110
I just wanna get my stuff done.

498
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,940
Human in the loop, escalation to human

499
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,190
becomes less effective
the more it's applied.

500
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,650
So it needs to be, like
the cookie monster says,

501
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,883
it's a sometimes food.

502
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,300
Don't always escalate to humans.

503
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,330
Only do it when it's
important or necessary.

504
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,440
But again, then there's the question,

505
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,753
when is it important to loop in humans?

506
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,020
These are all just different patterns,

507
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,970
architectural patterns, and
I think the right solution

508
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,220
is actually combining
these things together.

509
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,250
You might have some
capability-based tokens,

510
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,360
but that capability-based token might have

511
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,620
an attribute that requires
you to be in the loop.

512
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,440
It can initially say, hey, you're able

513
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,080
to create the wire transfer,
but to initiate it,

514
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,460
you have to get approval from me,

515
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,410
and there's like a tag on it
to be able to do that stuff.

516
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,640
So these can be composed together

517
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,280
to actually create the type of behavior

518
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,033
that you want in your product.

519
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,580
And when you're building
these objective systems,

520
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,980
I don't think there's one size fits all.

521
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,980
Only you can know about
the right permission model,

522
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,550
the right threat model, what
the risks or concerns are,

523
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,980
whether there will be
consent fatigue or not.

524
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,000
Maybe you don't need to worry about

525
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,040
escalation to a human being fatigued

526
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,940
if you're escalating it
to the head of compliance,

527
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,040
who you know is gonna
take it more seriously,

528
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,080
versus escalating it to a support rep

529
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,270
who might just be trying
to get about their job.

530
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,230
And so really, these four
things combined together,

531
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,670
I think, can give you a good foundation

532
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,160
for how to think about building
security or permissions

533
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,230
into your own agent-based workflows.

534
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,160
And they all kind of tie

535
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,910
into that identity permission side.

536
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,060
Okay, so I've given you a

537
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,833
few architectural examples up here.

538
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,430
Also, around identity for agents,

539
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,720
and just generally identity
in what we build at WorkOS,

540
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,893
there are a lot of acronyms.

541
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,890
So buckle up, we're about to enter

542
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,383
the acronym zone of this talk.

543
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,720
And what I'm gonna talk about is actually

544
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,450
some of these new protocols
that have emerged,

545
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,590
and new emerging standards all
around identity and agents.

546
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,860
So this is stuff that's
not done in the world yet.

547
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,750
It's kind of in the proposal state.

548
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,370
But things you might start hearing about

549
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,740
over the next few months
or the next few years

550
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,570
as people are building
more and more systems

551
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,583
to interface with agents.

552
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,473
All right, so here's some
emerging standards and protocols.

553
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,620
The first, not really emerging,
it's our old friend, OAuth.

554
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,353
OAuth 2.0/OpenIDConnect.

555
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,710
OAuth and OpenIDConnect
are pretty related,

556
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,930
kind of a superset of the protocol.

557
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,840
But we all know OAuth, right?

558
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,270
We've all signed in with our
Facebook account somewhere,

559
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,500
our Google account.

560
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,870
This has been around for quite a while.

561
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,300
And OAuth was designed
initially so that users

562
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,280
could explicitly grant this third-party

563
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,820
access, limited access,
without sharing passwords.

564
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,653
At the end of the day,

565
00:21:57,653 --> 00:22:00,150
you don't wanna give an agent a password.

566
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,590
You don't want the
password in the context.

567
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,630
You don't want it in the agent's memory

568
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,100
'cause agents are unreliable.

569
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,150
The LLMs are unreliable.

570
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,250
Someone can get that password out.

571
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,640
So with OAuth, being able
to do this delegated access,

572
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,910
being actually kind of give
this consent and approve it,

573
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,080
is actually a pattern I've seen

574
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,540
with most of these agent systems.

575
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,140
If you're using one of
these products like Zapier

576
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,980
or N8n, when you're connecting
all these systems together,

577
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,140
the first way you connect
these things together

578
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,070
is through OAuth.

579
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,800
This brings your identity
from other systems into it.

580
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,190
So to give this identity
to agents is through OAuth.

581
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,343
Now, the limitation is that
OAuth was built for people.

582
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,310
It was built for human consent.

583
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,870
And so for an agent to try to sign in

584
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,240
through an OAuth-based system is tough.

585
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,920
It actually has to run a browser.

586
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,110
There's usually a lot
of machine detection.

587
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,610
There's automated attacks that
happen on OAuth endpoints.

588
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,190
We've actually at WorkOS
built a whole product

589
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,550
around detecting and
blocking bot abuse and fraud.

590
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,140
So this emerges here.

591
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,940
It's very hard to tell the
difference between the agent

592
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,520
that's trying to do
something good for a user

593
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,023
and a bot that's malicious.

594
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,100
But OAuth is a well-loved, in some cases,

595
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,760
some cases not so loved, protocol

596
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,860
that can actually be adapted for identity

597
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,973
for agentic systems.

598
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,553
Cool.

599
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,060
Second here is something called UMA,

600
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,010
user-managed access.

601
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,110
So this is actually an extension to OAuth.

602
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,280
And it allows a user, which
is like the resource owner,

603
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,920
to actually proactively
grant another party,

604
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,720
another person, access to a resource.

605
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,150
And you do this through
a centralized server.

606
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,740
So this is a way that users
can give consent for resources.

607
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,170
And essentially what
it's doing is, as a user,

608
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,260
it's allowing you to set policies

609
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,480
for what an agent can access.

610
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,180
For AI agents, they
could use this to control

611
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,110
what a personal assistant
is able to do or not do.

612
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,790
It's essentially taking the policy

613
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:04,650
and externalizing the consent
to this third-party system

614
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,140
that's giving the grant,
rather than baking it

615
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,510
into every single OAuth consent dialogue.

616
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,150
So think about an example here.

617
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,760
You know when you sign into
something and it's like,

618
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,860
hey, I wanna connect to your calendar,

619
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,570
connect to your Google Calendar.

620
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,690
When you hit approve, you're
giving that thing access

621
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,870
to all of your Google
Calendar kind of forever.

622
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,210
With something like UMA, you
could actually give it access

623
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,540
to a sub-resource that could
be escalated or de-escalated

624
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,760
after that initial consent,

625
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,670
to kind of separate
the permission resource

626
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,070
authorization step from
the initial authentication

627
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,320
authorization connection.

628
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,100
Pretty powerful stuff.

629
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,960
And this is, again, it's
an extension to OAuth.

630
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,970
It's already out there in the wild.

631
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,260
It's not really used that much.

632
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,280
There's a lot of interesting stuff

633
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,950
that's in the OAuth specs and extensions

634
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,190
that are sort of becoming
more relevant with agents.

635
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,780
Bunch of ideas that
people had over the years

636
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,010
that didn't really catch on,

637
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,600
but now with agents, they're more popular.

638
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,520
And this is one I think
that has a lot of potential.

639
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,733
So if you haven't heard
of UMA, check it out.

640
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,200
Another one, increasing
our acronyms, is GNAP.

641
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,310
Sounds very cool.

642
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,620
The Grant Negotiation and
Authorization Protocol.

643
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,283
You can look up the RFC if
you want some bedtime reading.

644
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,480
GNAP is actually designed
for dynamic negotiation

645
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,190
of token scopes.

646
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,180
So I mentioned this before.

647
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,950
The previous one was about resources.

648
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,200
It's actually the resources
that it's connecting to.

649
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,300
GNAP is actually about
the scopes or claims

650
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,130
in the token itself.

651
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,830
So rather than resources
like a document or an object

652
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,180
or a piece of code or something,

653
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,610
this can be about the capabilities,

654
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,490
the kind of actions that it can take.

655
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,310
And this actually lets the
client that's interacting

656
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,890
with it negotiate dynamically

657
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,780
and receive these tailored tokens.

658
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,310
So going back to what
I was saying previously

659
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,460
about the capability-based access tokens,

660
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,170
this doesn't create
different tokens for it.

661
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,180
It's like the same token,

662
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,230
but you can kind of scope it up and down.

663
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,290
And this is a really flexible framework.

664
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,280
I haven't really seen that many examples

665
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,930
of people building stuff with it.

666
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,650
Weirdly, it's like many years old.

667
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,060
It feels like it was designed today.

668
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,510
I think it's actually an exceptional fit

669
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,680
for what we'll need for AI agents.

670
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,290
It's just sort of a question whether

671
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,790
all the people building stuff now

672
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,900
will go back and read this or

673
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,393
we'll just build something new.

674
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,220
But this is pretty fantastic.

675
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,810
It essentially is a big improvement

676
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:29,130
on this static scope model that OAuth has.

677
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,350
And the static scopes are one
of the biggest challenges,

678
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,520
not just around agent development,

679
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,630
but I think generally OAuth.

680
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,330
It's a big detriment to OAuth.

681
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,230
There's a lot of people
that will go through

682
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,700
and connect their Google
account to something,

683
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,190
for example, and forget
that they connected it.

684
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,840
It's very hard to deescalate those scopes.

685
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,010
You have to deactivate the whole thing.

686
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,150
You can't escalate or deescalate.

687
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,670
So GNAP is a grant negotiation
authorization protocol.

688
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,773
So it's really like a
dynamic negotiation protocol.

689
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,010
OIDCA, this is the OpenID
extension for agents.

690
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,650
Now, this is very early.

691
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,680
It's actually in a blog
post from earlier this year,

692
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,900
a couple of people working on it.

693
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,700
When I talked about this a few months ago,

694
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,620
someone very angrily
came up to me and told me

695
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,600
it's not in the spec, so I
shouldn't be talking about it,

696
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,980
but I think it's really cool.

697
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,930
It's an extension to
actually OpenID Connect

698
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,580
that's specifically built for agents.

699
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,980
So all the stuff I mentioned
earlier around OIDC

700
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,047
not being good for people
actually logging in,

701
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:26,280
the kind of dynamic system,

702
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,840
this actually is an extension

703
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,280
that makes it possible for agents.

704
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,843
So it's this emerging standard.

705
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,570
And it standardizes a
lot of these attributes

706
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,150
around the model, the
provider, the version,

707
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,120
the instance ID, all the agent
systems that you would want.

708
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,643
So it kind of brings
structure to that world.

709
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,840
I don't know the current state of it

710
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,040
if it's actually gonna make
it into the OIDC stuff,

711
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,720
but again, these are some very good ideas

712
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,670
to go build on top of if you're interested

713
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:55,470
in extending your own OIDC
framework for developers.

714
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,030
And in particular, this actually has stuff

715
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,250
for doing capability discovery.

716
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,820
So one of the differences
between OAuth and OIDC

717
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,290
is you can actually have
this kind of discovery step

718
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,980
that you can see what's
possible in the system.

719
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,770
And this lets you kind of
like check the permissions

720
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,230
that might be available beforehand.

721
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,400
So OIDC-A.

722
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,140
And the very last one here,

723
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,140
you've almost made it through
all the acronyms, is SCP.

724
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,573
The Secure Credential Presentation.

725
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,363
Have any of you heard

726
00:28:23,363 --> 00:28:25,740
of the Verifiable
Credentials Project, VCs?

727
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,660
This is through the W3C.

728
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,680
This is something that was
kind of like the Web 2.0 era.

729
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,390
People were really talking about it.

730
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,440
They're really excited.

731
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,670
It was the idea that you could have

732
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,890
like a personal credential that's created

733
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,900
and verified by some third party

734
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,330
that can be verified anywhere.

735
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,480
So if you like went to
Stanford and you got a degree,

736
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,590
you could actually have sort

737
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,065
of a cryptographic signed credential

738
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:51,720
that you have a CS degree from Stanford.

739
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,920
And you could show that to anyone

740
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,250
and they could verify it
with Stanford's public key.

741
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,083
It's really powerful.

742
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,410
It was actually built for humans,

743
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,120
but this is something that has a lot

744
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,040
of potential to be applied for people.

745
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,560
Some of the architectural
patterns I mentioned earlier,

746
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,590
you can use verifiable
credentials to provide that.

747
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,300
This can be the tokens that you can pass

748
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,133
from machine to machine

749
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,743
'cause it can be verified
in sort of a stateless way.

750
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,830
There's actually an OIDC
extension for this too.

751
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,050
OpenID Connect for
Verifiable Presentations,

752
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,100
is what it's called.

753
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,300
So you take these,

754
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,067
verifiable credentials is
actually separate from OIDC.

755
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:25,023
You can put the two together.

756
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,690
So acronym soup, there's
a lot of different things.

757
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,790
I hope this standardizes
a little bit more.

758
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,470
If I'm gonna give a talk
here at re:Invent next year

759
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,540
about this, it'd be nice
to have like one acronym

760
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,053
instead of five, but that's
the world we're in today.

761
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,760
All right, we'll start to talk

762
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,493
about some industry
approaches and tools next.

763
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,610
So it's super, super early around how

764
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,620
actually people are building with agents.

765
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,950
But there's an approach that we've taken

766
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,860
and we've actually built
products around this

767
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,840
in terms of how you can
bring authentication

768
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,990
and identity to your agentic systems.

769
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,020
And it's a pattern that
we've used for many years.

770
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,550
It's middleware.

771
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,120
So the idea here is really
to take your application,

772
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,740
your agent code in some way,

773
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,420
and isolate it from
these third party systems

774
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,340
you're connecting it
to with a shared layer

775
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,297
that's actually doing the authentication

776
00:30:18,297 --> 00:30:20,640
and authorization at some boundary.

777
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,670
And this is what we've built at WorkOS.

778
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,160
We are an identity authentication company.

779
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,360
If you've logged into products

780
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,620
like ChatGPT, Enterprise,
or Cloud, or Perplexity,

781
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,840
Cursor, how many of you have used Cursor?

782
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,280
Yeah, a ton of people.

783
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,360
We're actually running that as middleware.

784
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,190
We're an authentication middleware system.

785
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,380
And this same thing will work for agents.

786
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,640
We've built a product called AuthKit,

787
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,340
which is a full identity
end-to-end package for this.

788
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,870
And we actually have also figured out

789
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,070
how to build a middleware system

790
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:50,490
for doing authorization,
fine-grained authorization.

791
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,260
It's kind of built
around some of the ideas

792
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,550
that Google had with Zanzibar,

793
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,737
but resource-level permissions.

794
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:57,600
And so this model of just building

795
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,500
this kind of interface layer
gives your agent developers

796
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,090
a lot of tools and a lot of flexibility

797
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,490
and really leverage to go
build expressive applications

798
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,180
and have their code do crazy things

799
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,340
and call out to LLMs and
have them do the reasoning,

800
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,130
get all the benefit you
have from the LLM systems,

801
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,710
get all the juice out of that fruit,

802
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,360
but not expose yourself to risk,

803
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,663
not expose yourself to
potential attack or issues.

804
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,440
We've actually even built
in the middleware system,

805
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,120
I mentioned some of our fraud stuff,

806
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,470
you can also protect your app

807
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,540
against agents doing weird stuff.

808
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,560
So we have a product called Radar

809
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,300
that actually blocks fraud and abuse

810
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,890
and detects anomalous behavior.

811
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,000
And we run it in the same way

812
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,100
as this kind of application middleware.

813
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,660
So the same patterns that we've been using

814
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,950
for a long time for traffic,

815
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,810
for web-based systems on the internet,

816
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,483
we can use for agents, which is thankful.

817
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,570
There's a lot of
interesting stuff being done

818
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,933
also around identity for
agents from other vendors.

819
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,870
I know we're at the AWS conference,

820
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,880
but I have to say Microsoft Entra

821
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,890
is like a really, really
popular identity system

822
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,880
that a ton of companies use,

823
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,230
like enterprise identity thing.

824
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,560
And they recently
introduced Entra Agent ID.

825
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,880
So you can think about provisioning agents

826
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,430
coming from the human identity system.

827
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,290
There's a lot of interesting
stuff coming out of that.

828
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,830
We're working with them
to hopefully standardize

829
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,860
on some protocols there.

830
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,790
And then also around the
industry standards for this,

831
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,020
there's some pretty interesting stuff

832
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,310
happening from the IGA vendors,

833
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,680
like ConductorOne, it's a
pretty interesting startup

834
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,240
if you haven't seen them.

835
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,530
It's really used by IT for

836
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,410
human-based kind of permissioning

837
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:31,083
and it's a very natural
extension to move that to agents.

838
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,570
So a lot of cool stuff
happening in the industry.

839
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,710
What's next?

840
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,760
What's next for this?

841
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,750
Going, kind of rewinding
back a little bit,

842
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,363
trust used to be the barrier.

843
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,260
It was black and it was white.

844
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,043
You had code that was trusted,

845
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,290
code that your team wrote,

846
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,120
'cause we all know our
code is not full of bugs

847
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,680
if we wrote it, it's trusted.

848
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,630
And then you had untrusted code,

849
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,400
things that might have been packages,

850
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,990
open source things
downloaded from the internet,

851
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,420
you sandbox it, you run it in some type

852
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,150
of isolated container, you
don't trust its behavior.

853
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,530
But we really had these
two different worlds,

854
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,973
trusted versus untrusted.

855
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,053
And this has really gone away.

856
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,560
It's very hard now to say
what's trusted and untrusted.

857
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,810
Everything's a gray area.

858
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,620
What is real?

859
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,453
What is fake?

860
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,370
How can you tell that the
code that's been authored

861
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,620
by the AI system, the
agent, is actually correct

862
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,453
or trust or not?

863
00:33:29,453 --> 00:33:30,510
You can't.

864
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,680
And the same thing is true, actually,

865
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,780
with code that's written by your humans,

866
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,240
'cause humans are using AI
systems to write a lot of code.

867
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,830
So it's not just the code
that's being written,

868
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,200
it's the actual behavior
of the applications

869
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,520
and the kind of end-to-end system

870
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,730
of how these systems work in production.

871
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,223
And even if you can trust the code itself,

872
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,420
these LLM systems are super dynamic.

873
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,150
In fact, they're very,
very non-deterministic.

874
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,983
They have this stochastic behavior,

875
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,200
and the models are changing constantly.

876
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,210
If you're calling out
to a third-party model,

877
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,610
it could be totally different tomorrow.

878
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:05,160
And so you can't really
trust anything anymore,

879
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,150
is what I'm trying to say.

880
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,890
Previously, you could have
some code that you would run,

881
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,910
you'd put it on a box, you'd be like,

882
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,350
okay, I'm gonna trust it's
gonna do the same thing

883
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,150
for the next 10 years.

884
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,360
If you're plugging it into
one of these AI systems,

885
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,193
good luck.

886
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,540
Today's apps are primarily used,

887
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,853
say like 95% of them is by people.

888
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,720
If you ship a new product,
if you ship the new service,

889
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,100
your humans are onboarding it,

890
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,970
and maybe like 5% of
the traffic is some API,

891
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:39,510
some Zapier thing maybe that
connects or some automation.

892
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,510
If you build a task tracking app,

893
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,340
like a JIRA or a linear competitor,

894
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,260
mostly it's gonna be people using it.

895
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,000
And then maybe there'll
be some automated things,

896
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,300
automated bug reports
or whatever right in it.

897
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,250
But I think that this
is actually gonna shift.

898
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,570
It's already shifting,

899
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,613
especially with things like linear,

900
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,730
where agents are becoming actually

901
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,893
an increasing use case here.

902
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,933
They're going from being
maybe 1%, 0% or 1% or 5%.

903
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,163
To some point,

904
00:35:08,163 --> 00:35:10,810
I think that they'll
actually be like 50, 50%.

905
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,840
Fit 50/50.

906
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,980
And then at some point,

907
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,460
agents might be actually
the dominant set of users.

908
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,650
There might be products that are created

909
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,323
first for agents and second for people.

910
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,870
That you're just as a human

911
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,060
kind of stepping in to
override the system.

912
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,350
It's not actually designed for you.

913
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,120
And this is a huge architectural shift

914
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,650
around building products and services,

915
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,813
and honestly also building companies.

916
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,070
If we think back to the
early infrastructure

917
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,900
that was API first,

918
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,600
companies like Stripe
that launches an API,

919
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,240
I think that there will be
companies that are agent first.

920
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,530
They launch and provide their service

921
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,960
not to humans, but to agents.

922
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,420
And there'll be a whole
economy around agents.

923
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,470
This might sound far-fetched,

924
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:56,553
but these things happen
slowly and then all at once.

925
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,750
And there will be actually
more agents than people.

926
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,450
People, we're pretty slow to create.

927
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,440
Long time horizon.

928
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,870
Agents, you can make new
ones very, very fast.

929
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,040
And so it's not hard to imagine

930
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,500
with the seven billion
people we have in the world

931
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,230
that there will likely be
trillions and trillions of agents

932
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,320
popping into existence,
dissolving, doing tasks for us.

933
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,813
And the way that modern products will work

934
00:36:17,813 --> 00:36:20,820
and the way that modern
applications will leverage this

935
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,920
will determine whether it'll
be successful in the market

936
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,753
or not.

937
00:36:23,753 --> 00:36:24,930
And the way that companies leverage it

938
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,460
will determine whether they're successful

939
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,610
and competitive or not.

940
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,103
It's gonna be really,
really, really, really big.

941
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,420
Billions of people, trillions of agents,

942
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,880
one giant problem to solve

943
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,460
around identity and authentication.

944
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,440
So if you're interested in this,

945
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,430
if you have thoughts around this

946
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,730
or you're working with
agents inside of your company

947
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,830
or maybe just noodling
around or curious about it,

948
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,810
I encourage you to come
chat with me right now

949
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,315
after this talk or send
me a message later.

950
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:56,550
I'm really, one of the
reasons I'm here at reInvent

951
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,610
is to meet folks like you

952
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,700
and to hear about what
you're all building.

953
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,380
So hopefully we can collaborate together

954
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,930
and build this very exciting
future for AI agents

955
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,440
and rapidly bring this world to fruition

956
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,610
and do it in a way that's
very secure and safe.

957
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,490
Thanks so much.

958
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,657
(audience applauding)
