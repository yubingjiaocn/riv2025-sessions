1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,830
- [Edward] Thank you
everyone for coming out today

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,890
and spending a few minutes
with Sunil and myself.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,240
Again, my name is Edward McIlheran.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,740
I'm with Kyndryl.

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,720
I'm a consult partner
with our digital workplace

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,770
services practice.

7
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,580
I'm focused primarily on contact
center modernization across

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,890
all of our different verticals,
including healthcare, state

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,223
and local government, financial
services, and many more.

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,070
- Hi, I'm Sunil Menon.

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,980
I am a senior business development leader

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,120
for customer experience
engagement in US healthcare

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,053
at AWS.

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,770
- There we go. So a little QR code.

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,390
We'll have this slide up at the very end,

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,850
but again, if you guys want
to hang out afterwards,

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,040
we'll be here for the next half hour

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,080
to discuss any questions
that you may have stemming

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,403
from today's presentation.

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,380
So the short of our presentation
today is how can we help

21
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,020
you engage your patients during
the entire episode of care

22
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,780
and beyond leveraging the power of AI?

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,030
And I get it, that AI
is the number one thing

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,050
happening in our industry.

25
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,390
Everybody's looking to
AI, how do we use it

26
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,780
to solve our key use cases
and really drive home

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,430
a lot of benefits for our organization.

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,090
And so today we're gonna focus
on kind of like, three themes

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,220
that, and I'll talk about here shortly,

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,200
and you'll see that
throughout the deck as well,

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,690
of how does this apply
to patient engagement

32
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,770
and what are the opportunities

33
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,260
to leverage AI in the
contact center space.

34
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,020
So number one is with the
consumerization of it,

35
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,570
we're seeing a lot of
this chat bot experiences,

36
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,170
the ChatGPTs of the world
are, everybody has access to,

37
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,060
and it's really revolutionizing the way

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,380
that you can interact with data.

39
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,078
And so now the consumers have the need to,

40
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,730
or the preference of having
this from the services

41
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,900
they consume, including healthcare.

42
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,520
So it really opens up the opportunity

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,520
to reimagine those front end
engagements with your patients.

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,930
Number two is eliminating long hold times

45
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:55,020
and inefficient activity.

46
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,560
So with a combination of, you
know, shortening workforce,

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,990
but also long or more call volumes

48
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,450
that are coming into the healthcare space,

49
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,120
this really is a recipe for
potential bad experience.

50
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,470
So how do we leverage AI to
enable self-service capabilities

51
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,507
and drive down this call volumes,

52
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:16,440
but at the same time, give
your caregivers better tools

53
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,320
with AI that allow them to
service patients faster.

54
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,070
And then number three is
reducing the complexity around

55
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,330
how care is delivered, right?

56
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,050
So today in a modern
healthcare, you know, scenario,

57
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,180
you may have follow up
appointments, you may have

58
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,640
to coordinate different care specialists,

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,200
and sometimes you just
don't know where to go

60
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,340
to get help when you need it.

61
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,500
And so we can leverage AI

62
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,900
to look at this from a holistic view

63
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,690
and be a, you know, kind
of like that shepherd

64
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,570
and guiding them in a
smart way to make sure

65
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,710
that they're following along

66
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,390
and we can avoid scenarios like

67
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,740
non-adherence and readmission.

68
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,573
So Sunil, any thoughts there?

69
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,680
- I'll dive into how this
patient journey unfolds

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,880
on the next slide.

71
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,560
So if you really think
about the patient journey

72
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:04,440
whether it's for a short episode of care,

73
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,970
like going for a cold,

74
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,730
or a longer therapy,
like a cancer therapy,

75
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,470
there are some distinct steps.

76
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,370
There are the patients,
there is an intake process,

77
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,220
they communicate what they're
going through, they need

78
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,290
to get their appointments.

79
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,910
Then there is the actual visit
part, which can be virtual

80
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,260
or in person.

81
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,400
And then there's a post care follow up.

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,550
And then there is the nurturing campaigns

83
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,360
and continuous engagement,
proactive communications.

84
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,900
When you think about this,
on the front end, the point

85
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,660
where the patients come
in, that ingress point,

86
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,480
that's where you can
collect a lot of information

87
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,740
and provide that high
bar customer experience

88
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,210
that they deserve.

89
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:56,210
And this can be done by
having natural language AI

90
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,080
powered by Lex as well as Noah Sonic now

91
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,670
to try and provide
self-service opportunities.

92
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,620
Where is parking, what
are the hours of operation

93
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,540
I need to set an appointment?

94
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,860
These things can be managed
automatically if you can deflect

95
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,520
40% of the volume as many
customers have achieved,

96
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,750
what that does is it takes
the load off your engagement

97
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,800
platforms and your agents don't have to

98
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,070
provide answers to routine interactions.

99
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,220
They can focus their energy
and effort on the high

100
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,820
complexity, high value interactions.

101
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,060
Let's actually see a demo to,

102
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,580
and this is an immersive
demo, so I would encourage you

103
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,790
to listen to it carefully.

104
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,740
There are a lot of things going on

105
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,073
and you can see what that next
level engagement looks like.

106
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,190
- Yeah, before we jump
into the demo real quick.

107
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,770
So for those in the audience
who are not familiar

108
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,100
with Amazon Connect, this is
a full-blown contact center

109
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,650
as a service platform that
was built for Amazon by Amazon

110
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,180
and it was commercially
available back in 2017,

111
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,540
but now has grown very
quickly to be a leader

112
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,170
in the contact center space as defined

113
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,190
by folks like Gartner.

114
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,550
So it's an entire end-to-end application.

115
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,320
So from a patient experience perspective,

116
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,550
you have the full omnichannel
opportunities of integrate,

117
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,660
of calling in through voice, chat, SMS,

118
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,360
video, in-app web calling.

119
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,873
You can also integrate, you
know, agentic framework,

120
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:40,170
agentic chatbots and conversational AI.

121
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,510
If you need to elevate
that call to an agent,

122
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,000
agents have unified workspaces
where you can integrate

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,700
all of your applications
that are necessary

124
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,020
to reduce contact switching

125
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,120
and also your knowledge
library that allows you

126
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,020
to get next best action in order to solve

127
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,460
the inquiry faster.

128
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,640
From a supervisor perspective,
you have, you know,

129
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,410
all the reporting options
that you would need.

130
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,170
So whether it's out of the
box or you can customize them,

131
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,540
but also there's a lot of
tools that are available

132
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,850
to supervisors that
reduce a lot of the time

133
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,710
that goes into QA for your agents.

134
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,320
So this really helps on the front

135
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,870
of getting them more efficient,
training them faster,

136
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,060
improving them faster, but
really improving that time

137
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,970
to value for somebody that's
new to the organization.

138
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,910
And then finally, from an
administrator standpoint,

139
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,790
it's a simple, intuitive
GUIs when it comes

140
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,650
to designing your contact center,

141
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,630
but also making changes on the fly.

142
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,000
And then finally the modern API and SDK.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,180
So what you'll see here in a
second on our demo is you can

144
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,442
leverage these APIs

145
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:39,630
and SDKs to really curate the experiences

146
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,510
that you're looking to
create for your customers.

147
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,910
And you know, I'll quickly say too,

148
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,740
that the two advantages that we see

149
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,250
with Amazon Connect in the
field is that is the modularity

150
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,980
and the consumption based model.

151
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,990
And modularity, what
I mean by that is that

152
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,690
you don't have to adopt the
entire platform all upfront.

153
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,310
There's no upfront investment

154
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,470
and there's no licensing tiers
that you have to worry about.

155
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,180
You truly pick the services that align

156
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,640
to your organization's needs
and you go and build those,

157
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,460
and then the consumption
model allows you to pay for

158
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,540
what you truly use.

159
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,390
So with proper finops,
you know, practices,

160
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,160
you can really achieve high ROIs

161
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,203
when adopting Amazon Connect.

162
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,260
So with that, we're gonna walk you through

163
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,660
a quick little demo on
what this new experience

164
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,493
could look like.

165
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:25,200
(phone line ringing)

166
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,730
- [Speaker] Thank you
for calling Any Health.

167
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,470
I'm your virtual assistant.

168
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,510
Our system recognizes this number.

169
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,550
Am I speaking to Juan?

170
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,150
- [Juan] Hey, yes, this is Juan.

171
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,470
- [Speaker] Hi Juan.

172
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,140
Let me quickly verify your
identity before we go further.

173
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,750
I've sent a one-time code to
your registered phone number.

174
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,850
Can you please read it to me?

175
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,343
- [Juan] Sure. It's 547099.

176
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,223
- [Speaker] Thanks.

177
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:51,390
Could you also confirm your date of birth?

178
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,043
- [Juan] August 1st, 1984.

179
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,800
- [Speaker] Thank you for verifying, Juan.

180
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,620
Our records show you're
a designated caregiver.

181
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,200
Are you calling today
about Terri Whitlock?

182
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,150
- [Juan] Yes, I am.

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,090
- [Speaker] Okay, I see your
mom was recently discharged

184
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,130
from our hospital on August 15th.

185
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,130
Dr. Williams, as part of
her discharge care plan,

186
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,890
recommended an EKG follow-up appointment.

187
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,720
Would you like to schedule
that appointment now?

188
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,620
I can help you find a convenient time.

189
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,973
- [Juan] That'd be great.

190
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,470
- [Speaker] Based on your
previous scheduling preferences

191
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,260
for Terri's appointments,
I see you typically choose

192
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,610
Friday afternoons.

193
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,350
I have the following slots available

194
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,883
with Dr. Smith on Friday, August 22nd.

195
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:43,980
1:00 PM, 2:30 PM or 3:45 PM

196
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,200
at the Any Health Maine medical offices.

197
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,310
Don't worry about writing us down,

198
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,440
I'll send all the details
including the address

199
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,300
in your appointment confirmation email.

200
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,190
Would any of these times work for you?

201
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,800
I can also check other days if you prefer.

202
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,250
- [Juan] 1:00 PM Sounds good.

203
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,893
- [Speaker] Perfect.

204
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:02,490
I'll schedule Terri's EKG appointment

205
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,230
with Dr. Smith for Friday,

206
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,870
August 22nd at 1:00 PM at the Any Health

207
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,190
Maine medical offices.

208
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,250
And Juan, since this is a new
specialist visit for Terri,

209
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,620
would you like me to quickly
check if the existing referral

210
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,530
from Dr. Williams fully
covers this consultation?

211
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,080
Or if any additional
authorization might be needed from

212
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,450
Terri's primary care physician, Dr. Chen?

213
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,860
Sometimes different insurance plans

214
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,393
have specific requirements.

215
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,310
- [Juan] That's a good point.

216
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,510
Yes, if you could check.

217
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,790
- [Speaker] Sure. Just one moment.

218
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,780
Okay, I've reviewed Terri's
current authorization status.

219
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,170
It appears the referral from
Dr. Williams is comprehensive

220
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,020
and covers this initial
consultation with Dr. Smith.

221
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,080
So no further action should
be needed from your end

222
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,030
regarding authorization for this visit.

223
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,780
- [Juan] Great, for this
appointment, is there anything

224
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,930
specific that Terri
needs to do to prepare?

225
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,380
- That's a thoughtful question, Juan.

226
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,720
Let me check the standard
preparation guidelines

227
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,380
for a new patient cardiology
consultation with Dr. Smith.

228
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,710
Mary should continue taking
all her current medications

229
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,080
unless specifically instructed otherwise.

230
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,180
Wear comfortable clothing, bring a list

231
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,220
of her current medications, not eat

232
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,600
or drink anything except water

233
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,500
for four hours before the appointment.

234
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,190
- [Juan] That's a lot of instructions.

235
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,840
Can you send these to me somehow?

236
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,520
- [Speaker] Don't worry, I'll
include all these preparation

237
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,620
guidelines in your
appointment confirmation email

238
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,910
for easy reference.

239
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,250
Would you also like me
to text this to you?

240
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,300
- [Juan] Yes, please.

241
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,720
- [Speaker] The instructions
have been texted to you.

242
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,030
Additionally, you'll receive
appointment reminders

243
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,160
as we get closer to August 22nd.

244
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,100
Is there anything else I
can help you with today?

245
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,300
- [Juan] No, that's all.

246
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,813
- [Speaker] Thank you
for calling Any Health.

247
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:52,923
Have a great day.

248
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,653
- Excellent.

249
00:10:57,653 --> 00:10:58,740
So I hope everybody was able to hear it.

250
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,720
If not, you could read some of the subtext

251
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,553
that were up there.

252
00:11:01,553 --> 00:11:04,980
But you know, again,
this demo really shows

253
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,110
how you can take an average interaction

254
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,820
and really transform that experience,

255
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,890
leveraging all the
capabilities that come out

256
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,810
of the box with Amazon Connect.

257
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,190
And really, when you're thinking about it,

258
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,720
you're not looking at
it from the lens of as a

259
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,430
contact center, you're truly looking at it

260
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,960
as a patient engagement platform.

261
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,540
And so for the interest of
time, I won't be able to go

262
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,070
through all these, but
you know, these are a lot

263
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,810
of the common themes and
benefits we're seeing

264
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,510
with customers adopting
this type of strategy.

265
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,150
And you could see quite a few
of these in that demo alone.

266
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,040
So enhancing patient member engagement

267
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,750
through omnichannel communication.

268
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,000
The patient called in
through a voice channel,

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,430
but they spoke with the conversational AI

270
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,500
and they also interacted
over text message.

271
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,040
So it's a seamless unified
omnichannel experience

272
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,570
that the customer enabled.

273
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,030
You're leveraging AI and
automation for personalized care.

274
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,910
The conversational AI in the
background was interacting

275
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,450
with key systems like your EHR
to understand who they were,

276
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,820
why they were calling, what
they could be calling about,

277
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,280
but also hook into other
systems for prescription refills

278
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,330
or appointment scheduling.

279
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,540
So being able to leverage
that can create a contextual

280
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,280
but seamless experience for them.

281
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,290
And then finally, to
streamline administrative

282
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,970
and operational processes, right?

283
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,480
So these context center
platforms like Amazon Connect,

284
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,850
they have sophisticated
IVRs where you can embed

285
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,510
a lot of the, your simple tasks
that take up a lot of time

286
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,630
for your caregivers, such
as, you know, bill payment

287
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,750
or patients or rescheduling appointments.

288
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,170
You can streamline all of
this in the IVR to provide

289
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,330
a better experience for that
patient that's calling in,

290
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,050
but B, again, giving time
back to your caregivers.

291
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,810
So again, this is really the strategy

292
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,550
of how we're seeing customers adopt,

293
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,870
taking it from a contact center,

294
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,240
but thinking about it from
an engagement platform

295
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,729
and really rethinking
those new experiences.

296
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:47,130
So Sunil, walk us through on, you know,

297
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,030
how would we get started in
implementing the strategy?

298
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,900
- The big challenge customers
face is the patient engagement

299
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,670
journey is very complicated.

300
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,650
There are many parts of the organization

301
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,510
interacting with the patients.

302
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,110
Where do customers really start?

303
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,080
And the answer is they can start anywhere.

304
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,190
Amazon Connect is
engineered for the future

305
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,730
to accommodate all
kinds of AI, agentic AI,

306
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,513
conversational AI,
predictive AI, generative AI.

307
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:24,390
And the important thing is
that customers can choose

308
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,510
the extent and pace at which they bring AI

309
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,190
into their organization.

310
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,140
So if you look at this
slide, it's pretty busy,

311
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,690
but if you think of the
top half of the slide,

312
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,640
that's the fastest way

313
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,104
to go modernize your
patient engagement journeys.

314
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:44,104
On the top left, you'll see
that you can improve the IVR

315
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,790
like you experienced in the demo.

316
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,190
It was providing
self-service opportunities,

317
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,600
natural language used by
powered by Lex, Noah Sonic

318
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,430
and Agentic workflows.

319
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,280
I would highly encourage you,
on Thursday there's a session

320
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,480
by University of California
San Diego where they talk about

321
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,940
how they were able to
leverage Amazon Connect

322
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,560
and agentic workflows

323
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,370
to improve the self-service opportunities,

324
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,930
have patient verification
improve the first call resolution

325
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,750
and reduce the average handle time.

326
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,140
The right hand side of this slide

327
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,140
shows the outbound campaigns.

328
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,190
There's a need to proactively
reach out to customers.

329
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,570
One excellent example is
Jupiter Medical Center.

330
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,920
They had a peculiar problem.

331
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,610
They have this expensive
radiology equipment

332
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,930
that was used only about 75%
of the time, yet they had a lot

333
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,930
of open referrals for radiology.

334
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,210
They used Amazon Connect
outbound campaigns

335
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,790
to proactively reach out to those patients

336
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,200
and they were able to
convert a lot of them into

337
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,120
actual appointments.

338
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,390
The capacity utilization
of this expensive equipment

339
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,810
went up from 75% to 95%.

340
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,220
Think about what that means.

341
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,990
Number one, more revenue.

342
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,550
Number two, the productivity

343
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,880
of those expensive technicians is higher.

344
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,450
And most importantly,
patients get the imaging

345
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,510
that they need so that
they can have the diagnosis

346
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,050
and the treatment that
they deserve and need.

347
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,630
So it's a trifecta of benefits.

348
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,760
The bottom half of this slide shows

349
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,590
traditional contact centers.

350
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,580
One hidden opportunity is in
the clinics and departments.

351
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,190
You think of any healthcare
system, the departments,

352
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,260
ambulatory centers and clinics.

353
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,770
A lot of conversations
happen between the patients

354
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,200
and those clinics directly.

355
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,740
And yet there are these old style phones

356
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,150
that are not AI ML powered devices.

357
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,090
You can deploy Amazon
Connect there, take advantage

358
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,480
of the agentic workflows
and all of the goodness.

359
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,010
And the best part is

360
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,900
because it's a consumption based model,

361
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,910
it's not a license based model,

362
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,390
even in those low volume locations,

363
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,370
overall, individually they're low volume,

364
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,390
but together they contribute
a high volume of interactions.

365
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,150
You can deploy Amazon Connect.

366
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,490
Ed, do you want to take it next

367
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,273
and explain how Kyndryl has
deployed Amazon Connect?

368
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,710
- Yeah, so I chose this scenario
because it was something

369
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,240
that we deployed earlier in the year

370
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,580
and it really just kind of
speaks to everything that Sunil

371
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,260
and I are talking about, right?

372
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,750
You can adopt at your own
pace, but really start with

373
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,010
the workflows or start with
the needs that matter most

374
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,843
to your organization.

375
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:45,570
So, you know, when a federal
government COVID era program

376
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,120
wound down around safety
net benefit programs,

377
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,460
all of the constituents of
the state had to re-enroll

378
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,780
at the state level.

379
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,820
And the infrastructure that
was in place was not able

380
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,330
to really hold up to the
volumes that were coming in.

381
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,970
And undoubtedly what led next was,

382
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,080
you know, bad experiences.

383
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,420
People were on hold for two plus hours,

384
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,760
sometimes more than four hours.

385
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,210
They weren't happy, agents
were burning out very quickly.

386
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,040
So the agency knew they
had to make a change

387
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,110
and really figure out how
to leverage technology

388
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,260
to solve a lot of the issues
that they were facing.

389
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,560
And so we helped design a new
system that spoke to a lot

390
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,690
of the self-service needs
that they were requiring.

391
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:26,174
This was around, you know,
checking the status of,

392
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:28,380
you know, how much money is on my card,

393
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,030
when's my next benefit coming through,

394
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,154
are there other benefits
that I may be entitled to

395
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:33,840
and many more other use cases.

396
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,120
And what it led to,
initially in the first month

397
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,730
of deploying this was 30% call deflection,

398
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,843
which was amazing.

399
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,425
Also, there was a self-service capability,

400
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:46,380
so that meant when the
hours of this department

401
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,140
or the call center was closed,
people could still go in

402
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,780
and ask critical questions,
especially around

403
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,670
how much entitlements
may be on their cards.

404
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,980
So it was a big win.

405
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,290
The NPS scores were starting to improve,

406
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,150
the agents were much happier,

407
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,950
and because of the amount
of data they were able

408
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,040
to collect in the IVR about the
caller, the agents were able

409
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,070
to quickly reduce how much
time it took to handle

410
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,750
a lot of the inquiries
that were coming through.

411
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,240
So, and a great partnership with AWS,

412
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,220
they've been fantastic in
helping support us along

413
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,620
that journey along with
the client as well.

414
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,683
So Sunil, let's take us
home, keys to success.

415
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,020
- The first basic thing is
making the decision to move

416
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,020
to a cloud-based patient
engagement solution

417
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,490
like Amazon Connect.

418
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,230
Because if you don't move to the cloud,

419
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,160
you cannot take advantage
of all the data AI,

420
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,400
the continuous interactions
that your patients are having,

421
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,580
being able to personalize
the experiences to them

422
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,500
and understand their context.

423
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,000
So that's the first step.

424
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,460
The second step is crawl, walk, run.

425
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,210
It can be pretty overwhelming
if you try to plan

426
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,500
this whole journey and try to
massively change your system.

427
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,920
The trick is to find those
opportunities, like I explained,

428
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,920
those IVR modernization as
well as the outbound campaigns

429
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,131
are good places to start
because you'll get the ROI,

430
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:12,930
you'll have savings and you
can then pool those savings

431
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,633
into modernizing other
parts of your system.

432
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:20,160
The third part is choosing
the right partner.

433
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,760
Kyndryl's a great partner, lot
of experience in healthcare

434
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,820
and Amazon Connect, and people.

435
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,610
Getting your people in the
journey is very important

436
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,830
because they have institutional knowledge,

437
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,730
they know the inside of your organization

438
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,530
and when they work with the partner

439
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,270
and AWS technology, they are
going to uplevel their skills

440
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,980
and be ready for the future

441
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,860
so that they can deploy agentic workflows,

442
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,840
not only on the front end,

443
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,280
but then take it downstream

444
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,590
through all the organizational processes,

445
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,423
including clinical workflows.

446
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,850
- And we're right at time,

447
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,350
so I'll quickly go
through these last ones,

448
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,780
but you know, Kyndryl,
we've invested heavily

449
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,710
in the healthcare space.

450
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,140
We have over 13,000 practitioners,

451
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,940
whether they're supporting
our existing clients

452
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,120
or they're involved in our
consulting organization.

453
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,160
We've been investing
heavily in our partnerships

454
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,630
with Epic, Oracle, Ovation.

455
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,570
And we've been recognized as
a healthcare IT services firm

456
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,490
by, you know, three independent,

457
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,110
third party advising organization.

458
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,380
So, you know, this is an
area we take very, you know,

459
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,790
very seriously and we continue

460
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,140
to invest heavily into this space.

461
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,520
So yes, we do connect,

462
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,190
but we do a lot of other
things in the healthcare arena

463
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,180
as well.

464
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,350
And with that, we really appreciate

465
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,460
everybody coming by today.

466
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,860
Thank you for your time and
spending with us, and Sunil

467
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,120
and I are happy to hang out around

468
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,620
and answer any questions you may have.

469
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,453
Thank you.
