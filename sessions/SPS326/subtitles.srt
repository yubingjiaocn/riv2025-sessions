1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,113
- Alright, well, good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,540
Thanks for joining us.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,470
It's 5:30.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,530
Actually, before I start, silent session.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,960
So make sure you have your headphones on.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,710
Can everybody hear me okay? Good? Awesome.

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,970
If it's a little too loud

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,060
or if you need to adjust the
volume, there's a little dial

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,490
so you can use it to adjust your volume.

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,950
But thanks for joining us.

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,230
It's 5:30, it's around
this time where we decide

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,720
between like happy hour or dinner,

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
but you squeezed in a
session which tells us,

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,130
and you picked this
session, which tells us

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,710
that lifecycle management at scale is

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,780
a topic that you're interested in.

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,730
So we appreciate you being here.

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,400
My name is Farzin Bagheri, I'm
a principal technical account

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,250
manager at AWS and I'm
joined here by my colleagues.

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,020
So I'll let them introduce
themselves real quick.

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,903
- Hi, I'm Andrew Riley. I'm
also a principal team at AWS.

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,780
- Hi, everyone. Gian Mario Deluigi here.

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,060
I'm from the ServiceNow family

24
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,670
and I cover the item products.

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,010
Super excited to be here with you all.

26
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,843
- Thank you.

27
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,910
Folks, they're gonna join me later

28
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,950
after when it's their turn,

29
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,323
but for now, you'll have me on the stage.

30
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,860
Today, together, the three of us,

31
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,370
will dive deep into lifecycle
management at scale.

32
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,860
By the end of the session, you'll see

33
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,360
that it's very much possible
to move away from managing

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,360
thousands of lifecycle emails,
improve your operational

35
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,840
practices by 90%, improve
your operational efficiency,

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,460
and reduce your cost of
operations significantly

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,970
by reducing your need to
use extended support of some

38
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,233
of our managed services.

39
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,630
We will get there by
first diving deep into

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,990
what lifecycle events are in the cloud.

41
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,590
I'll walk us through what are
the common lifecycle events

42
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,110
that we manage in AWS

43
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,290
and I'll also walk us
through the common challenges

44
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,840
that we've learned from some
of our largest customers

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,490
and engaging with them.

46
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,746
Andrew later will do a
walkthrough of what AWS Health is.

47
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:14,790
We'll dive deeper into that

48
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,820
and how it fits into the
lifecycle management ecosystem,

49
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,730
how that actually is a very
critical component in enabling

50
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,193
customers to manage lifecycle at scale.

51
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,860
Then he will also run through some

52
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,930
practical implementation
of AWS Health by some

53
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,430
of our largest customers,

54
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,520
and he will actually share
a real customer example

55
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,050
that we're pretty excited about.

56
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,980
Lastly, Gian will join us
on the stage from ServiceNow

57
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,600
and he will do a demo.

58
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,630
It will do a walkthrough
of something exciting

59
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,030
that they're working on
about integrating AWS Health

60
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,960
and ServiceNow and he'll
finish up with a demo.

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,940
It's a silent session, so we
can't really take questions

62
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,960
on the stage.

63
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,712
Afterwards, happy to
meet with you downstairs

64
00:02:57,712 --> 00:02:59,880
outside of the stage,

65
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,220
we actually have the AWS
Health product team here

66
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,070
that would help answer some
of the questions as well.

67
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,453
So let's get into it.

68
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,601
We're gonna use the term
lifecycle event a lot today,

69
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:15,930
so let's get on the same
page as what we mean by them.

70
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,343
Lifecycle events are schedule changes

71
00:03:19,343 --> 00:03:22,218
that require coordination

72
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:27,218
and are part of our
continuous improvement in AWS.

73
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,990
The three common types of lifecycle events

74
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,580
are routine changes.

75
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,720
First, I think that's the one

76
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,940
that most of us are familiar with.

77
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,460
These are the changes that
their lifecycles are their,

78
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,860
sorry, the timelines are predictable,

79
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,630
are easily predictable.

80
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,630
So think of a EKS lifecycle
versions that are deprecating

81
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,632
and you need to upgrade to newer versions.

82
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:56,880
The timeline for that is 14 months,

83
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,890
so you can easily predict them.

84
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,680
Same thing for some of the
other services that we have.

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,440
But so another type is a less common type

86
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,780
of lifecycle events.

87
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,820
This is non-routine changes.

88
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,300
Think of hardware retirements that we do.

89
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,913
These timelines are not
really easily predictable.

90
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,150
We can anticipate them easily,

91
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,380
but we can't really
predict their timelines

92
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,900
until we get closer to when
we want to cycle out a piece

93
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,343
of hardware from our fleets.

94
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,069
Lastly, but definitely not least

95
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,280
are the urgent changes.

96
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,480
These are the types of changes

97
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,950
that we don't get the luxury
of plan ahead in advance.

98
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,790
Think of security patches that
we need to roll out globally

99
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,730
and we need to make sure that

100
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,070
they reach all the components that need

101
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,960
to be updated in a very quickly.

102
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,613
So we may get maybe a couple
of weeks of notice in advance.

103
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,417
So now that we've kind
of covered what are the

104
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:01,020
common types of lifecycle events, we need

105
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,820
to talk about why they're necessary.

106
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,350
So through these changes,
we are able to improve

107
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,170
the performance for our services

108
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,830
and keep improving the
performance of our services.

109
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,717
This is also how we enable
features, new features

110
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:21,900
and improve the security
posture of the infrastructure,

111
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,360
which is what we are responsible for

112
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,550
on our side on the AWS side.

113
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,990
Lastly, this is how we actually keep

114
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:34,560
the components of the cloud up to date

115
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,650
and make sure everything is
running on the latest versions,

116
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,290
both hardware and software.

117
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,690
But you need to know that
at any given time there are

118
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,360
thousands of changes
happening in the background,

119
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
but we try our best

120
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,679
to make sure these things
are happening seamlessly

121
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:53,370
and without the need for
customers to take action.

122
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,250
But there are always a subset
of changes that require

123
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,260
that are require customer action.

124
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,060
So today's session is gonna
be focused on those types

125
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,920
of changes, the changes

126
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,773
that require customer
action and coordination.

127
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,663
So let's look at one example
just to bring it all together.

128
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,120
EKS lifecycle, Amazon EKS
lifecycle starts really

129
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,830
with upstream open source.

130
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,243
When Kubernetes launch a new version,

131
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,213
they support it for about 12 months.

132
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,130
EKS then supports that
same version for 14 months.

133
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,530
So Kubernetes supported for 12 months.

134
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,110
EKS supports it for a couple more months,

135
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,520
so total of 14 months.

136
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,393
That period is called standard
support period for EKS.

137
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,940
Six months prior to reaching
that end of standard support,

138
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,866
that 14 months, EKS notifies
customers through AWS Health

139
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:56,700
and that six months is
ideally used by customers

140
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,870
to upgrade their clusters

141
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,450
and move off of that older version.

142
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,950
But for customers that
can't upgrade in time,

143
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,290
EKS will automatically roll them into

144
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,630
what we call extended support.

145
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,293
So extended support kicks in
at the end of that 14 months

146
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:15,453
for the clusters that remain
on that older version.

147
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,610
That gives you an extra 12
months on the extended support,

148
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,230
but it comes at a cost.

149
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,930
So during that, as long as
your clusters are running on

150
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,783
that extended support, you incur cost.

151
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,630
It does give you the flexibility,

152
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,260
but it also at over time, the
the cost of this will add up,

153
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,160
especially if you're running at scale.

154
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,930
At the end of that 12, extended 12 months.

155
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,220
So that now you have a
end-to-end 26 months of support.

156
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,640
At the end of that 26 month,
if you still have clusters

157
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,470
that are running on the old version,

158
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,040
EKS will automatically
upgrade your clusters.

159
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,340
Basically a force upgrade.

160
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,233
But all of these seem kind of
manageable if you're running,

161
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,100
your workloads are running
at a smallest scale.

162
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,210
Let's say you're a startup

163
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,840
or POC size, you're in that scale.

164
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,070
You have a couple of clusters.

165
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:16,070
You may have some RDS instances,
a few lambda functions.

166
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,913
It's pretty manageable.

167
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,940
You can pull up the console,

168
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,700
you can go look at the
changes that are coming up.

169
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,360
You can maybe even look
at rely on looking at

170
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,513
documentation every once in a while.

171
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,920
But as you get to the growth
stage where you're kind

172
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,444
of growing, you have now
some critical workloads,

173
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,860
you have customers that are
relying on their your uptime,

174
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,770
so it's not as easy to
bring workloads down to

175
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,703
for maintenance.

176
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,620
This is where most customers
start to feel the challenges

177
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,063
of managing life cycle.

178
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,930
Email is no longer as reliable.

179
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,330
Looking at the console constantly is not

180
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,800
as reliable anymore

181
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,370
because you may have
multiple teams, global teams,

182
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,250
you can't really reach
across the the office

183
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,650
and ask your teammate
to make sure to upgrade

184
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,993
this cluster or take action.

185
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,340
But when you get even
bigger to a larger size,

186
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,680
hopefully all your businesses
are growing at this pace

187
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,750
and you get to the enterprise level

188
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,320
where now you have even
more critical workloads,

189
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,540
maybe you're relying on
hundreds of different services

190
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,710
at AWS, then each of them
will have their own timelines

191
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,910
and things continue to
get more complicated.

192
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Now, at the largest scale,
which some of us we deal with

193
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,373
customers that have reached this scale,

194
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,194
you're gonna have siloed
teams that complete kind

195
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:41,880
of don't communicate
with each other at all.

196
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,100
And you may actually acquire
another company that comes

197
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,030
with their own tech debt, with
their own backlog of changes

198
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,290
that have kind of been putting off

199
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,270
because they have competing priorities.

200
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,650
So now you have this large set

201
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,740
of backlogs across your organizations

202
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,600
because the number of
resources has grown, number

203
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,260
of teams have grown, the competing
priorities have increased

204
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,660
where you have to choose
between maybe launching a new

205
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,990
feature or meeting your
business objectives

206
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,420
or managing the lifecycle of your changes.

207
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,691
So at this stage, it's very critical

208
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:19,590
to get very intentional to use the tools

209
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,830
and technology in this case AWS Health

210
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,210
to gain the right level of
visibility into what's changing

211
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,210
and when, and to bring in the
awareness to the right owners

212
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:34,590
and stakeholders at the right time

213
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,920
and accelerate driving action towards kind

214
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,130
of shrinking these backlogs.

215
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,340
So Andrew will join us on the stage

216
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,970
and show us the real implementation
of some of the solutions

217
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,180
that we have helped customer
build around AWS Health.

218
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,603
And from there on Gian will
take over for the demo.

219
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,683
- Thank you.

220
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:05,283
There we go.

221
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,370
Hey, thanks, everybody

222
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,050
and thanks for seeing fear
and introducing the issue.

223
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,280
So this is a specific
area I work in a lot.

224
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,990
So again, my name's Andrew Riley.

225
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,800
I work extensively with
customers operating at scale

226
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,990
and trying to work
through lifecycle events.

227
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,880
And in particular I work
with them on solutions

228
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,610
using AWS Health to
help with that problem.

229
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,510
So before we go deep into the solutions,

230
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,270
are do people generally
familiar with AWS Health already

231
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,280
like Jovans? Okay.

232
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,740
Most people, most people have heard of it.

233
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,420
The particular thing I wanna
do first is lay some groundwork

234
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,090
about what AWS Health does

235
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,100
and in particular the
features of AWS Health

236
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,830
that are specifically
designed for lifecycle events

237
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:53,400
because that's what we're
using at scale with customers

238
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,603
to put into this work.

239
00:11:55,653 --> 00:12:00,653
So to go through it really
quickly, what is AWS Health?

240
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,710
It's the platform on which all

241
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,820
of the AWS services
communicate to you about events

242
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,100
that might be impacting the performance

243
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,173
or availability of your resources on AWS.

244
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,960
So if you use EC2, S3, RDS, EKS,

245
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,020
the service teams are
looking to communicate to you

246
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,420
about issues going on
with your environment

247
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,120
and things you need to know about.

248
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:28,893
So we wanna keep you informed.

249
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,890
Health is this through different channels?

250
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,460
So I think everyone is most
familiar with first interacting

251
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,340
with health by receiving emails,

252
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,170
but the same information is also

253
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,390
provided through the WS Health dashboard

254
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,800
and through programmatic means.

255
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,040
So the AWS Health API
and Amazon EventBridge

256
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,377
and your default bus in your accounts.

257
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:52,590
And it's these programmatic
means that we really use

258
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,843
to drive change in your environments.

259
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,293
So what kind of information
does AWS Health communicate?

260
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,150
Health events fall into
three primary categories,

261
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,640
operational issues, count notifications,

262
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,693
schedule changes.

263
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,880
Operational issues.

264
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,580
These are unexpected
events in your environment

265
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,987
or unexpected events in AWS

266
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:18,990
and we want to communicate
to you about single instance

267
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,590
failures could be an EC2
instance or an EBS volume,

268
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,800
but these can actually range
up to control plane events

269
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,660
with the API for that
service that you're using.

270
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,890
So we wanna let you know what's going on

271
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,720
that AWS is addressing it

272
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,730
and help you make determinations about,

273
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,805
is this me or is this you?

274
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:36,540
Account notifications.

275
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,030
These are general events related

276
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,788
to the administration
security of your accounts.

277
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:45,960
So security issues, you
might be be very interested

278
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,130
to action them quickly, but
there are general events about

279
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,740
feature availability for
the services you use.

280
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,750
For instance, introducing
that there's another version

281
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,150
of an SDK available for
you without necessarily

282
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,490
deprecating the original version.

283
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,040
But schedule changes is
where I want to focus today

284
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,540
because schedule changes
are resource specific.

285
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,920
So meaning there's a specific
resource in your accounts

286
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,240
that you're using, like a database,

287
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,345
a cluster, some instance.

288
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:18,570
And there's a change coming
for it on the specific date

289
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,270
and we wanna make you aware of it.

290
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,550
Within schedule changes,

291
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,490
there's a subset specific
event type called planned

292
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,403
lifecycle events that were
introduced two years ago.

293
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:34,348
Planned lifecycle events
are specifically designed

294
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:37,890
for addressing the challenges
of making lifecycle event,

295
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,213
sorry, lifecycle event
management, frictionless at scale.

296
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,320
They're directly intended
to be used programmatically

297
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,180
and these factor heavily
into the solutions

298
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,130
that we talk about.

299
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,700
So the couple features we want

300
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,333
to talk specifically about are

301
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,540
these are things that
health built based on direct

302
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,743
feedback from you.

303
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,170
You wanted a better way

304
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:08,370
to pull Health event data
into tools that you use.

305
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,320
You receive email notifications,

306
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,670
but you're looking for a better way

307
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,160
to do this than parsing
that event message.

308
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,470
So we're also providing the information in

309
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,900
that event in structured
metadata that you can better use

310
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,600
to match into the payloads
for APIs you're gonna call.

311
00:15:25,353 --> 00:15:28,610
Every event we're giving you the, sorry,

312
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:33,417
each of these events have
a resource specificity

313
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,430
and we're giving you these events

314
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,790
with the full Amazon resource name ARN of

315
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,870
the resources involved.

316
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,510
So to make it easy to
understand which account

317
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,480
these live in, which region,
what's the specific idea

318
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,280
of the resource in the service fund.

319
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,510
Along with resource specificity,

320
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,880
we're providing dynamic burndown.

321
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,288
So that means for each
resource you receive a status,

322
00:15:57,288 --> 00:16:00,360
whether that is pending
your action or resolved,

323
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,220
and you can understand
how much work you've done,

324
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,520
how much is left to do
within your environment

325
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,190
and you wanna make these events fit

326
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,750
into your planning cycles.

327
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,540
So when do your teams normally work?

328
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,290
Can they balance their priorities
with delivering features

329
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,600
to your business with the
maintenance work that they need

330
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,463
to do to maintain their operations?

331
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:25,860
And along with those
timelines, you want to be able

332
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,810
to maintain visibility of these events

333
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,880
through their entire lifecycle.

334
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,300
So Farzin mentioned that

335
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,160
you're receiving notification
in advance from the services

336
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,980
you use about when these
lifecycle events are happening,

337
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,227
but for instance, for extended
support, you might have one,

338
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:44,468
two, or three years of
extended support occurring

339
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:46,200
after the change date.

340
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,210
And you wanna maintain
visibility of what the status

341
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,190
of those resources in your environment so

342
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,040
that you can continue to action them.

343
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,220
And to give you a lifecycle
of a planned lifecycle event,

344
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,020
this all starts with setting a date.

345
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,903
So for instance, RDS planned
lifecycle events for Aurora.

346
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,860
The service team gives you five years

347
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,200
of standard support from
the launch of that service.

348
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,150
So we know when the lifecycle events

349
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,700
going to occur into the future.

350
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,930
They begin planning

351
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,630
to send you a reminder about
this one year in advance.

352
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,840
So they begin working to get the list

353
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,832
of resources in your accounts
in scope for this change

354
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:32,103
and push them to the
Health Burndown service.

355
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,510
The burndown service is tracking whether

356
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,957
that resource is pending your
action or it's been resolved

357
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:43,495
and then it pushes
updates to your accounts.

358
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,500
And this process occurs daily.

359
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,310
So when you action a resource,
the generates a new list,

360
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,010
pushes it to burndown, you get an updated,

361
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,980
you get an updated list for
what's been resolved recently

362
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,530
and you can better act, you
can better tell the current

363
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,930
state of these resources
in your environments.

364
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,213
And this continues until the change date.

365
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,563
So on the change date,

366
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,680
this is when this particular change will

367
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,700
begin to affect your environment.

368
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,120
So whether that's an operational
upgrade that that you take

369
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,810
or if it's that extended
support is enabled

370
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,510
or it could be a security change.

371
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,000
If you remember the RDS
certificate rotation

372
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,450
that occurred last year, there's
different types of events

373
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,180
that are not specific to extended support

374
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,240
and there are things that
we need you to know about

375
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,153
and be able to handle on
a regular ongoing basis.

376
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,230
So how do you use planned lifecycle events

377
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,560
to improve the processes
and experience that you have

378
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,643
with these resources?

379
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,390
I like to frame this conversation with

380
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:51,870
the AWS Health maturity model.

381
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,000
The health team developed
the maturity model

382
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,820
to represent the different
stages that you go

383
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,980
through in your journey
towards health's vision

384
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,780
for a frictionless experience,

385
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,530
managing lifecycle events at scale.

386
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,913
So we all start with manual processes,

387
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,775
but we wanna build into
automations that allow you

388
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:14,775
to automatically ingest this
data to assign responsibility

389
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,540
for it and ultimately work
towards making it easier

390
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,720
for your teams to action these
events in the first place.

391
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,320
So let's start at the beginning.

392
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,444
So in the reactive stage,

393
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:29,580
you're receiving
information from AWS Health

394
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,950
through the health dashboard as emails.

395
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,840
If you've configured chat
channel notifications

396
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,113
through Slack or Microsoft Teams.

397
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:40,110
These are human readable
notifications, they're good

398
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,403
for point in time awareness.

399
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:45,000
And when you're in small environments,

400
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,610
this is a good way to keep informed.

401
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,733
So as these teams send you events,

402
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,060
you receive emails

403
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,800
and emails like this one.

404
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,387
So this one's telling you
about Aurora Postgres 13

405
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:03,600
end of standard support.

406
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,200
So is everybody getting
these emails? Yeah.

407
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,570
Are you receiving a lot of these emails?

408
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,710
Okay, so that is what
we're here to talk about.

409
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,960
It's moving away from emails
as the primary mechanism

410
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,643
for managing lifecycle events.

411
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,560
This email represents a
lot of information though,

412
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,530
and it's what service does is effect,

413
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,810
what's the version being deprecated,

414
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,300
what's the related change I need to do?

415
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,530
What date does this occur on?

416
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,320
And in specific, if this is
far into the future, you know,

417
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,050
how am I tracking when I
need to follow up on this?

418
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,370
Where can I find the list of affected

419
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,433
resources so I can start
working through it?

420
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,190
So in the small environments
that Farzin was mentioning,

421
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,840
you might have a small, small team

422
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,900
or even single developers within accounts

423
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,350
and you know all the resources
used by your applications.

424
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,150
So this is manageable.

425
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,150
But as you grow and you have more teams

426
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,840
and more resources under their
management, you need to start

427
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,630
to have processes to track these

428
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,050
and reduce the risk of
missing one of those emails.

429
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,903
Because, I think from the
nods I saw in the audience,

430
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,920
you get, there's a volume,
there's a challenge

431
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,620
with the volume of the number
of emails you're getting.

432
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,990
And you don't want to be in this position

433
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,160
where you've missed a critical change

434
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,790
for just the other volume
of messages you're getting.

435
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,173
So as you grow more teams, like I said,

436
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,650
now you might be in a
model where you have SREs

437
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,360
or central teams that are responsible

438
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,550
for tracking these events.

439
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,190
And while they don't own the resources,

440
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,650
they own responsibility for making sure

441
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,530
that your teams action
them on a regular basis

442
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,930
and before the change dates.

443
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,660
So they're still receiving

444
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,400
these human readable notifications.

445
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,583
But you want to start using
a programmatic approach.

446
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,410
And this is the first
thing that we focused on

447
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,990
with our large enterprise customers.

448
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,600
The scale of whom are using not just tens

449
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,610
or hundreds of accounts,
but thousands of accounts,

450
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,160
potentially hundreds of
thousands of resources

451
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,013
and need scalable mechanisms
to approach these.

452
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,570
So you're receiving events

453
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,840
and you want to use these
with your operational tools,

454
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,330
your ITSM tools, risk management tools,

455
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,860
but you need to do this

456
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,743
through a different channel than email.

457
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,970
So I just showed you the email
version of a health event,

458
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,450
but this is that same
event received as event

459
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,010
as an EventBridge message.

460
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,183
It's in JSON format.

461
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:50,970
The human readable message
still appears in this event,

462
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,430
but the content of this message

463
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,740
and the salient details are
pulled out into individual key

464
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,860
value pairs that you can
use with your tooling.

465
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,410
You can use them to form
the payload of a message

466
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,750
that you're gonna send
to the APIs of your tools

467
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,900
to create events in those,
to track these resources

468
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,660
and manage them, and manage
them much better scale.

469
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,360
So I wanna highlight a few things.

470
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,160
These events have many
common fields between

471
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,960
a standard health event and
a planned lifecycle event.

472
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,530
But the first thing I
want you to notice is

473
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,540
within scheduled changes
I talked about there being

474
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,170
this event type of
planned lifecycle events.

475
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,450
The first thing you need
to do is filter down

476
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,148
to just these events

477
00:23:32,148 --> 00:23:34,620
because you're going to be taking these

478
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,060
into your operational tooling.

479
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,430
And we're not trying to
recreate the the scale

480
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,280
and volume issue you have with email.

481
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,413
A lot of people suffer
from notification fatigue.

482
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:46,830
The whole point of this
is to make things clear

483
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,710
to say central teams to
have a good visibility

484
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,347
of just the list of top level changes

485
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:56,419
and individual DevOps engineers to be able

486
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:58,983
to understand their
particular responsibilities.

487
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,570
And the first thing you're going to do

488
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,060
is understand there is a top
level change in this case

489
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,063
for Amazon Aurora Postgres
13 end of standard support.

490
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,750
And this is reflected across
all the health events you

491
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,380
receive across all the regions
and accounts that you use.

492
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,540
So you can understand
there's one top level change

493
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,990
with potentially many
resources associated to it.

494
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,760
This this event is
occurring in the future,

495
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,670
it's upcoming, it'll will
apply to your accounts

496
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,510
on the start date.

497
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,080
So in this case 28th of February, 2026,

498
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,870
extended support will
begin on your remaining

499
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,700
resources you haven't actioned.

500
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,210
So use this as the due date

501
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,020
for the change across your creating.

502
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,040
And like I mentioned,
resource specificity.

503
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,937
So in this case we're
providing you the resource ARNs

504
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,940
also the status and the update time.

505
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,841
So when we last noticed a change

506
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:00,323
with this moving from pending to resolved.

507
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:07,130
So, pardon me, we're gonna
share some links about,

508
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,860
share some links at the end
about solutions you can use

509
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,903
to actually just start
calling those APIs like

510
00:25:12,903 --> 00:25:17,903
for common tools at the end
of this end of this session.

511
00:25:23,225 --> 00:25:24,060
Alright, so using that health event,

512
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,370
you've called the API
for one of your tools.

513
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,830
You've recorded this as a change

514
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,860
and you're looping through
that list of resources

515
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,930
to create subtasks for that change.

516
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:38,280
So this provides you one top
level visibility of the list

517
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,990
of changes that are
affecting your environment.

518
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,420
But that can be a concise list.

519
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,560
You maintain per resource
visibility for the status of each

520
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,953
and the amount of work that's
needed in your environment.

521
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:54,990
So you still have a manual
action in this case though,

522
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,300
which is you need to assign those tasks,

523
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
the different teams in your environment.

524
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,660
You have reduced the
risk of missing an event

525
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,890
and you've reduced the
amount of work you need

526
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,270
to report on these in your environment

527
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,650
because you're
automatically ingesting this

528
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,900
information, the tools you use.

529
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,170
So you don't have a different dashboard

530
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,653
or different tool you have to
use to manage these things.

531
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,770
But as you're growing again right

532
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,270
now you're tracking these changes

533
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,790
and as you grow further it
becomes necessary address

534
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,010
that second part that I talked about,

535
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,133
which is per resource
ownership and accountability.

536
00:26:34,737 --> 00:26:36,543
So in the secondary, pardon me,

537
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:50,460
in the second area, you
wanna pull in information,

538
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,370
excuse me, you wanna
pull in information about

539
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,420
who owns these resources and
who can take action on them

540
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:02,010
and begin the automatic
assignment of those, pardon me,

541
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:05,010
of those change tasks to those
teams to allow 'em to action.

542
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:10,590
So my experience here
the last year working

543
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,160
with customers is that
everyone has different

544
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,430
metadata they're pulling in
from their own environments.

545
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,110
A lot of you'll have a
change management database

546
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,410
that's kind of give you a good
view of your organization.

547
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,723
It might be down to per
resource specificity.

548
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,670
But even if you don't
track things as granularly,

549
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,509
as individual resources, most often

550
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:35,430
one account will have specific contacts

551
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,250
or you'll have specific
contacts for an application.

552
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,270
And maybe that ties back

553
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,373
to financial ownership cost centers.

554
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,840
You also see many
customers put standardized

555
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,010
tagging practices in place.

556
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,230
So there's usually a wealth of information

557
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,580
about a specific resource

558
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,400
that you can get just from
looking at those tags.

559
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,040
And again, we'll have some
samples later about pulling in

560
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,740
that tag information into these processes.

561
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,180
But this is an easy way to identify

562
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,413
and link these things to
their respective owners.

563
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,490
Alright, so now you know who's responsible

564
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,290
for these resources, you're able

565
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,300
to automatically assign them

566
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,660
and get the right people,
right people or teams,

567
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,850
the visibility that you have,

568
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,000
but to their specific resources only.

569
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,180
So you're reducing the
noise that they experience

570
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,000
and keeping things focused on
just what they need to action

571
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,780
and giving them ample
warning in advance allows 'em

572
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,850
to fit these things into their planning

573
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,910
normal flow of work
avoids urgent interrupts

574
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,260
and the operational impacts

575
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,690
that can occur if they miss these events.

576
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,020
And really this is where
we see the resolution rate

577
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,100
for customers employee solutions
is take a hockey stick turn

578
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,310
so they get a better experience

579
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,002
working through these events.

580
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:57,720
You see them action these events earlier

581
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,120
and faster and you see
a return in investment

582
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,020
for the time you put in to
implement a solution like this.

583
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,800
So I mentioned in our
most mature environment,

584
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,510
what we're really trying
to do is make it easier

585
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,520
for those teams to action
the events in the first place

586
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,710
action their particular resources.

587
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:21,710
So we see teams building
workflows off of these systems.

588
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,300
So for instance, you might
have standard deployment

589
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,860
practices in your environment.

590
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,960
You want to automatically bring those in

591
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,540
and give teams directions
about what they need

592
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,373
to do to action that event.

593
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,080
You probably all use
infrastructure's code to a degree

594
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,430
to a large degree.

595
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,550
So you might actually be
suggesting a poll request

596
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,990
to that team just directly against

597
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,700
one of their repositories.

598
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,040
That immediately lets them
understand here's the change

599
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,640
that needs to be made and
start integration testing.

600
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,510
We also see teams take
steps with gen AI triage.

601
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,820
So they're not just ingesting these events

602
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,710
and assign that teams, but
they're also deciding the

603
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,080
priority in which they need
to be actioned based on other

604
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,550
criteria within their environments.

605
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,927
Like are these tier zero
applications for you?

606
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,570
Do you have other priorities

607
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,450
for those teams based on
cycles you already know.

608
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,520
So all of this is to
make it easier for you

609
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,950
to action these events you just assigned.

610
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,379
And with an aspirational
goal of fully automating

611
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:21,060
this process, the governance, excuse me,

612
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,290
governance policies happening

613
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,840
automatically at the same time.

614
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:28,680
I want to give you a a
concrete example of what one

615
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,340
of our customers that we've
worked with has done this year.

616
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,460
So the BMW group, they're
headquartered in Munich, Germany.

617
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,780
They have 159,000 employees
across 30 facilities in

618
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,280
15 different countries.

619
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,400
They manage 10,000 AWS accounts

620
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,560
and these support the
premium digital services

621
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,750
and their connected fleet of automobiles

622
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,093
of 23 million automobiles worldwide.

623
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,950
And they share similar goals to you.

624
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,280
So they wanna maintain
visibility of their environment,

625
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,230
they want to automate processes,

626
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,847
but in their words,

627
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:06,180
the technical lifecycle
management team at BMW, they want

628
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,033
to distill what gets pushed
down to their organization.

629
00:31:09,895 --> 00:31:13,317
They want to delegate
responsibility for the resources

630
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:15,719
and scope to specific SREs

631
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:18,540
and give them the
flexibility with guardrails

632
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,030
to do these things on
their own timetables.

633
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,559
And most importantly, TLM wants to do this

634
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,800
by keeping noise as low as
possible for as long as possible

635
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,530
and avoid over escalating to these teams

636
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,173
and causing kind of churn for them.

637
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,750
So this is a complete architecture

638
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,520
for health in their environment.

639
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,110
It's not just planned lifecycle events.

640
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,981
I wanna walk you through specific
sections demonstrating the

641
00:31:45,981 --> 00:31:50,550
ingestion, the automated
assignment that we talked about.

642
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:53,190
So it all starts with a process

643
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,470
to pull the health API on a daily basis

644
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,623
and pull in new events and
updates to existing events.

645
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,390
They take that data just like
I showed you in the example,

646
00:32:03,265 --> 00:32:05,200
feed it into an S3 bucket

647
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,603
and begin to power
processes based on that.

648
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,650
So they're taking a step with AWS glue

649
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,360
to merge data from their cloud data hub.

650
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,890
That's the mapping of the
resources to the teams

651
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,640
that own them and where they
live in their environment.

652
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:31,590
They'll take a process to
then put a Jira issue onto the

653
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,510
boards for those teams

654
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,880
and link them with an overarching legend.

655
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,140
So that's their link from the level change

656
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,340
to the individual actions
required by teams.

657
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:46,380
And you're thinking about the,
let's say the six month life,

658
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,110
six month notice in the lifecycle here.

659
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,230
They're allowing those teams
to work through these within

660
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:56,463
that period until they
have some guardrails.

661
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:02,526
So they're also using the same data

662
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:04,950
to power BI reporting.

663
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,710
So they've provided QuickSight dashboards

664
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,520
that have role level
security, meaning that myself

665
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,220
as an engineer, I only
see the resources in scope

666
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,623
for my team, nobody else's.

667
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:22,140
The TLM team also uses
that as a fail safe.

668
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,533
So within that period of say six months,

669
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,640
if those teams haven't actioned
the items with four weeks

670
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,800
to go in one of these
events, they begin escalating

671
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,040
to them through ServiceNow.

672
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:49,395
This process results in a
significantly improved experience

673
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:50,553
for their teams.

674
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,700
I actually do want to
call out here that again,

675
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,380
there's more things on this slide

676
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,843
than just plain lifecycle events.

677
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,080
They're also interested
in those issue category

678
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,160
events I talked about earlier.

679
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,990
So it means the ongoing things

680
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:06,840
or near real time events
they might be receiving

681
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,490
and they want to avoid delays from

682
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:13,634
the once a day polling they're
doing for the health API.

683
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:17,370
So integrating with EventBridge,
they get push notifications

684
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,470
of these events and they can use these

685
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:22,950
to drive automated workflows,
make their teams aware

686
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:25,353
of operational issues
with ServiceNow as well.

687
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:32,250
So BMW wants these flows routing to work

688
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,693
as seamlessly as possible.

689
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,850
And based directly on their feedback

690
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,250
and the feedback from similar customers,

691
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,483
we've launched AWS health
labels just this past week.

692
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,810
So this is available
for all customers now,

693
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:53,100
but you can filter health events
based on whether they are,

694
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,550
whether label is actionable,
whether based on their persona,

695
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,370
route them to the right
recipients for your organization

696
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,563
for operations, security and billing.

697
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,180
So if you were looking at the schema

698
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,990
or the example event I sent
earlier, right at the bottom,

699
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,521
the new metadata already
appears on those events

700
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:14,910
and for plain lifecycle events,

701
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,492
those are marked action required

702
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:18,843
and with your operations
team as the persona.

703
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,570
But I wanna get back to what BMW

704
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,220
achieves with their architecture.

705
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,126
So first, by building plane
lifecycle event management into

706
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:31,589
their processes and planning

707
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:35,370
this architecture enables
the BMW team to perform most

708
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:40,080
of their upgrades on
meaning in the last several

709
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,610
months, they've shrunk the portion

710
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:45,300
of their resources on
extended support to only 4%

711
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,840
of their RDS and 2% of their EKS fleets

712
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,913
resulting in a significant cost savings.

713
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,960
They've reduced the operational
issues from missed events.

714
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,600
So where the developer wasn't
aware, they took an upgrade,

715
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,500
they weren't expecting and
they've improved developer

716
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,753
satisfaction with a system
that respects their autonomy

717
00:36:04,753 --> 00:36:06,453
but also holds them accountable.

718
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,110
And in all this while
reducing the overhead

719
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,713
for the technical lifecycle
management team by 90%.

720
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,080
So I've shown you a lot

721
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,630
and if you're thinking this is great,

722
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,170
but my team doesn't have the resources

723
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,970
or time to implement this right now,

724
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,843
I want to ask you to
strongly reconsider that.

725
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,160
The teams that we work
with spend about two weeks

726
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,600
of a developer's time getting familiar

727
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,100
with the pattern that they need to deploy

728
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,820
and getting a foundational
architecture out there that

729
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,773
immediately gives them a benefit.

730
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,810
So one catches the events that you,

731
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,460
it didn't necessarily have awareness of.

732
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,460
You might know that that EKS
or RDS cadence is occurring,

733
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:03,272
but those off cycle events
are things that are unique.

734
00:37:03,272 --> 00:37:05,610
You capture those as well

735
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:09,150
and directly if you are already
paying for extended support,

736
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,280
this investment pays you back.

737
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,190
So if you're thinking you don't have time

738
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,290
to make this happen,
this is where I'd like

739
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,740
to turn the mic over to Gian
to talk about how ServiceNow

740
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,540
is working to enable the vision

741
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,853
of effortless lifecycle management scale.

742
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,840
- Awesome, thank you, Andrew.

743
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,813
You can take that actually, I'll use mine.

744
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,500
So here we go.

745
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,180
We are at the final part
of this presentation.

746
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,530
You're very likely getting ready

747
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,010
to celebrate a little bit
more with the upcoming parties

748
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,960
and all partner events,

749
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,030
but this is gonna be, it might be

750
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,640
the most important session
from a point of view

751
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,380
of connecting everything

752
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,930
that we said about the great innovations

753
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,500
for AWS Health into your
existing businesses.

754
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,730
So how do we take all the
technical parts innovations

755
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,440
that we have seen

756
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,160
and we get them to have
a bigger context on

757
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,023
how they impact the business?

758
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,760
There are a few things that
I would like to mention

759
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,430
and I'm gonna switch screens right now.

760
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,970
First things first, please do acknowledge

761
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,409
that we have a safe harbor
Notice today we're gonna

762
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:27,420
actually, as a matter of fact,
announce a new collaboration

763
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,970
with AWS and this is a new integration.

764
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,530
You're the very first customers

765
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:34,410
to learn about this integration.

766
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,550
And before we go

767
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,129
and see a little bit more about it,

768
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:42,540
who has ever heard of ServiceNow?

769
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,635
I wanna see a few hands up there, right?

770
00:38:45,635 --> 00:38:50,253
And who is currently actively
using ServiceNow? Awesome.

771
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,280
Good few of you. Who wants
to go to the parties?

772
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,150
No, I'm kidding.

773
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:59,150
So ServiceNow is as a matter
of fact, a unique platform

774
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,060
because it's, you can think
about it as the control tower

775
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,973
of your AI and software.

776
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,630
As a matter of fact, you
can see that we integrate

777
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,510
with any cloud, not only AWS,

778
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:15,750
although we know that especially
when this event is your

779
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,310
favorite cloud, isn't it?

780
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,370
We also integrate with all of your systems

781
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,770
'cause we wanna make sure
that you know exactly

782
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:26,650
what is your IT estate looking
like at any point in time

783
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:32,130
and we merge all this data
with your business level

784
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,040
of data, which means

785
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,130
how do you then associate
each single resource

786
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,793
to your business applications
to your business processes.

787
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,630
Now this is just to give a
little bit more context on why

788
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,950
ServiceNow is relevant.

789
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,990
Because to Andrews

790
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,710
and Farzin point,
customers are willing now

791
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,710
to have huge deployments
of AWS and beyond at scale.

792
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,477
And we have seen that
there are different ways

793
00:40:01,477 --> 00:40:04,440
in which you could already as of today

794
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,910
integrate your AWS Health with ServiceNow

795
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,830
and essentially get the
value of the platform,

796
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,420
which is just one thing.

797
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,000
If there's one thing you
need to remember out of

798
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,650
today's session is the context
that ServiceNow gives you.

799
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,190
Not only about AWS and your deployment,

800
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,160
but about every single IT

801
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,990
deployment that you currently have.

802
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,150
This is just the as-is status.

803
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:33,251
And we've been talking to
many customers such as BMW

804
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:36,630
that really want to have, they want

805
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:40,620
to capture these lifecycle
events at scale so

806
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,980
that they can have broader
context on top of them

807
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,963
and they can manage
them a little bit better

808
00:40:45,963 --> 00:40:50,760
with change management
and with business context.

809
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,460
The use cases are the usual ones, the ones

810
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,570
that we have heard from BMW
as an example, which means

811
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:01,110
how do you get to establish
concrete ownership

812
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:05,580
or even a business cost
center that is associated

813
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:10,230
with your impacted resource
or even operational issues.

814
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,946
We have cost optimization

815
00:41:11,946 --> 00:41:15,607
or even more simply I
would say cloud governance.

816
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,400
Cloud governance is definitely one

817
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,290
of the biggest use cases here.

818
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,570
Now these are some of the
reasons why customers are already

819
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,050
doing this manual
integrations with ServiceNow.

820
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,415
But this is not only it.

821
00:41:26,415 --> 00:41:31,415
As a matter of fact, we are
very happy to introduce you

822
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,222
to one of the newest innovations
we're planning to introduce

823
00:41:34,222 --> 00:41:36,420
as of next year.

824
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,118
And we've been working really
hard with AWS to listen to all

825
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:42,240
of you and all of our
customers that have been asking

826
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,970
for an out-of-the-box integration,

827
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:49,623
which is the new AWS Health
and ServiceNow integration.

828
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,530
This is the paramount step

829
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,980
because we are partnering in
order to essentially allow you

830
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:00,330
to ingest those events,
those lifecycle events,

831
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:03,690
specifically the scheduled changes

832
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:07,950
and the account notifications
into the ServiceNow platform

833
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,110
directly, automatically.

834
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:14,310
Which means for each one of those changes,

835
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:19,046
you'll automatically get
the blast radius impact

836
00:42:19,046 --> 00:42:22,590
and you'll be able to see
not only for each account,

837
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,980
but also how many resources are impacted,

838
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,770
how many application
services are impacted,

839
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:32,130
and eventually how many business
applications are impacted.

840
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,720
You'll get all of that plus
proactive notifications to

841
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,930
who really needs to take
care of those changes.

842
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:44,610
And don't worry if this
doesn't look as clear yet

843
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,010
'cause I'm gonna show you a demo.

844
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,680
Now, another part that you need

845
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,300
to keep in mind is ServiceNow

846
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,170
we've always partnered with
customers that are deploying

847
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:57,060
this technology at scale.

848
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:02,060
So you're deploying essentially
zero touch changes at scale.

849
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,130
And I'm now gonna switch screens

850
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,573
so I can show you a demo.

851
00:43:08,775 --> 00:43:12,480
So let's imagine that
for a moment we are still

852
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,880
in the AWS Health dashboard.

853
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,800
Who is familiar with this
dashboard, by the way,

854
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,610
the AWS Health Dashboard, right?

855
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:23,010
This is just your regular interface

856
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,370
where you can clearly see
all the upcoming changes

857
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,010
or I would say lifecycle events.

858
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,590
You can see all the different categories

859
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,510
and information about each one of them.

860
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,890
Let's say that we focus on one

861
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,210
of the Lambda Planned
lifecycle events here

862
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:39,930
at the very bottom.

863
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,300
Of course you'll get all the details

864
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,242
that Andrew was showing you
earlier on, on the context

865
00:43:46,242 --> 00:43:49,714
from an AWS point of
view on the ownership of

866
00:43:49,714 --> 00:43:52,860
that Lambda function, et cetera.

867
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,980
But let's say that you want
to get more, you want to know

868
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,470
how many application services
are gonna be impacted.

869
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,509
How is my business
potentially been impacted

870
00:44:01,509 --> 00:44:04,320
by this upcoming change?

871
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,320
And how do you automate
your change requests

872
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,000
and change tasks?

873
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,740
So you effectively do not
need to manually create them.

874
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,460
And that is exactly why we
already have, by the way,

875
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,310
a product that is very useful for all

876
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,560
of your cloud governance use cases.

877
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,290
Not only the events lifecycle use cases,

878
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,750
which is cloud workspace.

879
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,990
This is a one single pane of glass

880
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:34,920
where you can see everything
about your cloud resources the

881
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,940
way that they are divided
between on-prem and in the cloud.

882
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,250
And also you can see just
everything that you need

883
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,830
to care about your cloud
deployments, such as

884
00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:49,890
a clear breakdown of all
of your cloud accounts,

885
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:54,600
but not only with the
traditional details about costs,

886
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,460
about ownership,

887
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,080
but multiple levels of
ownership, multiple associations

888
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,470
to your business, let's say cost center

889
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,410
or business applications
and service mapping,

890
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:11,100
which means you know exactly
how each account is related

891
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,100
to each other part of your business.

892
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,470
Now let's say that we want to dig deeper

893
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:21,470
and we are impersonating, in
this case a specific owner

894
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,340
of the Center of Excellence,

895
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,780
of the Cloud Center of Excellence.

896
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,670
Let's say that you want to
know a little bit more about

897
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,560
everything else that is happening

898
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,223
to your specific environments.

899
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,400
This integration that we
are just announcing will

900
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,420
essentially connect to
your AWS Health dashboard

901
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,210
and essentially capture
all the different upcoming

902
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,240
notifications and schedule changes

903
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,800
and bring them into ServiceNow

904
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,300
so you know exactly what's happening

905
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,960
to the different cloud
environments that you are managing.

906
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,260
And you'll get also a clear breakdown of

907
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,410
how these changes are
effectively impacting your

908
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,180
different resources.

909
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,840
Specifically you can see here
you'll also see a breakdown

910
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,000
of the different resources

911
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,430
that are primarily impacted by them.

912
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,550
And you can of course
dig a little bit deeper

913
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:18,360
inside each one of these
categories, such as of course,

914
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,860
the Lambda function.

915
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,230
And in this case you'll see that

916
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:26,820
that very same lambda
function, planned change

917
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,350
or planned lifecycle event

918
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,693
is effectively already captured in here.

919
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,460
Now of course, ServiceNow is
not only gonna have the context

920
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,180
that is already coming from
AWS, it will offer you more.

921
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,790
As a matter of fact, you'll
have all the different affected

922
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,400
accounts that are being
brought to ServiceNow

923
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,620
with the ServiceNow context.

924
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,880
You'll have ownership of
whoever needs to act on this

925
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,200
because you already have
an automated change request

926
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,060
that is being being created

927
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,656
as being already created for you.

928
00:46:59,656 --> 00:47:02,548
Now the change request contains
all the different details

929
00:47:02,548 --> 00:47:04,500
that you need to care about.

930
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,760
Specifically we can see that
there is already someone

931
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,000
that has been assigned
to that change request

932
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,130
so that they can act on it.

933
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,920
You have a different priority information,

934
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,030
you have the service context
so you know exactly which

935
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:23,820
of your services could be impacted by it

936
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,660
and more specifically all the
different details have also

937
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:32,430
been pulled directly AWS into this change.

938
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:35,490
You'll also see all the
different resources impacted by

939
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:39,689
that very same change
beyond that Lambda function,

940
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:43,560
as I said, the services that
will be impacted by them.

941
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,450
And most importantly,

942
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:48,270
you'll have all these
different change tasks

943
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:50,990
that will be created
for each single account

944
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,190
that is impacted by it.

945
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:56,460
So you don't need to do any
manual tasks any longer.

946
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,910
Everything is already pre-made for you.

947
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,775
Now the cloud leader will want to know

948
00:48:02,775 --> 00:48:07,230
how these change tasks are processed

949
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:10,800
and you'll be able to decide
who needs to act on them,

950
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,610
who's the owner, but not
only a single specific user,

951
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:17,910
but rather also a bigger user group

952
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,719
that will be assigned to them.

953
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:22,320
And they will of course
get all the details

954
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,939
that we already talked about

955
00:48:23,939 --> 00:48:28,939
and also about the effective
CIs record, record history,

956
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,490
but more importantly, this is the view

957
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,770
that you need to keep in mind.

958
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:35,880
This is where everything

959
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,280
that we talked about comes together,

960
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,342
where all your technology infrastructure

961
00:48:41,342 --> 00:48:44,520
is being connected meaningfully to see

962
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,474
how each single component is
effectively impacting your

963
00:48:47,474 --> 00:48:52,470
services and beyond your
business applications.

964
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:56,070
Which means you're finally
identifying the bridge

965
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,050
between your ideal world,

966
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:02,550
where you have your business
enterprise architecture designs

967
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:06,333
and your real as-is it infrastructure.

968
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,330
Now, that was a quick demo for you,

969
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:13,320
but I will kindly ask you if
you are interested to know more

970
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,110
and specifically to partner with us

971
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:20,550
to work on these innovations,
please do scan the QR code.

972
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,830
We're absolutely very happy
to collaborate with you

973
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:26,130
and if you want to stop
over just for a few seconds

974
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,650
after this presentation, we'll stay here

975
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,650
so we can get any of your questions.

976
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,830
And that was my part, so
I'm gonna hand it back over

977
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:35,883
to you folks.

978
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:39,680
- Yeah, thanks, everyone.

979
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,070
So we are going to take
some questions off the stage

980
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,770
if any questions, if you
have any questions for us.

981
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:49,680
But for 2026 AWS Health's vision is

982
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,380
to continue focus on improving

983
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:56,130
or enhancing the ways you can
integrate with your tools,

984
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:59,133
bring in some AI features
in the next year,

985
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:03,940
but also we have some
ready to use solutions

986
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,530
that, yeah, you can, if
you follow this link,

987
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,810
it will take you to a place
where you can actually access

988
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,980
some ready to use solutions.

989
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,980
So I encourage you to take
some time and captured this,

990
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,380
but we will also have a booth at the AWS

991
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,543
in the expo support.

992
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,930
I don't see anyone taking
any screens anymore,

993
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,430
so I'm gonna move on to this.

994
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:33,720
So meet us at the AWS
support booth at the expo.

995
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,040
Here's how you can find us there.

996
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,680
And here's also some
other support products

997
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,403
and you can take you to the
other features of AWS support.

998
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,850
With that, thanks, everyone,

999
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:47,460
and I hope you enjoy
the rest of re:Invent.

1000
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,583
- [Andrew] Yeah, thanks.
- [Gian] Awesome, thanks, all.
