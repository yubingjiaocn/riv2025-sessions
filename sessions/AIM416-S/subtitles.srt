1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,870
- Good evening all, Srini Seshadri,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,520
global head of Financial
Services for HCL Tech

3
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:09,120
AWS has been a great partner for us

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,933
and we've just recently
signed an FS-specific SCA.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,000
We've also partnered with
Commonwealth Bank of Australia

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,060
for the last almost two decades

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,270
and we are extremely thrilled
to have Terri Sutherland,

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,890
who's the general manager for
data platforms and operations.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,090
She oversaw what is probably
the largest data migration

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,550
in the southern hemisphere,
and we look forward

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,330
to hearing insights from her
on this pathbreaking platform,

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,570
as well as other insights
on data modernization.

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,553
Once again, Terri Sutherland, please.

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,780
- Thank you, Srini. Hello, everyone.

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,880
I'm Terri Sutherland, general manager

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,590
of the Enterprise Data Platforms

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,630
at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia,

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,250
and I'm super excited to be here

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,350
with you today to talk about

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,260
our enterprise data platform modernization

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,930
and our strategic partnership with HCL

22
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,590
and how we achieve the
largest and fastest migration

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,480
in the southern hemisphere.

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,480
But first, let me tell
you about the bank itself.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,340
Though many of you may never have heard

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,940
of the Commonwealth Bank
of Australia, or CBA,

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,193
as we call it, we are
Australia's largest bank.

28
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,540
Australia's population is 27 million,

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,680
and today, CBA services
17.5 million customers,

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,870
which means one in three Australians

31
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,023
and one in four businesses bank with us.

32
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,750
Overall, 50% of Australia's
transactions go through CBA.

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,280
And on the global stage,

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,373
we are the 13th largest
bank by market value.

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,100
And I'm very excited to say

36
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,040
that we've just been named
the top four bank globally

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,423
for AI maturity.

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,360
I'd like to talk to you to you briefly

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,070
about our data strategy

40
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,823
and then how the data platform
modernization fits in.

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,750
At the heart of our transformation,
are three core pillars:

42
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,290
people, safeguards, and technology.

43
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,090
On people, we recognize

44
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,420
that a centralized data
team couldn't keep pace

45
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,480
with our business demand to scale on AI.

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,310
So we embedded data engineers

47
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,880
and data scientists directly
into the lines of business,

48
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,850
bringing data closer to
the people who use it

49
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,763
and closer to the people
we serve, our customers.

50
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,870
As a bank, safeguards are non-negotiable,

51
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,930
so we embedded governance
and risk controls

52
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,040
at every stage of the
data in AI lifecycle,

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,830
ensuring safety by design.

54
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,430
And lastly on technology,
we needed to connect decades

55
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,700
of rich data spread across hundreds

56
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,700
of source systems to empower
our federated data teams

57
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,153
on the latest tooling.

58
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,470
To achieve this, we established
a data mesh ecosystem

59
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,670
on AWS cloud that empowers
our federated teams

60
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,150
to operate independently, move data,

61
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,310
and use data seamlessly,

62
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,313
all the while, enforcing
strict governance.

63
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,980
We call this ecosystem CommBank.data.

64
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,920
Today, it empowers 40 lines of business,

65
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,460
the freedom to produce
and use data as needed

66
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,953
within a trusted and controlled framework.

67
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,920
To enable this, we decentralized

68
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,910
and adopted a clear
producer-consumer model.

69
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,030
Each business unit now builds, owns,

70
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,580
and manages its data as a product

71
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,000
with defined roles and responsibilities.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,970
We've also introduced
self-service data sharing

73
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,650
through a unified data
marketplace, a single pane of glass

74
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,960
where users can discover, request,

75
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,893
and consume data across
the entire AWS ecosystem.

76
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,480
However, that said, data has gravity

77
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,630
and where the data lives is
where every data scientist

78
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,030
and data engineer in the bank will work.

79
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,000
Historically, CBA held years

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,240
of rich data held in on-premise platforms

81
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,843
that lacked interoperability
and could not scale for AI.

82
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,750
And so we made a bold move.

83
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,250
We migrated 61,000 on-premise pipelines

84
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,430
to our AWS mesh ecosystem.

85
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,983
That's equivalent to 10 petabytes of data.

86
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,330
The migration took nine
months with a hundred percent

87
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,200
of data pipelines tested three times,

88
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,440
that's 229,000 tests.

89
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,860
And in so doing, we moved
our entire data engineering

90
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,203
and AI workforce to AWS cloud.

91
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,400
So how do we do such a
large migration so quickly?

92
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,910
This is where our partnership
with AWS and HCL comes in.

93
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,873
Oops, sorry.

94
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,680
Early last year, we kicked off a series

95
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,590
of workshops with AWS and HCL

96
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,500
to test our most complex data pipelines

97
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,680
and AI use cases to see if the migration

98
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,370
to AWS native technologies was possible.

99
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,980
We call this approach steel threads.

100
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,920
Unlike a proof of concept or an MVP,

101
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,320
steel threads prove the technology,

102
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,440
but they also productionalize the outcome.

103
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,560
Working closely with HCL, we built AI

104
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,790
and generative AI that transform
code, check for errors,

105
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,080
and then tested the output,
reconciling the tables exactly

106
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,100
to our on-premise platform 100%.

107
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,740
Every single row, column, and number

108
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,183
needed to be accounted for.

109
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,500
Throughout the nine month
migration, CBA, AWS,

110
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,500
and HCL worked closely as
a unified tight knit team.

111
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,470
We adopted this approach to
stop any potential misalignment,

112
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,380
often associated with big programs of work

113
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,450
and ambitious deadlines.

114
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,540
We prioritized establishing
a shared purpose

115
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,240
and operating cadence,
ensuring each member

116
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,710
of the team felt a real sense

117
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,893
of ownership toward
achieving our common goal.

118
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,720
And now, with our AWS
mesh ecosystem in place

119
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,840
and evolving our on-premise migration

120
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,830
to that ecosystem in place and complete,

121
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,240
we are ready to scale on
CBAs ambitious AI-powered,

122
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,713
data driven-future.

123
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,263
Would like hand over to Pukhi.

124
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,130
I'll grab you this.

125
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,160
- Thank you, Terri for
sharing the insights.

126
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,980
I'm Puneet Makhija, delivery partner

127
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,220
at HCL Tech, leading high performing teams

128
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,173
delivering solutions at CBA.

129
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,330
Let me dive into some of
the critical success factors

130
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,700
that were for this migration.

131
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,330
Best in class and fit for
purpose engineering practices.

132
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,700
At HCL Tech, engineering is at the core

133
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,993
of everything what we do.

134
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,490
Industry is seeing a conversions of data,

135
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,230
AI, and engineering,

136
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,260
and we leverage best practices
across these paradigms

137
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,880
for this program.

138
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,310
We began early, strategically sourcing

139
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,770
and deploying talent in phases

140
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,143
to access the ideal talent pool.

141
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,820
The data and AI lab created an environment

142
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,440
that encouraged learning

143
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,680
and innovation, helping teams to adapt

144
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,303
to the program requirements.

145
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,170
We improved test and migration quality

146
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,563
in each sprint by use
matrices and track progress.

147
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,380
Delivery construct for this program

148
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,883
was truly outcome-based.

149
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,110
Cognitive team topologies.

150
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,880
We organized the teams

151
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,540
according to the Dreyfus
Competency Framework,

152
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,320
which helped us create a
cognitive diverse team structure.

153
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,180
Connect pods led enablement,
scale migration, and automation

154
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,763
and acceleration spots across the program.

155
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,570
Elite AI engineers were
embedded in the teams

156
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,400
to foster creative tension

157
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,883
and consistently identify
ways to accelerate.

158
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:30,270
Engineering skills uplift
and transformation levers.

159
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,940
We ramped up our engineering team early,

160
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,500
peaking at over 250
AWS-certified data engineers.

161
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,560
We began upskilling and
certifications early,

162
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,740
so our team was ready and effective

163
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,213
from start of the migration.

164
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,210
We shifted from specialized roles

165
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,260
to full cycle engineering,
aligned to CBS model

166
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,543
to deliver solutions effectively.

167
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,064
In short, we used three
transformation levers:

168
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:01,050
AWS certification for engineers,

169
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,133
focused on full cycle engineering
and AI-driven automation.

170
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,063
Automation and Gen AI.

171
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,500
Developing automation
accelerators of parallel testing

172
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,180
enabled us successful
migration of 61,000 pipelines

173
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,460
and over 10 petabytes of data

174
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,460
over to AWS in less than
nine months with precision

175
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,740
and meeting quality objectives.

176
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,500
An important takeaway from this migration

177
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,980
is that we are committed to
incorporating AI accelerators

178
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,870
for all future transitions

179
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,720
and legacy migration initiatives.

180
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,790

183
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,290
we have embraced future-fit delivery model

any search initiative.

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,450
Last, but one of the significant
critical success factors,

186
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,540
HC Tech strategic partnership with AWS.

187
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,910
A significant factor in our success

188
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,490
has been the strategic
partnership with AWS

189
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,353
and a strong collaboration top down.

190
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,340
The mantra, One Team One
Dream united CBA, AWS,

191
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,713
and HCL Tech, leading to
the program's success.

the first of its kind,

193
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,040
