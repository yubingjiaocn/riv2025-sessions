1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- Welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:03,120
We're gonna be talking about scaling AI,

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,960
scale trusted AI adoption
with Salesforce and AWS.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,860
My name is Shibani Ahuja and
I am one of your hosts today.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,950
But I'm joined by four
gentlemen, three gentlemen here.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,860
We've got Amit Bangad,

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,170
Director of Go-to-Market
Applications from CrowdStrike.

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,190
Welcome.
- Hi.

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,980
- Hrushi, Principal
Solution Architect from AWS.

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,720
And we've got Pravin, who
is the Managing Director

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,910
from Deloitte Consulting over here.

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,370
So good spread. And I am Shibani.

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,100
I work at Salesforce, and I'm
gonna start with a small story

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,840
of what my role at Salesforce is.

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,953
But before I do,

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,580
a love letter from our
lawyer from Salesforce

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,980
to say, please make all of
your purchasing decisions

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,680
on all of the products that
are readily available today,

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,740
not on any future-looking
products that you might see.

20
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,620
Obligated to say that. I try
to say it in a way with love.

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,970
Three things we're gonna talk about today.

22
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,590
So, one, the first part
is I'm gonna take you down

23
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,910
a few trends that I've seen of CIOs

24
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,260
and folks that are implementing AI

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,040
and this whole notion of
AI and what we've seen in,

26
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,000
what I've seen in the industry

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,680
as far as trends have gone along

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,140
in the first, I'd say for the last year.

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,510
The second one is we're
gonna go a little bit deeper

30
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,130
on this partnership that we
have between Salesforce and AWS

31
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,667
because a lot of folks
ask that question to say,

32
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:18,247
"Wait, aren't you, are you
competitors? Are you partners?

33
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:20,490
"How do you partner? I'd love
to learn more about that."

34
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,680
And then the last one is where
it's gonna get a lot of fun

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,690
where I'm gonna be able to grill

36
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,360
and interrogate these three
guys on stage over here.

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,880
We'll learn more about the
success that CrowdStrike has had

38
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,950
in becoming an agentic enterprise.

39
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,990
We'll also leave open time for Q&A.

40
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,480
So think about all of those really hard,

41
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,250
juicy personal questions

42
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,350
that you wanna ask these
gentlemen over here.

43
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,660
I'll help facilitate that as well.

44
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,260
Okay, so what I'm gonna start
with is a small introduction

45
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,220
of who I am and why on
Earth am I on stage here,

46
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,290
besides the fact that Salesforce
is sponsoring this event

47
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,940
and I happen to work at Salesforce.

48
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,150
Now, a year ago, however, I
was not working at Salesforce,

49
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,590
I was sitting in your seat.

50
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,650
I was working at one of
the largest banks in Canada

51
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,280
and I was driving a massive
technological transformation

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,990
thing called personalization.

53
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,480
Also, for a little bit, I was at TD Bank.

54
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,660
And for a portion of time,
I also ran all of digital

55
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,580
for the Canadian Bank.

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,190
So I knew a thing or two
about working with Salesforce.

57
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,450
And so what happened was,

58
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,180
part of my remit was the Salesforce stack,

59
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,850
amongst many other technologies,
as we were driving digital

60
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,760
and creating these personalized
experiences for customers.

61
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,290
And Salesforce is notorious

62
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,020
for wanting to put
customer stories on stage,

63
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,610
a little bit like what we're doing here,

64
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,470
where if they've had a
success with a customer,

65
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,750
they invite them to come
up, tell their story.

66
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,790
So I was working at TD Bank,

67
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,197
I got this invite from Salesforce to say,

68
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:44,070
"Hey, Salesforce has
this internal conference.

69
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,590
It's for Mark Benioff and his top leaders,

70
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,470
like 450 SVP plus will be in the room,

71
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,380
and 73,000 colleagues will be dialing in.

72
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,910
It's like an internal employee thing.

73
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,710
Would you come in and
will you tell your story

74
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,900
about what you drove at TD

75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,457
with personalization, with Data 360?"

76
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:01,080
And I said, "Sure, no problem."

77
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,250
And they said, "It's in Hawaii."

78
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,690
And I went, "Oh, if I must."

79
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,660
So off I go, I fly to Hawaii,
and I'm sitting there,

80
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,827
they're asking me questions
about the transformation saying,

81
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:11,100
"You know, how did you use Data 360?"

82
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,170
All the typical questions
that they would ask

83
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,260
to entice and incentivize
their sales teams.

84
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,567
At the end, I was asked one question,

85
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:21,150
and that question was,
"Shibani, you've got Mark,

86
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,700
who's sitting as far as
you are in the audience,

87
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,770
you've got his top leadership here,

88
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,810
what advice do you have for them?"

89
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,880
Now, what you'll learn throughout today

90
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,670
is I have zero filter and I let it rip.

91
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,120
Like, I mean, I made it
a standup comedy show.

92
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,430
I said, "You know, you
guys are like a timeshare.

93
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,280
You like set us up with
really, really nice dinners,

94
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,050
but we have to listen to
someone talk about sales

95
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,480
for 45 minutes and maybe we'll
get a nice dinner out of it

96
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,470
and we might get a gift."

97
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,030
And I kind of went on and on and on

98
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,590
about what my experience was.

99
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,240
And I said, "It's ironic
that you're helping me

100
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,470
put my customer at the center

101
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,850
to drive personalization at scale,

102
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,680
yet when I show up for a meeting with you,

103
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,500
you bring 22 people and I have
to know who's Sales Cloud,

104
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,090
who's Marketing Cloud,
who's Service Cloud."

105
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,760
And I went "Like, this is
not how you do business."

106
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,770
And so, you know when you're on a roll

107
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,780
and you know that you should
stop, but you just can't stop?

108
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,157
That was what it felt like.

109
00:04:08,157 --> 00:04:11,310
And so, then I finally
stop and Mark stands up

110
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,860
and he's a towering guy,
and I'm very, very short.

111
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,080
And he shakes my hand and
I get a standing ovation.

112
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,790
I'm like, okay, so I'm
not being escorted out.

113
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,900
This is good news.

114
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,049
As I am walking out of the venue,

115
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:25,260
someone says, "Watch out.
They're coming for you."

116
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,540
And I think before I
even got back to Toronto,

117
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,337
which is home base for me, I
had gotten the call to say,

118
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,400
"Hey Shibani, you've got a lot of opinions

119
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,580
on how we engage with
the office of the CIO.

120
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,570
And with our shift now to AI
and agentic and autonomous

121
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,210
and Agentforce, you know,
we'd really like your help

122
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,430
in helping us better
understand our customer."

123
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,470
And so now I'm at
Salesforce and I'm leading,

124
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,180
my title is a bit vague,

125
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,040
ultimately, I'm leading
our go-to-market strategy

126
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,510
for how we engage CIOs.

127
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,010
And these are enterprise level CIOs,

128
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,510
because we just don't do it right,

129
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,800
or we hadn't done it right,

130
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,230
and we weren't necessarily
seen as a serious player

131
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,063
in the AI space.

132
00:04:59,063 --> 00:05:02,190
And so we've been doing
a lot of CIO events.

133
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,050
What ended up happening was I joined,

134
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,340
and I do a lot of speaking.

135
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,650
I share all of this
because in the last year,

136
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,180
and I just hit my one year anniversary

137
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,460
on November 18th with Salesforce,

138
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,290
I have met with over 457 enterprise CIOs.

139
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,030
And these are not just hi, shaking hands,

140
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,380
but these are deep conversations

141
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,300
through one-to-many engagement events

142
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,400
where I may be either
meeting with them one-on-one

143
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,410
and helping them, guide
them on their strategy

144
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,960
of where they wanna go,
how they wanna get there.

145
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,570
Or just general education on,

146
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,750
not necessarily products and sales,

147
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,273
but what, this era that we're in.

148
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:39,120
And the number one insight that I've seen

149
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,150
as we are going through this
technological revolution,

150
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,350
the number one insight

151
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,460
is that AI is the smallest, biggest word.

152
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,470
And what I mean by that
is, I can't tell you

153
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,630
how many conversations
I'm having with CIOs,

154
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,550
or I'll be in a room with tech leaders.

155
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,720
It could be anyone, tech leaders.

156
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,280
And you'll have like the sales team here,

157
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,770
you'll have tech leaders here,
you'll have data folks here,

158
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,260
and everyone is using the word AI.

159
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,310
Everyone.

160
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,180
Good. That's good.

161
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,160
That's the conversation we wanna have.

162
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,990
But if you listen very carefully,

163
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,630
one person may be talking
about predictive AI,

164
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,910
another person talking
about generative AI,

165
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,090
another person thinking they're
talking about agentic AI.

166
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,520
And if you listen to the
words really carefully,

167
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,797
they're literally just
describing generative AI.

168
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:23,370
And so that was a massive
aha for me to say, like,

169
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,220
I don't know how well
people are being prepared

170
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,710
to think about architectures of the future

171
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,510
if they haven't really paused for a moment

172
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,100
to really fundamentally think

173
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,230
about the architectural differences

174
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,070
between generative AI versus agentic AI.

175
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,720
And then, you know, that study hits,

176
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,880
that MIT study that creates a lot of noise

177
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,880
around 95% of pilots are
failing to deliver value.

178
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,230
Well, that's on generative.
That's not on agentic.

179
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,360
So this is just the setup,
and what's happening,

180
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,280
and so these CIOs are
having these conversations,

181
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,560
they're rushed to try to get
a use case in production.

182
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,540
And now all of a sudden what's happened

183
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,650
is it's not unlike the internet,
or cloud, or even mobile,

184
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,720
the CIO was squarely in charge

185
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,850
and was delivering this
for the organization.

186
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,530
Now, suddenly, with every board member

187
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,290
and every CEO having access to ChatGPT

188
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,210
thinking they are an AI expert,

189
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,430
they're going, "I need a
use case in production.

190
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,950
I need a story to tell my investors.

191
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,510
I need to get something in production."

192
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,790
Their business leaders
are putting this pressure.

193
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,940
Suddenly these leaders
are under immense pressure

194
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,010
to just get a use case in production.

195
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,337
And they're going through
these thoughts that say,

196
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:29,203
"Should I build, should I buy?

197
00:07:29,203 --> 00:07:31,920
What's the use case that I should get in?"

198
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,620
And one thing that I've
seen in terms of maturity,

199
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,970
and again, in a year,

200
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,380
and this maturity I've only really seen

201
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,850
in the last two to three months,

202
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,910
is as people pause and
recognize the difference

203
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,630
between generative architecture
versus agentic architecture

204
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,640
that would enable a digital agent

205
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,310
to traverse the virtual
halls of your organization,

206
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,700
I'm seeing the shift of build
versus buy conversation,

207
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,620
that also evolve a little bit.

208
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,947
And it's changing from one of,

209
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:58,290
"Should I build from scratch?"

210
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,127
And I kind of, I would
giggle when someone said,

211
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:02,520
"I'm gonna build my agentic
architecture from scratch,"

212
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,200
going like, do you really
know what that means?

213
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,460
That's a lot.

214
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,460
So it's shifting from
build to buy, from that,

215
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,740
to now talking about,

216
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,300
should I be going with a SaaS provider?

217
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,920
Should I be going with a
cloud service provider?

218
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,070
And so this has really
been the conversation

219
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,230
of what is it that you're trying to build,

220
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,850
what are you trying to drive?

221
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,910
Understanding the core
differences between predictive,

222
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,530
generative and agentic.

223
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,700
And I'll give a moment 'cause I love it

224
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,140
when I see cameras out to take pictures

225
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,930
and I'll flip the slide as
soon as you've got those.

226
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,340
Okay, good.

227
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,030
It's like popcorn, I wait for
the popcorn to stop popping.

228
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,560
Perfect.

229
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,600
And so now this is giving
rise to another conversation

230
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,730
to say, should I go
with the SaaS provider?

231
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,130
With the SaaS provider,
I can build at scale,

232
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,510
or I can build at speed.

233
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,370
They're gonna provide me templates.

234
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,140
It's gonna be grounded
in my business logic.

235
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,940
So you think about the
Salesforce platform,

236
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,140
we have all of your customer data.

237
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,720
So theoretically, being
able to create agents

238
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,190
that are leveraging your customer data,

239
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,360
it's in a clean spot.

240
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,310
That'll be a fast way to do it.

241
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,840
And they're gonna be
ready-made with guardrails

242
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,390
because Salesforce already
has all the guardrails

243
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,040
that are built within the system.

244
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,117
But then you've got another
cohort of folks that say,

245
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:13,391
"Well, Salesforce is kind
of like a CRM company.

246
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:15,870
My COO, my CMO cares about them.

247
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,290
I'm not really gonna look at
Salesforce for agentic agents."

248
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,307
And you've got those that are thinking,

249
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:24,360
"I'm gonna go with a hyperscaler,
a cloud service provider.

250
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,810
They're gonna give me the
options to choose my models.

251
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,240
Like, I'm gonna be able
to build custom agents

252
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,670
that I really need and want
throughout my organization

253
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,190
and with customer security architecture."

254
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,470
And this is where we're
starting to see more stories,

255
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,970
like the one we're gonna
share with you today,

256
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,690
is there is a world
where both could exist.

257
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,950
And that is a world where you
start to look at partnerships,

258
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,860
the Better Together story
of Amazon, or of AWS,

259
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,960
and Salesforce coming together,

260
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,090
where you can start to
take all of that rich data

261
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,380
that you have on customers,

262
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,210
be able to harmonize that,

263
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,210
create agents that operate with context.

264
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,530
You've got model options.

265
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,170
So again, as a customer, I often thought,

266
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,360
oh, Salesforce is like a
beast. It's a monolith.

267
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,220
They want me to put everything in it.

268
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,530
They want to be at the end-all be-all.

269
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,260
But the reality is, choose your
lake, choose your warehouse,

270
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,720
choose your model, choose your partner.

271
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,550
And so there's been a lot
more of that aha moment

272
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,487
where folks are going,

273
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:20,490
"I didn't realize that
I could do this and this

274
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,750
to bring it together."

275
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,790
Being able to create a
unified agent strategy,

276
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,880
being able to create these
multi-agent ecosystems

277
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,740
and all with the trusted guardrails

278
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,260
that are extended beyond
just the Salesforce ecosystem

279
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,640
and the AWS ecosystem.

280
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,890
And the partnership
benefits are well beyond

281
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,470
even what you're seeing
just here on slide.

282
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,910
That's really what I wanted to share

283
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,277
and really talking about CrowdStrike,

284
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:44,250
how CrowdStrike is now
an agentic enterprise

285
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,660
that has taken this leap forward

286
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,260
with both Salesforce and AWS
to start creating these agents

287
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,180
that are gonna operate at scale.

288
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,770
And it's with that partnership

289
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,710
and the Salesforce Agentforce 360 platform

290
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,440
that they've been able
to get context, clarity,

291
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,910
the richness that's necessary,

292
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,830
and the safety and security and guardrails

293
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,500
for those agents to operate at scale.

294
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,200
All right, now chapter two,

295
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,100
I'm gonna hand this off

296
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,330
to Hrushi, my friend.
- Sure.

297
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,190
- Who's gonna tell us and
go a little bit deeper

298
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,640
on that partnership
between AWS and Salesforce.

299
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,350
- Thank you, Shibani.

300
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,730
Good afternoon.

301
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,350
Principal Solutions Architect, AWS,

302
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,900
and I think since the last few months,

303
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,920
I've been working very closely

304
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,890
with the Product and
Engineering Team at Agentforce,

305
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,800
specifically to help guide
on the model optionality

306
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,580
and the agent interoperability
integrations on AWS.

307
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,980
So these are the two key
topics of today's session.

308
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,120
So let's dive in.

309
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,390
Now, before I get into
the further part of it,

310
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,920
I want to bring, first thing is that

311
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,110
for building any agentic enterprise,

312
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,560
you need trusted data
to fuel your AI agents.

313
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,810
And by this time, you must have known,

314
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,311
looking at the Agent 360,

315
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:53,640
that Agentforce works
on this trusted data,

316
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,900
it runs on this trusted data.

317
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,760
Now, as we have established,

318
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,970
that trusted contextual data is critical

319
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,460
for any agent to work.

320
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,560
The next logical question comes says,

321
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,200
how about giving the
empowerment for the users

322
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,693
to choose their preferred AI models?

323
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:11,640
When it is like, if you look at an agent,

324
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,340
agent is powered by the
LLMs or the backend models.

325
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,220
So to do that, Salesforce just launched,

326
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,390
I think two months ago,

327
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,920
support for Anthropic Claude
Sonnet model on Bedrock.

328
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,490
This enables the joint
customers, our customers,

329
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,003
to keep the data within the
Salesforce trust boundary.

330
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,270
And this helps actually,
specifically when it comes to

331
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,030
thinking about the
models which we use here.

332
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,800
You will make sure that
the data never leaves

333
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,510
the trusted boundary, right.

334
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,580
Now that we have kind of,

335
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,270
if you look at the various
LLM flexibility we have here

336
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,610
in the Prompt Builder, in
the Atlas Reasoning Engine,

337
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,010
we can select a bunch of
models from the Amazon Bedrock.

338
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,370
So with LLM flexibility,
our customers can now build,

339
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,060
or I would say, rather maximum
control on their security

340
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,280
when building the agentic enterprise.

341
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,820
So now that we talked about
the unified data strategy

342
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,380
or the model choices for
borrowing your AI agents,

343
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,915
now let's think about
taking these digital labels

344
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:14,100
to the next level,

345
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,980
like coming up with a
unified agent strategy.

346
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,570
And how do you do that?

347
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,240
So this is done through the way,

348
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,070
if you think about Agentforce
now actually supports,

349
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,820
the agent could, say,
multi-agent orchestration,

350
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,320
and multi-agent orchestration is possible

351
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,300
through few things, right.

352
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,000
So one other thing is that
if you, as a customer,

353
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,430
in order to build, you
know, an agentic enterprise

354
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,410
using Salesforce and AWS,

355
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,180
what you have to think about here is that

356
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,910
the Agentforce with MCP client support

357
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,120
can now talk to the MCP
servers provided by AWS

358
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,240
and plus, the AWS MCP servers
are also made available

359
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,280
on the Salesforce AgentExchange,

360
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,980
which helps you to deploy
your agents rapidly

361
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,380
in a production environment, right.

362
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,400
So this way, I mean,

363
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,650
if you look at the other
options which it has,

364
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,930
is the agent-to-agent collaboration.

365
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,710
So agent-to-agent interoperability
is based on Salesforce's,

366
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,000
or you could say Agentforce's,

367
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,500
open agent collaboration,

368
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,370
which is based on the
standard protocol called A2A.

369
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,130
That helps the Salesforce agents

370
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,380
or the agents for agents to
talk to any other agents.

371
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,050
So here, what we have
shown is that you can talk

372
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,120
to an agent sitting on Bedrock Agent Core.

373
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,340
Bedrock Agent Core Runtime
is one of the several

374
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,547
less managed services from AWS
to run and scale your agents.

375
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:30,930
You can talk to those agents,

376
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,640
or you can talk to any third party agents.

377
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,730
And also, coming up very
recently we can think about

378
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,820
is also the tools which
the other agents can call,

379
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,250
assuming that the Agentforce
agent is as a tool,

380
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,890
so they can call those tools
through the Agent Core Gateway.

381
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,260
That will help you to
route the tool traffic

382
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,540
to the Agentforce agents.

383
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,910
So with that, let me pass it on to Shibani

384
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,850
and to our amazing CrowdStrike customer,

385
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,363
a leading security provider
and an agentic enterprise now.

386
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,333
- Perfect. Thank you.

387
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,960
All right, so this is the part

388
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,520
where we're just gonna
get into conversation.

389
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,650
And I'm short, so I'm gonna like lean up

390
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,100
so you can see me over there.

391
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:08,622
- Yeah. It slides more.

392
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:09,455
- Sorry, what was that?

393
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:10,290
- You can click few slides more.

394
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,123
- Yeah. Yeah.

395
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,100
So we're gonna talk about CrowdStrike.

396
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,537
CrowdStrike is an agentic enterprise.

397
00:15:15,537 --> 00:15:17,940
And to ask and get deeper
into those questions

398
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,070
of how did they become
that agentic enterprise,

399
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,660
what were the aha moments
that they went through

400
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,670
as they were becoming
that agentic enterprise?

401
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,110
And think about the
questions that you have.

402
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,499
I have a couple of questions that I've got

403
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:27,900
that are warmups.

404
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,840
But this is an opportunity for
you to learn from your peers

405
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,190
and from those that are on the stage,

406
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,470
both from an implementation, a partner,

407
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,300
a platform, SaaS provider, and
our customer's point of view.

408
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,650
The first question that I'm gonna ask you

409
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,267
is not on the script at all.

410
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:44,640
- Really?
- What's your guilty pleasure?

411
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,340
So, and as you are introducing yourself,

412
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,840
so maybe as you're answering the question,

413
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,510
give a small intro of your role.

414
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,500
- Awesome. Yeah.

415
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,770
- Guilty pleasure. What is it?

416
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,320
- So my guilty pleasure is chocolates.

417
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,633
- Chocolates, okay.

418
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,040
- And dark chocolate specifically.

419
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,920
So I'm totally up for it
anytime during the day,

420
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,990
during the night, so
that's my guilty pleasure.

421
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,080
So briefly introducing about
myself, I'm Amit Bangad,

422
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,053
Director for Go-to Market
Applications at CrowdStrike.

423
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,830
I have been part of CrowdStrike
for close to three years.

424
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,830
I've been part of this
ecosystem of Salesforce

425
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,580
and go-to market systems
for more than 15 years.

426
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,880
At CrowdStrike, currently
I manage that platform

427
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,190
and I'm primarily, in this context,

428
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,850
responsible for building
those high value agents,

429
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,160
which not only bring
operational efficiency,

430
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,280
but also reimagine the
complete end-to-end process

431
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,620
when it comes to agentic enterprise.

432
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,673
- Amazing. Thank you.

433
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,043
Guilty pleasure? Yeah, go for it, Hrushi.

434
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,680
- I think electronic gadgets.

435
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,820
- Electronic gadgets?
- Yes.

436
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,960
- Any in particular?

437
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,130
- Specifically laptops.

438
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,000
- Laptops. Okay.

439
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,260
Do you know as a kid, my Dad and I,

440
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,150
every time Sony would release something,

441
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,820
MP3 player, laser disc,
we'd be the first to get it.

442
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,653
So I get it.

443
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:55,740
I get that obsession.
- Right? Yeah.

444
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,020
My son was buying a gaming laptop,

445
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,580
so he was thinking about,
"Hey, what's your budget?"

446
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,340
I said, "No, let's, let's
look at the specification

447
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,630
and then think about it."

448
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,534
So that's how I mean, yeah.

449
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:07,350
But yeah, I mean, I'll introduce myself.

450
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,480
I've been with AWS around six years now,

451
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,610
and I've seen a lot of ML startups

452
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,870
and ISVs I have worked with.

453
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,450
I'm happy to, you know, give my insights

454
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,810
into how things work here,
what questions you have.

455
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,780
Good to understand that
and explain it to you.

456
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,620
- Great.

457
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,880
Pravin, guilty pleasure?
- Okay.

458
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,600
So I was gonna use one
of the guilty pleasures

459
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,280
which was already used,
so I'm gonna switch

460
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,851
to another one that I've got.

461
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,840
I think it's anything and
everything around Indian food.

462
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,480
- Indian food, really?
- Oh yeah.

463
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,313
- So if I-

464
00:17:37,313 --> 00:17:38,820
- That seems so healthy.

465
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,530
- Yeah, I know. Like I-

466
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,520
- I'll give you my guilty pleasure.

467
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,290
I'll tell you how it's done.

468
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,550
- My daughter keeps telling me

469
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,500
that I need to start losing weight

470
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,930
and then how I should not
eat a lot of Indian food.

471
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,517
But as you could imagine,
that's not happening.

472
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:52,226
- What's your favorite Indian food?

473
00:17:52,226 --> 00:17:53,946
So I know when next time you
come over, what I'm making.

474
00:17:53,946 --> 00:17:57,840
- Yeah, I think my favorite
Indian food is anything

475
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,550
which is spicy and non-vegetarian,
like chicken or goat.

476
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,500
- Got it. Noted.
- Yeah.

477
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,023
So as a quick introduction,

478
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,080
I'm Managing Director in Deloitte.

479
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,990
As part of my role, I primarily focus

480
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,340
on like helping my clients

481
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,620
with like business
transformation engagements,

482
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,095
which are focused on not only just driving

483
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:22,320
the operational efficiencies,
but like truly driving

484
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,810
like revenue growth for my clients, right.

485
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,220
And as we do that,

486
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,370
I've been working with the
Salesforce plus AWS ecosystem

487
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,150
for the good part of like,
I guess 15, 16 years now.

488
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:33,983
And prior to that,

489
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:36,150
I was also working with
the go-to market systems.

490
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,060
I used to help with implementation

491
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,420
around like one of the old
CRM solutions called Siebel,

492
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,770
if you guys have heard about it.

493
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,330
- Mm-hmm.

494
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,340
- And internally at
Deloitte, I also lead our,

495
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,770
what we call as a customer, 360 practice.

496
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,290
And considering like everything around AI

497
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,270
and then everything that we have discussed

498
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,890
about like how data becomes
the fuel and the food for AI,

499
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,450
that has been one of the core areas

500
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,340
that I've been focusing on helping clients

501
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,410
getting on that strong foundation

502
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,413
that can help them scale their AI journey.

503
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,910
- Great. Okay. So my guilty
pleasure, let me tell you

504
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,560
since you all are so innocent.

505
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,540
- Yeah.
- Bourbons and burger.

506
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,190
- Ah.
- So, I'm from Canada,

507
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,630
where if you aren't aware,

508
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,410
there's no more bourbon on our
shelves because of, you know,

509
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,790
for whatever reason there may be.

510
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,710
So every time I cross the border,

511
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,499
I make sure that I get my
share of bourbons and burgers.

512
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:30,810
- Which brand is your favorite?

513
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,003
- Well, Woodford is good for everyday.

514
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:32,836
- Woodford.
- Perfect.

515
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:35,100
- Yeah. For the everyday.

516
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,080
Okay. Now to get into the tough stuff.

517
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,910
Amit, tell us about your team.

518
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,520
Why is AI so important
to your organization?

519
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,450
- Absolutely.
- What are you driving?

520
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:47,450
- Yep. So I lead a team of
a combination of engineers,

521
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,060
testers, analysts, product
owners, architects.

522
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,170
So that's my team.

523
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,360
But what's really important here is

524
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,890
whom do we support, right?

525
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,300
So we support our business,

526
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,720
internal business teams across
marketing, across sales,

527
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,710
across customer success, legal,
finance, product, et cetera.

528
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,410
Beyond this, we also build tech
solutions for our customers

529
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,530
and partners to use on
their respective portal.

530
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,580
So AI is not only important
for us, it's basically,

531
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,610
it's a foundation of how we
think about our three Ss, right?

532
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:22,610
So, which is speed,
scalability, as well as...

533
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,870
I mean, speed, scalability, and strategy.

534
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,210
So at its core really,

535
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:32,210
AI helps us to, A, think
faster, understand faster.

536
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,150
So understanding the customer
behavior, that's one.

537
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,410
Then beyond customer behavior,

538
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,010
the internal inefficiencies, right.

539
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,850
So AI can surface this
information with speed

540
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,790
and it's basically like
thousands of analysts working

541
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,480
for you and surfacing information

542
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,240
which otherwise would not
come to the forefront, right.

543
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,920
Beyond this, AI also helps you

544
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,760
to basically act smarter, I would say.

545
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,910
Be it your mundane
day-to-day routine tasks

546
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,900
that you're automating,

547
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,390
or be it complex workflow simplification,

548
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,010
AI helps you to focus and
channelize the human energy

549
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,983
where it matters the most
in building relationships.

550
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:13,950
In building relationships

551
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,950
then also just the experience, right.

552
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,740
Beyond this, I would say not just tech,

553
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,170
but AI is a game changer, right.

554
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,310
So AI is a cultural shift, so
it's super important for us.

555
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,050
- It sounds like you've got a good balance

556
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,600
between where you're focusing
on colleague enablement,

557
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,980
but also customer engagement.

558
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,570
- Yep.
- Customer experiences.

559
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,550
And it's important when
organizations are thinking about it

560
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,510
from both sides of the house,

561
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,490
because it creates those more holistic,

562
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,190
rounded use cases
throughout the organization.

563
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,480
- That makes sense.
- Thanks, Amit.

564
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,612
All right, Hrushi.
- Oh.

565
00:21:47,612 --> 00:21:49,290
- The Salesforce trust boundary.

566
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,260
Why is that a non-negotiable requirement?

567
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,733
- I'll start with a very serious note,

568
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:55,560
that when it comes to security

569
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,620
and compliance of our customers' data,

570
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,080
both Salesforce and AWS take them

571
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,330
as priority number one, right.

572
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,580
So enterprises basically trust us.

573
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,010
And when it comes to
like a trust boundary,

574
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,070
they want an absolute, whether
it is like a user prompt,

575
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,960
or the intermediary workflow

576
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,210
where the agentic AI workflow is trying

577
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,330
to process the data or
the final AI response.

578
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,570
All has to be done, or
none has to actually cross

579
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,400
that trusted boundary, right.

580
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,120
So together actually both,
I mean AWS and Salesforce,

581
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,520
designed and built a solution

582
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,910
that meets the data residency
and compliance requirements

583
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,760
for our customers globally,
across 22 regions.

584
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,040
And we're counting, I guess, right?

585
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,030
So 24 maybe, something like that.

586
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,480
But the key thing here
is that the customers,

587
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,610
wherever the customers operate from,

588
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,080
no matter in the world,

589
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,760
we are making sure that,
and we are assuring

590
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,790
that your data remains
within the trusted boundary

591
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,040
that you have established with Salesforce.

592
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,470
- So trust boundary
really in data residency

593
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,440
and ensuring the safety,
security, stability of that data.

594
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,310
- Yeah.
- But also,

595
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,460
as you start to provision
that data access to agents

596
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,920
is ensuring that you've
got that consistency,

597
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,450
particularly, I think about it in a world

598
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,620
where you start to think of agents

599
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,210
that are talking to other agents

600
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,180
and how to ensure that
same trust boundary across-

601
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,184
- Yeah, it's both.

602
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,460
I would say it's both north-south

603
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,290
and east-west, for example.
- Yep.

604
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,030
- Agent-to-agent or agent-to-models.

605
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,020
So you have to keep, make sure

606
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,410
that your customer's data
is secure and compliant.

607
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,759
- Right. Thank you.

608
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,560
Okay, one more for you.
- Oh yeah.

609
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,970
- And you've got the
cheat sheet right there.

610
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,030
So the integration, I'm not gonna...

611
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,930
You've got this.

612
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,460
How does the integration
with Amazon Bedrock

613
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,040
ensure compliance for our joint customers?

614
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,870
- So I'll start with first
Amazon Bedrock, right.

615
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,140
Amazon Bedrock provides
you the secure connectivity

616
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,377
to the frontier models like
Anthropic Cloud, Amazon Nova,

617
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:46,230
and others through a
technology called PrivateLink,

618
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,320
which makes the entire application

619
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,060
to talk to these models privately

620
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,670
within the private network of AWS, right.

621
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,010
And certainly, I mean,

622
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,270
like if you look at the Agentforce,

623
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,740
there are two modules
which we talked about,

624
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,710
the Prompt Builder as well
as the Reasoning Engine.

625
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:05,137
And these modules
typically use Agentforce.

626
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:06,420
If you look at these modules,

627
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,550
these are using the Amazon
Bedrock models, right.

628
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,160
Anthropic Claude for the Reasoning Engine.

629
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,340
And there is a bunch of
models within Amazon Bedrock,

630
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,790
like the Claude Haiku, Opus, Sonnet,

631
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,090
as well as Amazon Nova,
Nova Lite, Nova Pro.

632
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:21,923
They're used in the Prompt Builder.

633
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:23,460
If you have used Prompt Builder,

634
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,260
that will give you model optionality.

635
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,810
So depending on customer's preference,

636
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,640
Agentforce also supports a feature

637
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,343
called in-country inference
profile of Bedrock,

638
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,940
I would say, which restricts the data

639
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,790
to remain within the country
where you are doing inferencing

640
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,630
or you're running the agentic
AI applications, right.

641
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,200
So I would say the compliance
rests on these three pillars.

642
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,340
One is your secure
connectivity to the model.

643
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,010
Second is no data addressed.

644
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,200
The third is depending on
the customer preference,

645
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,473
they can pick and choose
the in-country inferencing

646
00:24:57,473 --> 00:25:00,033
so that the data never
leaves the country boundary.

647
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,240
- Perfect. Like, I'd
love to do a quick poll

648
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,630
just to see how many of you
are Salesforce customers.

649
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,843
I would imagine that you
all are AWS customers,

650
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,940
or it might be easier to say

651
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,700
who in the crowd is not
a Salesforce customer?

652
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,110
Like, would this be news?

653
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,730
Is this something that
is coming as news to you

654
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,200
that, ah, there is a partnership?

655
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,300
Again, like, as a customer,

656
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,220
Salesforce didn't necessarily
do the greatest job

657
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,060
at the onset of talking
about how open, extensible,

658
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,220
adaptable the stack was.

659
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,190
And it took a bit of finally convincing

660
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,590
and getting time with
the reps to say, okay,

661
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,450
I didn't realize that there was,

662
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,960
we could choose a model, let
alone from a library of models,

663
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,940
through partnerships like this.

664
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,810
So like, this is pretty important

665
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,030
for those that are starting
to explore and understand

666
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,980
and really understanding
how Atlas Reasoning works,

667
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,870
where Atlas Reasoning is not the model,

668
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,370
it's the one that helps to choose

669
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,350
what is the right model fit for purpose

670
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,380
based on guardrails that
a customer establishes.

671
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,570
- Yeah, I would say it's a
true multi-tenant environment.

672
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,040
I mean, Agentforce to scale

673
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,530
to these multi-tenant
requirements of model optionality,

674
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,600
I mean, tool optionality and other things,

675
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,570
is really based on your own requirements.

676
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,730
I mean, these tenants have
given those requirements to us.

677
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,573
- Yeah. Yeah.

678
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:14,130
Okay. Amit, what are your primary drivers

679
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,230
that made you choose Anthropic on Bedrock?

680
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:17,974
On Agentforce?

681
00:26:17,974 --> 00:26:19,530
There would've been a plethora of options.

682
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,210
- Yep.
- Why this combination?

683
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,060
- Yeah, I think we had
three primary drivers.

684
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,170
One is the data residency
and compliance in general.

685
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,360
This model ensures that the data stays

686
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,580
within the Salesforce
managed trust boundary

687
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,470
and it does not leave the trust boundary,

688
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,030
which is critical for organizations

689
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:39,720
with strict data compliance
requirements, like such as ours.

690
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,250
That's one.

691
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:46,250
Second driver is in general the security.

692
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,560
The security first architecture
from Claude, right.

693
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,860
So Claude is known for a constitutional AI

694
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,870
which emphasizes a lot on transparency,

695
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,723
on safety, and less hallucination risk.

696
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,980
This just gives another layer
of reliability index for us.

697
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,170
So that's driver number two.

698
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:08,520
And the third key driver is
meeting people where they are,

699
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,180
like for example, in
Salesforce, in Slack, right.

700
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,160
When deployed via Agentforce,

701
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,070
Claude actually runs on Salesforce infra,

702
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:21,420
which offers tight control
over the prompt execution

703
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,043
as well as the model behavior.

704
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,823
So those were our key drivers.

705
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:26,880
- Yeah. And there's a lot
of native integrations,

706
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,530
I think ultimately is what
you're wrapping it around,

707
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,800
is to say this is again how
the conversation had evolved

708
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,540
with a number of CIOs over
the course of the year

709
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,980
to say "No, no, no, no, Salesforce,

710
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,020
I'm gonna build, I'm a build shop."

711
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,700
To then recognizing, hang on a second,

712
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,440
what exactly do you think
that you're building

713
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,210
when you think about
all the individual tiles

714
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,850
that are necessary to
build agentic architecture?

715
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,920
To then, exactly what you're describing,

716
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,020
is this, you know, I really
wanna think of a partner

717
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,520
that's gonna have native integration,

718
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,170
someone that's gonna do the work for me.

719
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,700
Someone that I've already got the stack

720
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,070
that is constantly upgrading, updating

721
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,430
and agentifying the stack that I have

722
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,720
and building those partnerships.

723
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,270
And so all the more reason that
we really wanted to show up

724
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,070
to make sure that people really recognize

725
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,350
that we've got this Better Together story.

726
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,600
Now I know I've got more questions,

727
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,040
but I also wanna open it up to the crowd

728
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,810
because we can mix it up with the crowd

729
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,520
and then go back to the
questions that I've got.

730
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,183
Is there any questions that
we've got in the audience?

731
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,600
Yeah, okay. I dunno if
we've got a mic runner

732
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,213
or if you wanna just yell it out.

733
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,880
- [AUDIENCE 1] So on the
question of the multi-model

734
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,980
and the ability to choose your model.

735
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,813
- Yeah.

736
00:28:29,813 --> 00:28:33,810
- [AUDIENCE 1] And I guess one
alternative here just means

737
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,647
that drop is-,

738
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,620
You know.

739
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,906
But what I don't understand,

740
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:43,778
and we've been kind of
looking a little bit

741
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:45,423
at the Salesforce and AI,

742
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,140
I'm trying to understand how, you know,

743
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,930
you've trained obviously
on something, right?

744
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,320
Whatever your existing
chat bots, everything are.

745
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,600
You've got data sitting, you know,

746
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,073
potentially in Salesforce.

747
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,580
But with making a choice
of a different model,

748
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,670
how is that model
operating against the data

749
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,569
that happens to be in your environment?

750
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:10,017
That I cannot-,

751
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:11,460
- So I'll take this up.
- Yeah.

752
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,440
- I mean, there are two types

753
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,970
of machine learning techniques here.

754
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,440
One is on the predictive models,

755
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,500
where the models are trained on your data,

756
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,333
which is in the Salesforce,

757
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:22,500
which you are training themselves
to give some predictions

758
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,370
or some kind of attritions
or some forecast, right.

759
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,753
That is a different aspect.

760
00:29:27,753 --> 00:29:29,070
This is an agentic aspect.

761
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:33,810
In the agentic world, the
agent is a set of instructions,

762
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,740
or you could say user context
and the user query, right.

763
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,490
That orchestration is using a backend LLM

764
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,770
and the backend LLM
nowadays are so powerful

765
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,690
that you don't have to train
with the customer's data.

766
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,230
The LLMs can make and decide
based on the user query.

767
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,420
Let's say if someone
wants to take a time off

768
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,360
and they want to go and call
multiple tools for that,

769
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,550
so that that intelligence is in the model

770
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,450
that if a query comes

771
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,180
with this particular
agent instruction context,

772
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,460
then what tools I should be calling

773
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,470
to complete that particular task.

774
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,810
So that way, so to comment to your point,

775
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,910
the models which are behind the choices

776
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,650
which we are giving those models for,

777
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,150
those are the frontier models

778
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,440
which are quite intelligent

779
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,080
to come up with the workflow
given the right instruction,

780
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,130
right context.

781
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,480
That context that trusted data,

782
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,650
is what Salesforce is providing

783
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,350
as part of the in-flight
data to the model.

784
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,450
It's nothing to do with that
models are trained or not.

785
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,030
The thing which surely
is coming in the middle

786
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,740
are the trust layers, right.

787
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,060
So those models are trained

788
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,210
for specific toxic detection
or prompt injection.

789
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,850
Those are something it has
to be proprietary models.

790
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,920
But coming to your point,
the model optionality is

791
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,863
for those LLMs which are
giving these workflows.

792
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:41,790
- And the other thing that
I would say is, again,

793
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,860
that's coming in now is this idea

794
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,010
that you don't necessarily want
non-deterministic responses.

795
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,710
And so the ability to
have adaptive reasoning

796
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,110
and to be able to put in
parameters against those models

797
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,020
and against the instructions
where you want a finite

798
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,980
and definitive response versus
where you do want the LLM

799
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,690
to be able to reason, to think,

800
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,153
to consider what the
response option should be.

801
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,460
- [AUDIENCE 1] Let me expand a little bit.

802
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,580
- Yeah. And if folks, we're gonna...

803
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,450
Once the question's asked,

804
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,560
we'll just make sure
that everyone can hear.

805
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,060
If not, whoever's taking the answer can-

806
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,855
- [AUDIENCE 1] So if we
take the same concept

807
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:16,095
and talk about, you know, company data,

808
00:31:16,095 --> 00:31:17,357
which helps you grow

809
00:31:17,357 --> 00:31:20,107
and the truth of what the fact is

810
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,117
and not training the LLM by using that-,

811
00:31:24,117 --> 00:31:26,807
but changing the choice of an LLM, right.

812
00:31:26,807 --> 00:31:28,043
It could be on DeepSeek today

813
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:30,349
and it could be on
something else tomorrow.

814
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,400
So, the perception of changes,

815
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,800
the response of what you may have spent

816
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,854
building six months to a year, right,

817
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:39,330
now you're changing because
there's a better model,

818
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,271
cheaper model, it's performing well

819
00:31:41,271 --> 00:31:44,490
and it's more data sufficient
than the other one is.

820
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,140
So you see some implemented
gains with that,

821
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,160
but there's a whole lot of
pipeline building worked on.

822
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,350
I think that's where we
got part of the same thing.

823
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,149
So this is where we,
interaction with Salesforce

824
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:56,483
could not wrap our head around to say,

825
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:57,991
how are you guys solving this?

826
00:31:57,991 --> 00:31:58,824
And we never were able to have that-,

827
00:32:00,182 --> 00:32:01,620
- Yeah. So I mean, by
the way, I mean we have-

828
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,090
- Sorry, sorry. Just quick question.

829
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,760
Did the folks on the
ends of the room hear it?

830
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,593
Okay. Can you-

831
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,130
- Got the question clearly?

832
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,140
- Yeah. Paraphrasing the question.

833
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,030
- Yeah. So the question was about, yeah,

834
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,710
when you're building
this agentic AI system,

835
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,630
a low-code, no-code environment, right,

836
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,310
how are you giving model optionality

837
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,100
without making big workflow
or pipeline changes?

838
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,320
Because every other model
has a different tone,

839
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,233
different way of responding
to a practical request, right.

840
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,320
So I mean I will not answer deep,

841
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,607
but there is a obsession on that.

842
00:32:29,607 --> 00:32:32,463
ISV 309, please do come on that part.

843
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,490
But the thing is that it's all possible

844
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,180
because Salesforce thought this way ahead

845
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,760
and they built all these things so modular

846
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,170
and how having a different

847
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,080
or complete dedicated data
scientist team also helps a lot.

848
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,310
So this, I mean, combination

849
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,960
of these two building modularity,

850
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,900
bring some adapter level things,

851
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,710
which you can always
choose a target model,

852
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,350
even when you are
describing the agent actions

853
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,910
or descriptions, right.

854
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,220
If you make it AI-assisted,
that makes it easier

855
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,920
for the target model to interpret.

856
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,220
- All right, we'll go back to
some of the questions we have.

857
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,180
This is hopefully prompting you

858
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,710
to think of other
questions that you've got

859
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,790
within your own environment,

860
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,470
or just even broader questions

861
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,780
on what we talked about
in the earlier parts.

862
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,950
Okay, Pravin.

863
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,960
So, what is the most
tangible business impact

864
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,533
clients are seeing when they
implement Agentforce and AWS?

865
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,040
- Yeah, I think that's a good question,

866
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,250
but before I get to the exact response,

867
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,800
let me take a step back, right.

868
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,500
If we rewind back, like
say 12 to 18 months,

869
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,023
or maybe even like 8 to 12 months now,

870
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:35,007
- Yeah.

871
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:37,530
- Every AI and gen AI conversation

872
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,540
that was happening in like,

873
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,200
at least the conversations that
I was having with my clients

874
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,010
was essentially dominated
by like a DIY thinking,

875
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,780
like I want to do it myself, right.

876
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,670
- Absolutely.
- Like there was a,

877
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,250
there was lot of concern
around like security,

878
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,103
the compliance, and what
it is at risk, right.

879
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,850
Now, fast forward to today,

880
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,140
and if you think about it,

881
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,170
the landscape has changed drastically.

882
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,340
- Mm-hmm.

883
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,450
- Now the clients,

884
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:11,070
for them, the focus is more
on like obviously the cost,

885
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,913
but more important than
that is time to value.

886
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,690
Am I able to deliver
something to my stakeholders

887
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,393
which can really drive the value for them?

888
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,150
And with that context now,

889
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:29,150
a lot of clients have started
reevaluating what is feasible

890
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,080
and that reevaluation is leading to like,

891
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,310
hey, maybe there is-

892
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,300
Obviously we all knew,

893
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,520
like most folks in this room probably knew

894
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,590
that like doing it yourself

895
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,172
or like building everything
in-house is not the smartest

896
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:45,570
and never has been the
fastest way to get the value.

897
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,130
Because there are like these big players

898
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,540
like AWS and Amazon,

899
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,240
they're investing
heavily in the innovation

900
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,250
and coming up with all these frameworks,

901
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,110
interconnectivity and all those things.

902
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,480
And that makes a huge, huge difference.

903
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,390
So now there is a lot more
appetite for customers

904
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,080
to consider these like
very credible alternatives

905
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,560
that can drive the value
while also getting them,

906
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,840
like giving them the trust boundaries

907
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,510
and the frameworks that they can use

908
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,030
for scaling it at a pace

909
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,523
that can drive the value
for their business.

910
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,040
So where are we right now?

911
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,020
And what I'm seeing from my customers,

912
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,050
I would say like there are
like three or four things

913
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,610
that I would call out.

914
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,060
But number one theme is
about like time to value,

915
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,320
like faster time to value.

916
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,150
Like, am I able to deliver something

917
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,410
for my stakeholders which can
drive the immediate value?

918
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,870
And then the other thing
that is like the key thing

919
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:44,760
that is really originating
from all of this, is we started

920
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,520
with like a lot of like
point AI use cases, right.

921
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,660
I want to like-

922
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,930
We almost started like
thinking about like automation

923
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,490
in an agentic sense.

924
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,140
Like, what we used to do historically

925
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,663
as a automation of like
predict two things and then-

926
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:59,070
- RPA.
- That's what we call that

927
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,110
like agentic behavior.

928
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,610
But now it has become more like,

929
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,410
hey, I can't reason with it, right.

930
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,900
And I'm able to drive this value

931
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,940
and then I can do this at a scale

932
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,020
and at a speed which my teams
can like literally deploy

933
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,930
some of the AI-infused
capabilities or features

934
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,270
for a particular subset of the group

935
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,940
in days or weeks as
compared to months and years

936
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,380
that we had to do it.

937
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,400
That's the number one thing.

938
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,860
I think the second thing
that I would talk about

939
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,543
is operational efficiencies.

940
00:36:29,029 --> 00:36:29,970
And I think this goes back

941
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,440
to that automation concept, right.

942
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,600
What has happened is like the mundane task

943
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,193
that we used to do and
those are repetitive tasks,

944
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:40,450
a lot of clients are like
essentially evolving towards like,

945
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,053
"Hey, these are the
things that I don't have

946
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:44,340
to have my resources
spend a lot of time on,

947
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,430
that I want to free up my
teams to do more strategic work

948
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,700
that can truly lead to
my like revenue growth."

949
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,610
And then the third thing that
I would say is around like

950
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,050
essentially cost optimization

951
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,050
of like doing some something like this

952
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,770
while also having the
flexibility and agility to scale

953
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:07,380
in different areas
where you want to scale.

954
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,067
So I would probably stop there with three.

955
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:11,820
There are a lot of other
things that I can talk about,

956
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,920
but those are like the top three themes

957
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,670
and the real benefits
that clients are seeing.

958
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,920
And there are clients who
are like really making

959
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,753
that like shift.

960
00:37:20,753 --> 00:37:23,310
Like it's almost like a
tectonic shift now, right.

961
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:26,610
Where you are like very concerned

962
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,310
and you are like, "Hey,
should I do it or not?

963
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,960
What if it goes wrong?"

964
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,180
To a point where, "Hey, I want to do it.

965
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,980
Tell me how to do it the right way."

966
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,220
- And what you've talked
about is specifically like

967
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,200
from a use case perspective,
value, time to value,

968
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,840
efficiency, effectiveness,
experience, risk and control.

969
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,359
I think the partnership
brings so many more benefits

970
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,460
in the how you also do it.

971
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,100
Whether it is the fact that
you can now purchase Salesforce

972
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,329
through AWS marketplace.

973
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,700
It's not just the what
that you're implementing,

974
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,660
it's the how.

975
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,240
It's that there is an agent ecosystem,

976
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,880
or the AgentExchange,
where you've got agents

977
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,510
that you can now get that
are prebuilt through AWS

978
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,040
and through Salesforce together.

979
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,920
So it's a lot of the what
and the how, I'd say.

980
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,753
- Yeah, I would agree.

981
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,220
And I think like what,
and again, just going back

982
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,430
to like what has really
fueled this tectonic shift

983
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,667
is like these powerful
alliances and the partnership

984
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:20,310
and the interconnectivity
between different platforms.

985
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,860
Obviously we are talking
about Salesforce and AWS here.

986
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,240
But a similar thing is happening

987
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,340
with like Salesforce, Google Cloud.

988
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,500
Like there is Microsoft
doing their own thing.

989
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,440
So all these big platforms
have like come together

990
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,480
and they have forged these partnerships

991
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,480
because now everybody
is realizing that like,

992
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,050
hey, you can't really
do it all by yourself.

993
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,280
Doesn't matter how big you are,

994
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,780
whether you are Amazon,
Google, or like Apple,

995
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,960
like everybody is
realizing there is a need

996
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,100
to partner and collaborate
with each other.

997
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,740
- But here the partnership
that's most important

998
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,220
is Salesforce and AWS.
- For sure.

999
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,694
- That's the only one
we're talking about here.

1000
00:38:54,694 --> 00:38:55,910
- I agree.

1001
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,743
- I have not heard about the others.

1002
00:38:56,743 --> 00:38:57,576
- I didn't hear anyone else.

1003
00:38:57,576 --> 00:39:00,660
I didn't hear any other
name in that response.

1004
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,390
Amit, what governance
factors are important to you

1005
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,780
when you're choosing to
deploy Agentforce on AWS?

1006
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,000
- Yeah, so beyond just security,

1007
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,520
there are three key
governance factors for us.

1008
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,520
One is control, then compliance,

1009
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,578
and then finally collaboration as well.

1010
00:39:16,578 --> 00:39:17,411
- The three Cs.

1011
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:20,220
- Yeah, the three Cs is easier, right?

1012
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,120
The three Cs.

1013
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,300
So when it comes to compliance,
first of all, right.

1014
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:29,280
So, A, yeah, this model
basically contains the traffic,

1015
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,830
the LLM traffic within
the virtual private cloud

1016
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,030
of Salesforce, right.

1017
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,290
So the data is isolated,

1018
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,390
it does not leave the private environment.

1019
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,690
Couple it with data isolation

1020
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,650
and the policy of Claude
to not retain any data,

1021
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,990
it just helps us to know,

1022
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,450
I mean, it just improves the
compliance portion for us

1023
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,130
to know that this data is not being used

1024
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,170
to train the model itself.

1025
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,133
So it's added layer of
privacy, that's like one area.

1026
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:00,273
Second is when it comes to control,

1027
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,750
this model also gives us access

1028
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,220
to the command center, right.

1029
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,500
So the command center,

1030
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,680
we can control and we can
also monitor agents realtime

1031
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,000
for their performance, especially
their error rates, right,

1032
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,650
or their escalation parts.

1033
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,233
So this is super important for us.

1034
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,520
Beyond this, the third aspect
is obviously collaboration.

1035
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,590
We talked a bit about
agent-to-agent, right.

1036
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,510
So agent collaboration is very real.

1037
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:32,340
So an agent built on Agentforce
is expected to collaborate

1038
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,530
with the agent built with
a totally different LLM

1039
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,080
and totally different
ecosystem seamlessly.

1040
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,890
So basically this model
checks all the boxes for us.

1041
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:45,813
And you know, with the
use of A2A as well as,

1042
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,850
you know, MCP protocol, this
absolutely helps us, right.

1043
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,940
So it fits right well into
your enterprise strategy.

1044
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,810
- Great, great.

1045
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,130
And you talked about command center.

1046
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,930
Going onto a small tangent for a moment,

1047
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,520
like the command center,
you talked about it,

1048
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,440
but like the importance of it, again,

1049
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,980
as CIOs or tech leaders would
think about build versus buy,

1050
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,420
these are the things that
they wouldn't think about

1051
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,540
necessarily to say, "Am I
also gonna build the interface

1052
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,190
that is gonna allow me to test,

1053
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,480
if I'm building it from scratch,

1054
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,760
that's gonna enable me
and allow me to test it,

1055
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,640
or the interface that allows me to do..."

1056
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,410
You know, I think about an agent.

1057
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,030
So generative being a co-pilot,

1058
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,990
something that's sitting on the side,

1059
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:25,350
that's helping me type and
it helps me do something.

1060
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,890
With agentic being like a
colleague, a virtual colleague

1061
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,170
that's traversing the
halls of my organization.

1062
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,400
Now, when I joined Salesforce,

1063
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,200
I needed all the things
that this agent needs,

1064
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,760
including the quarterly check-ins

1065
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,250
that are happening post
one year in the job.

1066
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,660
And that command center acts as a bit

1067
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,160
of that quarterly check-in to say,

1068
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,500
is this digital worker performing the way

1069
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,510
that they were expected to perform?

1070
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,880
- Absolutely.
- Underscoring that point.

1071
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
It's very important.

1072
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,293
I'll take one more

1073
00:41:51,293 --> 00:41:53,520
and then we'll open it
up to the crowd again.

1074
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,540
Amit, back to you.

1075
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,310
So what mechanisms are
you putting in place

1076
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,210
to ensure control, auditability,
and prevent agent sprawl?

1077
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,320
Agent sprawl. My goodness.

1078
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,030
Like this feels like it's real.

1079
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:06,660
I can only imagine that
you are being inundated

1080
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,437
with every vendor under the sun going,

1081
00:42:08,437 --> 00:42:09,907
"Well, I've got an agent for you."

1082
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:12,030
"No, no, no, I've got an agent for you."

1083
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,990
So what do you do?
- Absolutely.

1084
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,910
I think this is a really,
really important question,

1085
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,320
especially for organizations

1086
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,950
who are adopting autonomous
AI at this point.

1087
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,320
And it's not an easy
answer to this, right.

1088
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,080
So you need like a
multi-dimensional framework

1089
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,040
to address this.

1090
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,690
It's a combination of people, process,

1091
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,790
and technology I would say.

1092
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,130
When it comes to control, first of all,

1093
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:35,070
to ensure that the agent
is indeed responding

1094
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,870
or actioning within the boundaries

1095
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:40,500
and with human intent
for those high priority

1096
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,660
or really critical use cases.

1097
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,700
Like for example,
processing a payment, right.

1098
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,930
So you always need a human
in the loop initially, right,

1099
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,770
until you gain a lot of confidence

1100
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,510
with this particular framework, right.

1101
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,280
So that is really, really important.

1102
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,350
Beyond that, I think it's very important

1103
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,050
to have like a stop switch

1104
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,880
and a rollback mechanism for an agent.

1105
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,880
If you see that it's either hallucinating,

1106
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,180
or let's say it's drifting a bit, right.

1107
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,700
So that is number two,
which is very important.

1108
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,720
And you also have to
periodically just take a look

1109
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,720
into what is the data this
agent is accessing, right?

1110
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,940
And just reassess and kind of
build those guardrails around.

1111
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:25,834
Just look at the security posture of this,

1112
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:28,680
the risk classification of
this particular agent, right,

1113
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,680
and all the action that it is
doing and keep on readjusting.

1114
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,530
So that's very important
when it comes to control.

1115
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,570
The second aspect is auditability.

1116
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,760
I think we talked a
bit about auditability,

1117
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,860
but really auditability is all about

1118
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,960
we should be able to
trace everything back,

1119
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,900
every action and decision
taken by the agent,

1120
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,120
back all the way to its origin.

1121
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,180
Either, you know, for
compliance purpose, that's one.

1122
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,890
And second is if there is an incident,

1123
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,850
the post-incident kind of analysis, right.

1124
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,710
So we talked a bit about command center,

1125
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,570
but then there is also testing center,

1126
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,040
which is really, really important.

1127
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,670
Beyond testing center,
enhanced audit logs.

1128
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:06,503
Those are really, really important.

1129
00:44:06,503 --> 00:44:11,503
And we, at CrowdStrike, we
love to use this information,

1130
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,830
process into a language
that we really understand,

1131
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:18,830
so that we build those
additional layer of traceability

1132
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,870
and detailed logging into
the tool of our liking.

1133
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,400
So that's what we're doing.
- And again, all of this

1134
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,130
out of the box as you had
invested in Agentforce.

1135
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,170
- Obviously. It starts there.

1136
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,150
We have all the information, and you know,

1137
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,520
front-facing people are used
to different layers, right.

1138
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,320
So we apply some layer, homegrown.

1139
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,790
- Yeah.

1140
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,500
- I think the third most important topic,

1141
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,550
agent sprawl, right.

1142
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,490
So again, This is a
rapidly evolving space.

1143
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,340
So new terms are getting coined, right.

1144
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,670
So agent sprawl is basically
proliferation of agent, right.

1145
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,370
I know folks might know
here, but just reiterating,

1146
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,940
proliferation of agents, but
agents which are unmanaged,

1147
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,400
unsupervised, redundant, right.

1148
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,360
The risk is, you know,

1149
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,210
they might be security risk, number one.

1150
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,000
Second is there might be
a lot of cost overruns

1151
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,380
with this agent.

1152
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,443
In order to avoid agent sprawl,

1153
00:45:06,443 --> 00:45:10,050
A, it's very important that
you build an agent registry.

1154
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,960
So agent registry is very simple, right.

1155
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,250
The concept is very simple, right.

1156
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,933
Like what is the agent, right?

1157
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,150
What is the scope of the agent?

1158
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,980
What is the API scope of the agent?

1159
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,500
What is the data scope of the agent?

1160
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,510
What exactly is the risk classification

1161
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:26,430
of this particular agent, right?

1162
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,900
You need to have all this information.

1163
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,760
Beyond that, once you build an agent,

1164
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,280
you also need to outline
its complete life cycle,

1165
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,580
right from the inception
of agent all the way up

1166
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,300
to the decommissioning
or archival of the agent.

1167
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,900
That's really, really important.

1168
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,220
I mean these are couple of areas

1169
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,200
which will help with the agent sprawl.

1170
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,250
Beyond that, I think the agent

1171
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,110
should also have some owners, right.

1172
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:50,580
And ownership,

1173
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,680
it's going to be a shared
responsibility, right?

1174
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,840
At this point we are at a stage

1175
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,860
wherein business is super
excited with the agentic world.

1176
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,740
So they want access to the
agent, they wanna build.

1177
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,180
Because they look at it, it's a prompt,

1178
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,680
we can go and we can build something,

1179
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,427
they want to do it, right?
- It's like RPA all over.

1180
00:46:06,427 --> 00:46:08,220
Blueprint them all over again.

1181
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,090
- Yeah, exactly.

1182
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,650
So I think it's very important

1183
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,870
to draw certain boundaries initially

1184
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,610
while you are on this journey,

1185
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,430
wherein, you know, an agent
gets a business owner, right,

1186
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,920
who is responsible for mainly its value,

1187
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,050
and then agent also gets an IT owner,

1188
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,690
who is responsible for
its maintenance, right.

1189
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:25,800
I think it was a lot of talking,

1190
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,860
but if you combine this
particular framework,

1191
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,371
I think this may avoid the chaos

1192
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:35,220
and help you run the agentic
enterprise successfully.

1193
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,320
- Yeah, and I'll put in a shameless plug

1194
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,480
on behalf of Salesforce,
is that this is exactly,

1195
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,830
agent sprawl, what you just described,

1196
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,810
what a lot of organizations are facing,

1197
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,930
is exactly why we released
MuleSoft Agent Fabric.

1198
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:46,860
- Yeah.

1199
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,500
- It's a capability that enables all-

1200
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,580
Oh, and we've got a question here.

1201
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,080
We'll come to you after.

1202
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,490
It's a capability that enables you

1203
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:54,720
to be able to look at agents

1204
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,370
that are not just Salesforce agents,

1205
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,340
not just Agentforce, but
agents across the ecosystem,

1206
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:02,040
and be able to put a layer of governance

1207
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,163
and control over those
agents and that transparency.

1208
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,133
- [AUDIENCE 2] Can you talk a little bit

1209
00:47:07,133 --> 00:47:08,245
about the orchestration layer,

1210
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:12,000
using the same models to
manage your Agentforce?

1211
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,572
And also, have you noticed
any emergent behaviors

1212
00:47:14,572 --> 00:47:16,072
from your system-,

1213
00:47:19,682 --> 00:47:20,946
- Okay, so orchestrational layer.

1214
00:47:20,946 --> 00:47:22,720
- I think you should go for it.

1215
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,990
- So, and let me try to
repeat your question.

1216
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:28,140
So you're saying that for
this agent orchestration,

1217
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,680
are you using a separate LLM for it, or?

1218
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,820
Yeah. Okay.

1219
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,000
So I mean, kind of,
you could say that way,

1220
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,470
because there is always,

1221
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,690
there could be a headless
agent orchestration.

1222
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,850
There could be one agent
which actually does

1223
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:44,490
all the distribution to
the various other agents,

1224
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:48,210
like a main agent orchestrator
sitting over the top of it.

1225
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:51,720
So yes, wherever there is an agent module,

1226
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,150
it has to be backed up by an LLM.

1227
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,153
But it also has to have a good agent SDK,

1228
00:47:57,153 --> 00:47:59,310
like what Salesforce
has, its own agent graph

1229
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,860
to come up with a very deterministic rule

1230
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,330
that what exactly and how exactly

1231
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:05,400
you're going to execute
this particular task.

1232
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,080
Will it be calling multiple agents?

1233
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,890
So that particular
combination of the right SDK

1234
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:14,520
and the right LLM at every
other agent hierarchy,

1235
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,590
multi-agent hierarchy is important.

1236
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:17,850
So I would say, yeah.

1237
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:18,690
To answer your question, yes,

1238
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,370
there is a separate LLM for each of that

1239
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:22,260
and those LLMs you could select

1240
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,571
in the model optionality part.

1241
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,475
- [AUDIENCE 2] Any emergent behaviors?

1242
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:27,642
Is it always-,

1243
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,920
- I think the emergent behavior

1244
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,190
is it has to be really
bidirectional contact sharing

1245
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:37,080
and a lot of things which
you need to really have

1246
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,673
in A2A type of communication.

1247
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,553
But I would say, yeah,

1248
00:48:40,553 --> 00:48:43,050
these are some of the
things which we are seeing

1249
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:46,530
that's trending is more of like
agent-to-agent collaboration

1250
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:50,730
is more towards how
those shared systems are,

1251
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,410
or how the systems are shared together.

1252
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:54,330
Like all the way from,
as Shibani mentioned

1253
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,280
about observability,
governance, and other things.

1254
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,750
So that's coming up now.

1255
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,460
A lot of things are trending on that area

1256
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,700
where governance, observability, identity,

1257
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,570
these three things, I mean,

1258
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:06,027
I think I would say are
key important roles.

1259
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,860
- Oh, I wouldn't say that it's a behavior,

1260
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,200
but it is an insight that has come.

1261
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,900
I think when, like, just to back it up,

1262
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,710
agentic or autonomous agents
have only existed for a year.

1263
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:18,690
Like, it hasn't even
existed for a long time.

1264
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:21,360
Like, it's as old as I am at Salesforce.

1265
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,700
One of the patterns that has
emerged is I think early days

1266
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,100
of agentic architecture,
autonomous agents,

1267
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,530
there was this idea that
they're non-deterministic.

1268
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,990
You know, you ask them a
question using these LLMs,

1269
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:32,310
it'll give you a response.

1270
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:33,360
You ask that question again

1271
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,590
based on the context that it gains,

1272
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,390
it might answer it slightly differently.

1273
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,040
Well, one of the patterns that emerged

1274
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,480
was actually there are times

1275
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,430
where you don't want autonomous agents

1276
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:43,590
to answer a question inconsistently.

1277
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:46,680
And that's where adaptive
reasoning really came into play.

1278
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,390
I think that I'd say maybe
what, three months ago,

1279
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:49,223
three, four months ago,

1280
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:51,120
where there was a greater
focus to say, no, no, no,

1281
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,560
there are times when,

1282
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,930
particularly in a highly
regulated industry,

1283
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:57,240
there is no discretion in
how a question is answered.

1284
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,380
It's black and white.

1285
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,420
And so that is something
that's been really emerged,

1286
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,760
or a pattern that I've seen that,

1287
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,010
again, at Salesforce,
we've doubled down on that

1288
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,690
to ensure that we've
got adaptive reasoning.

1289
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:09,450
Meaning where you want
a consistent response,

1290
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:11,550
you have the ability to hard code that in.

1291
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,350
Where you want there to be some autonomy,

1292
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:16,620
some thinking, like mimicking
the patterns of a human,

1293
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,870
you can also enable that.

1294
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:23,160
Okay. I'm gonna go on to
the next one that I've got.

1295
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,690
Hrushi, how does the
combined power of Agentforce

1296
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:28,560
and AWS help teams enforce
AI governance and guardrails?

1297
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,210
And you could see that
governance and guardrails,

1298
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:32,160
like this is a pretty big
theme that we've come out with

1299
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,870
because this has been top of mind

1300
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:36,060
for a number of the tech leaders

1301
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,460
that all of us have been speaking with.

1302
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,220
- So I think, Amit, you've
talked about a bit on that part.

1303
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:44,220
Let me expand and show my perspective here

1304
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:48,090
that AI governance, specifically
in the Agentforce stack,

1305
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:50,940
is three integrated layers.

1306
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,590
At the application layer,

1307
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:55,800
It's an Agentforce trust
layer that comes into picture,

1308
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,560
which does like data masking of PII data,

1309
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,320
or prompt injection
detection, toxicity detection,

1310
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,050
and also does a complete audit logging

1311
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:06,600
at all Agentforce interaction,

1312
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,570
adhering to all the automation
policy at every touch point,

1313
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:12,350
including the agent
interoperability, right.

1314
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:15,180
At the second layer, which
is basically the model layer.

1315
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,353
So Agentforce using Anthropic
Claude Sonnet on Bedrock,

1316
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,140
which is basically the
Anthropic Claude Model

1317
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,370
is built on, as you mentioned,

1318
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:25,560
the constitutional AI principle

1319
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,160
to be helpful, harmless,
and honest by default.

1320
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,790
So this actually helps
reduce the non-compliant

1321
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,760
or toxic data even triggering
the Salesforce trust layer.

1322
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,410
It gets activated before that, right.

1323
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:39,390
So it gets a double protection.

1324
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:41,610
And the third thing which
I will talk about is,

1325
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:42,540
and in addition to that,

1326
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,220
I would say Claude Sonnet
is also very strong

1327
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,420
at instruction following, right.

1328
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,420
That will help to do a kind
of a reliable, you know,

1329
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,520
adherence to the organization policies.

1330
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,650
Now the last layer, which
is the inferencing layer,

1331
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:53,850
which is on the Bedrock,

1332
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:56,930
and some of the trust models
runs on the Amazon SageMaker

1333
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:00,210
in the private network of Salesforce.

1334
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:03,420
That gives you like a complete
control about your data

1335
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,280
not leaving the trust boundary.

1336
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,430
More importantly, it also
gives you good traceability,

1337
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,230
you know, good auditability,

1338
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,510
and then I think good
visibility to this entire thing.

1339
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:14,700
So entire governance stuff.

1340
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,190
So I would say, just to summarize this,

1341
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:19,920
it's a kind of a defense in depth approach

1342
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,500
where our customers are getting,

1343
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,000
I mean it's a complete visibility

1344
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,300
and control on the AI
behavior with compliance,

1345
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,050
audit logging, and all those
aspects available to them.

1346
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,240
- Fabulous. Okay.

1347
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,800
Pravin, back to you.

1348
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,530
Top three steps Deloitte
is recommending to clients

1349
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,593
to quickly and effectively
enhance AI data governance.

1350
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,137
- Yeah, that's a great question

1351
00:52:43,137 --> 00:52:45,600
and I think it's also timely

1352
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,830
because I think we have spoken

1353
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,625
about the governance throughout this.

1354
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:49,458
- Yeah.

1355
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,110
- Amit covered it, part of it.

1356
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,123
You mentioned some of it as well.

1357
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,544
I think obviously for
all the right reasons,

1358
00:52:57,544 --> 00:52:59,820
every enterprise is trying to get

1359
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,640
on the agentic enterprise journey.

1360
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,950
And as they do it, obviously
for all the right reasons,

1361
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:07,440
because there is like
a huge business impact

1362
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,010
and the benefits that
could be gained from that.

1363
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:14,070
At the same time, there is also need

1364
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:17,640
to recognize the risk associated with it,

1365
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,500
like if you don't do it right.

1366
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,630
And some of the key things that obviously,

1367
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:24,210
one of the very first things
that we did at Deloitte,

1368
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,810
and this is almost like
18, 24 months back,

1369
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:31,830
we defined what we called
a trustworthy AI framework

1370
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:34,350
and that's what we take to our clients.

1371
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,560
And obviously, if you
go to like deloitte.com

1372
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,860
or like Google it, you'll find
like more details around it.

1373
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,750
But the top three things that we recommend

1374
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,700
to the clients based on the experiences,

1375
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,250
number one is you need to define

1376
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,517
and stand up your AI governance framework.

1377
00:53:50,517 --> 00:53:52,380
And there needs to be recognition

1378
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,860
that AI governance is
no more like a security

1379
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:00,450
or IT team's, whatever the word is.

1380
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:03,930
That's not, it's not their
own ownership anymore.

1381
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:07,377
You need to recognize AI
governance as a business problem

1382
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,858
and it needs to be dealt
as a business problem.

1383
00:54:09,858 --> 00:54:11,130
And you need to solve

1384
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,900
as a business problem.
- Yeah, exactly.

1385
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,240
- Yeah. And then you need
to have that top down buy in

1386
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,140
from your leadership.

1387
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,330
And that's one of the things that I like

1388
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:21,420
when we work with Amit and
his team at CrowdStrike,

1389
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:25,860
is there is this top level,
like right from CIO down,

1390
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,820
there is a full buy in

1391
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:30,240
on like we want to be on the agentic path,

1392
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,490
we want to be an agentic enterprise

1393
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:35,523
and we are invested in making
it happen the right way.

1394
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:40,110
The second thing that I
would say is obviously

1395
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,110
making sure you are defining
your overall data governance

1396
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:45,300
and then make sure you create a visibility

1397
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,970
of your data's lifecycle.

1398
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:49,920
What that means is from the standpoint

1399
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,770
of documenting all your data
sources, where the data exists,

1400
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,630
what elements of that data you are using,

1401
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:57,480
in what context would they
be used in your models,

1402
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,200
how they enter into the
models and what happens

1403
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,690
from like the time they
enter into the model

1404
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:06,900
to getting into the outputs
that it generates, right.

1405
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,900
And having that like
inventory of like your data

1406
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,640
and creating that visibility

1407
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,100
creates that trust with your stakeholders.

1408
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,410
If you don't earn that trust upfront,

1409
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,140
then you're gonna struggle
with like getting that adoption

1410
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:23,220
from your business stakeholders
and even your customers.

1411
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:26,400
And then I think the third,
maybe I will say four things,

1412
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,830
but the third thing is more around like

1413
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:31,410
making sure you are automating some

1414
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:34,980
of your ongoing continuous monitoring

1415
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,570
of what Amit was mentioning, right.

1416
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:39,420
You cannot really rely on
somebody doing it periodically,

1417
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:44,160
or some human trying to
do those audits for you.

1418
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,740
You have to like automate
it, make it proactive,

1419
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,047
and make sure you get
those proactive alerts.

1420
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:50,760
And if something is going wrong,

1421
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,950
you can define your
thresholds around like,

1422
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,630
what is your hallucination threshold?

1423
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:55,980
What is your error threshold?

1424
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,020
And if those thresholds get breached,

1425
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,400
the system is able to alert it

1426
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,680
and you're able to course correct quickly.

1427
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,210
And the last thing that I would say,

1428
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:06,420
and this is going back to the
point that Amit was making

1429
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,130
around like agent sprawl

1430
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:11,070
and like documenting all
the agentic use cases.

1431
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,020
One of the things that
we tell to the clients,

1432
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,258
and we have had these
conversations with Amit as well,

1433
00:56:15,258 --> 00:56:18,240
is documenting your agentic use cases,

1434
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,000
but also documenting all the
models that you are using

1435
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,980
and make sure you're not creating,

1436
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,380
another terminology that is
in the industry right now

1437
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,150
is shadow AI.
- Yes.

1438
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,830
- So you don't want to have the shadow AI.

1439
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:32,400
Somebody wanted to do something
fancy because they liked it

1440
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,290
and then nobody knows about it.

1441
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:36,960
And if you don't know what
you are trying to protect,

1442
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,220
you're not gonna protect it.

1443
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,840
- Right.
- So that's the key.

1444
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,950
So those are the four things

1445
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:43,980
that I would say are the top things,

1446
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,413
but obviously we can talk more.

1447
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:46,650
Like this is one of the topics

1448
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,510
where we can keep talking about.

1449
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:49,343
- Well good.
- Yeah.

1450
00:56:49,343 --> 00:56:50,670
- And for those that are in the crowd,

1451
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:51,840
if anyone does have a question,

1452
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,640
we'll make sure we corner these gentlemen,

1453
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,750
make sure we keep them behind

1454
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,390
so you can ask any of the
questions that you've got.

1455
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:58,920
Okay. One more, Amit.

1456
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,080
You know, 'cause we're
getting down to the clock.

1457
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,280
Tell us about your journey with Deloitte,

1458
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,220
your path to success with
Agentforce, AWS, Deloitte.

1459
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:08,130
Like just, this is an open,
more broader question.

1460
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,090
- Absolutely. Yeah.

1461
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:10,530
- Were you gonna do it on your own?

1462
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:11,910
Did you decide to do it with a partner?

1463
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:13,260
Like, how did you get to that?

1464
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,870
- It's an exciting partnership
equilibrium, right.

1465
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:19,170
So Deloitte has been a trusted
partner for CrowdStrike.

1466
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,630
It's been years.
- Yeah.

1467
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:25,950
- And Deloitte brings those
transformative mindset

1468
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:29,700
right on the table, helps
us think outside of the box.

1469
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,650
When you guys are starting
with your agentic journey,

1470
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:32,940
you really have a few options.

1471
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,280
Like, A, you can train your internal team,

1472
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,300
that's number one.

1473
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,760
Second is you can hire new talent, right.

1474
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,680
Third is you work with a partner,

1475
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,410
and the partner can really
give you a jumpstart

1476
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:46,050
or rather slingshot, I would say,

1477
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:48,690
because I mean, this is that era, right.

1478
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,880
So they can bring in the
governance, leadership,

1479
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,410
the execution acumen,

1480
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:53,970
and that's where Deloitte comes in, right.

1481
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:58,500
So we started our journey
on agentic pretty recently,

1482
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,180
but looking at the output

1483
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,220
that we have delivered the past quarter

1484
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,610
and what comes ahead
in the next fiscal year

1485
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:06,443
and coming quarters,

1486
00:58:06,443 --> 00:58:08,520
I'm really, really excited
about the roadmap, right.

1487
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,303
Our strategy is very simple.

1488
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,200
A is, yeah, we give those
tactical accelerators

1489
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,370
to business folks, right.

1490
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:16,620
One that they ask for, right.

1491
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,900
And beyond that, we don't lose sight

1492
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,700
to the wider agentic roadmap, right.

1493
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,900
So we want our business teams

1494
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,510
to really reimagine their
existing workflows as well

1495
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,600
and really come up with
a very different mindset

1496
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,513
and open mindset to agentify stuff, right.

1497
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,810
And I think the path to success
is exactly the same, right.

1498
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:37,290
Like, A, it's not only
delivering the strategic

1499
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:40,230
like high efficiency gains

1500
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:43,560
in like a quick turnaround
time, that's number one.

1501
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,450
But at the same time also ensuring

1502
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:50,450
that the wider processes are
reimagined via agentic lens.

1503
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,553
- That's great.

1504
00:58:52,553 --> 00:58:55,020
And again, while agentic autonomous

1505
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,580
might have only existed for one year,

1506
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,460
partners like Deloitte really
bring the learned experiences

1507
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,930
from even generative implementation,

1508
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,730
AI broad implementation.

1509
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:04,080
They see it across all of their clients.

1510
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,100
They bring it to you.

1511
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,180
- Absolutely.

1512
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,560
- Great, thank you.

1513
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,110
Any questions from the crowd before we?

1514
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:11,231
Yes.

1515
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,301
- [AUDIENCE 3] So what's
the role of the Cloud-,

1516
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,736
And I know you have different-,

1517
00:59:17,736 --> 00:59:21,173
Sales Cloud and multiple
Salesforce Clouds.

1518
00:59:21,173 --> 00:59:23,192
- Yes.
- So what's the role of-

1519
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:25,430
- So, I can...

1520
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,800
Oh, look at this. We're
getting the curtains.

1521
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,790
We've got six seconds
left for that question.

1522
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,280
So Data 360, now Data
Cloud is called Data 360,

1523
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,140
I'll do the very quick version of it.

1524
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,790
You have a lot of data
lakes and warehouses.

1525
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:42,450
Like, at my organization I
had Azure, I had Databricks,

1526
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:45,210
Snowflake, but all of
those lakes and warehouses,

1527
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,830
you couldn't actually extract data

1528
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:49,020
to operationally leverage that data

1529
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,970
to activate it across your ecosystem.

1530
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,010
What Data 360 or Data Cloud ended up being

1531
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,630
was a thin activation layer.

1532
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:57,060
It wasn't like, it wasn't
warehouse, it had zero copy,

1533
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,300
meaning the data stays within
those lakes and warehouses

1534
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,130
through a zero copy partnership.

1535
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:04,080
You could extract that
data, you could activate it,

1536
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,240
you could use it, whether
it's for personalization,

1537
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,160
whether it's for an
agent to perform actions,

1538
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,760
and it would remain in the
respective lakes and warehouses.

1539
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,700
The other clouds, those are just products.

1540
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,700
I don't know why, we're
changing that as well.

1541
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,880
Like Marketing Cloud is
just a suite of modules

1542
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,720
that enable marketing
in a more efficient way.

1543
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,520
Sales Cloud is your CRM.

1544
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,470
Service Cloud is like workflows

1545
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:31,293
and case management, as examples.

1546
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,210
Okay, friends, they wanna
thank you all for sticking.

1547
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:37,230
We got right to the end,

1548
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:39,690
got a couple of questions
