1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,030
- Well, look at this. Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,800
So you paid for the whole seat,

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,940
you're only gonna need the edge.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,930
My name is Brian Vecci.

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,400
I'm the field CTO at Varonis

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,060
and I've got 20 minutes
before you all go get drunk

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,700
to talk about beyond posture management.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,020
I'm gonna talk about data security.

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,100
For those of you that don't know,

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,960
Varonis is a data security platform.

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,800
And I've been doing this
for close to 16 years now.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,170
I was in IT and IT security before that.

13
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,790
And one of the things that I learned,

14
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,090
16 years in cybersecurity, is
that attackers don't break in,

15
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:30,923
they log in.

16
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:32,160
I think we all know this.

17
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,050
Nobody breaks into a
bank to steal the pens.

18
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,330
If somebody gets access
to your infrastructure,

19
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,980
compromises an identity,
compromises an API, owns a device,

20
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,150
they're going after data,

21
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,010
but they're doing it through identities.

22
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,260
88% of data breaches

23
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,960
involve some sort of stolen credentials.

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,360
The best and easiest, fastest and best way

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,950
to get in to your infrastructure
is to steal an identity.

26
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,690
What happens when that happens?

27
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,940
Somebody logs in with those credentials.

28
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,030
Then, they exploit the blast
radius, they move laterally.

29
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,640
In the cloud, that means going
to different infrastructure

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,170
or different applications.

31
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,730
They elevate their privileges,

32
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,520
ideally getting access
to an admin account.

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,440
They establish persistence,

34
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,630
creating new identities and new accounts,

35
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,390
but the goal is always to get access to

36
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,780
so that they can steal and encrypt data.

37
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,060
The kinds of things being in the wild

38
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,970
are Codefinger, ransomware, and AWS.

39
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,420
This doesn't exploit
any AWS vulnerability.

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,820
It exploits an identity to get access

41
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,570
to data in your AWS environment,
and then it's ransomware,

42
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,070
to get access to it, steal it,

43
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,990
encrypt it, and hold it for ransom.

44
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,000
How might attackers do that?

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
Well, we're seeing things

46
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,880
like infostealer malware in the wild,

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,480
people putting malware into game cracks

48
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,540
that they host in GitHub
that users then download,

49
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,060
and then, of course, their
identities are stolen.

50
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,090
If I can get access to your
credentials, to your identity,

51
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,570
I can use that to establish
persistence, move laterally,

52
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,200
and get access to and steal data.

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,200
It's really all about
data. I said it before.

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,820
But if I get access to an identity,

55
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,640
if I get access to an API,
if I own one of your devices,

56
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,700
I'm not just going to look
at configuration files.

57
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,170
I'm not just gonna explore.

58
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,400
Data is the target.

59
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,740
Data is what has value.

60
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,540
Nobody breaks into a
bank to steal the pen.

61
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,220
They are after money.

62
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,500
Your threat actors, the
attackers that you're trying

63
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,350
to defend against are after data.

64
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,930
And there's lots of
vectors that a threat actor

65
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,870
is going to use to get
access to those identities

66
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,660
that they then will use to access data,

67
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,170
whether it's a phishing attack
or a supply chain compromise.

68
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,450
We have advanced persistent
threats that we see

69
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,060
in almost every big
environment in the world.

70
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,150
The goal, of course, is
to get access to data.

71
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,210
Now, DSPM, data security
posture management,

72
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,290
CSPM, configuration posture
management, is not enough.

73
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,100
It is one set of controls,
one set of defenses,

74
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,960
but it's not enough to protect you.

75
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,660
It can't detect changes in authorization.

76
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,580
It can't detect lateral movement going

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,450
from one piece of structure,
like your AWS environment,

78
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,080
to another hyperscaler,
or from a SaaS platform,

79
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,360
like Salesforce, in your AWS environment.

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,090
It's not gonna detect abnormal behavior

81
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,860
because these tools don't look

82
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,220
at how identities actually access data.

83
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,630
And it's not gonna detect
any current active threats

84
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,710
or insider threats.

85
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,830
If somebody already has valid credentials,

86
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,120
then they start accessing something

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,760
that they've never looked at
before, how would you know?

88
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,160
They are not exploiting the controls

89
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,160
that DSPM and CSPM are
designed to help you fix.

90
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,380
Posture management is one
piece of the security puzzle.

91
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,870
If you think about how
an attacker behaves,

92
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,370
you need identity protection.

93
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,870
You need to look at all of the accounts,

94
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,600
internal and external, in
all of the applications

95
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,160
and in all of the infrastructure,

96
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,860
whether it's a global identity
or an application identity,

97
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,010
whether it's a user identity
or a machine identity.

98
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,590
You also need to monitor
and manage your data

99
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,570
and configuration security posture.

100
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,080
You need data centric-user
and entity behavior analytics.

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,310
That means is you need to watch

102
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,110
how all these identities behave

103
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,600
and you need to look at the
data that they're accessing

104
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,970
and you need a full set of forensics

105
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,760
so that you can come quickly
to a complete picture

106
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,230
about what happened.

107
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,470
If you're a CISO or if
you're in a security team,

108
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,110
you generally wanna do four things.

109
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,698
You wanna stop breaches, you
wanna avoid paying any fines,

110
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:36,660
you wanna stop having to hire people

111
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,150
or pay others to do all of this work,

112
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,400
and you wanna be able to
prove that you did it.

113
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,140
Where did we start? Where did we finish?

114
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,030
How are we implementing these controls?

115
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,590
And what does right look like?

116
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,670
How can we prove

117
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,730
that we're actually
protecting our environment?

118
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,620
Let's start with identity protection.

119
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,130
You need to protect against the
most used methods of attack.

120
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,070
88% of data breaches involve a stolen

121
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,600
or compromised identity.

122
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,370
That means you need to watch identities.

123
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,380
You need to know what right looks like,

124
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,750
which are our human, which
are our machine identities.

125
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,540
And you need to remove excess privileges.

126
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,040
A lot of us have been trying
to solve these problems

127
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,290
by using identity and access management,

128
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,540
but that is only one piece of the puzzle.

129
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,600
Imagine when somebody or
something authenticates,

130
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,839
what do they actually have access to?

131
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,770
At Varonis, we do data risk assessments

132
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,230
for our customers in
their AWS environments.

133
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,200
And what we find is up to 40% of the data

134
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,280
that they're trying to protect

135
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,503
is open to literally every single account

136
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:36,570
that can authenticate to the environment.

137
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,650
Think about that.

138
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,290
Imagine if 40% of the
money in your bank account

139
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,470
would be anybody that
could walk in the door.

140
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,480
How long would you keep that money?

141
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,760
So you need strong identity protection,

142
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,820
but you need to manage the blast
radius of those identities.

143
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,060
Ensure least privilege, remove exposure,

144
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,560
but you need to do that safely.

145
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,840
In security, one of the things
that gets us in trouble most

146
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,180
is when we're like a bull in a China shop.

147
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,940
If you start making changes
without understanding

148
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,530
what those identities have access to

149
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,080
and how they've been
accessing that information,

150
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,680
you run the risk of breaking
things as you fix them.

151
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,830
Using that telemetry,
watching how data is accessed

152
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,560
by who and by what with the context

153
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,600
of what data is sensitive and important,

154
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,980
where do we have credentials?

155
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,630
Where do we have sensitive information,

156
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,930
like PII or intellectual
property or source code?

157
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,060
Once you have all of that context,

158
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,490
you can enrich logging and behavior,

159
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,870
and then you get useful user
and entity behavior analytics.

160
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,150
You can minimize the time it takes

161
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,040
to detect and respond to a threat.

162
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,830
The easiest analogy here
is your credit card.

163
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,890
We use credit cards primarily or partly

164
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,270
because they are safe.

165
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,890
Your credit card company knows who you are

166
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,360
and where you live and where you travel.

167
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,970
My credit card company knows
that I'm in Las Vegas today

168
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,040
because I booked a flight
using my credit card.

169
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,680
My credit card company knows
the kinds of things I buy,

170
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,290
the amounts that I buy,
and when I tend to shop.

171
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,380
So when somebody uses my
number to buy gas in Montreal,

172
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,150
a place that I'm not currently,

173
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,040
and that's a pattern
that a threat actor uses

174
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,090
to test a credit card number,

175
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,910
they know instantly that's fraud.

176
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,640
If you watch your data and
you watch your identity

177
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,560
with the context of what the data is

178
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,200
and who the identities are,
which accounts are human,

179
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,540
which accounts are machine,
what they have access to,

180
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,820
who they work with, how
they normally behave,

181
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,130
when and where and on what data types,

182
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,800
it turns out you can
minimize how long it takes

183
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,420
to detect and respond to threats

184
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,750
by alerting on things
without a lot of noise.

185
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,250
And then you need a forensics layer.

186
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,770
You need to be able to quickly

187
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,313
and completely answer the
question, what happened?

188
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,910
I've been involved with a
lot of incident response,

189
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,800
over the last 15 years,

190
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,360
and one of the things that I've learned

191
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,000
is that when there is an
incident, an insider threat,

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,560
an APT, an advanced attack,
a global data breach,

193
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,080
like what happened with SolarWinds,

194
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,020
the first question that gets asked isn't

195
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,300
how do we fix this or how do we recover.

196
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,410
The first question that gets
asked is what data was touched?

197
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,970
Was anything stolen?

198
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,320
Do we have to tell our employees?

199
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,880
Do we have to tell our customers?

200
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,790
If we're a public company,
do we need to tell the SEC?

201
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,980
Was there anything
material that was stolen?

202
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,040
And how do we minimize the damage?

203
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,930
That's the first question
and the second question

204
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,850
and the third question that gets asked.

205
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,920
Ask yourselves, as security professionals,

206
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,320
how long would it take
to answer the question,

207
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,730
what data was touched?

208
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,160
And then, how did the
threat actor get there?

209
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,690
What identity was compromised?

210
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,190
What permissions were changed?

211
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,170
Were there privileges that were escalated?

212
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,490
Was there lateral movement?

213
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,000
Do I have a single pane of
glass that'll tell me exactly

214
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,560
how this all happened?

215
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,310
At Varonis, we've built
a data security platform

216
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,560
over the last 20 years to do exactly that.

217
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,649
Now, some of you might
be thinking, "20 years?

218
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,910
AWS didn't exist 20 years ago."

219
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,620
It's 'cause 20 years
ago, nobody could do this

220
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,370
on a single file system
in a single data center,

221
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,630
let alone, these days,

222
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,940
where all of the places
that your data lives.

223
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,220
It lives in files. It lives in databases.

224
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,020
It lives in all of the hyperscalers.

225
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,460
It lives in S3 buckets.

226
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,910
It lives in databases
that live in RDS or EC2.

227
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,040
It lives in your AWS environment,

228
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,530
but it also lives in
the other hyperscalers.

229
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,490
And for many of you,

230
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,660
it still lives in your
data centers on premises.

231
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,120
What Varonis is is a
data security platform

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,250
designed to give you observability

233
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,930
so you can find these problems,

234
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,690
classify data accurately, cross cloud,

235
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,100
and in hybrid environments,

236
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,460
classify data accurately
in structured, unstructured

237
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,780
SaaS application databases,
files, collaborative platforms.

238
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,970
We'll give you observability
to where that data is.

239
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,640
And observability isn't
just data classification.

240
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,320
It's not just what's sensitive.

241
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,300
It's who and what has access to it.

242
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,470
And to do that, you need to look

243
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,990
at all of the access
controls, the deep links,

244
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,570
the permissions on all
of these containers.

245
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,100
You need to look at all of the identities

246
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,600
and all of their entitlements,

247
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,640
and you need to combine
all of them together

248
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,260
so that you can answer the question,

249
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,660
what on earth does Brian have access to?

250
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,850
What does this account have access to?

251
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,360
Who has access to this
sensitive data in this S3 bucket

252
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,950
or this Salesforce record

253
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,400
or this file sitting inside
a virtualized file server?

254
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,200
Varonis unravels all of that for you

255
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,380
so you can find problems,
you can identify exposures,

256
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,530
you can map access, and
you can measure risk.

257
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,750
But finding problems isn't enough.

258
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,430
Findings fatigue is a real thing.

259
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,130
If I just give you a list
of the hundreds of thousands

260
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,890
or millions of problems
that you have to solve,

261
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,390
that's not a solution.

262
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,940
Who among us has the people to go respond

263
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,490
to hundreds of thousands
of help desk tickets

264
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,310
or service tickets to go
fix all of these problems?

265
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,200
So Varonis takes all of this telemetry,

266
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,720
including all of the behavior information.

267
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,960
How is this data being
accessed by who and what?

268
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,140
How are these identities
authenticating and from where?

269
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,380
How is data flowing between
all of our infrastructure?

270
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,200
We use all that telemetry
to build automation.

271
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,140
And it's automation that
can be deployed safely.

272
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,650
If I'm gonna remove a
permission or fix an exposure,

273
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,040
I better know exactly what
might break when I do that,

274
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,260
so that, when I make
changes, I can do it safely.

275
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,060
And that's exactly what Varonis does.

276
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,890
We're watching how all of this data

277
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,230
is being used by who and what,

278
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,960
so when you apply
policies, you do it safely.

279
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,360
You can be surgical, but it's automatic.

280
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,880
So you can reduce risk
without breaking anything

281
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,920
and without requiring a lot of effort.

282
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,440
And because we have the
telemetry in the context

283
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,210
of what data is used by who and what,

284
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,250
from which devices and which services.

285
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,250
In all of the places that
Varonis provides visibility,

286
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,580
we give you useful user
entity behavior analytics

287
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,260
without a lot of noise.

288
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,310
We generate a very small alerts
that have a lot of context

289
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,240
about why there's a threat
that you need to respond to.

290
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,480
You can lock down your AWS IDM

291
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,720
so you can ensure that identities
are properly configured,

292
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,850
that your infrastructure's
properly configured,

293
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,890
and these identities only have access

294
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,910
to what they're supposed to.

295
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,260
You can enforce these privilege,

296
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,770
do it automatically
without breaking anything.

297
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,830
You can detect abnormal
behavior by watching

298
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,440
how all of the data in
your environment is used

299
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,170
with the context of what is sensitive.

300
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,650
Not just sensitive data,
but sensitive identities.

301
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,850
Which identities are human?

302
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,140
Which identities are machines?

303
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,120
Which identities are administrators,

304
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,250
whether you know it or not?

305
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,300
What are they accessing?

306
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,410
How are they accessing it?

307
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,960
What's normal, so that
you know what's abnormal.

308
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,870
Without a lot of noise, you
can minimize the time to detect

309
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,600
and time to respond to threats

310
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,140
and you can fix the problems
that you will identify.

311
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,170
The number of times I've
heard from hospitals and banks

312
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,057
and manufacturing companies
and software companies are,

313
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:41,850
"We know we have risks.

314
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,070
We just don't have the
people to solve them.

315
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,200
We know that there are
problems out there."

316
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,610
Varonis will show them to you

317
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,610
and then give you the
ability to automate policies

318
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,990
to fix the problems that we
find but to do it safely.

319
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,997
I used to ask security teams and CISOs,

320
00:12:57,997 --> 00:12:59,430
"What keeps you up at night?"

321
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,850
I stopped asking that question
because what you wanna hear

322
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,840
is something really interesting.

323
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,730
What keeps me up at night
is nation-state actors.

324
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,830
What keeps me up at night is ransomware.

325
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,830
What keeps me up at night
are insider threats.

326
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,030
I stopped asking the question

327
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,617
because smart people
always answer the same way,

328
00:13:14,617 --> 00:13:17,100
"It's not the problems that I know about,

329
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,440
it's the problems that
I don't know about."

330
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,420
Because Varonis looks at everything.

331
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,400
We don't use data sampling
or predictive scanning.

332
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,250
We will scan everything and
show you where you have gaps

333
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,080
and then we'll give you the automation

334
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,690
to find and fix those
problems automatically.

335
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,020
So you can go from, "I don't
know what I don't know"

336
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,930
to, "I do know my problems
and I have fixed them

337
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,630
and I can prove it and I
didn't break anything."

338
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,210
And you can do it extremely quickly.

339
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,970
We integrate with the AWS Security Hub.

340
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,310
We take signals and telemetry and analysis

341
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,020
and threats and alerts.

342
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,660
We import them and give
you additional context.

343
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,780
So we enrich the views that
you get from the Security Hub.

344
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,030
We enrich the telemetry streams

345
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,430
that you get from the AWS CloudTrail.

346
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,640
We add additional information
and context to the CloudTrail

347
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,020
so it's more useful and
it's a better set of signals

348
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,350
to detect and respond to
threats and to apply automation.

349
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,080
We enrich the IAM Identity Center

350
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,390
by giving context about data access

351
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,150
and where and how entitlements are applied

352
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,480
and what kinds of sensitive
data are available

353
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,860
to which identities.

354
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,530
And we enrich the AWS GuardDuty

355
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,540
with data-centric threat detection.

356
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,760
Everything that I've
just shown you integrates

357
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,860
with your AWS security stack.

358
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,140
We make the AWS security
controls and tools

359
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,530
that you have more valuable
and we make it easier to prove

360
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,500
that you're implementing
controls and we do it safely.

361
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,820
We secure data across your AWS ecosystem,

362
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,220
whether they're SaaS
applications and platforms,

363
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,363
like Salesforce and GitHub,

364
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:50,670
that are integrated with
your AWS environment,

365
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,580
or data stores that are living inside AWS,

366
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,260
like Snowflake and Databricks.

367
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,199
And the databases that are sitting in RDS

368
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,840
are virtualized in EC2,
let alone all of the data

369
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,380
that's sitting inside S3 environments.

370
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,270
We'll secure this data across cloud.

371
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,620
We give you a single pane of glass

372
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,870
and a single set of
policies and automations

373
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,710
that you can apply quickly,
easily, and safely.

374
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,770
If you would like to learn
more, and I know you would,

375
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,390
'cause if you sat here this long

376
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,860
while there's free beer over there,

377
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,390
that means you wanna learn more.

378
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,590
If you'd like to see how this works,

379
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,180
if you'd like to see a demo,

380
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,910
either tonight or maybe tomorrow,

381
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,740
either give us a call or
come over to our booth.

382
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,840
We're booth number, oh, there's
no booth number on here.

383
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,390
It's four something. It's
right along the back wall.

384
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,223
Varonis.

385
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:35,580
It's a data security platform

386
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,430
that will help you find
problems, automatically fix them,

387
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,860
automatically detect
and respond to threats.

388
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,640
And the way we start is
we do a risk assessment.

389
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,350
This takes 15 to 20 minutes

390
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,450
to plug into your AWS environment.

391
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,800
We'll look at the other hyperscalers.

392
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,000
We'll look at on-premises data.

393
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,190
We'll look at files.
We'll look at databases.

394
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,870
We'll plug into your
Salesforce environment.

395
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,670
We'll plug into your GitHub environment.

396
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,580
And very quickly, on day
one, you will see results.

397
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,220
Within a week, you'll see real risks.

398
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,480
And within a couple of weeks,

399
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,340
we will show you a real
plan to reduce them.

400
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,830
But even if you do nothing else,

401
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,720
I can guarantee you we're
gonna show you things

402
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,107
that you didn't know about your data.

403
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,470
The whole reason, the
whole goal of cybersecurity

404
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,420
is to protect data.

405
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,390
We make it easy. We'll do it cross-cloud.

406
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,910
We'll do it accurately and
we'll do it automatically.

407
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,270
And if you don't believe
me, well, come and try it.

408
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,850
I'll take the Pepsi Challenge
against any other tools

409
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,830
or processes that you have in place.

410
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,090
I've been doing this for a long time.

411
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,890
I've seen people struggle.

412
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,010
I've seen people do a little
bit with a lot of people.

413
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,070
We'll help you do a lot
with just a little bit.

414
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,210
I'm gonna end a little bit early

415
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,100
'cause it looks like
you guys all wanna go.

416
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,650
Enjoy the rest of the show
and enjoy your time in Vegas.

417
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,520
My name is Brian.

418
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,170
I've got a flight to
catch in about 40 minutes,

419
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,850
so I'm gonna run upstairs
and catch an Uber.

420
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,500
I really appreciate your time.

421
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,360
I hope you come over and learn some more.

422
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,973
Thank you all so much.
There it is, booth 430.
