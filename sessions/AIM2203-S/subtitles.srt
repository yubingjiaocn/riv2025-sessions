1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,190
- All right, thank you very
much everyone for coming.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,840
Today we're gonna talk about a topic

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,303
that was barely discussed this conference,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,570
and kind of under the headlines,

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,983
we're gonna talk about AI.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,910
But seriously now,

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,950
I think one of the areas

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,470
where AI can make the biggest
impact is observability.

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,490
And observability is one
of the closer areas to code

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,970
where AI is already making
a huge impact in the world

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,370
and it's actually has the potential

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,650
to not just make our lives easier

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,600
as software engineers
and platform engineers,

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,700
but also make our lives better

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,280
with faster, better software delivery,

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,400
better stability and security of software.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,323
When we thought about it in Coralogix,

18
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:48,037
we were trying to understand

19
00:00:48,037 --> 00:00:49,710
what is the highest value
that we can provide.

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,880
Is it an assistant?

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,260
Is it a co-pilot?

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,520
And we came up with Olly.

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,545
This session is going to be both

24
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:56,580
about how we built it

25
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,500
and how we came to that conclusion

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,020
of what exactly is going to be the design,

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,840
but also a bit about how you
guys can build it on your own,

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,060
and what are the
fundamentals that you need

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,520
to build an AI agent,

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,780
not just for observability by the way,

31
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,313
but for any data access.

32
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,620
I'll start with a bit of background

33
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,540
about Coralogix and ourselves.

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,180
I'm the co-founder, CEO of Coralogix.

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,400
Liran heads AI for Coralogix right here.

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,450
He'll be the one talking more about Olly.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,190
We started Coralogix in 2015,

38
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,620
launched in 2017,

39
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,500
over 300 petabytes of data ingested

40
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,490
every day in the Coralogix.

41
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,560
Probably a much bigger number.

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,740
We raised about $400 million so far,

43
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,120
running multi-cloud,

44
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,320
but primarily Amazon.

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,350
Coralogix also was awarded this year

46
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,650
EMEA Partner of the year
for Amazon Marketplace.

47
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,680
And we run on eight
different regions today,

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,863
including the federal
cloud on FedRAMP Moderate.

49
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,300
I don't have to say much.

50
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,810
Software is complex and it's
getting more and more complex.

51
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,940
Actually, this thing,
sometimes you need to use

52
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,770
something that you edited or something.

53
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,370
This is like a small company service map.

54
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,110
When we look at large scale companies,

55
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,330
services got so complex today,

56
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,780
it's almost impossible
for a platform engineer.

57
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,660
And I think it also reflected in culture

58
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,520
of push things towards the engineering

59
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,450
and the service owners,

60
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,100
just because it's impossible to understand

61
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,830
and grasp software systems today.

62
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,570
If we go back in time

63
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,810
when we kind of started
our engineering experience,

64
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,030
maybe 15, 17 years ago,

65
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,640
not not several decades ago,

66
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,480
there were monoliths.

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,280
You would go to the machine,
you'd look at the logs,

68
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,270
maybe a little bit of metrics.

69
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,400
You get a good understanding
of what's happening.

70
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,080
These days with microservices,

71
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,790
different deployment models,

72
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,070
multi-cloud, serverless,

73
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,420
your ability to actually understand

74
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,080
what's happening in your
software is very limited.

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,423
And we think we have the solution to that,

76
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,690
but we'll talk about it in a minute.

77
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,980
Telemetry is exploding.

78
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,350
So people think, okay,

79
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,540
how do I monitor all these microservices?

80
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,700
How do I get a better understanding

81
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,707
of what's happening in
my production systems?

82
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:09,540
I'm just gonna add more telemetry.

83
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,490
I'm gonna add a metric,
I'm gonna add a log.

84
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,490
I'm gonna add another instrumentation.

85
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,063
And just over eight years, we see a 100X.

86
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,210
This is from public sources,

87
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,270
100X increase in telemetry data.

88
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,103
What does it mean?

89
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:25,936
It means that it's complex,

90
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:27,780
it means that it's expensive,

91
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,390
it means that it's difficult to manage,

92
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,220
but we're not really getting
better observability.

93
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,520
And we'll talk about that.

94
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,760
The solution is the all-in-one dashboard.

95
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,250
One dashboard, it has all that you need,

96
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,950
all the KPIs that you're tracking.

97
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,210
I'm of course joking.

98
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,600
The last thing we need
is another dashboard.

99
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,270
The last thing we need is another alert.

100
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,880
The world of just dashboarding everything

101
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,860
and alerting on every single
possible scenario removes

102
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,500
a bit of the ownership
from the service owners

103
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,090
and engineers towards the services

104
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,370
that they provide and run in production.

105
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,130
We think, okay, we solve the
problem, we add a dashboard.

106
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,900
What's our definition
of done for a feature?

107
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,120
We have dashboards and alerts set for it.

108
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,710
But the definition of
done for a feature is

109
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,420
that we can run it in production

110
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,093
and keep it in high quality
and high performance.

111
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,940
So that led us to build
more dashboards and alerts

112
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,860
and it feels like we got good coverage.

113
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,560
This is an average of
a Coralogix customer.

114
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,120
I'm talking only the dashboards

115
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,520
that are accessed and
alerts that are triggered.

116
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,530
We're in the hundreds.

117
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,700
Sometimes we come to customers

118
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,820
that have 10,000 alerts, 20,000 alerts.

119
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,100
Can you really comprehend the system?

120
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,770
Do you really own your service

121
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,420
if it triggers 20 alerts every day

122
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,220
and has 100 dashboards on it?

123
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,213
Probably not.

124
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,940
This is what it'll look like.

125
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,500
You go into your dashboard interface,

126
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,330
you got multiple folders.

127
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,840
Many things are just, you
know, duplicated variables

128
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,310
that you need to change to understand

129
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,890
your specific component.

130
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,360
Hundreds of alerts that are triggered.

131
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,490
And then we built on top these alerts,

132
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,340
we built all these alert aggregation tools

133
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,260
and incident management tools.

134
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,300
So we're trying to figure out the problem,

135
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,630
but we started with a
very kind of low state

136
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,180
and we're trying to improve it.

137
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,190
There's a paradigm now
where more dashboards,

138
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,150
more data, more alerts don't
mean more observability,

139
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,270
don't mean more reliability.

140
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,770
And intuitively, you'd imagine

141
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,760
on data analytics in general,

142
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,610
you know, and a lot of us
studied math or statistics,

143
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,250
the more data you have,
the more accurate you are.

144
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,510
The more data points you get,

145
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,370
the better insights you get.

146
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,167
In reality, if you think about this

147
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:48,900
for observability in
software, what is easier?

148
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,960
Is it easier debugging a
service with one service,

149
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,793
a gigabyte of logs every day,

150
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:54,600
and 100 custom metrics

151
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,110
or billions of metrics,

152
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,270
terabytes of data for multiple services?

153
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,300
Obviously, it's easier when you have less.

154
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,730
So how do we deal with that?

155
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,900
Do we build more dashboards?

156
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,050
Do we create more alerts?

157
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,700
Do we trim down data,

158
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,250
which is also a complete industry

159
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,890
that's started now just
for filtering data out.

160
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,110
We got so much garbage,
we don't wanna pay for it.

161
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,333
We start filtering out,
we start optimizing.

162
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,230
And

163
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,330
the numbers I've given
on dashboards and alerts,

164
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,330
those are only the ones
that are being accessed.

165
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:32,330
92% of dashboards are
only used for one week.

166
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,730
People will create kind
of a standalone dashboard

167
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,230
for a specific issue they have,

168
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,270
then they neglect it.

169
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,250
Now the funny part is,

170
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,790
you know what's gonna happen
in the next postmortem?

171
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,820
The conclusions are we're
gonna add this dashboard now

172
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,690
and alert,

173
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,850
so next time we'll know.

174
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,770
But they, you just go back and add

175
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,970
the same dashboard a week later.

176
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,740
No one looks at it.

177
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,520
So engineers now have to spend

178
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,850
close to half their time just
triaging and understanding

179
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,560
where should I even look?

180
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,660
What dashboard do I need to look at

181
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,680
out of 100 alerts?

182
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,150
And every time there's a big incident

183
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,800
in large scale systems and you know,

184
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,813
we run one, coincidentally,

185
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,080
when one service goes wrong,

186
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,000
everyone starts firing alerts and errors.

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,310
So where do I even start?

188
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,140
A lot of the times we start
triaging and we think,

189
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,010
oh, it's that service.

190
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,510
No, this is just downstream.

191
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,833
This is just the upstream.

192
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,000
So can we do something better?

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,790
Is there a way to deal with this?

194
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,380
And also a big question is,

195
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,690
how come this wasn't solved yet?

196
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,640
It's a big problem and the data grows

197
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,190
faster than our ability to deal with it.

198
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,560
Now there's an opportunity

199
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,810
because something big
happened in technology

200
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,310
over the past few years,

201
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,893
and how do we leverage that?

202
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,313
So let's start with the basics.

203
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,300
Observability is a term
that we have a problem with,

204
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,133
to be frank.

205
00:07:58,133 --> 00:07:59,403
And it's a bit of a,

206
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,263
it's a bit tricky because
we're an observability company,

207
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,723
but observe is a very passive term.

208
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,350
Do I want to observe my systems?

209
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,640
I mean, imagine police officers will say

210
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,220
that their job is to observe the street.

211
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,110
We're actually, you know,
we need to keep systems

212
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,943
up and running.

213
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:20,910
We don't need to observe them.

214
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,480
Having more monitors and
dashboards and telemetry is

215
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,953
a great way to observe,

216
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,110
but what's the end goal?

217
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,390
The end goal is to have reliability,

218
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,570
to have stability, to
create business insights,

219
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,533
to have security.

220
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,270
So we keep building better observability,

221
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,010
but we kind of forgot
why we're building it.

222
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,290
And you know, I can say that Coralogix,

223
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,780
specifically, Coralogix had invested

224
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,040
over $250 million in R&D
over the past six years.

225
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,430
So imagine the amount of
engineering and R&D work

226
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,310
that we put in just try to keep up

227
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,743
with how fast data and
systems were evolving.

228
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,500
So we were in that arms race

229
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,470
against obviously a very crowded space,

230
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,690
but it was very hard for us

231
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,420
to go back to the essence
of what companies want,

232
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,350
which is reliability, ease of management,

233
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,150
being able to resolve issues faster,

234
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,343
have performance that's measurable,

235
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,800
actually meet business KPIs

236
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,080
that drive the revenue of the business

237
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,580
and the customer satisfaction.

238
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,823
Now how do we get there?

239
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,630
Every software emits

240
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,050
millions and trillions
sometimes of data points.

241
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,640
Coralogix cover the entire suite,

242
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,410
whether it's logs, metrics, traces,

243
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,200
infra monitoring, APM, realism monitoring,

244
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
SIM, AI monitoring.

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,490
So, we have enough signals.

246
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,083
We can get signals for
every user action now.

247
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,960
But the challenge is

248
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,310
how do we stitch 'em together

249
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,140
into a story and the cardinality of data

250
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,220
and the variety of data

251
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,510
and the multidimensional
aspect of it creates

252
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,360
such anthropy that to actually understand

253
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,560
what are the connections in a way

254
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,140
that gives me high
certainty to take action is

255
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,030
really complex.

256
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,560
And the compute that it required

257
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,280
until now was just impossible to employ,

258
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,113
to solve that problem.

259
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:17,430
And the data was growing so fast.

260
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,260
So that frog leap we've made

261
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,783
in technology now enables something else.

262
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,570
How do we now create a story,

263
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,460
not, we don't have an assistant

264
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,370
to help you build another
dashboard or you know,

265
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,860
a co-pilot that gives you hints.

266
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,680
How do we autonomously
and automatically create

267
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,440
that story from those breadcrumbs

268
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,540
to create a complete new interface,

269
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,969
a complete new approach to observability

270
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:49,530
and go back to the basics of
simple and coherent insights

271
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,773
that lead to reliability,
performance, business KPIs.

272
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,650
And there comes Olly,

273
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,950
and I'll hand it to Liran.

274
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,850
- Thank you, Ariel.

275
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,043
So as Ariel mentioned,

276
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,760
we've been focusing on the wrong thing

277
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,550
for the past few years, right?

278
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,390
We have been focusing
about how we do better

279
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,420
observability and we forgot why.

280
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,950
We forgot that the key,

281
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,980
the end goal we are
actually aiming for, right?

282
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,020
Is just to have reliable software.

283
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,270
We built something, we invested
in developing a software,

284
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,420
we wanted our users to
experience something

285
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,233
and we built crazy platforms
just to observe them.

286
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,440
And yes, we have very,
very advanced tools,

287
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,050
but how much do we increase reliability?

288
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,343
How much have we increased reliability

289
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:37,530
with all these capabilities?

290
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,693
And this new paradigm of AI, right?

291
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:41,100
Like I think you can see it here

292
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,123
on every single booth
and every vendor, right?

293
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,430
There's a true and great power to it,

294
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,070
which allows us really to rethink

295
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,760
what is observability or,
you know, really reliability.

296
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,140
How do we achieve it

297
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,960
and how can we actually
do it not the same way,

298
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,940
not grow linearly,

299
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,950
but actually how can we
do it 10 times better

300
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,230
than what we've done until now?

301
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,080
And this is where Olly
comes into the picture,

302
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,263
the world first autonomous
observability agent.

303
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,010
So what Olly is doing?

304
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,380
How it actually works, right?

305
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,980
So we talked about billions
and trillions of breadcrumbs,

306
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,160
logs, metrics, traces.

307
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,950
Let's say I'm at home watching Netflix,

308
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,300
watching "Squid Games",

309
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,470
I click on episode number two

310
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,650
and it doesn't work right?

311
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,810
Or it glitches for a few seconds, right?

312
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,070
Quite annoying.

313
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,453
Not a fun evening to have,

314
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,880
but why it happens?

315
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,460
So it means there's probably
something along the way

316
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,780
along the software stack, right?

317
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,090
Maybe some microservice backend,

318
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,850
maybe a database experiencing some issues,

319
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,220
maybe actually another
third party application

320
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,960
that my app, that Netflix app is

321
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,760
connected through API,

322
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,580
having some, experiencing
some issues, right?

323
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,640
And all these pieces somehow result

324
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,240
in me as a user experiencing
not even a downtime,

325
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,150
just a glitch or unexpected behavior

326
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,030
that what the original
engineers actually wanted

327
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,350
and aimed for.

328
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,660
So this, all these pieces,

329
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,330
taking these, each and every component,

330
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,100
the microservices, the databases,

331
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,650
the Lambda functions,
taking the breadcrumbs

332
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,230
of each one of them potentially

333
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,390
should tell a story of what happened

334
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,013
to Liran as a user, right?

335
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,280
And the question is not only
what happened to me personally

336
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,113
as a user,

337
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:36,810
but what actually happens
as a trend for more users.

338
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,400
Maybe there are hundreds
or thousands users

339
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,050
experiencing the same issue

340
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,123
and what's common about all of them.

341
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,710
So back to what we see on the screen,

342
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,310
we see all these billions
of breadcrumbs, right?

343
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,200
And usually, how do we do it?

344
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,670
We open the alerts,

345
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,920
try to find correlated alerts,

346
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,810
we deep dive into the dashboard,

347
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,107
we filter out for logs, we say,

348
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:01,710
"Hey, I see there's
some error logs," right?

349
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,150
And then I understand, oh I see

350
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,820
like this services seems
to be related, right?

351
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,050
So I further analyze.

352
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,060
So we have logs, we have,
sorry, we have alerts,

353
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,680
we have dashboards.

354
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,150
And the third component
is plenty of manual labor

355
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,640
going into resolving,

356
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,180
investigating production incidents, okay?

357
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,140
So with Olly,

358
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,750
we have all this information
available not only for us

359
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,070
but also for Olly.

360
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,243
And the beauty of it is that
it makes everything go away.

361
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:33,411
No, okay,

362
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,070
so Olly takes all this information,

363
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,150
we can give them the task

364
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,655
and then it zooms in

365
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:45,750
onto out of all these
billions of breadcrumbs,

366
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,900
onto the specific, most relevant pieces

367
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
to the task at hand.

368
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,970
And the next thing, it actually
eliminates the noise, right?

369
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,640
Remember we have more and
more and more and more,

370
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,800
we lost clarity, we got more noise,

371
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,340
Olly eliminates all this noise

372
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,270
and can actually focuses on the signals

373
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,220
that truly are important

374
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,570
and hopefully will tell
my story as a user.

375
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,720
And most importantly,
it can connect the dots

376
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,940
to one single story,

377
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,830
what the end user is experiencing

378
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,410
or the end users are experiencing

379
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,540
all the way back to what was

380
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,430
the root cause of that?

381
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,350
Sounds too good to be true.

382
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,930
Yes, no, okay.

383
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,540
So yeah, these are nice slides,

384
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,220
but I think the proof is in the pudding.

385
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,683
So let's see Olly in the works.

386
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,180
So

387
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,730
what I'm going to do now,
you can see my screen right?

388
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,563
Awesome.

389
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:43,830
So, nice to meet you.

390
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:48,060
I'm Adam, I'm head of
platform at Sportify,

391
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,360
a sport goods companies

392
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,950
and I manage the e-commerce website

393
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,820
and the platform team.

394
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,920
And I'm just writing code in the meantime,

395
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,103
doing my day-to-day tasks.

396
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,123
And as I'm doing my work,

397
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,723
let's see,

398
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,313
oh, I got a message.

399
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,160
I got a message from Sarah Parks.

400
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,993
Let's see,

401
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:20,640
so Sarah is our VP of Product.

402
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,770
She's very good at what she's doing.

403
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,263
And let me zoom in a bit.

404
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,070
I got a message, Adam,
this doesn't look good.

405
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,903
What's going on?

406
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:32,670
We're getting slammed with
customers' complaints,

407
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,730
and seems like she
referred here to an alert

408
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,010
we got on production alert channel.

409
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,140
So let's take a deeper look into it.

410
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,600
So we can see a warning
about checkout error spike.

411
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,300
So we're an e-commerce website,

412
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,180
obviously the last part
is customers come in

413
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,850
after they chose the
items they can check out

414
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,200
and make the purchase.

415
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,030
And it seems like there is an issue.

416
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,850
So instead of opening another dashboard,

417
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,410
let me just ask Olly,

418
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,823
hey Olly, can you please take a look?

419
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,840
Okay, and as I tagged Olly,

420
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,090
Olly immediately reacted as you can see,

421
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,500
and it starts conducting

422
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,830
an investigation of what really happened.

423
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,500
And it shared with me this link

424
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,560
so I can see really what's
going on in real time.

425
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,733
Let me zoom in a bit,

426
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,433
okay,

427
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,720
so how will it work?

428
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,650
What we're actually seeing?

429
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:30,240
Olly works like yet another
engineer in your team.

430
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,800
So think about yourself, right?

431
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,930
You would've looked on
dashboard every time.

432
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,980
Let's say we would've
filtered for error logs,

433
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,900
we would've identified some pattern.

434
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,373
Actually, let me zoom out.

435
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,310
We would identify a pattern based on that.

436
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,800
We would probably see another
filter or go to traces, right?

437
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,820
Or go to metrics.

438
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,410
So in every given point in time,

439
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,540
I have one thing on my screen.

440
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,210
So on the right side, what you can see is

441
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,400
what Olly is currently looking at.

442
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,900
So for example, right now we can see

443
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,960
Olly is looking at the logs, okay?

444
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,830
And it's writing to me,
it's sharing with us

445
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,643
what it currently thinks and
what path it is exploring.

446
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,000
And it has many capabilities,

447
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,220
whether it's exploring logs, metrics,

448
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,890
traces, correlating them,

449
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,890
analyzing the code and more, okay?

450
00:18:25,118 --> 00:18:27,743
And we see that we got a result,
so let's see what happened.

451
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,000
So let me close this.

452
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:34,770
And by the way, as you can
see this is a live demo.

453
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,860
Decided not to go for a video, okay?

454
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,000
So let's see.

455
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,340
I noticed a spike in failed checkouts

456
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,170
over the last two hours.

457
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,700
Dug into shopping cart API,

458
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,040
this is one of our services,

459
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,630
logs and found a new type error

460
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,550
that correlates exactly with the spike.

461
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,610
It is affecting about 2,000 users.

462
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,610
From here, we can see
what is the root cause,

463
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,880
failed checkouts are caused
by type error exceptions

464
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,130
in the shopping cart API service.

465
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,640
Now one more thing you
will see with Olly is

466
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,180
that every time Olly provides
you with information,

467
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,400
it backs it up with evidence.

468
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,637
Why?

469
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:13,680
Because we know AI can hallucinate,

470
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,640
can make up things

471
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,730
and we wanna make sure we
can actually trust Olly.

472
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,970
This is a key that we put
a lot, a lot of effort

473
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,740
and engineering resources into

474
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,990
ensuring the quality of Olly.

475
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,020
So I can see exactly the
logs that are relevant.

476
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,760
Let me open one of them

477
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,290
and we can see the message here is

478
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,960
unsupported operand
type and the trace back,

479
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,670
this is a pipe service.

480
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,250
So I can see really what's going on.

481
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,540
Let's go on.

482
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,863
So, where it crashes.

483
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,580
So Olly here actually opens the code file,

484
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,170
analyzed it and found the
specific lines of code

485
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,940
causing the issue.

486
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,610
It explains that some function failed

487
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,640
because it tried to add
interesting and none,

488
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,813
raising this error.

489
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,980
Why have we gotten to
this case from the get go

490
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,980
that we have none in this
list of items in Python?

491
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,280
The reason is bug in remove
from cart lines 65 to 66,

492
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,930
I can open the source file

493
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,320
and actually I also got
suggested fix from Olly.

494
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,540
So it seems, you know,

495
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,030
not like, really quite an easy fix.

496
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,383
We hopefully can apply.

497
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,250
Also an analysis of how
many users were impacted

498
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,370
and chart analyzing where
the issue has started,

499
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,383
how it looks like and so on.

500
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,020
Olly also share with you what happened.

501
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,000
So just to understand

502
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,330
how Olly really got to
this thing, it's not magic.

503
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,840
There was a real, in-depth
investigation that happened

504
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,013
in this one minute.

505
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,563
So Olly analyzed metrics,

506
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,950
it tried to find relevant metrics,

507
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,230
it looks specific payment errors, API

508
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,523
or checkout our account,

509
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,420
ran query, I won't go in
into each one of them,

510
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,280
but you can see just this,

511
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,280
let's say, see, we have
one, two, three, four,

512
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,800
four queries.

513
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,630
Just think about how
long would it take you

514
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,510
just to realize you
need to write this query

515
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,820
and filter this out and make
sure the syntax is correct

516
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,940
and realize what's the
insights you're getting from it

517
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,330
and how you can actually
continue with the investigation.

518
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,880
Usually, usually from what we see

519
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,950
in our customers this time being saved is

520
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,580
about 94% on average.

521
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,600
And to make it into
numbers, that means an issue

522
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,180
that would take me five
hours to investigate

523
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,790
with Olly would take
about 20 minutes, okay?

524
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,470
Obviously this is average,

525
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,580
there are things that finish
up in a matter of two minutes.

526
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,980
Some of them take longer than that.

527
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,870
But all in all, this
is extremely powerful.

528
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,840
Okay, so now we have the,
we've identified the issue.

529
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,520
Let me go back because I don't want

530
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,843
Sarah to be upset with me.

531
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,690
So Nikesh, our engineering lead,

532
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,533
hey, Nikesh, we have production issue.

533
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,250
Please take a look

534
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,250
on the reason

535
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,810
and deploy a fix ASAP.

536
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,733
Please keep me posted.

537
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,530
And I'll be sharing, let me go to Olly,

538
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,843
share, let share this link.

539
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,290
Awesome, and let's link Sarah,

540
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,243
we don't want to leave her waiting.

541
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,160
Sarah, thanks for bringing this up.

542
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,567
We're on it

543
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:36,303
and the fix is on the way.

544
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,337
I think it deserves some applause.

545
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:43,337
(audience applauds)

546
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,360
This is real, okay?

547
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,250
Like, this is real.

548
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,590
I have a video demo here

549
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,390
in case the internet would, you know,

550
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,470
make up some challenges.

551
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,180
But what you just saw, the
querying, the data, the use case,

552
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,120
all of this is from a
real environment, okay?

553
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,433
No, not a simulation
or anything like that.

554
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,123
So what we've just,

555
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,880
what we just saw,

556
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,590
this is not better observability.

557
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,660
This is how we can actually achieve

558
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,640
10 times better reliability

559
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,280
than what we had until now, okay?

560
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,660
Olly understands your stack,

561
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,523
this is super important.

562
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,180
The reason Olly was able to do that

563
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,440
in a matter of a minute

564
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,300
and come up with valuable insight

565
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,670
and not just made up ones is

566
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,380
because like similar to any engineer

567
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,930
you would hire that would
go through training,

568
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,710
when you connect and integrate
Olly for the very first time,

569
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,350
it learns your observability workspace,

570
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,510
it learns which applications you have,

571
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,743
what subsystems,

572
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,270
what fields are present
in the logs metrics.

573
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,470
Has it occurred to you

574
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,810
that you have five metrics,

575
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,610
one with capital case,
one with lower case,

576
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,560
they all mean the same thing

577
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,730
but they have different naming.

578
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,310
So when you query, you may
miss some of them, right?

579
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,350
Because you just didn't know

580
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,000
that the casing is so important.

581
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,340
So Olly familiar with all these fields

582
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,450
and this is extremely powerful.

583
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,280
This is what allows Olly really to conduct

584
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,100
smart and insightful investigations.

585
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,440
So in a matter of minute

586
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,030
we found the root cause,

587
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,973
we got the suggestion for a fix.

588
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,950
I think this example is
particularly interesting

589
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,753
because the fix here was not,

590
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,840
I dunno, increase CPU
or anything like that

591
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,970
or allocate more pods.

592
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,523
This actually was a code issue.

593
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,030
And think about an on-call.

594
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,730
Any on-call, any SRE, any developer,

595
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:43,083
doesn't matter how much experts they are,

596
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,380
with this, they could have gotten

597
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,260
to the root cause within
the lines of the code,

598
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,400
even if they're not familiar

599
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,550
and they haven't seen this
code repository before, okay?

600
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,460
So this is really the true
power we're talking about.

601
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,710
And I think most importantly,

602
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,170
I didn't open even one dashboard.

603
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,150
I didn't filter any query on my own

604
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,620
and this is really the true power

605
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,120
and the true potential we have here

606
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,610
to achieve 10 times better reliability.

607
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,590
Now for those of you here in the crowd,

608
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,230
and I see you, some
skeptical guys here thinking,

609
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,670
oh yeah, it's just
ChatGPT for observability,

610
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,790
it's, you know, I saw that.

611
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,070
It's not, okay?

612
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,260
And let me elaborate what Olly is not.

613
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,780
So it's not ChatGPT for observability

614
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,350
in the sense that Olly is not
just ChatGPT-like interface

615
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,420
for accessing your observability data.

616
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,323
It's not that.

617
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,650
Olly has context, Olly has knowledge.

618
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,770
Olly is autonomous,
meaning in every single,

619
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,390
he doesn't have playbooks.

620
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,090
In every single point of time, it decides

621
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,913
autonomously what is the next step?

622
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,753
Olly is also not an AI assistant.

623
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,270
Now I'm sure you saw plenty,

624
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,020
every single company
on earth these days got

625
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,190
directive from the CEO,

626
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,550
we need to add AI, as much
AI as possible, right?

627
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,040
So we see that with AI assistant,

628
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,310
this small, cute chatbot you see

629
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,690
on the bottom right usually, right?

630
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,253
Like, hey let me help you.

631
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,520
And these are great, like they
do provide a lot of value,

632
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,320
but the value they focus on is

633
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,650
really making you and making your users

634
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,860
more efficient within the platform, right?

635
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,920
So if Olly, for example, was an assistant,

636
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,100
it wouldn't do all the
investigation for you or with you,

637
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,230
it would actually just help you build

638
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,673
dashboard in Coralogix.

639
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,470
So it doesn't do that.

640
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,970
It's not an AI assistant.

641
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,320
The the difference in power
is not becoming, I dunno,

642
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,800
20% faster in building
dashboards or alerts.

643
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,020
It's actually becoming 10
times better in reliability,

644
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,750
which is a much broader, higher level goal

645
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,800
for the organization.

646
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,130
And lastly, MCP,

647
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,893
MCP has been around for quite a while now.

648
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,720
So Olly is not an MCP server.

649
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,110
We do offer MCP for Coralogix, okay?

650
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,130
But Olly is not that.

651
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,050
What's the differences?

652
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,630
MCP in a way is exposing API

653
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,620
for AI agents, okay?

654
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,260
So if I want to take my information

655
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,560
for example for to expose
Coralogix information

656
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,750
to other AI agents like Cursor,

657
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,900
I would take the Coralogix MCP server.

658
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,670
But it does not have any knowledge,

659
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,803
it does not have any special context.

660
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,973
It is not an AI agent, AI system.

661
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,053
So let's understand what
Olly is and how Olly works.

662
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,300
So it all starts with data.

663
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,750
For years, we've been really focused

664
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,480
around how we achieve, store better data.

665
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,090
And finally, I think really over a decade

666
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,680
that we're talking about data

667
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,820
and the potential value of data,

668
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,200
I think finally we can harness

669
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,930
the true value and the
true potential of data.

670
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:05,930
So Coralogix is really good
as a platform for processing,

671
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,230
harnessing tons, massive amounts of data,

672
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,480
petabytes of data, terabytes of data

673
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,723
that we've really close
to infinite retention.

674
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,133
So all of this is being leveraged by Olly.

675
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,160
Olly learns from this data,

676
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,110
creating a knowledge base,

677
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,590
like you would learn something
in school for example.

678
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,243
And then with this knowledge,

679
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,480
what he saw and saying that he may say,

680
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,720
hey, this is an AI, an
observability agent.

681
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,400
It is not observability agent

682
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,963
because agent is singular.

683
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,670
Behind the scenes, Olly
has a team of agents,

684
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,550
specialized agents working for you, okay?

685
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,320
So we have for example logs explorer,

686
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,270
we have metrics analyzer.

687
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,790
Each one of them is powered by SLMs.

688
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,280
SLMs are small language models,

689
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,200
think about 7 billion parameters,

690
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,970
13 billion parameters,

691
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,880
that is specialized in the specific role

692
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,410
and specific task at hand.

693
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,710
And they all collaborate
together to produce

694
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,960
insights, answers,

695
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,760
which all together allow us to get

696
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,510
this 10 times better reliability
we were talking about.

697
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,030
Now let's go a step back and talk

698
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,550
in general about any agentic AI system.

699
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,120
I think this is if you want to know

700
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,210
what you can take back
home to your offices,

701
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,840
to your work and how do
you build your AI agent

702
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,043
or your own Olly,

703
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,920
this is all about that.

704
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,910
So any agentic AI system
has five main components.

705
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,320
Obviously we can break it down to more,

706
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,270
but these are the core concepts

707
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,750
and the core things you must
have in agentic AI system.

708
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,083
So it starts with a model
in the center, okay?

709
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,800
Which is clear, this is like the engine

710
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,830
for our agent or our agentic system.

711
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,910
We have the system prompt.

712
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:00,690
So for example, you are an
expert in analyzing logs

713
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,520
for this company.

714
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,750
So this is how we provide

715
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,400
actual instructions to our agent.

716
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,550
Then we talked about multiple agents.

717
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,300
So we said logs explorer, right?

718
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,560
Metrics analyzer, let's say
security analyst and so on.

719
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,560
The way they collaborate
together could be different

720
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,860
and is crucial.

721
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,720
So for example, there are

722
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,160
different design patterns for it.

723
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,720
One architecture would be that I have

724
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,180
one orchestrator that takes the task.

725
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,270
For example, in this case
we ask for investigation.

726
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,190
So the orchestrator is familiar

727
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,850
with all the other
agents and assign tasks,

728
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,620
hey logs explorer, please find me

729
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,750
relevant logs to this issue.

730
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,123
Log explorer will come back with results,

731
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,690
orchestrator will decide on next steps.

732
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,250
This is one type,

733
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,340
another type is handovers.

734
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,750
We can decide, we can make
any sub-agent autonomous

735
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,330
so they can play around together as a team

736
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,440
like playing ball.

737
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,210
And at every given point in time,

738
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,130
someone else holds the ball,

739
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,390
meaning they are the one

740
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,310
leading the conversation from now on.

741
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,960
So there are different architectures

742
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,243
about how we actually organize our agents.

743
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,170
Then we have the knowledge,

744
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,850
which talks about really
how we provide this,

745
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,970
how we empower this agentic AI system

746
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,730
not only with tools
but also the knowledge,

747
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,800
the information that's
very, very much needed

748
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,230
to make smart decisions, smart actions.

749
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,950
And lastly but probably the
most important one is the evals,

750
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,120
how do we actually evaluate

751
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,343
the quality of our agentic system?

752
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,750
So out of these five,

753
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,210
what you will notice is model

754
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,130
is commodity, okay?

755
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:52,130
So Opus was released I think
a week ago or two weeks ago.

756
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,650
We have access to it, all
of you have access to it.

757
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,170
GPT5 got released, same thing.

758
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,060
So there's nothing really
unique about the model.

759
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,860
We can, we all share the same models,

760
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,030
and same for system prompt.

761
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,130
I can write something,
you can write something,

762
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,250
it won't make a huge, huge difference.

763
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,440
So that leaves us with
three other main components

764
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,220
which together compose what we call

765
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,413
the context engineering triangle.

766
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,150
The context engineering
triangle, this is the key.

767
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,430
What you see here, these three components,

768
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:27,810
if you want to build
powerful, high quality agent,

769
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,640
you need these three items

770
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,213
and you need to understand
them deeply and focus on them.

771
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,180
So we covered about agent architecture

772
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,230
and the importance of agent architecture.

773
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,933
I wanna talk a little bit
about knowledge and memory.

774
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,320
So in ChatGPT, I think we are all familiar

775
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,870
with the fact that as
we talk with ChatGPT,

776
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:52,080
sometimes it memorizes
what we talked with them

777
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,950
about it, right?

778
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,073
And then it can be reused
in other conversations.

779
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,980
But one of the challenges
with making agentic AI system

780
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,930
really, really good

781
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,840
with knowledge as well is

782
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,750
the limitation of context, right?

783
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,910
In theory, if I could take

784
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,280
all my petabytes of observability data

785
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,320
from the last week and just push it

786
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,180
to all of them and wish them good luck,

787
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,620
I will do that.

788
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,550
But it's not technically
possible as for today.

789
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,260
And I think we can also
take here the more is

790
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,060
not more here as well.

791
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,730
The fact that I will have more data

792
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,073
does not mean I will get better answers.

793
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,650
So what we do need?

794
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,223
We need to have relevant data,

795
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,340
we need to have it in a structured way

796
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,323
that is optimized for the LLM.

797
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,680
And let me tell you that it may sound

798
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,620
that changing models is quite easy, right?

799
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,810
Just within the API
call, change the string.

800
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,130
Hey, GPT5.

801
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,413
Now I want to use Claude, very easy.

802
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,910
In reality, changing model is difficult.

803
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,900
The reason it's difficult,

804
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,820
because different models has

805
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,860
different preferences
and you need to optimize

806
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,930
the context you're building accordingly.

807
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,810
So the knowledge needs
to be optimized as well.

808
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,700
So going back to we wanna build

809
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,100
this observability AI agent,

810
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,910
we need to push relevant
information to the context

811
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,320
and we already agreed

812
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,990
we cannot just take all
the logs, metrics, traces

813
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,440
and so on from the last week.

814
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,070
So we need really what,

815
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,260
the way to do it is

816
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,870
actually same way as we investigate

817
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,620
and as we conduct an investigation,

818
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,370
is identify the key parts

819
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,603
and the key elements,

820
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,213
store them at first.

821
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,820
And the structure rate could be

822
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,940
whether in vector DB, knowledge graph

823
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,680
or just rational DB depending

824
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,273
on what information we store,

825
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,690
and allow our agent to
access this information.

826
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,210
And the querying part is also key here

827
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,580
because the fact that I
have this information stored

828
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,370
somewhere does not mean

829
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,550
I know how to query in an effective way.

830
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,900
So we said how do we,

831
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,520
how do I store this information?

832
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,190
How do I structure it and how do I query?

833
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,830
These are the three components
when come to knowledge

834
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:14,760
and how we build this context.

835
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,040
So let's say we've done these
two really, really good.

836
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,280
So we have model, we have system prompt,

837
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,600
we have some agents architecture,

838
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
we can do something simple for starters.

839
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,800
And let's say I saved
some basic aggregations

840
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,353
on my log to start simple.

841
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,010
The last thing,

842
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,869
which is actually the most
important one, is evals.

843
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,810
Evals is short for evaluation.

844
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,360
Now in traditional software,
we have unit testing,

845
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,820
integration testing,
system testing, right?

846
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,500
When we build it, we test,

847
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,230
we see hey, thumbs up,
nothing broke, all good,

848
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,103
we can go live.

849
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,750
A new feature comes in,
we implement it, right?

850
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,363
We build some new tests, run
it again, all works well.

851
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:05,640
Ideally, we would've done
the same with AI agents.

852
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,240
The challenge though is
that there is no structure.

853
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,000
What are we testing, right?

854
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,500
Like we have a conversation,

855
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,140
the user can input whatever they want.

856
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,660
The possibilities are infinite, right?

857
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,310
Like, what do I test?

858
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,953
What happens if the user
just come in and say,

859
00:36:23,827 --> 00:36:27,720
"Hey what should I
order for lunch", right?

860
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,270
Like there are infinite
amounts of possibilities

861
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,773
to what the user would put in.

862
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,460
So the question of how do I evaluate it

863
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,100
becomes really, really challenging.

864
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,110
And if not done correctly,

865
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,400
or if you actually build an AI agent

866
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,563
and you don't evaluate it at all,

867
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,700
I can show from experience what happens is

868
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,910
you build something, it
seems to be working right?

869
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,800
Even you, let's say you're very proud,

870
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,217
you deploy it to production,
you say to your friends,

871
00:36:54,217 --> 00:36:55,530
"Hey, I have it.

872
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,150
You can start using it."

873
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,320
In a matter of minutes probably,

874
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,877
you will get some Slack message
or someone will tell you,

875
00:37:00,877 --> 00:37:03,660
"Hey, hey look, I tried
this, it doesn't work."

876
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,640
So yeah, oh, no problem, I'm on it.

877
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,350
You'll go back, you'll check

878
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,940
this very, very specific use case

879
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,650
and you'll change the system prompt.

880
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,820
And guess what?

881
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,480
You will be successful in
resolving this use case.

882
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,850
So it seems like we made progress,

883
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,950
but what you didn't realize is

884
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,450
as you change the system prompt,

885
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,210
you change the entire
behavior of the agent.

886
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,430
So things that used to work before,

887
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,890
the test that you ran a day ago,

888
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:33,810
this use case is not
working anymore, okay?

889
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:38,220
So this is why evaluations
in AI agents are

890
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,813
no less than crucial.

891
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,130
I will say just one
more thing about evals,

892
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,360
another challenge here is

893
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,770
not only testing because
it's not just one message.

894
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,290
I got input, output is it correct or not?

895
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,600
We have an entire flow of conversations.

896
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,310
So how do we test this?

897
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,140
So I'll leave it as a food for thought

898
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,440
and we can talk this offline
if some of you are interested.

899
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,393
So how does that translate into Olly?

900
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,690
So the beautiful thing you saw before,

901
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,210
this is what happens behind the scenes.

902
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,343
Onto the left, okay?

903
00:38:14,343 --> 00:38:15,840
And this is really sharing
with you the internals,

904
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,793
how Olly works under the hood.

905
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,900
On the left, Olly is
powered by Coralogix's

906
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,080
extremely powerful observability
data platform, okay?

907
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,283
So notice, remember I told you
Olly is not an AI assistant.

908
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,353
That's exactly that.

909
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:34,500
Olly is not an expert in using Coralogix

910
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,140
or using its feature to build dashboards.

911
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,320
It is an expert in
helping you with achieving

912
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,600
better reliability and
investigating issues,

913
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,583
optimizing production and so on.

914
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,890
So it leverages the large scale
data observability platform

915
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,880
by Coralogix.

916
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,910
From it, it takes all these signals

917
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,233
and creates knowledge.

918
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,140
To be honest, like if you
would ask me to choose

919
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,610
one thing

920
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,970
or the key to all these
success and quality lies,

921
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,293
it's within the knowledge.

922
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,670
And then we have the collaboration
of the multiple agents,

923
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,690
again, each one powered

924
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,400
by small language model,

925
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,550
which allows us to get really
invaluable production insight,

926
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,140
as we saw.

927
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,460
So how can you take it back home

928
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,580
and how can you start build your own Olly?

929
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,253
So first thing first, data.

930
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,310
We need to store all
of our data somewhere,

931
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,600
logs, metrics, traces.

932
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,343
The more we have, the better.

933
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,220
But we also need to make sure

934
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,920
that we build in a structured way

935
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,280
that the agent can
actually optimize in that.

936
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,630
The second part is what we call

937
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,520
semantic layer, okay?

938
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,300
Semantic layer is really a more,

939
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,710
we call it a basic understanding

940
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,420
at least of the data.

941
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,130
Let's say I have a field that has

942
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:54,930
name CPU USG 7D.

943
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,670
What does that mean?

944
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,190
So maybe we can assume it means CPU usage

945
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,510
over the last seven days,

946
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,090
whatever is CPU usage
over the last seven days.

947
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,394
But it's important for
the agent, for the LLM,

948
00:40:06,394 --> 00:40:09,840
for our engine to have this information

949
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,210
because this what allow the agent to make

950
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,043
smart decisions.

951
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:15,030
Say "Hey, I have a problem with CPU,"

952
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,240
this metric is actually
the metric that would,

953
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,260
is likely to be relevant.

954
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,030
So maybe I should check this out.

955
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,580
Okay, so semantic layer is,

956
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,550
I would call it kind of
the first building block

957
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,323
within the knowledge of the agent.

958
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,410
And the third part is

959
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,693
building your first AI agent MVP,

960
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,190
take whatever model, build it.

961
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,450
There are actually great tools,

962
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:43,080
whether it's OpenAI agents at Python SDK,

963
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,850
LangChain and others,

964
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,940
today it became quite easy
to come up with an MVP.

965
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,920
So I do recommend really
just getting your hands on

966
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,780
and try to build this thing.

967
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,010
So, and this is, you know,

968
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,993
just the core concept to start with.

969
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,423
So from here,

970
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,973
we've seen one demonstration
of how Olly works.

971
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,220
Olly has been in beta

972
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,060
for the last few months with
some of Coralogix's customers.

973
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,060
I do wanna share with
you how it actually work,

974
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,790
how it actually looks in real life.

975
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,730
So this is a story of
one of our customers.

976
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,470
I was actually fascinated to hear that,

977
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,303
to be honest.

978
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,140
So they had a notification service, okay?

979
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,880
It's a microservice running on Docker

980
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,700
that had random latency
spikes every now and then.

981
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,370
It was really unclear what's going on.

982
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,719
They look on the logs,
they look on the metrics,

983
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,500
they look on the traces,
they try to analyze them,

984
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,590
but they couldn't find any correlation

985
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,270
to these latency spikes.

986
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,300
They were really puzzled
of what's going on.

987
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,280
And at some point they say, you know what?

988
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,450
We have no idea.

989
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,570
So, let's leave it this way.

990
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,180
After trying out Olly for a few weeks,

991
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,200
they say, you know what?

992
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,800
Let's give it a try, we
have nothing to lose, right?

993
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,703
So what happened?

994
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:14,040
Okay, so the first thing that
Olly helped them realize is

995
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,290
this notification service is

996
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,870
actually connected to
another email service

997
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,790
that's connected to authentication service

998
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,083
that's using RDS.

999
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:26,820
Now that's interesting because
until that point in time,

1000
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,460
they didn't even think or consider

1001
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,440
checking for RDS

1002
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,312
because the service itself has
nothing related to RDS, okay?

1003
00:42:35,312 --> 00:42:38,400
So they were looking in the wrong places.

1004
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,830
Now, not only that it is connected to RDS,

1005
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:44,160
the reason it is interesting
as Olly identified,

1006
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,093
Olly correlated spikes in the CPU,

1007
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,210
CPU spikes of the RDS,

1008
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,620
amount of connections,

1009
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,260
as well as latency spikes of the RDS.

1010
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,940
And this was correlated with the spikes

1011
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,620
of the notification service.

1012
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,290
So for the very first
time after four months,

1013
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,063
they got some clue of,

1014
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,010
we have at least more
understanding of what's going on.

1015
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,450
Now, the investigation didn't stop there.

1016
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,620
It was not the one shot,

1017
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,880
it was not just one prompt there,

1018
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,993
it was four or five messages
in the conversation.

1019
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,160
So the next thing that
Olly shared with them,

1020
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,570
it has found another Lambda function

1021
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,940
that also works with this RDS function.

1022
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,743
Oh, sorry, with this RDS database.

1023
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,420
And the interesting thing is that

1024
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,680
this Lambda database,

1025
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,980
sorry, this Lambda function apparently has

1026
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,890
also correlation when it activates

1027
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:44,433
with the spikes of the Postgres, okay?

1028
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,750
And looking, when Olly
looked on the queries

1029
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,300
that were running by this Lambda function,

1030
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,530
it realizes this,

1031
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,390
that the queries were running against

1032
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,700
unindexed tables, right?

1033
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,010
Which obviously makes,

1034
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,840
creates loads on the RDS

1035
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,910
and as a result, identification service.

1036
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,640
So from here, the fix was quite obvious.

1037
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,630
Olly also recommended it,

1038
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,340
but I think it was quite clear

1039
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,130
that the fix is really
just building indexes

1040
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,243
for these tables.

1041
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,240
But this is fascinating.

1042
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,020
Like, think about how much time

1043
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,310
would take to find and investigate

1044
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:23,400
and get to the root cause of
something like that, right?

1045
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,430
We have three services,
one Lambda function,

1046
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:29,940
each one running and being
managed by a different team.

1047
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,040
RDS didn't even think about it

1048
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,200
as something that could be related.

1049
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,820
And in general, something tricky

1050
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,870
about Lambda functions, right?

1051
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:40,200
They start, they end, nothing happened,

1052
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,553
like they never existed.

1053
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,630
So this is a real case, super interesting,

1054
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,750
four months this issue was unsolved,

1055
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,120
tried with Olly less than 10 minutes,

1056
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,623
they realize what's going on.

1057
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,410
So we talked about the
power of reliability,

1058
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,645
we talked about the fact

1059
00:45:00,645 --> 00:45:03,540
that our focus was in the wrong place.

1060
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,940
We are running after observability,

1061
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,150
we forgot to chase after reliability.

1062
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,280
So how do we move from here?

1063
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,510
Okay, we're still in the early days of AI

1064
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,810
and what you see?

1065
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,310
So in the last decade,

1066
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:21,390
I would say observability has increased

1067
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,223
and has

1068
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,710
kind of evolved in a linear way.

1069
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:28,110
We've had the more features,
we've had user sessions,

1070
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,510
run more capabilities,
obviously, more features.

1071
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,780
So we have improved but not exponentially.

1072
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,770
This is the first step.

1073
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,450
What I'm just presenting you, okay,

1074
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,630
this is just the first
step in a paradigm shift

1075
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:41,160
we're experiencing.

1076
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,290
The first milestone is co-pilot, okay?

1077
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,810
So just to clarify, it's
not here to replace anyone,

1078
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,960
it's here to help us make
our work, make our job

1079
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,970
much, much better

1080
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,120
and to allow us to focus
on what really matters.

1081
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,613
The next step for Olly,

1082
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,610
and by the way, it's like few weeks

1083
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:02,850
from getting the first release of it,

1084
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,023
is being proactive.

1085
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:05,933
What does that mean?

1086
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:06,766
It means two things.

1087
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:10,680
One, it means when an
alert fires on Slack,

1088
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,110
Olly automatically triage and provide you

1089
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,753
with initial understanding
of what's going on.

1090
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,370
The second part of being proactive is

1091
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:24,330
really allowing Olly to
take actions, all right?

1092
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:27,240
Maybe it's suggest pull request.

1093
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,140
Maybe it's suggest changing
our AWS environment.

1094
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,040
So this is the next step,

1095
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,260
this is the proactive phase

1096
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,320
and the holy or Olly grail is

1097
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,070
getting to preventive observability, okay?

1098
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:41,970
Now think about it.

1099
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,910
This is an ideal,

1100
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:47,220
think about an agent and I
think we've been talking about

1101
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,990
this vision for years now,

1102
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:50,910
but for the very first time it seems

1103
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,800
possible to get to a point

1104
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,570
where we have an agent

1105
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:57,090
that constantly watches our production.

1106
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,500
Whether it's from product standpoint,

1107
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,690
whether it's from cost standpoint,

1108
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:04,380
operations, infrastructure
and so on and so forth.

1109
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,930
It is familiar with the
way it works in general,

1110
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:10,920
it is familiar with seasonality
and can say, hey, listen,

1111
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,400
we expect to see increase in
load in the next few days.

1112
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,530
We have 80% utilization.

1113
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,060
We have to increase the amount of pods

1114
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,380
and take action and actually increase

1115
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,000
these amount of pods,

1116
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,750
preventing a downtime or delay for users.

1117
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,100
So this is really where
we are going with that.

1118
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,900
And with that, I'm really happy to share

1119
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,720
that Olly is now generally available

1120
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,820
for all of Coralogix's customers.

1121
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,100
We started rolling this
out and by December 15th,

1122
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,500
will be publicly available
for all of our users.

1123
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:47,463
So,

1124
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,943
I think we covered a lot of points,

1125
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:56,403
whether it's the fact that the
software stack has changed.

1126
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:00,810
I really remember, you know, 10 years ago

1127
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,010
when you build an app,

1128
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,510
it was just one single application.

1129
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,220
It was web application,

1130
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:09,270
you were running it on one
web server and that's it.

1131
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:12,000
And maybe, you know, you had
some blogs written somewhere

1132
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,170
to help you debug it.

1133
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:16,680
So it was much, much, much
easier, much convenient.

1134
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,385
But now we have microservices

1135
00:48:18,385 --> 00:48:20,280
and we have serverless and
we have so many tech stack

1136
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,020
and so many moving parts,

1137
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:26,430
all of them creating so many breadcrumbs.

1138
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,050
So we have to find a better way

1139
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,123
to achieve software reliability.

1140
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,750
This is not a feature,

1141
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,110
Olly, autonomous observability,
this is not a feature.

1142
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,690
It's not just something cool,

1143
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,460
it's really a paradigm shift.

1144
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,190
It's really a change of the way we think,

1145
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,380
the way we work, the way we act.

1146
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,150
And the time is now.

1147
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,620
It is not something futuristic.

1148
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,660
What you saw is already working,

1149
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:56,163
proactive is really, let's
say two, three months away.

1150
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:59,580
So the time to adopt this solution,

1151
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,350
the time to implement those solutions is

1152
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:02,850
really now, okay?

1153
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,830
We have this opportunity
to make our software

1154
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:07,173
much, much better, to
make our work better.

1155
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,800
And with that, I want to thank you.

1156
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,380
I'm happy to take questions afterwards.

1157
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,060
I'm not sure if we have time.

1158
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:18,060
- [Ariel] Yeah, just we got
like a few minutes for questions

1159
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,013
if anyone wants, we're very.
