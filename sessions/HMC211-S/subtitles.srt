1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,240
- Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,530
Hopefully, you can hear me okay.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,210
It is a little bit loud in here.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,310
You can ask me to speak up if you need to.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,433
Welcome.

6
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:12,090
If somebody had told me,

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,990
I don't know, three or four years ago

8
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,060
that would be standing on a stage

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,670
at the AWS conference

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,100
talking about one of the
largest market opportunities

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,593
that I've seen in my
14, 15 years at Oracle,

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,770
I would've thought you were crazy.

13
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,600
But here we are, and it's tremendous.

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,040
My name is Doug Palmer.

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,900
I am Group Vice President

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,770
for Oracle's Data Platform
Sales organization

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,090
servicing the largest healthcare
and life sciences companies

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:42,923
in the US.

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,340
And by healthcare, we mean
the largest providers,

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,290
payers, pharma life sciences
and med distribution companies.

21
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,900
And by data platform, we mean our on-prem,

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,510
our cloud, our hardware environment,

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,300
and our licensed business in the US.

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,300
Now, I'm gonna talk a little
bit about healthcare today,

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,640
but I'm also gonna focus
really specifically

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,250
on the partnership that is Oracle and AWS

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,920
that probably a lot of
folks did not see coming

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,390
quite a few years ago,

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,810
and how it's unlocked a huge
opportunity for our customers

30
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,110
to capitalize on the massive data estate

31
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,810
that lives and breathes
in Oracle Databases

32
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,193
all over the world today.

33
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,930
But I do wanna start
with the common problem

34
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,700
that we see in almost every sector

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,680
within the healthcare space.

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,100
Over the last five decades,

37
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,670
whether it's from mainframe to
the client server, internet,

38
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,210
mobility, big data, all
the way into cloud and AI,

39
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,860
while the technology is modernized,

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,890
we have created massive amounts of data

41
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,310
and application silos
across the organizations.

42
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,800
Now, I see this in the
largest healthcare providers

43
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,970
in the US

44
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,100
with thousands of applications

45
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,620
introducing tremendous cost and overhead

46
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,213
in a sector that today is
challenged with margin,

47
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,010
margin challenges, cost optimization,

48
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,263
and resource constraints across the board.

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,430
Now, this same 50 years
of computing paradigm

50
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,150
has led to this
application and data sprawl

51
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,520
has also inhibited us from capitalizing

52
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,220
on the market momentum of AI.

53
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,650
AI models require data,

54
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,477
and they require good data.

55
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:29,460
And this application challenge

56
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,590
has caused a ton of sprawl,

57
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,610
a ton of data movement,

58
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,820
and also introduced
significant security risks,

59
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,550
governance challenges, regardless
of the sector you're in,

60
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,070
whether it's the largest
pharmaceutical organizations,

61
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,203
payers, or life sciences.

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,280
Now, the data opportunity in healthcare,

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,820
for examples, is tremendous.

64
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,930
In the top left, it is to gain
visibility across all data

65
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,780
for understanding things
like population health,

66
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,000
improving patient outcomes,

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,693
improving physician's life experience.

68
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,460
If you look to the right,

69
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,000
more data sources equal better
decision-making and value.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,030
That is true, but it's also
presented a massive challenge.

71
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,760
If I look at the vertical integration

72
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,840
of the provider space
from the primary care

73
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,840
to the specialists to the
acute and the ambulatory,

74
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,980
it's a challenge to
understand a patient journey

75
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,680
when there's data in
silos across everywhere.

76
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,130
But the opportunity to
focus on patient centricity

77
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,290
and to provide a better patient experience

78
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,180
and a better continuum of care

79
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,010
is an opportunity that we are working on,

80
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,340
and data is at the center of all that.

81
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,410
If we look at connecting
the data value chain

82
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,910
and automating decisions,

83
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,280
interoperability is one of the
most important things for us

84
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,150
in the healthcare space.

85
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,640
Whether we're talking about the providers,

86
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,770
whether we're looking at the payers

87
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,330
or the policy makers

88
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,780
to help focus on improving
prior authorization,

89
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,320
claims adjudication,
real-time claims adjudication,

90
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,753
and the data is at the heart of it all.

91
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,760
And then on the left,

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,580
unifying data structures for
lowering risk operations.

93
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,770
We see this in the
provider space tremendously

94
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,380
of trying to understand
cost and containment,

95
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,560
physician cost, supply chain costs,

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,280
and again, data not being
capitalized on the best today

97
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,740
given the sprawl across the board.

98
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,420
Now, I'm gonna talk a little bit about

99
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,990
what is this Database@AWS offering

100
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,890
that Oracle has brought to the market.

101
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,310
And I'm gonna look at it from the lens

102
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,700
of really four or five common
scenarios that we've seen

103
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,200
as we've deployed this in production

104
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,420
for many customers already today.

105
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,340
The first is modernizing from
IaaS to Database services.

106
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,630
Over the last five or 10 years,

107
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,460
a lot of our customers

108
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,090
have deployed Oracle
Database on native IaaS.

109
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,850
Now, that was the right choice at the time

110
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,410
because it was the only offering

111
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,660
and customers rely on Oracle Database.

112
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,450
However, now we're seeing
an opportunity to leverage

113
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,260
Oracle Database@AWS native services

114
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,500
to improve scalability, security,

115
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,900
maintenance and operations,
and reduce costs.

116
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,720
And I'll talk about some
examples in a little bit.

117
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,090
The second one, and there's
really two in this category,

118
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,720
it's reuniting apps and
Database in the cloud.

119
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
Many of my customers

120
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,740
have massive Oracle
environments sitting on-prem,

121
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,300
yet they have chosen AWS

122
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,730
as their hyperscaler of choice

123
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,150
and made the decision to
separate the app stack

124
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,130
from the Database and leave it on-prem.

125
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,250
Now, what that's introduced
is latency challenges,

126
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,470
customer not having a good experience,

127
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,780
and so we're seeing a lot of
our customers now capitalizing

128
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,500
on their hyperscaler of
choice, in this case AWS,

129
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,670
and marry the Database in the
cloud with the application

130
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,210
to improve performance for
the end user experience.

131
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,560
At the same time,

132
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,750
I have loads of customers

133
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,990
running very large Oracle
workloads on-prem today:

134
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,210
claims and policy administration systems,

135
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,240
custom applications, large data warehouses

136
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,200
that rely on high availability,
security, performance,

137
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,580
and in many cases are running
our incredible technology

138
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,990
that is Exadata

139
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,820
and our real application clusters

140
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,520
to maintain the high availability needed.

141
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,490
Now, we're unlocking that
ability for our customers

142
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,160
to migrate those
applications and workloads

143
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,160
directly into a
Database@AWS native service.

144
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,233
It's tremendous.

145
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,650
I can tell you, I've had customers,

146
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,900
very large payers across the US

147
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,840
that have been asking for
this capability for years,

148
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,083
and here we are, 2025 having delivered it.

149
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,250
The fourth is really the
building applications

150
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,380
with Oracle in the hyperscaler dev stack.

151
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,870
Again, with the Oracle Database,

152
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,420
our converged 26ai Database

153
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,890
native capabilities
across Vector, JSON, Graph

154
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,290
in a single database environment

155
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,990
can now deploy that natively within AWS

156
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,150
directly from the AWS Console,

157
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,610
but capitalize on the
advanced AWS services

158
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,990
for doing things like AI,

159
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,990
agentic systems and whatever you needed.

160
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,680
Obviously, that goes along
with enabling enterprise AI.

161
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,780
Today, we have a habit and a market

162
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,110
of moving data to the AI.

163
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,780
Oracle has a firm belief
in doing the opposite,

164
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,000
is bring AI to the data.

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,390
So allowing our customers to
deploy natively within AWS

166
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,790
and bring the large
language models to the data

167
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,120
versus moving the data to the models.

168
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,503
Now, we haven't,

169
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,710
this isn't a new service,

170
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,543
I guess I could say.

171
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:43,543
Oracle pioneered the concept
of multi-cloud starting in 2019

172
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,480
when we announced the Azure
Oracle OCI Interconnect.

173
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,760
And it really was, I mean, it
was monumental in the market

174
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,250
when Larry and Satya got up
on stage and talked about it,

175
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,560
and it was really to
kind of connect clouds

176
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,810
to give our customers the best choice.

177
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,590
Since then, we've announced
Database @ services

178
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,470
with Azure, with GCP,

179
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,300
and most recently with AWS

180
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,890
with two regions live,

181
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,110
East 1 and West 2,

182
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,070
and many more,

183
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,810
I think it's up to now 20 more regions

184
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,060
planned in the future.

185
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,040
So in five short years,

186
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,120
Oracle has delivered the power
of choice to our customers.

187
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,740
I can tell you from my perspective,

188
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,570
having been here for quite some time,

189
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,030
when I can sit down in
front of senior executives

190
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,867
at my customers and say,

191
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:31,740
"Where do you want to
deploy the Oracle Database?

192
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,573
You tell me.

193
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:34,080
We're providing you the opportunity

194
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,670
to deploy it wherever you like."

195
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,940
And for me, especially
in the life sciences

196
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,140
and the payer space,

197
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,290
the opportunity for us to partner with AWS

198
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,120
is just absolutely tremendous,

199
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,490
probably the largest market
opportunity I've seen

200
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,140
in many, many years.

201
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,930
Now, trusted for more than 48 years,

202
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,860
Oracle Database is synonymous
with enterprise software.

203
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,320
Now, founded in 1977

204
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,910
as Software Development Laboratories,

205
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,380
if didn't know that,

206
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,610
by Larry Ellison.

207
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,090
Our first customer was the
Central Intelligence Agency.

208
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,140
So we were founded

209
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,510
and born out of the intelligence community

210
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,510
with a rich history predicated
on security, trust, scale.

211
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,100
Most large enterprises today

212
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,540
and entities around the world,

213
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,160
both government and otherwise,

214
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,900
rely on Oracle Database

215
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,840
as the trusted data management service

216
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,930
for the majority of
the world's data today.

217
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,340
And over the last decade,

218
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,750
many of our customers,

219
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,190
most of our customers,

220
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,620
have invested tremendous
amounts of dollars

221
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,603
in other hyperscalers.

222
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,110
Now, today, with Oracle Database@AWS

223
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,530
and Azure and Google,

224
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,730
our customers have the choice

225
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,890
to deploy that wherever they want to.

226
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,690
It's the best of both worlds,

227
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,200
and it's truly one of the
best things we've released in,

228
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,050
I can't tell you.

229
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,230
So, what about some of the benefits?

230
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,810
As I talked about, the Oracle
Database has a reputation

231
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,033
second to none and only getting better.

232
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,170
Oracle Database delivered at AWS

233
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,730
is by far the fastest,

234
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,400
most performant, most
scalable and secure way

235
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,590
to deliver your Oracle Database.

236
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,830
Performance and availability at peak.

237
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,200
Maximum performance with purpose-built

238
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,030
database infrastructure.

239
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:28,680
Let me be clear, we have
deployed our hardware

240
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,323
inside of the AWS data centers,

241
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,603
which is a unique thing.

242
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,100
Minimize latency with
local database access

243
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,500
directly from the hyperscaler services.

244
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,670
No different than calling

245
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,250
another database service in AWS Console

246
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,900
versus calling Oracle's
Database@AWS service,

247
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,630
either our full Exadata Cloud Service

248
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,190
or our Autonomous Service,

249
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,710
which we'll talk a little bit about later.

250
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,410
So achieve extreme availability,

251
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,030
cut maintenance and downtime,

252
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,130
reduce your operational costs

253
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,733
by leveraging native cloud
service of the AWS from Oracle.

254
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,120
Reduce complexity,

255
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,010
use fewer database platforms

256
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,630
and require less integration.

257
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,470
Again, the 26ai concept
of our converged database

258
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,140
being able to handle
native vector capabilities,

259
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,400
Graph, JSON, Spatial within
one database environment.

260
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,590
Simplify management operations.

261
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,930
You work directly within the AWS Console,

262
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,670
no need to punch out to another console,

263
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,700
it is directly within the AWS Console.

264
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,950
And create a standardized
set of skill sets

265
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,030
for the Oracle Database.

266
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,230
We see our customers

267
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,020
that have unlimited
license agreements with us

268
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,180
capitalize on this tremendously

269
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,900
by having ability to deploy
at scale how they need to.

270
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,550
Reduce risks,

271
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,880
security, continue to identify
and remediate threats,

272
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,890
reduce chance of human errors.

273
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,780
We deployed the Autonomous Database

274
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,060
to be able to self-secure,

275
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,300
self-repair, auto-scale on your own

276
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,150
to reduce human intervention,

277
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,000
which obviously reduces security risks.

278
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,350
And finally, use your
choice of AI and analytics.

279
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,750
Migrate data to the Oracle Database@,

280
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,430
and securely access your data

281
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,790
within the latest GenAI
services and AI capabilities,

282
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,010
many new ones which
have been announced here

283
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,780
at re:Invent today.

284
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,760
Run the analytics of your choice

285
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,593
and create and run DevOps

286
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:27,510
and microservices how you want.

287
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,480
Now, just gonna drill into a
little bit of where we are,

288
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,303
the top scenarios that we see.

289
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,240
To this day, many of my customers

290
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,140
are running Oracle Databases
natively on IaaS services.

291
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,750
Now, again, at the time,

292
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,040
great choice,

293
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,540
but if you could do it over today,

294
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,520
would you make the same choice?

295
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,860
And 90% of the conversations I have,

296
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,300
the answer is no.

297
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,800
There's a maintenance overhead,

298
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,150
there's database sprawl,

299
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,893
it's costly to maintain.

300
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,163
Using the Database@ services with AWS,

301
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,300
up to 99.995 SLAs,

302
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,820
fully managed database infrastructure,

303
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,500
fully managed autonomous,

304
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,420
and we're seeing incredible opportunities

305
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,420
for up to 40:1 database consolidation,

306
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,070
given the performant nature

307
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,163
of our services deployed within AWS.

308
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,460
Second scenario,

309
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,310
again, reuniting apps and
database in the cloud.

310
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,050
I have customers in the healthcare space

311
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,580
that have massive data warehouses,

312
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,110
they have deployed on-prem

313
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,400
and wanna leverage some of that data

314
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,800
to provide customer-facing applications.

315
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,890
Performance has never been ideal.

316
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,000
Now we have the opportunity

317
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,860
to leverage those AWS native services

318
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,940
with the Oracle Database,

319
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,990
removing latency,

320
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,970
improving the customer experience,

321
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,310
and a consistent collaborative support

322
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,623
as well as net new
development opportunities.

323
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,387
Finally, building new applications
with Oracle Database@AWS.

324
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,100
Today, a lot of the applications

325
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,240
that we see our customers build

326
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,420
may not meet performance,
availability or security needs,

327
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,010
especially if you're
developing applications

328
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,670
that require a multitude
of databases and data types

329
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,410
to support that application.

330
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,090
It introduces challenges,

331
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,520
multiple skillset requirements,

332
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,130
overhead of additional
services for AI and analytics,

333
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,970
different security paradigms
for different databases,

334
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,710
post after,

335
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,860
enterprise grade performance at scale,

336
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,200
high availability, security

337
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,440
in a single database that
supports all data types:

338
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,980
JSON, Vector, Graph, Spatial,

339
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,810
unstructured, semi-structured,

340
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,050
structured data in a single environment

341
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,420
built-in GenAI and machine
learning capabilities

342
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,690
to allow us to bring AI to the data

343
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,943
versus the opposite moving.

344
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,940
Again, Oracle Database@,

345
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,830
the best of both worlds.

346
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,223
Enterprise grade data management services,

347
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,120
highly available, fully automated,

348
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,400
performant, agile, built-in security

349
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,460
combined with the most
widely adopted cloud today,

350
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,033
leveraging services like EC2, EKS, S3,

351
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:18,930
SageMaker, Bedrock, Amazon Q,

352
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,980
or any of the native services

353
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,573
that have been announced today.

354
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,070
So, as we kind of wrap up here

355
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,630
in the next two or three minutes,

356
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,080
it's really why Oracle Database@AWS?

357
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,050
And I can tell you

358
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,310
again in my 15-year career,

359
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,350
it is probably the easiest conversation

360
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,810
that I can go have with our customers.

361
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,000
I can provide full Oracle capabilities

362
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,300
in our purpose-built
performance and security

363
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,550
on our Exadata XM11 hardware

364
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,180
deployed inside of the AWS data centers.

365
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,680
I can deploy RAC.

366
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,870
All of my customers that
run RAC over the years

367
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,660
have been asking, "Why can't I deploy RAC

368
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,987
and have the high availability
I need inside of AWS?"

369
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,210
Now, we can.

370
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,790
It's been a while, but
we finally delivered it.

371
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,330
Migrate your on-premise
workloads easily and quickly.

372
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,530
There's another advantage,

373
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,110
de-risking projects by migrating workloads

374
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,600
directly from Oracle Databases on-prem

375
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,510
directly to an Oracle
Database running in AWS.

376
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,370
It's a seamless migration.

377
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,320
We're doing these and
have many, many customers

378
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,753
live in production today already.

379
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,680
Second, low latency.

380
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,730
I get this question a lot,

381
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,350
so I do have to clarify.

382
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,340
It runs within the AWS data center

383
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,800
to enable latency-sensitive applications

384
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,500
to perform at their best.

385
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,960
The same connectivity latency

386
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,600
for Oracle Database@AWS

387
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,470
and their first-party AWS
services in AWS data centers,

388
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,000
no difference.

389
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,800
A seamless experience.

390
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,360
In order to deliver a service like this,

391
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,390
we had to provide a seamless
experience for our customers.

392
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,223
Provision and deploy

393
00:16:58,223 --> 00:17:01,950
directly from the AWS
Management Console or API.

394
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,120
A collaborative support

395
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,330
for supporting the customers in need.

396
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,600
And purchasing it directly
through the AWS Marketplace.

397
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,310
Again, a unique opportunity for us

398
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:15,030
to capitalize on commits
already made with AWS,

399
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,260
burned down the commercials

400
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,570
leveraging Database@ services

401
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,250
and unlocking databases today

402
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,750
that are often sitting on-prem

403
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:24,390
to get them to the cloud.

404
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,040
And then we have native AWS services

405
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,130
like zero-ETL integration
between Oracle Database services

406
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,500
and AWS Analytics services.

407
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,740
And a connected enterprise
in Oracle Database with EC2

408
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,423
and the rest of the services.

409
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,590
Now, as I wrap here,

410
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,180
got one minute left.

411
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,980
If you want more information about this,

412
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,750
it is certainly a huge opportunity for us.

413
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,620
We'd love to talk to you.

414
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,840
One, we've got a booth over in the corner,

415
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,790
happy to answer questions.

416
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,310
And two, we have a litany
of these opportunities

417
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,690
coming across the US,

418
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,310
in Chicago, Atlanta, Boston,

419
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,440
Houston, Austin, Seattle,

420
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,380
to come talk to our teams
about the opportunity

421
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,570
and how we can unlock this for you

422
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,820
and your other customers.

423
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,490
So with that, I really
appreciate everyone's time.

424
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,970
I'd be happy to also dive in
if anybody has more questions

425
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,430
about healthcare specifically

426
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,580
versus just the Database@AWS service.

427
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,250
Oracle has a massive commitment
to healthcare, as you know.

428
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,690
We are committed to help driving

429
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,360
the health ecosystem across it,

430
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,130
so I'd be happy to talk
more specifics about that

431
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,330
if you have any questions.

432
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,670
But certainly happy to talk
about this incredible service

433
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,800
and partnership that we have with AWS

434
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,690
if there's anything you'd like.

435
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,610
With that, thank you very much.

436
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,960
Appreciate your time today.
