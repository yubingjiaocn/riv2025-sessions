1
00:00:00,529 --> 00:00:01,110
Alright.

2
00:00:01,489 --> 00:00:04,049
Welcome everybody to WPS 201

3
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:06,448
architecting larger scale migrations with Fannie Mae

4
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:07,150
and the NRO.

5
00:00:07,488 --> 00:00:09,528
My name is Bobby Halihan, and I'm a solution architect here

6
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:10,349
at AWS.

7
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,689
All right, so what are we gonna speak about today?

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,858
Um, well this is a 200 level session, we,

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,609
uh, because we're not gonna make assumptions that you know everything about migrations

10
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,000
and modernization, so we're gonna take

11
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,399
just 2 minutes, a couple minutes, and we're gonna cover,

12
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,100
uh, migration and modernization patterns, right, just some of

13
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,100
the core common, you know, bread and butter

14
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,260
stuff, hopefully most of you know, but if you don't, you

15
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,519
know, you're gonna learn something right away,

16
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,529
uh, from then we're gonna go into the well

17
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,539
application of well architected principles, and we're gonna

18
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:37,679
talk a little bit about that and how it applies

19
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,759
to migration and modernization

20
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:42,340
and what you'll find throughout today's discussion is.

21
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:44,819
Um, there's gonna be a theme of well

22
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:45,560
architected,

23
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:48,098
uh, and it's something that I heavily wanted to speak about

24
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:48,798
today because,

25
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:51,259
um, you know, it's a kind of a unifying

26
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,298
or underlying principle, right? No matter how you

27
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:54,649
do migrations, um,

28
00:00:54,978 --> 00:00:56,079
especially when they're large scale,

29
00:00:56,728 --> 00:00:58,859
um, being able to fall back on those well architected

30
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:59,639
principles

31
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:02,020
of like like how we do distributed compute

32
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,058
well, um, is just core

33
00:01:04,058 --> 00:01:06,180
to all of this, right? It, it almost underpins it,

34
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,948
um, and, and connects it all together.

35
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,609
Uh, so today we have two, also

36
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,629
two customer stories, right? The first from the National

37
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:14,650
Reconnaissance Office or the NRO. We'll talk about

38
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,680
a large scale migration for a, uh,

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,870
zero fail mission.

40
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,198
Next, we'll then speak with Fannie Mae,

41
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:23,448
who went and redefined and retransformed

42
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:25,480
how they do financial forecasting. They're able to

43
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,549
take a process that took

44
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,319
well over 80 days and bring that into

45
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,329
the realm of just, you know, a few

46
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,650
dozen hours, like 72 hours, like something

47
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,469
crazy compression

48
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:37,019
of that. Um, and then throughout

49
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:39,180
the session we're gonna talk about things that you can do

50
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,209
today, right? So during these, uh,

51
00:01:41,338 --> 00:01:43,579
big migrations, right, obviously there's lessons

52
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:45,400
learned. This isn't just gonna be a, uh,

53
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:48,099
you know, that's all, you know, uh, rainbows

54
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:50,019
and sunshine, right? There's gonna be,

55
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,480
you know, things are hard.

56
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:53,930
There are challenges when doing these migrations,

57
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,159
um, and we're gonna speak about some of that today.

58
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,609
We're gonna speak about lessons learned and, you know, we're really gonna

59
00:01:58,609 --> 00:01:59,120
get in there.

60
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:01,959
So, without further ado, let's talk about

61
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,198
some common migration and modernization patterns.

62
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
So maybe some of us may be

63
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,118
familiar with this type of graph.

64
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,879
Hopefully a few people have seen it before, right? We talk about like,

65
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:13,349
um, like why, why migrate,

66
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,758
right? And in terms of like the value proposition,

67
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,419
it's really,

68
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,800
you know, as you migrate and modernize, your cost

69
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,819
of compute goes down.

70
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,639
Um, however, the innovation velocity, how

71
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,659
fast you're able to move as an organization, how quickly

72
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,419
you can innovate is gonna go up.

73
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,080
Um, so generally speaking, right, if you think

74
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,580
about, you know, going from on-premises to re-hosting

75
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:34,000
Amazon EC2 optimize, maybe you're going into like

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,710
serverless computer, cloud native computing.

77
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:38,308
Um, because of that, you're able to, you're

78
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:39,969
gonna be able to move much faster, right?

79
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,169
However,

80
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,038
um, And then if we take this

81
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,639
like one level deeper, right,

82
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:48,278
and, um, another kind of common pattern

83
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:49,409
for, uh,

84
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,080
you know, just migration, modernization, you know, this

85
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,000
type of thing is,

86
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,588
and you may have heard this before, we call it the seven R's

87
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:57,758
of migration, right? So we'll cover them really quickly, which

88
00:02:57,758 --> 00:03:00,028
is re-host, relocate, repurchase,

89
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,778
retain, retire, re-platform, and refactor.

90
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:05,020
In today's talk we're actually gonna cover

91
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,919
I think just about every one of these will be covered,

92
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,330
um, to, to some extent, right? So like

93
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,338
pay, pay attention for that,

94
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:14,379
uh, I, I, I would say maybe commit 7

95
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,038
things to memory for the next 60 minutes.

96
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:19,038
Maybe that's not, not a fair ask, but, um,

97
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,500
um, just note, right, we will be covering a

98
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,038
few of these.

99
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,000
Um, but let's say.

100
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,199
You know, what if we're just starting, right? Like I don't know

101
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,229
when, when should I re-platform, when should I

102
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:31,419
retain, when should I retire?

103
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,020
How do I make those decisions

104
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,179
is if anyone here is in the, in this room today

105
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:37,199
and you're

106
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,300
thinking about doing a migration, you're in the process of a migration,

107
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,838
um, and you're not doing it necessarily in a

108
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:43,860
very structured way

109
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:46,008
in terms of like how you're making decisions

110
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,939
and you don't necessarily know where to start.

111
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:50,659
Um, there is one thing I would suggest, right,

112
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:53,069
which is taking a look at a migration readiness

113
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,179
assessment or MRA. And what this

114
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:56,349
is, is a,

115
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:57,580
um,

116
00:03:59,088 --> 00:03:59,800
Um,

117
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:02,679
a process, I guess is a fair way to say it,

118
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,919
uh, that is gonna give you preparation,

119
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,360
uh, understanding of the types of things you need to migrate.

120
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,020
There's gonna be workshops, assess assessment

121
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,250
and outcome-focused, essentially to give you a plan

122
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:12,838
so you know,

123
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:15,300
hey, of those seven R's, which ones should we really

124
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,238
look at and what's gonna be most impactful for us.

125
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:21,598
Um, and this is something your account team can help you deliver

126
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:23,420
today. Now

127
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:27,298
In terms of tooling for migration, right, and

128
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,838
we're still covering, you know, this is still kind of like bread

129
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:31,879
and butter basics, but let's, let's, we're still gonna

130
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,338
talk about it because it's, it's important

131
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,980
and we'll see that in our assess, mobilize

132
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,439
and then manage and modern migrate and modernize

133
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,509
what you'll find is,

134
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,819
you know, variety of different tooling here.

135
00:04:43,278 --> 00:04:44,139
For example,

136
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,480
in assess you can see we have right there the

137
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,819
migration readiness assessment,

138
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,949
um, but a couple like callouts I'll make,

139
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,660
especially if you're like starting with your

140
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,778
like migration journey.

141
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:55,608
Um, is,

142
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,209
um, application discovery service is great,

143
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,290
you know, you need to understand what exists on premises.

144
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:01,988
You need to understand what's, what exists there,

145
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:04,569
um, but control tower or landing zones, right,

146
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,189
having some sort of,

147
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,858
essentially like, like, you know, we call them,

148
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:10,649
you know, call it account vending machines, um, some

149
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:12,720
way to be able to provision accounts in a structured

150
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,230
manner,

151
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,720
um. It's

152
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,910
like you just need that if you're gonna migrate, right?

153
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,600
IMS,

154
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,040
maybe I'll even do like a poll of the audience, right? Like how many

155
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,660
people use like automation for, you know,

156
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,798
account provisioning today.

157
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:25,709
A few? OK.

158
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,009
Uh, how many people in the room are actually in the process of

159
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:28,809
doing a migration?

160
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,139
OK, awesome. Alright, so we're in the right place.

161
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:34,660
It's really good, that's really good we're in the right place,

162
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,858
um, so,

163
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:38,139
um, the one thing I would say, right, is,

164
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,559
uh, to be successful in your migrations, um,

165
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,838
you need to have some sort of automation in place, right?

166
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,119
That's gonna help you enforce compliance, it's gonna help you enforce

167
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,569
and standardize governance in the,

168
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,000
in the long run, right? This is one of those things where,

169
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:51,420
you know, it's gonna be probably a little bit of work to set

170
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,420
up, but it's something that's gonna pay off in full

171
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,379
like tenfold later because you can just,

172
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:57,920
you know, push out these accounts as often

173
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,119
as fast as you'd like to.

174
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,059
And then it gives you that type of, um, you know,

175
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,079
uh,

176
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,699
delineation between different workloads, right? So it's,

177
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,259
you know, the question of how many accounts do we use

178
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:10,259
becomes a lot easier because it's not a, it's not a

179
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,278
huge lift to actually start provisioning new things.

180
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:15,040
And then on the

181
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:18,689
Migrate modernized standpoint, right, we have things like

182
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:20,850
Snowball, Kinesis Firehose, Direct Connect of

183
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,069
like, OK, how are we effectively able to connect,

184
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:26,119
um, our on-premises workloads into the cloud,

185
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,048
right, because a lot of times when we migrate,

186
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:30,488
um, there are things where it's like, hey,

187
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:32,649
some stuff's gonna work on AWS, but it still needs to be able to

188
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:34,338
talk to something in our data centers, right?

189
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:37,108
Um, so being able to have that well established,

190
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,108
um, communication is important.

191
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,988
So, right, this sounds, this all sounds pretty easy, right?

192
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,028
Uh, why doesn't everybody do it? Or

193
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:47,809
I guess obviously, right, there are some challenges here, right?

194
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:49,670
And a lot of times we see customer challenges

195
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,088
come out with things like having diverse infrastructure

196
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:54,488
and operating system types, right? Maybe even legacy operating

197
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:56,678
system types or legacy applications,

198
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,108
complex databases.

199
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:00,949
Um, compatibility issues, right? Or

200
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:01,509
even

201
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,910
thinking about like if we're an organization and

202
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,369
we don't operate in the cloud today.

203
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:08,379
Like, do I have a workforce? Is my workforce

204
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:10,660
even specialized or do we have that like that corpus

205
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,009
of knowledge within our employees or

206
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:15,079
organization to actually effectively,

207
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:17,500
um, migrate and and perform this

208
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,209
transformation?

209
00:07:19,298 --> 00:07:21,329
And then of course, right, tight budgets and timelines,

210
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,738
right? We say, OK, we'll move to the cloud, great.

211
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,199
Um,

212
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:27,338
but you're probably not gonna get more budget to do it.

213
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,278
Um, so that's, that's always gonna be a constraint

214
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:31,500
and throughout today's talk,

215
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,170
um, we will, you know, once again that's something I'm

216
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,559
gonna ask you to kind of pay attention to, right? There's some challenges

217
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:38,559
here, but we're gonna cover some more challenges in our customer

218
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,139
stories,

219
00:07:39,678 --> 00:07:41,738
um, and I'd really, really like us to really

220
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:43,738
focus on like what we did

221
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:44,559
to overcome them.

222
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:45,949
Um,

223
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,338
and like think about how you can apply that today,

224
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,838
right, because I think that's really,

225
00:07:50,238 --> 00:07:52,480
um, if we think like what's like the real heart and

226
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,178
core and story of this session, it's,

227
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,678
um, you know, it's not just to tell a good story

228
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:58,750
that, OK, yeah, they migrated, great,

229
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,519
right, awesome outcomes,

230
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,980
but how can you apply those lessons learned today?

231
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:05,238
I think that's really what you're gonna get out of today's session.

232
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:07,379
So,

233
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,639
Outside of just the the uh migration

234
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,019
and modernization patterns,

235
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,819
um, next I wanna speak very briefly on,

236
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,389
uh, the application of well architected in

237
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:19,019
in this in this domain

238
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:20,379
right so we see.

239
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,079
Uh, how many pillars of the well architected roofie do we

240
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,278
have, right? We have operational excellence, security,

241
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,278
reliability,

242
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:29,338
performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability.

243
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,379
And just when we went through those seminars,

244
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,908
right? Like,

245
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:35,879
Uh, well architected is just, it's like bread and

246
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,119
butter distributed compute,

247
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:38,798
right? And

248
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:41,869
Throughout this session you will also see that

249
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:44,508
in some cases even as a solution architect when I work

250
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:46,577
with my customers and we do well architectural reviews,

251
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:48,148
one of the first questions I ask is like,

252
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:50,567
OK, what are these pillars, right, not one is more important

253
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:51,229
than the other,

254
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:53,869
but which ones are more important to you as an organization.

255
00:08:54,489 --> 00:08:56,879
Um, for this workload, for this

256
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,048
application, does it need to be reliable? Is that

257
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:01,168
super important? Or maybe it has to be very

258
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:02,070
cost effective.

259
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,269
Um,

260
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,729
and many of these stories will find

261
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:08,090
that operational excellence, right, reliability

262
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,139
is very important.

263
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,808
Of course we all see security as like job zero for

264
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:13,849
everybody, right? I would say even argue that it's

265
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:14,469
probably,

266
00:09:14,729 --> 00:09:15,548
um,

267
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,210
you would elevate that,

268
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,808
uh, or at least personally I think I like to elevate security

269
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:20,548
to think it's.

270
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Um, not necessarily more important than the other pillars, but

271
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,250
we all know security is of paramount importance.

272
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:26,298
However,

273
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,529
In some organizations they have a very mature

274
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:30,450
security posture,

275
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:32,869
right? Um, maybe there's,

276
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:33,538
uh,

277
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:35,808
a lot of stuff as maybe as an application team

278
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,009
I don't necessarily

279
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,519
need to worry about as much of security because a lot of it's

280
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,649
managed we're very advanced. I, there's not

281
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,759
as much help I'm gonna get out of it as I

282
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,168
would if we could then focus on like cost optimization

283
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,070
or reliability,

284
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:49,048
right? Um, so.

285
00:09:49,908 --> 00:09:51,950
Never that you know one's more important than the other. What we

286
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,288
wanna think about is like where can we get the most outcomes

287
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:56,989
and then when we think about this in the lens of migration,

288
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:59,389
don't necessarily get caught up on the fact of like,

289
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:01,700
OK, are we, are we, um, you know, retiring,

290
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,609
retaining, re-platforming, or rehosting,

291
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:06,489
um, you also wanna make sure that you're focusing on,

292
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,609
um, you know, these core principles.

293
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,759
I wanna reflect back on this this specific slide

294
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,500
here right where we talk about

295
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,779
um you know

296
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,320
like ask the hypothetical what happens

297
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,500
right after we migrate and what happens after

298
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,840
we, you know, essentially almost fully modernize

299
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,599
and we're at the very end of that, you know,

300
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:27,000
um, you know, the very end of that axis

301
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,479
right where you have like big in uh

302
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:30,000
um

303
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,399
innovation velocity right like what does that look

304
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,320
like? Um,

305
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:36,538
but also, like, even after that,

306
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:39,070
you're still gonna have a similar set of challenges.

307
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:40,519
You're still, you know.

308
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,379
Like, maybe if you're a startup, right?

309
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,779
Like you won't have to deal with legacy tech, but

310
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,359
I imagine most people in this room,

311
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,940
um, there's gonna be tech debt, there always

312
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,019
will be, right? You're always gonna be dealing with some of these

313
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:52,719
challenges

314
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:55,099
and. Um

315
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,840
Something I guess I would say in terms of,

316
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,178
you know, what's one thing or like

317
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:03,639
the one, the single biggest thing that you could do

318
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:04,418
um

319
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:05,859
to make sure that.

320
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:09,038
I know you're successful in these migrations, right,

321
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:10,538
and like what's one good I guess

322
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:12,210
signal, right,

323
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:14,590
that you are actively modernizing and you're doing well

324
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,168
in this

325
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,830
is that you have estab established some sort of

326
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,168
like cloud center of excellence,

327
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,009
right? We,

328
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:22,168
you, you can call them whatever you want, right, but

329
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:24,210
essentially what it is, it's gonna be

330
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,288
a team

331
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,139
from across different dimensions of your

332
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,649
organization, right? So from.

333
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:32,178
Uh, lead cloud architects, infrastructure

334
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:33,889
cloud engineers, security engineers,

335
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,580
operations engineers, and then you see your software engineers,

336
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:38,859
right? So you're bringing in people from various

337
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:40,308
different parts of your organization

338
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,658
to build that center of excellence, and essentially what that

339
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:44,279
is doing is,

340
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:47,210
um, you're building that in-house,

341
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,719
uh, expertise,

342
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:51,500
um, where you can take lessons learned, apply

343
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,479
them across the organization.

344
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,840
Um, and of course I believe both

345
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,219
of our, both of our stories today have our customers

346
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,308
have, uh, implemented, uh,

347
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,479
CCLEs or cloud centers of excellence, and

348
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,678
I would, um,

349
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,038
I would go as far to argue is that having these

350
00:12:06,038 --> 00:12:08,019
centers of excellence help accelerate

351
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,379
innovation velocity.

352
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,808
It's so if you don't have one established,

353
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,210
um, think, think about establishing that

354
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,629
within your own organization.

355
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:19,029
Now you may ask, it's like, OK, how formal do we wanna make

356
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,099
it, right? Um, that's really up to you,

357
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:23,340
right? These can be informal groups, they can be

358
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,950
very formalized, um,

359
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,320
it, it's really based on how you wanna do in your organization.

360
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:30,099
Um, like, personally, I don't think it should

361
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,219
be very formal, right, but there should be some sort of

362
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,259
structure around it to make sure that, you know, there's,

363
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,460
you can't just have like a bunch of people that care about the

364
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,418
cloud, right, because,

365
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:40,359
um, one of my favorite quotes is like good intentions

366
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:42,700
don't get things done like mechanisms do, so you

367
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,908
do have to have like some sort of process around that,

368
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,418
right? OK,

369
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:47,320
so

370
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:49,200
without further ado, I wanna introduce,

371
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:51,820
uh, Shri Devi on stage, uh, from Fannie

372
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,918
Mae who's gonna walk us through,

373
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,658
uh, this enterprise transformation that they're able to do.

374
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:06,469
down. Thanks,

375
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:07,928
Bobby. Um,

376
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:10,149
let me start off with a question.

377
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,590
How many of you here with a show of hands,

378
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,759
how many of you here had to modernize

379
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,460
a process that's been around for decades?

380
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:19,899
Don't be shy.

381
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,019
All right, that was us that Fannie Mae too.

382
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,460
Today I'm going to talk about our

383
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,519
unprecedented journey to

384
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:30,700
transform financial forecasting.

385
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:35,210
It wasn't about, for us, the modernization

386
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,509
wasn't just about upgrading

387
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:39,609
technology, it was reimagining

388
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:40,849
how we forecast,

389
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,798
collaborate differently, and make

390
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:44,428
decisions

391
00:13:45,109 --> 00:13:47,259
with increased confidence in our data.

392
00:13:48,158 --> 00:13:50,359
My name is Shridevi Mullapurdi. I'm the vice

393
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,558
president for finance technology at Fannie

394
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:54,969
Mae. When

395
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:57,369
I was first asked to lead this initiative,

396
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,469
the mandate was to build

397
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:01,769
a cost effective and scalable

398
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:02,460
platform

399
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:04,769
that can meet both the current and

400
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:06,509
future forecasting needs.

401
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:10,048
Sound is simple and straightforward, isn't

402
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,308
it? I thought so too,

403
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:14,940
but the more I learned about the program,

404
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,408
I realized that we didn't have to solve

405
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:18,048
for the

406
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:20,428
three typical dimensions people,

407
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:21,879
process, technology.

408
00:14:22,168 --> 00:14:24,210
We also had to solve for 1/4

409
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,769
dimension, governance,

410
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:27,450
all in a single go.

411
00:14:28,558 --> 00:14:30,599
So, over the next 20 minutes

412
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:32,678
or so, I'm going to talk about

413
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:33,658
our approach,

414
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,359
uh, the strategic choices we made,

415
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:38,538
the lessons we have learned, both

416
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:40,019
successes and stumbles,

417
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,519
and the tangible results we are already

418
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,668
seeing. But most

419
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:46,788
importantly, I also plan to

420
00:14:46,788 --> 00:14:48,629
share with you some insights

421
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:50,908
that I hope are valuable

422
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:52,859
to your own transformation journeys.

423
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:54,609
So let's get started.

424
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:57,190
First, a little bit about Fannie Mae.

425
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:01,389
Fannie Mae was founded in 1938

426
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:03,450
and is chartered by US

427
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,109
Congress

428
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:06,529
to advance home ownership and

429
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:08,649
promote affordable housing all

430
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:09,950
across the United States.

431
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,558
We are headquartered in DC and

432
00:15:13,558 --> 00:15:16,080
are considered as the single largest

433
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:18,859
player in the secondary mortgage market.

434
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,558
What does that really mean?

435
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,428
So consider us as the bank for

436
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:24,349
the banks.

437
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,719
So Fannie Mae purchases

438
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,798
home loans from lenders, that is

439
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:29,389
banks,

440
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,359
converts them into mortgage backed securities,

441
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:34,239
and sells those to investors,

442
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,019
and this process creates liquidity

443
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:38,859
for the lenders

444
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:41,320
to offer new home loans, thereby

445
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,479
increasing the home ownership and

446
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:45,678
rental housing again in in

447
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,460
all of the United States.

448
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,538
So just in the first nine months of

449
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:52,019
2025 alone,

450
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,418
Fannie Mae has provided

451
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:56,739
about $287

452
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:59,000
billion worth of liquidity

453
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,500
to support 1.1 million

454
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,058
households to either purchase,

455
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,440
rent, or refinance a home.

456
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:10,719
So you may also know that

457
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,788
US housing economy

458
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:15,158
contributes up to 16%

459
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:16,538
of the nation's GDP,

460
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,479
and with Fannie Mae being the cornerstone

461
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,899
of that housing market

462
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,739
to provide liquidity and stability,

463
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,019
it is vital that

464
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,859
we continue to assess and strengthen

465
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,469
the financial future of the

466
00:16:31,469 --> 00:16:32,960
of the organization,

467
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,639
hence the need for financial forecasting.

468
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:39,369
But you might ask me what's financial

469
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:40,048
forecasting.

470
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,450
Um, in its simplest form,

471
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,609
it's the use of current and

472
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:48,070
past financial data to predict

473
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,779
the financial future.

474
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,918
This is how we guide our business,

475
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,690
um, plan our business,

476
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:57,408
guide our stakeholders,

477
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:59,928
and also meet the regulatory demand.

478
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:02,759
So as part of this process,

479
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:05,209
uh, we have to do tests

480
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:07,779
on a periodic basis to simulate

481
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:09,939
the micro and macroeconomic conditions

482
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:12,019
of the market, which are called

483
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:12,838
stress tests,

484
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:15,759
right? But unlike banks, our

485
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,259
stress tests are actually set by FHFA,

486
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,759
our regulator, and not the Federal Reserve.

487
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,338
So our process is unique and the stakes

488
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:23,939
are high.

489
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:28,388
But why was this a hard thing to do?

490
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:31,539
So let me paint a picture. Imagine

491
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:32,519
a world of

492
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:33,969
spreadsheets,

493
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:36,750
data silos, and manual processes.

494
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:39,500
That was our reality at Fannie

495
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,598
Mae. Right,

496
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,539
and, and for us this process

497
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:45,939
did work well for many years and

498
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,969
it let us prioritize on

499
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:50,368
other things that were important to us,

500
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:53,160
but we quickly realized that

501
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:55,779
it was limiting our ability

502
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:58,098
to provide forward looking insights

503
00:17:58,098 --> 00:17:59,439
to our stakeholders

504
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,939
that is again critical

505
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:04,098
in an increasingly complex environment.

506
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:08,250
In addition to the manual processes,

507
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,709
we also had fragmented

508
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,769
technology and at one point too many

509
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:13,799
technologies,

510
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,608
which was increasing our maintenance costs.

511
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:19,529
We also had software that

512
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:21,650
was running on-prem data centers

513
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,368
with end of life infrastructure.

514
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,479
Our subject matter experts were spread

515
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:29,068
thin across the enterprise and siloed.

516
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,799
So as a result of all of these, we had

517
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,140
significant operational challenges

518
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,709
that were only amplified by heavy

519
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:38,618
custommisations that we've made.

520
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,868
So to solve for these

521
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:45,029
challenges, we initiated the

522
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:47,049
forecast transformation program

523
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,209
um

524
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:51,328
in back in September of 2023

525
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,789
and we set ourselves some very bold

526
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:54,868
goals, right?

527
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:57,269
The first and foremost being we needed

528
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,930
the platform to be fast.

529
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:01,348
We needed to reduce the forecasting

530
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,670
life cycle from about 80

531
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,689
to 10 days,

532
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,279
right? We also wanted to run

533
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,239
our stress tests in parallel.

534
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,910
Running them sequentially was no longer an

535
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,920
option. We

536
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,949
also had to co-locate about

537
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:18,160
2,000+ calculations

538
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,680
that were spread across 80 different

539
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,500
systems

540
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,289
into a single unified platform,

541
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:27,029
and we wanted to run our analytics

542
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:29,219
on top of that calculated output.

543
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,519
We knew to do these calculations,

544
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:34,390
we had to have compute

545
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,689
that could scale up and down based on

546
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:37,588
the demand

547
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,328
and accommodate complex workflows.

548
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:44,209
And we had to do all of this with cost

549
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:44,910
in mind.

550
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:47,400
As you can see, the work was clearly cut

551
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,229
out for us.

552
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:51,799
So,

553
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,479
to, to address these requirements,

554
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:55,358
um,

555
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,180
we first chose AWS as

556
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,890
our foundation,

557
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,449
mainly because it offered

558
00:20:02,449 --> 00:20:04,039
a, a wide variety of

559
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,390
both storage and database options,

560
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:07,209
and they are,

561
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:09,910
they're one of the few vendors that could, um,

562
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:12,000
meet the Fannie Mae's strictest

563
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:13,680
security guidelines.

564
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:17,009
We also wanted to persist

565
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:19,549
all of the data into a single domain,

566
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,410
mainly because we were

567
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:24,029
struggling with the data silos that

568
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:25,750
was in the current ecosystem.

569
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:30,259
We knew that we had to do these calculations

570
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:32,709
on about 1.5 billion

571
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:34,130
loan records,

572
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:35,989
so we needed compute,

573
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:39,529
uh, and for that we chose EMR Elastic

574
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,769
Mapu, as our main

575
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:42,608
compute option.

576
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,059
For orchestration,

577
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:48,660
after a careful evaluation, we settled

578
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,098
on step functions

579
00:20:50,489 --> 00:20:53,019
to stitch between the data services

580
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,019
models and the, both the

581
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:57,059
internal and external systems.

582
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:00,489
We also consciously decided

583
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,949
that we were going to integrate with upstream

584
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:05,108
and downstream systems with minimal

585
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:05,670
impact to them.

586
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:07,789
And finally,

587
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,868
we wanted to establish reusable

588
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:12,969
frameworks, not only to

589
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,750
um accelerate our own development,

590
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:17,130
but also

591
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,759
to give back to the enterprise.

592
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:21,769
Excuse me.

593
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:32,279
So our process is actually very simple.

594
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,199
We start off with the user interface.

595
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:36,000
This is where

596
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:39,420
our business community comes in, um,

597
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,400
enters any of the inputs,

598
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:44,219
and, um, submits the scenarios

599
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,059
for execution.

600
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:48,769
Based on the type of scenario that

601
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,118
they choose to execute,

602
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,049
we go and source relevant data from

603
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,969
um multiple systems of records,

604
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,420
and all of that is written to the data backbone.

605
00:21:59,989 --> 00:22:01,130
We then call upon

606
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:03,630
the models, both existing and

607
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,328
new ones that we created

608
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,410
as part of this ecosystem,

609
00:22:07,949 --> 00:22:10,189
and the model output is also written

610
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:11,348
to the data backbone.

611
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:14,469
We then initiate a bunch of

612
00:22:14,469 --> 00:22:16,049
business calculations,

613
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:18,709
and all of the calculated output

614
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:20,469
is also returned to the backbone.

615
00:22:21,989 --> 00:22:24,318
And then we send off whatever is needed

616
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:25,848
to the downstream systems.

617
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,338
And we further prep this outputs

618
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,348
into uh for analytics,

619
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:34,559
uh, both for regulatory and user,

620
00:22:34,598 --> 00:22:36,180
um, user analytics.

621
00:22:37,699 --> 00:22:39,699
And for those of you who are interested in

622
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:40,920
the tech details,

623
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:43,779
our user interface is made up

624
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,939
of Angular and uh

625
00:22:45,939 --> 00:22:46,719
Fargate.

626
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:49,618
The orchestration, as I mentioned before,

627
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:51,920
is a is nothing but a series of

628
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,959
step functions

629
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,699
that um get initiated

630
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:56,660
through an API.

631
00:22:57,949 --> 00:23:00,250
Whenever a job gets executed.

632
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:03,689
Our calculation framework uses

633
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:06,088
the EMR option that I talked about,

634
00:23:06,588 --> 00:23:07,130
and

635
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,469
it uh and then

636
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:10,818
it uses um the

637
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:13,799
it it then initiates the calculations

638
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:14,920
that are written in Yamu,

639
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:17,029
yet another markup language.

640
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:20,328
For us, this was our way to decouple

641
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,818
the business logic from the

642
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,568
application logic.

643
00:23:25,358 --> 00:23:27,400
And our backbone itself is made up

644
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,420
of S3,

645
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:29,949
and we used uh

646
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:33,039
Aurora and Dynamo DB for

647
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,699
all of the metadata management,

648
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,559
and the integrations were all done

649
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,019
through APIs and SNS

650
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,439
and for analytics we use Sage

651
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:43,719
Maker and Tableau.

652
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,259
So you've heard me, so far you've

653
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:51,539
heard me talk about the genesis

654
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,059
behind our transformation,

655
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,920
the objectives, the process.

656
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:59,459
So how did we do our, on our implementation?

657
00:24:00,969 --> 00:24:03,160
Well, we had our own share of stumbles.

658
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,000
At one point,

659
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:07,338
at its most active phase of the

660
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:09,500
engagement, we had over 100

661
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,239
engineers

662
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:12,039
on this project,

663
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,358
and having them all

664
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:17,229
um consistently adhere

665
00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:19,959
to the guardrails and the best practices

666
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,338
over a period of 2 years was, was

667
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:23,420
really challenging.

668
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:26,529
Consistency was also something

669
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:27,750
that we had to

670
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:30,269
deal with when we were integrating

671
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,769
with about 76 integration

672
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:34,449
points across the ecosystem.

673
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:38,189
As I mentioned to you before, this platform

674
00:24:38,189 --> 00:24:40,588
was going to be used for both regulatory

675
00:24:40,588 --> 00:24:41,108
demands,

676
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:43,509
but also for our data science

677
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:45,729
community that needed that flexibility.

678
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,848
So finding that balance

679
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:49,088
to support

680
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,828
two different ends of the

681
00:24:51,828 --> 00:24:53,949
spectrum was also a challenge that we

682
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:54,828
had to overcome.

683
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,519
And every scenario that we were executing

684
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,059
was generating about 500 terabytes

685
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:02,680
of data.

686
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,170
So we had to find

687
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:07,588
very quickly the right archival

688
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:08,848
strategy because

689
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,390
our our storage costs

690
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,529
were going up if we couldn't solve for that

691
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:15,660
puzzle. And then

692
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,539
because we were doing these calculations

693
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,358
on big data volumes,

694
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:23,180
we knew we needed multiple EMR

695
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,160
clusters.

696
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:25,439
But then

697
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:28,519
we also had to find ways to minimize

698
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:30,539
the cross AZ traffic, cross

699
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,529
availability zone traffic,

700
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:35,400
to reduce the for latency

701
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,000
and also the cost optimization.

702
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,880
And for the same reason.

703
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,059
We also needed,

704
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,509
we also needed to

705
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:46,358
figure out how to

706
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:49,299
Solve for the limits,

707
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:51,689
you know, whether it's an S3 lambda,

708
00:25:51,868 --> 00:25:54,108
account limits, we were running into these limits

709
00:25:54,108 --> 00:25:54,900
all the time,

710
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:57,469
so we had to solve for those, for that

711
00:25:57,469 --> 00:25:58,449
challenge as well.

712
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:04,279
So this is where our partnership with

713
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,479
the AWS became critical because

714
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:08,559
they helped us solve for many of

715
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,818
these challenges that I just talked about.

716
00:26:11,868 --> 00:26:14,549
So we started our engagement with AWS

717
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:17,068
um in August of 2024,

718
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,670
and we had done a series of

719
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,769
deep dives and workshops with them.

720
00:26:22,578 --> 00:26:24,660
Uh, AWS was able to bring

721
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,608
in, um, their specialists,

722
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:29,140
mainly for, um, uh,

723
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,380
compute and storage, sorry, compute

724
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,519
and databases.

725
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,750
And through the,

726
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,568
through the deep dives and workshops, we

727
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:39,939
have been able to iterate and refine

728
00:26:39,939 --> 00:26:41,009
our solutions.

729
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,939
So in addition to the deep dives, we

730
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,539
also leveraged AWS well architected

731
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,279
framework

732
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:51,618
to SSR Foundation.

733
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,630
For us, we specifically focused

734
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,588
on cost,

735
00:26:56,108 --> 00:26:57,588
performance and reliability.

736
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:00,699
For us, cost optimization was

737
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:01,279
not

738
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,578
just a technical goal, it was

739
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:04,858
a business imperative.

740
00:27:05,588 --> 00:27:08,068
So we had to use um AWS

741
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:10,250
services like uh Redshift Spectrum

742
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,828
and S3 partitioning,

743
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,430
but also we created

744
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,689
our own real-time cost monitoring

745
00:27:16,689 --> 00:27:17,449
framework.

746
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:20,509
But my personal favorite was to show

747
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:22,509
the cost of the scenario right on

748
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:23,150
the UI

749
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,789
before the user even clicks on the submit

750
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:27,289
button so that they know

751
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,828
what they're, you know, what, what kind of a

752
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:31,890
bill they would get at the end of that execution.

753
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,039
And to solve for flexibility

754
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,420
and high availability,

755
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:39,930
we leveraged EMR's

756
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,289
instance fleets, which gives you an

757
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:44,650
option of mix and match between different

758
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,719
instance types and different processors.

759
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:49,049
So you could choose between an Intel or an

760
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:51,410
AMD or a or a Graviton

761
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,469
processor based on the type of workload

762
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:54,549
you are dealing with.

763
00:27:56,189 --> 00:27:58,479
And then, um, on proactive

764
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:00,059
capacity management,

765
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,598
uh, we raised account limits. We

766
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,000
worked with AWS to to

767
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,380
raise our account quotas,

768
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:08,979
and we had used

769
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:11,479
S3 pre-partitioning

770
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:12,380
to support our

771
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,078
throughput of 20 million transactions

772
00:28:15,078 --> 00:28:15,719
per second.

773
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:19,088
So every bit of work that

774
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,209
we have done to refine our

775
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:22,430
architecture

776
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,029
was to make was to make

777
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,489
the lives of our business community

778
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:28,430
a bit easier.

779
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:34,380
So, as a result of the work

780
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,650
that we had done, we have been able

781
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,680
to reduce

782
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,400
the cost by 39%

783
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:41,500
and then

784
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:43,818
the execution time almost by

785
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:44,838
70%.

786
00:28:47,949 --> 00:28:49,439
So as to recap,

787
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:51,868
so did we meet our objective

788
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:54,170
of accelerating the forecast

789
00:28:54,588 --> 00:28:57,088
and also simplifying our ecosystem?

790
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,449
I would say absolutely yes,

791
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:02,630
because we have been able to reduce our manual

792
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,769
processes by about

793
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:05,219
60%.

794
00:29:05,588 --> 00:29:08,170
We have reduced our system execution

795
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:10,318
from 20 to 3 days,

796
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,709
and we are now able to run.

797
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:15,269
Uh, a forecast that for

798
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:17,689
36 million loan records,

799
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,219
uh, for every scenario, and we

800
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:22,588
can run up to 20+ scenarios

801
00:29:22,588 --> 00:29:23,209
in a month.

802
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,568
Prior to this, we could only run

803
00:29:26,568 --> 00:29:28,568
our forecast for a book

804
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:30,568
of 1.4 million loans or

805
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,858
so. So

806
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:36,059
we have been able to provide a modular

807
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:38,199
and auditable platform that

808
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:39,858
supports rapid innovation.

809
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:42,059
While this platform

810
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:44,400
did take about 15 squads

811
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,559
to develop and design,

812
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,920
it now we only now need

813
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,000
about 2 squads to support it on an

814
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,239
ongoing basis.

815
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:54,838
And just for reference, uh, a squad

816
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:57,039
could have between 6

817
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,939
to 8 engineers.

818
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:02,689
So, um,

819
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,088
while we did deliver on the, the

820
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:07,439
initial phase of the program,

821
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:10,269
we are continuing to work to refine

822
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:12,108
our advanced analytics

823
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,828
and introduce Gen AI capabilities.

824
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:17,739
We also want to extend this platform

825
00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:18,608
to

826
00:30:18,979 --> 00:30:21,598
the two different business lines, um,

827
00:30:21,838 --> 00:30:24,250
our multi-family and capital markets,

828
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,858
and of course we are actively

829
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:27,640
socializing

830
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,680
the reusable frameworks we created

831
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:33,140
for adoption across the enterprise.

832
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,769
So as I conclude today's session,

833
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,489
let me share with you a few insights

834
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:41,250
that transcend technology.

835
00:30:42,489 --> 00:30:44,838
One The first one being,

836
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,420
you know, modernizations like these

837
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,670
are marathons, not just sprints.

838
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,059
So please

839
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,420
continue to

840
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:55,400
enjoy all the wins, right? Celebrate all

841
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,559
the wins, whether they are big and whether

842
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:58,779
they are big or small.

843
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:02,568
Technology is just an enabler. People

844
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:03,588
drive the success,

845
00:31:03,969 --> 00:31:06,108
so continue to invest in your teams.

846
00:31:07,088 --> 00:31:08,969
And data quality

847
00:31:10,108 --> 00:31:11,848
should be non-negotiable.

848
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:14,489
We not only consolidated all of

849
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:15,449
the data

850
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,150
into a single domain, but we

851
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,630
applied data governance on top of

852
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,068
that data from day one.

853
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:24,588
So as a result, we are now quickly

854
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:27,489
able to build out our Gen AI capabilities.

855
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,559
And finally, I would also say that

856
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,039
always start with the business problem and

857
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,500
not just technology.

858
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:37,358
Um, for us, that, that was

859
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:38,019
a big,

860
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:38,979
um,

861
00:31:39,318 --> 00:31:39,939
big theme.

862
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,779
Um, I forgot to add one thing,

863
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,539
um, is embracing agility.

864
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:48,640
That was the recipe for

865
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,920
success. So the iterative work that

866
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,559
we had done with AWS

867
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,279
or even with our product and business

868
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:55,858
teams

869
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,328
helped us, um, in, in,

870
00:31:58,358 --> 00:31:59,559
in this engagement.

871
00:32:01,358 --> 00:32:03,519
So, as you think about your own

872
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,779
transformations,

873
00:32:05,118 --> 00:32:07,509
what are the outcomes you would like to achieve?

874
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,199
For us, it was not just about better

875
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:11,000
forecasts,

876
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,719
it was about better decision enabling.

877
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,059
And Fannie Mae's journey is obviously

878
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:19,049
not finished, it's ongoing,

879
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,559
but we have set the foundation

880
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:24,920
to forecast with greater accuracy

881
00:32:25,098 --> 00:32:27,519
and lead with increasing confidence,

882
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:29,939
and that is going to serve us and

883
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:32,199
the housing market we support for years

884
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:34,239
to come. So thank you for

885
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:35,140
your time.

886
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,140
I, I hope, uh,

887
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,709
you found the information helpful.

888
00:32:40,078 --> 00:32:42,078
Please do take a little bit of time

889
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:44,430
to, uh, complete the survey and, uh,

890
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:46,059
enjoy the rest of your conference.

891
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:46,920
Thank you.
