1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:00,869
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,539
We are Vega. We're a start-up started

3
00:00:03,539 --> 00:00:05,679
in January 2024.

4
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:08,250
We raised $65 million from

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,478
cyberstarts, Acel, Wetpoint, and.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,470
To completely change how you

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,509
do security operations and

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:16,879
security analytics,

9
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,329
um, and today we're gonna talk

10
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:21,089
about how you can reimagine

11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,629
your SIM architecture using

12
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:25,298
AWSS for buckets,

13
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:27,750
something that we all have today,

14
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:30,109
and how you can increase your

15
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:32,429
visibility and get a lot

16
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,399
more out of your data

17
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:37,228
without compromising on costs

18
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:38,709
and breaking the bank.

19
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,090
So, um.

20
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:44,719
Just a bit on us, I'm Ellie. I'm

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,868
the co-founder and CTO here at Vega.

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,209
Uh, I've been building Vega together with a

23
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:51,469
team for, uh, almost two years,

24
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,149
since January 2024.

25
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:55,609
I'm based in New York, originally from Tel

26
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:56,168
Aviv.

27
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:58,569
I've been doing cybersecurity for more

28
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:00,598
than 15 years. Started on the

29
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:01,509
offensive side,

30
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,430
uh, and now on the defensive side.

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,888
Actually did a lot of, uh, uh,

32
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,120
low-level engineering, which is gonna,

33
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:11,349
uh, show up in, uh, the talk today.

34
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,209
And also Iran.

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Uh, hi everyone. Uh, my name is Ian, head

36
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,159
of, uh, threat detection and research at

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,329
Vega. Uh, past 10 years, roughly

38
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:22,359
doing incident response, uh, threat hunting,

39
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,019
managed the SOC

40
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,138
in the past,

41
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,588
uh, led engagements, uh,

42
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:29,000
of incident response in a global

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,819
IR firm,

44
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,239
and today at Vega for

45
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,400
around 1 year and a half years.

46
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,219
Perfect. So really when we started

47
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:40,299
Vega, um, we spoke with

48
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,939
hundreds of enterprises

49
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:44,918
and we asked them and

50
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:47,599
spoke with them about their challenges

51
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:50,138
today that they're facing with their SIM and

52
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:52,239
their security operations programs.

53
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:55,189
Um, and really we have, we've identified

54
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:56,599
three common problems

55
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,099
amongst almost every customer that we

56
00:01:59,099 --> 00:01:59,838
spoke with.

57
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,299
The first one is growing security

58
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:03,540
telemetry volume

59
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:04,719
and with.

60
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:07,109
You know, migration to the cloud today and

61
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:08,610
multi-cloud environments,

62
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,588
the types and volumes of security telemetry

63
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:13,969
just grows year over year and

64
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,270
you know, significantly grows, and you

65
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,270
have cloud logs, VPC flow logs,

66
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:20,308
you have all these logs that you want to

67
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:22,868
be able to generate security insights

68
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:23,490
from them,

69
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:25,868
but it's really challenging. It's really

70
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:27,909
challenging many times because of

71
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:29,849
the cost constraints

72
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:32,610
that are coming with the traditional

73
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,008
architecture of the same.

74
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,240
And really if you think about,

75
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,349
you know, the traditional monolithic architecture

76
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:42,210
requires you to send all these logs

77
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,250
and pay for each byte of log

78
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,669
that you're sending into your SIM

79
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,330
and therefore you have to deal with all

80
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,349
these cost constraints. Um,

81
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:53,008
another common problem that we've seen

82
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:53,669
amongst

83
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:56,599
every organization or a lot of

84
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,808
organizations is as a result of the growing data

85
00:02:58,808 --> 00:03:01,419
volume as well as the cost constraints,

86
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,808
we've seen a lot of organizations who just

87
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,770
keep. Multiple data repositories

88
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,729
of their security telemetries.

89
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,288
Maybe they have some in each cloud

90
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:13,399
environment. Maybe

91
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:15,889
they have a bunch of different SIMs. We've seen

92
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:18,008
organizations with 9 different SIMs

93
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:20,610
and uh different data lakes,

94
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,830
and think about how you can deal with that.

95
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,960
Um, and

96
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:27,979
All of these, uh, uh,

97
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,979
uh, you know,

98
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,000
uh, problems really stem

99
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:33,008
from

100
00:03:33,808 --> 00:03:35,838
The outdated monolithic

101
00:03:35,838 --> 00:03:37,729
architecture of the SIM,

102
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,099
which requires organizations

103
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,558
and leads, you know,

104
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,000
engineers and, and the security

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,939
operations teams

106
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,139
to work with some assumptions

107
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,479
of, uh, you know, what you can

108
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,479
do and what you should do with your, with

109
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,088
your security telemetries.

110
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,618
And the most important

111
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,479
assumption that we are challenging at

112
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,088
Vega. Is

113
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:02,800
telemetry,

114
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,979
security telemetry centralization.

115
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,528
And we're asking ourselves,

116
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,500
why

117
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,308
do you need to centralize and copy

118
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:13,538
each byte of data

119
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,278
that you would like to be able to monitor on?

120
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,838
Uh, why can't you just query

121
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:21,619
data in multiple data repositories

122
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,470
instead of sending it all over the

123
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,040
internet, uh,

124
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,540
uh, into this one centralized data

125
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,579
location? Another one is.

126
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,949
Why the storage and detection,

127
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,769
engineering and threat hunting capabilities

128
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:37,970
must be coupled into the same

129
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:40,000
uh monolithic system.

130
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:42,579
Just like how, uh, uh, you know, we've

131
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:44,970
seen data technologies that decouple

132
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,250
storage and compute.

133
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,910
Why? Security

134
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,939
operations teams have to rely on

135
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:53,040
a single monolithic piece

136
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,798
that couples together their storage

137
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,678
and the storage fees

138
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,459
together with the security processes

139
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:01,920
and outcomes that they want

140
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:03,959
out of this security data.

141
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,750
And really it also we're asking

142
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,569
the question of

143
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:10,449
why cannot you utilize

144
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,569
multiple

145
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:14,189
uh uh uh data repositories

146
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,309
and storages, uh, maybe

147
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,189
even your S3 buckets

148
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,509
to achieve the outcomes that you

149
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:22,588
would like out of a traditional

150
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,588
SIM, uh, querying the data,

151
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,850
correlating the data.

152
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,399
And what happens really when you have

153
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:30,829
multiple data repositories?

154
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:33,149
Maybe uh uh that's due to

155
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:33,699
MNA.

156
00:05:34,338 --> 00:05:36,629
Maybe you've acquired a new company

157
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,019
and they have another SIM.

158
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,858
Maybe as a result of data residency

159
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:43,298
requirements, you have to keep data in multiple

160
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:44,519
data repositories.

161
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,819
But uh, you still want to be

162
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,959
able to cross correlate.

163
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,290
Uh, data across all these different repositories

164
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:54,619
and even, you know, either build

165
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:56,028
an a detection,

166
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:58,548
right, on top of this data, maybe do some

167
00:05:58,548 --> 00:05:59,170
threat hunting

168
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:01,509
or respond to a real incident and

169
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:03,629
you would like to be able to query all this

170
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,170
data.

171
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:05,809
Fundamentally,

172
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:09,079
You know, those outdated

173
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:11,439
architectural assumptions that are coming

174
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,470
with the monolithic architecture of the same

175
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:16,178
really, uh, uh, uh, you know,

176
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:17,319
uh, make

177
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:20,178
the threat detection team as well as the architecture

178
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:22,298
team, uh, uh, you

179
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,379
know, it's, it's a huge challenge to

180
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,000
solve these,

181
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:27,338
uh, problems with the traditional tools

182
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:29,459
that we have today. And let's talk

183
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,639
about how it affects real,

184
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,579
uh, AWS customers today.

185
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,678
OK, so we can take uh A

186
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:39,858
address as a, as an example how

187
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,040
to uh leverage um a

188
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,420
federated architecture

189
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,259
to achieve security operations.

190
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:47,910
So, uh let's see, uh, there's

191
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,879
an organization they want to,

192
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,540
uh, monitor and apply, uh,

193
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:54,600
detections and threat hunting

194
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,899
and incident response over their AWS

195
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:57,500
environment.

196
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,199
So for that, first of all, they gotta enable

197
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,670
those logs. They are cloud trails, VPC

198
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,939
flow logs, guard duty.

199
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:06,129
So there's a fee of course

200
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,569
for AWS to enable those services.

201
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:10,730
Those services are

202
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:13,470
creating logs and audits, and those logs

203
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,829
need to be retained. So we have the AWS

204
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:16,608
storage,

205
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,290
that's your cloud watch, your S3

206
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:19,928
buckets.

207
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,509
So you have the service creating

208
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,730
the logs. You have now the storage there,

209
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,428
but the team cannot really leverage those logs

210
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:29,790
for any security purposes when they're

211
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,790
simply retained

212
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,709
in that storage.

213
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,238
So what they gotta do in the, you know, the,

214
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,298
the, the old fashioned way as we call it, they gotta

215
00:07:37,298 --> 00:07:39,699
send it to the SIM. So they gotta uh

216
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:42,298
start shipping all the logs from AWS

217
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,420
outside of Amazon and into their SIM. So

218
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,540
this is leading for AWS egress

219
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,178
costs.

220
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,000
For data movement,

221
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,579
then we have the most significant

222
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:54,759
cost for the SIM ingestion

223
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:57,178
and also the SIM storage because you want

224
00:07:57,178 --> 00:07:59,079
to retain it for a long period of time

225
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,379
and most most SIM solutions

226
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:02,869
today. Of course,

227
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:03,809
um,

228
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:06,329
you need to also apply security modules

229
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:08,730
and this, this costs additional costs, meaning

230
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,309
that if a security team

231
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,899
wants to go ahead and have

232
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:15,369
uh security operation capabilities

233
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,528
on top of your AWS environment, they

234
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:20,088
gotta have 6 places where they're actually

235
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:20,910
spending money

236
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,488
just to do this simple thing.

237
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:25,278
Imagine there's an

238
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:27,750
organization with 200, 400,

239
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:30,309
even 750 ES accounts,

240
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:32,129
uh, and how much

241
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:34,788
money just cost just to get the

242
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:37,029
data to where they can start leveraging

243
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:39,268
it. So, uh, with

244
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,817
this example, this is what we're, um,

245
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,347
one example of one thing we're coming to,

246
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:46,619
to, to fix and, and address,

247
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:48,327
uh, in our federated approach.

248
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,269
So, uh, let's see how this looks like, for

249
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,359
example, when we do not

250
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:55,570
ship the logs to the SIM.

251
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:58,629
So, we got the, of course, the

252
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:00,570
service, so we gotta enable those logs.

253
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:02,710
Uh, we gotta store them,

254
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:04,548
so in the database storage,

255
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:05,788
but that's it.

256
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:08,950
What basically we're doing, we're applying

257
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,469
an indexer

258
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:12,849
to index those logs exactly

259
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:15,029
where they already are, where they natively

260
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:15,830
already live.

261
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:17,710
So we're using

262
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:20,129
uh indexing computes in the same

263
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:20,908
cloud,

264
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,428
in the same region

265
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:25,129
to take those logs in,

266
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:26,869
let's say S3 buckets

267
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:29,629
and create an index for them in the same storage.

268
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,590
So we're, we're able to achieve

269
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,178
that index without chipping the logs

270
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,288
outside of AWS.

271
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:39,070
The second part of this, of, of

272
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,509
this process is to be able to run queries,

273
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,788
threat hunting, incident response, detections,

274
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:44,609
and that's where,

275
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:46,509
uh, Vega is a console.

276
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:49,389
Um, which is external is able

277
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,048
to reach out to that storage, to that index,

278
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:54,489
and do queries, do federated

279
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:56,918
detections, do instantent response, and essentially

280
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:59,308
everything a security need a team would need

281
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,808
to, um,

282
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,119
uh, to, to, to do detection and response over

283
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:03,849
AWS.

284
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,408
So we just have some

285
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:08,619
service fees, the storage, the 3 buckets,

286
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,729
some, some computes, but it's a

287
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:12,229
small fraction of the

288
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,269
money it actually costs

289
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:16,250
when you don't need to ship it.

290
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,739
So in this scenario, an organization with

291
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:20,798
let's say 750+

292
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,158
HDBS accounts that can achieve

293
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,918
these security operation capabilities

294
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,719
with 60

295
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:29,639
up to 80%

296
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:30,820
cost reduction.

297
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,729
By doing this approach,

298
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,109
so there's no what we call syntax.

299
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:37,460
Uh, let's see 22 use cases,

300
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:39,719
an example. Uh, with

301
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,859
two organizations that we're working with who

302
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:42,619
are using

303
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:44,139
S3 buckets,

304
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,210
um, to, to, um,

305
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:48,479
to use the federated architecture.

306
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:51,418
So one is a major e-commerce platform.

307
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:54,548
They essentially had a seam solution that they

308
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:55,928
use for everything they need,

309
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:58,690
but they also needed to have a longer retention

310
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,750
period, so they're shipping everything

311
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,729
to S3 buckets just as a backup.

312
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:05,428
When we started a conversation with them, we just told

313
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:07,369
them, listen, all your logs are already

314
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:09,710
in a, in a very low cost,

315
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,288
high performance storage.

316
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,250
But you're also sending it to the SIM and it costs

317
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,190
you so much money.

318
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,808
So essentially we're, we started

319
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:20,090
to index all their logs, their firewall,

320
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,908
EDR,

321
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,599
Office 365,

322
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:25,639
any data source that they have in estuary buckets.

323
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:27,928
We just applied indexing for it exactly where it

324
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:30,029
is. This made their

325
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:31,369
SIM entirely redundant

326
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,668
because they were able to create detections on top of the S3

327
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:36,710
threat hunting on top of S3 incident

328
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,590
response the same,

329
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,029
so they were able to churn and entirely remove

330
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:42,029
the SIM and the immediate value

331
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:44,229
was a 70% cost reduction in

332
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:44,808
total.

333
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:47,590
Um, they have the same

334
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,629
security capabilities but even more than

335
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:51,869
that because now that they have this additional cost

336
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:54,210
they're able to say, right, so now I can have

337
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:56,219
longer retention periods of my

338
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:58,399
data. I can onboard more

339
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,700
data that I could not have onboarded before.

340
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,570
Let's say I can have a load balancer logs or waf

341
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,629
logs or the EDR event telemetry,

342
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,889
something that I say I cannot really fit in my SIM,

343
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:10,359
but now that I have this extra money plus the

344
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:12,570
capability to operationalize data in a low,

345
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,080
in a low cost, high performance storage, now

346
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,580
it's an opportunity for them.

347
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:19,590
Uh, the second use case is a Fortune 500

348
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,759
pharmaceutical company.

349
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,629
They had a very,

350
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:24,330
very large SIM.

351
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:27,428
Um, really dozens of terabytes per

352
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:29,469
day. And at some point

353
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:31,649
they realized that they cannot afford

354
00:12:31,788 --> 00:12:34,229
to send all the logs from AWS

355
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:35,129
to their SIM

356
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,330
just because of, of, of

357
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,210
the insane amount of costs

358
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:41,048
of uh that it takes.

359
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,269
So they were looking for a solution to

360
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:46,668
uh have security operations on top of

361
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:48,048
their AWS without

362
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:49,139
shipping it to the SIM.

363
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:52,168
So, uh, we came in, we started to index

364
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:54,389
all their, uh, they have a 500 or more

365
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:56,678
than 500 AWS accounts. So we started to index

366
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:59,009
their cloud trail, VPC flow logs, guard duty,

367
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,469
cloudWatch, any piece of data, RDS logs,

368
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:03,928
everything they needed for the security day to day.

369
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:07,058
Uh, they gained full visibility, all

370
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:09,259
detection capabilities on top of it, but

371
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:11,489
did not ship a single log out of Amazon.

372
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:13,649
Everything solely rela uh there,

373
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,538
no egress cost at all, no syntax,

374
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:18,558
um, but then you can say,

375
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:20,219
but I have an issue now.

376
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:22,558
I have logs

377
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,308
for my security team

378
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:25,379
in S3.

379
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:28,279
But also have logs for security

380
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,580
in the SIM, so practically what happened

381
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,119
there is data fragmentation.

382
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,019
Practically what happened here is the security teams

383
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,099
need to work on two consoles, and this is what we

384
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:38,038
wanted to avoid.

385
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,950
So Vega also have that capability to

386
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,989
go ahead and connect to an existing

387
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:43,538
SIM,

388
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:45,548
also an existing data lake,

389
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,489
and also to object storage

390
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:49,989
and cross correlate information that does

391
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:51,450
not exist in the same place.

392
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,250
One more slide

393
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,139
So there are 3 core.

394
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:00,080
Things that we're um

395
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,719
focusing on. The first one is the capability

396
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:04,820
to to have a correlation cross

397
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,979
storage. If I have logs in S3,

398
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,099
logs in my SIM, log in my Elastic,

399
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:11,340
logs in my Snowflake, logs in other

400
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,500
cloud platforms, I can still run one

401
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,859
query that is taking these logs and these logs

402
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:18,580
and cross correlating it, so the fragmentation

403
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,440
becomes irrelevant.

404
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:22,190
The second thing is hybrid data lakes,

405
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,460
meaning that I can have

406
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,178
uh data lake, let's call it the S3 I

407
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:28,298
can have something which is the elastic and I I

408
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:28,869
can have the SIM.

409
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:31,960
So different data lakes of different technologies

410
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,739
of different even query languages, but

411
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:36,320
it would still work seamless.

412
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,158
And the third thing.

413
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,918
Is to still keep a unified

414
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:42,918
security view, meaning one platform, a

415
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:43,940
true real,

416
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,500
uh, single pane of glass,

417
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,080
even though I have different data lakes, it's still

418
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,200
11 console, one query

419
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,859
language,

420
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,239
and just one interface to work in for the

421
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,239
team and let's see how, uh, let's see

422
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:56,779
how this looks like at a high level.

423
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:00,658
So you must, must be asking

424
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:02,700
yourself how does this magic work behind the

425
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,369
scenes.

426
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:04,599
So this is

427
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:07,139
basically what we've been working on

428
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,340
for the last two years.

429
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:10,869
And we call it SEM, Security Analytics

430
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:11,440
Smash.

431
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,019
Now, the architecture

432
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:16,019
of security analytics Smash

433
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:19,320
really gives you the flexibility

434
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:21,950
of connecting to the data

435
00:15:22,178 --> 00:15:24,250
wherever it makes sense to keep the

436
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,440
data. And you must be asking

437
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,570
yourself, well, now I have to rip and replace my

438
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,418
existing SIM.

439
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,428
But no, as everyone said,

440
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:34,369
one of the core capabilities of Vega

441
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:36,658
is understanding that you already

442
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:38,849
have made a lot of investments

443
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:41,298
in your EDR platform, in your

444
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:42,629
existing SIM platform,

445
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:45,548
in maybe a data lake where you're shipping

446
00:15:45,548 --> 00:15:48,048
some of your logs. Maybe you're using a pipeline

447
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,269
tool like a Quibble

448
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:51,629
to push them to ask for buckets.

449
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,440
Vega can help

450
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,820
instantly operationalize all

451
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,719
of these data repositories

452
00:15:58,038 --> 00:16:00,229
uh uh without moving all the data.

453
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:02,399
So we can connect to any

454
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:03,399
SIM,

455
00:16:03,658 --> 00:16:05,779
Splank, Microsoft Sentinel, Google

456
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:06,859
Setups, Elastic.

457
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,840
We can connect to any NextGen SIM

458
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:12,859
and XDL platforms like the

459
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:15,580
Sentinel One Data Lake or the CrowdStrike

460
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,479
NextGen SIM.

461
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:18,989
And all of the telemetries

462
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:21,149
that you already have in there, they

463
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:23,210
can stay in there, and over time,

464
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:25,509
if you feel like it makes sense for you to

465
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:27,710
move them to S3 buckets or a data

466
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,269
lake,

467
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:30,658
it's up to you. You now have the

468
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:32,710
flexibility to choose where you want

469
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,080
to store your data.

470
00:16:35,178 --> 00:16:37,308
Now, but the real power of Vega

471
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:37,918
comes

472
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,340
when uh uh we talk about data

473
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,320
lakes and object storage.

474
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,099
So we can connect to also

475
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:47,099
data lakes such as data bricks

476
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:49,580
or Snowflake. And if your CIO

477
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,580
decides that, you know, you guys

478
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,808
are going all in on a specific data lake,

479
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:56,558
that's fine. That should not change

480
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:58,859
uh how the security team is

481
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:01,330
working or building and managing detections.

482
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,598
But most importantly for AWS

483
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:05,430
customers,

484
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,838
Vega shines if you have a lot

485
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:10,539
of data already in object storage.

486
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,759
And if you think about most of the

487
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:15,160
telemetries that are born in the cloud, or basically

488
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,229
all of the telemetries that are born in the cloud,

489
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,660
they are naturally born in object storage.

490
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:22,239
Vega allows you to keep

491
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:24,928
all the cloud logs and the VPC

492
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:25,798
flow logs

493
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:28,698
within those object storage. What we

494
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:31,259
do is we have our own indexing

495
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,259
technology where you don't need to ship the

496
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,337
data to any data lake or or

497
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,659
a SIM. We can connect and index

498
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:38,417
the data

499
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:41,239
within the same cloud and within the same region.

500
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:43,948
This architecture makes so much

501
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:44,878
more sense

502
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:47,438
because there is no need to send data all

503
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:48,417
over the internet.

504
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,049
Now, think about a multi-cloud

505
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:52,338
uh environment.

506
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,769
Maybe you're using multiple clouds.

507
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,549
We have a customer who is

508
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:00,219
utilizing all three major clouds

509
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:02,289
across tens of regions, and they have

510
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,469
thousands of cloud

511
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:05,769
accounts across each

512
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,608
each cloud provider.

513
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,390
With them we can instantly operationalize

514
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,368
all of their data

515
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:13,324
in the. The data locally,

516
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:15,934
save a lot of money. This

517
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:17,963
can come up to millions of dollars and even

518
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,434
tens of millions of dollars, but still

519
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:23,193
achieve all the security outcomes

520
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,074
that they want

521
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:26,074
and get visibility

522
00:18:26,424 --> 00:18:28,993
out to all of the security telemetries.

523
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:31,473
Also, you have much more power

524
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,864
because you can be in control over

525
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,134
your own indexes. You can keep

526
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:37,233
the indexed

527
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:38,555
buckets

528
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:40,934
in your AWS account.

529
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:43,459
So now you have more attention,

530
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,750
more flexibility to where you want to put

531
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,328
your data,

532
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,769
and less cost.

533
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:49,059
Sounds good to me.

534
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:50,568
Um,

535
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,098
really, all of these data repositories

536
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,559
are are accessible for a single KQL

537
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,848
query interface.

538
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,380
So our user interface and user experience

539
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,420
is very good.

540
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:02,930
People love it and especially analysts

541
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,189
who are already familiar with the pipeline language

542
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:07,449
like SPL or Microsoft Sentinel's

543
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:09,750
KQL we leverage the same KQL

544
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,068
so it's easy to get started instantly,

545
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,358
um, uh uh and, and

546
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:16,449
get your sock uh to be familiar

547
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:17,309
with the system.

548
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:19,969
We also obviously leverage a lot of AI

549
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:22,430
and LLM capabilities within the product

550
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,509
to, to make, uh, uh, uh,

551
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,910
asking simple questions really easy.

552
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,279
And I think the most important piece is

553
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,019
that this is the foundation

554
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:36,338
for an AI native security

555
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:38,920
operations, because once you have this single semantic

556
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,920
data layer across all of your

557
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,479
security telemetries in every data repository,

558
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,104
you can now achieve the AI outcomes

559
00:19:46,104 --> 00:19:48,344
that you want out of your data, because we all

560
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:49,344
know that your

561
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,275
AI triage, AI detections,

562
00:19:52,545 --> 00:19:54,664
AI ability to

563
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:56,703
