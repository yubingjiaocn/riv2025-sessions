1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,130
- Hello, hello.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,273
How is everyone doing?

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,240
I realize this is day three

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,780
and the only thing keeping between you

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,670
and a happy hour is me.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,530
So I'll try and make it interesting.

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,320
I know you have heard AI agents
all through the conference,

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,750
but trust me, this is gonna
be really interesting.

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,790
We are gonna be talking about AI agents,

10
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,900
the new phase of privileged
machine identities.

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm Venu Shastri.

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,980
I'm a Senior Director of
product marketing for platform

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,900
and AI solutions at CyberArk.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,420
And joining me for this
session is my colleague

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,050
Anat Eytan-Davidi, Senior
Manager for product management

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,693
who's leading our secure
AI agent solution.

17
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,360
Alright, so I don't want to assume

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,520
that everyone here knows about CyberArk.

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,140
So just a quick intro.

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,960
We are an identity security leader

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,510
that offers a comprehensive platform

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,530
for securing all types of
identities, humans, machine,

23
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,220
and the new wave of autonomous AI agents

24
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,440
all to ensure that they
have the right level

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,970
of privilege control.

26
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,580
Now, some of you might
recognize as a PAM leader

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,560
or privileged access management leader,

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,540
but we offer way more than that,

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,240
including things like identity
and access management,

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,760
threat detection and response, governance,

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,970
comprehensive machine
identity security and so on.

32
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,220
And the idea is that we
provide all these capabilities

33
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,470
to every identity human machine

34
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,680
or AI every time they're trying to access

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,540
any kind of enterprise resource.

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,460
Is it endpoint or infrastructure

37
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,100
or cloud to drive all
kinds of value, right?

38
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,930
In terms of reducing CyberArk.

39
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,630
In terms of cyber risk reduction,

40
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,140
enabling business resilience,
ensuring compliance

41
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,180
and increasing efficiency.

42
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,430
And in case you missed the news

43
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,430
recently Palo Alto announced
its intent to acquire CyberArk

44
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,203
as a part of its broader
platformization strategy.

45
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,990
Alright, so let's get started.

46
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,990
Today's focus is gonna be on agentic AI.

47
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,590
Right, now AI agents are
rapidly becoming the new face

48
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,230
of privileged machine identities
in the enterprise, right?

49
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,250
You have heard a lot about it.

50
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,310
So I'm just gonna quickly skim
through the immense potential

51
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,540
they have to offer,

52
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,120
but I'll quickly get
into why it is important

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,810
to think about the identity
security aspect of AI agents.

54
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,060
And then I'll have my
colleague Anat talk to you

55
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,700
through our secure AI agent solution

56
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,403
before I wrap it up with
summary and next steps.

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,940
Alright, so starting
off with the potential.

58
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,790
Now I know that agentic
AI is really exciting

59
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,410
for a lot of organizations.

60
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,160
It has the potential to
unlock trillions of dollars

61
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,510
across the industry.

62
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,570
This could be whether it is
software engineering, sales,

63
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,350
marketing, customer
operations, support and so on.

64
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,950
And early experiments have
shown that it's not all hype.

65
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,720
There is real measurable gains

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,550
that a lot of customers are getting

67
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,893
even as they start off on this pilot.

68
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,250
But what is important is that it uncovers

69
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,780
unprecedented risk,
especially as these AI agents

70
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,580
are given elevated privileges

71
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,620
to access enterprise resources.

72
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,410
Now, by definition, AI agents
means that you're giving

73
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,680
agency to the LLM to access and do things,

74
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,420
and that's where the risk is, right?

75
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,140
So these risks not just stem
from external threat actors,

76
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,630
we need to realize that we
are still in the early stages

77
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,230
of AI agents and they are
prone to hallucinations

78
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,000
or they might misunderstand the context,

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
so they might end up doing things

80
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,260
that they were not intended to do.

81
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,530
So further, what we need to
realize is that as agent AI

82
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,860
adoption grows, the
risks are gonna multiply

83
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,450
because the agents are going to operate

84
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,610
at different maturity levels.

85
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,200
Now, for a lot of folks,

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,960
AI agents typically means an AI assistant,

87
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,000
oh, I'm doing something with Copilot

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,190
and it's doing something on behalf of me.

89
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,250
So that's where we are today
in terms of a lot of the actual

90
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:57,330
agentic deployment in production, right?

91
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,280
But as you go down this chain,

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,410
it's only going to get
more and more complex.

93
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,180
You're gonna have organizations
that are experimenting

94
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,520
with completely autonomous agents

95
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,160
with much broader access
to enterprise resources.

96
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,170
These may get triggered based on,

97
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,480
let's say an event like
a customer support call

98
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,520
or a bank teller and so on, right?

99
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,040
And that's when you start
getting more business value,

100
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,473
but that's when the
risk starts increasing.

101
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,890
And within a year or
less, take my word for it,

102
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,220
you're gonna start seeing way
more complex agent systems.

103
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,230
You heard on the keynote today on the way

104
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,850
we are progressing here, right?

105
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,450
So that's when you have
multi-level orchestrator agents

106
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,100
in turn invoking other agents

107
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,690
and humans to do multi-step
tasks across systems, okay?

108
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,570
So that's when the complexity
is going to increase

109
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,080
the access to these
set of agents increases

110
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,110
and the risk goes through the roof

111
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,870
unless you have already these
started planning towards that.

112
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,030
And that's where we come in, right?

113
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,030
So now let's kind of
talk about the AI agents,

114
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,480
the fact that they're taking decisions

115
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,640
and they are able to reason,

116
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,170
the LLMs are able to reason

117
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,230
makes them really useful in
the enterprise context, right?

118
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,530
And then as we started giving
them more and more agency

119
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,930
to access enterprise resources

120
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,080
like applications, machines,
databases and so on,

121
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,850
a new standard has evolved.

122
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,700
Like Anthropic came out
with moral context protocol

123
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,460
and the first version of it
did not really address anything

124
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,440
around authentication or authorization.

125
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,660
Again, things are moving so fast,

126
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,970
we quickly realized that
that's not the way to go.

127
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,780
And so we are focusing a lot
on how this can be improved.

128
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,540
So the next version of
the standard is coming out

129
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,110
and we know that that is gonna
focus a lot on using OAuth

130
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,720
as a standard to kind of
access these resources, right?

131
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,280
And ensure we have a standardized way

132
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,650
for the agents to access those resources.

133
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,800
Now the other part is in terms
of what are the new risks

134
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,480
that come out of this.

135
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,240
Now, OWASP has done a
pretty good job of trying

136
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,180
to outline the top 10 risks, right?

137
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,060
And each of these risks may be targeting

138
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,920
a different part of the agentic system.

139
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,070
Some of them are targeting the components

140
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,200
like the applications
that they're using, right?

141
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,690
So for example, the agent
behavior one targets

142
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,760
the LLM so that it can be manipulate that

143
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,100
and do things like jailbreaking and so on.

144
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,640
Same way, agentic supply
chain targets the applications

145
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,800
that it does as a part of
its supply chain, right?

146
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,410
So there are different ways
that threat actors can use it,

147
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,260
but a common theme that
you see across all of this

148
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,610
is the fact that a lot
of them are going to use

149
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,400
the privileges that the agent
has on those applications.

150
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,770
And that's where the identity
component comes in, right?

151
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,690
That's where it becomes imperative.

152
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,510
In fact, if you heard
Swami talk about it today

153
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,550
in the keynote, he
specifically pointed out

154
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,393
that identity is becoming a
critical control plane for this.

155
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,780
So now let's talk about that
identity security imperative.

156
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,890
I'll try and make it quick

157
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,900
because I want to give
enough time for Anat

158
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,400
to get into the details.

159
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,340
So what we see is that AI agents

160
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,500
are really kind of this new identity class

161
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,170
that shows some characteristics
of human identity

162
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,580
and some of machine, right?

163
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,220
They're able to like reason make decisions

164
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,140
and they work more like
AI assistance, right?

165
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,960
And so a lot of immediate
focus is that AI agents

166
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,330
should be done like
service accounts, right?

167
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,450
But if you look at the autonomous agents,

168
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,640
that's where the agents
are behaving more like

169
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,080
cloud native machine workloads.

170
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,880
They're ephemeral in nature, right?

171
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,400
Traditional MFA will
not be an answer there.

172
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,530
You need to introduce humans in the loop

173
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,090
as a part of the process, right?

174
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,780
So overall, AI agents should be treated

175
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,120
as privileged machine identities, right?

176
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,170
Because they are, at the end of the day,

177
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,580
they're still machine identities.

178
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,660
They're highly privileged

179
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,060
because they have all access
to enterprise resources

180
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,003
and they operate at
machine scale and speed.

181
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,680
So our belief is that the
only way to solve this problem

182
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,800
of securing AI agents
is to combine these two,

183
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,600
securing human and machine.

184
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,620
Aspects of human identity,

185
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,530
including credential management,
zero standing privileges,

186
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,910
session monitoring, isolation,

187
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,760
and all of those as well as
securing machine identities,

188
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,710
which includes things like
strong authentication,

189
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,340
secrets rotation, certificates,
PKI, workload access,

190
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,470
SPIFFE and so on, right?

191
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,830
So we are really excited
if you have missed the news

192
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,230
that we will be announcing
the general availability

193
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,740
of CyberArk's Secure AI agent solution

194
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,420
by the end of the year.

195
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,280
Now the vision is to extend the same set

196
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,410
of privilege control that we do for humans

197
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,413
and machines to the world of AI agents.

198
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,560
Now our solution is built to address

199
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,200
all the top concerns that CISOs bring up.

200
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,170
Do I already have agents
running in my organization?

201
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,300
That's a discovery and context fees.

202
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,900
How can I ensure AI agents
are operating securely,

203
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,310
that's securing access

204
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,490
and enforcing zero standing privileges?

205
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,120
How can I quickly respond if
my AI agent is going rogue

206
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,680
or has gotten compromised?

207
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,900
That's threat detection and response.

208
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,740
And how can I govern AI
agents to ensure compliance,

209
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,600
that's governance and lifecycle.

210
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,510
So our solution covers
all of these aspects.

211
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,400
Now I realize that this
is a lightning session,

212
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,740
so we are not going to
have time for all of this.

213
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,080
So I'm gonna get my colleague Anat

214
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,650
to get a little more details
into the secure access part.

215
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,740
The quick shout out I wanted to have here

216
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,810
is because you heard about AWS Bedrock.

217
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,130
So in fact that is one of
the target agent ecosystems

218
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,540
for our discovery and context.

219
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,730
So that gives you a way
to kinda start utilizing

220
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,180
the solution in combination
with AWS Bedrock.

221
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,110
Over to you Anat.

222
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,943
- Perfect.

223
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:36,420
Thank you so much Venu.

224
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,120
And indeed, we are going
to review the solution

225
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,420
and we are going to focus
on the secure access piece

226
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,260
and how we can ensure that we can secure

227
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,850
the AI agent access.

228
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,910
So let's start by understanding
what it actually means

229
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,800
to secure an AI agent.

230
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,020
So first of all, we need to control

231
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,110
what the AI agent can do,

232
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,110
and more importantly, what the
AI agent shouldn't be doing.

233
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,300
Now there are cases, the bad attacker

234
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,120
or even the AI agent itself can bypass

235
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,950
those controls and guardrails.

236
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,170
So we also want to ensure

237
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:18,060
that the AI agent cannot
do any unintended action.

238
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,590
And the third challenge is,

239
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,170
and from talking with a lot of customers,

240
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,970
they see that as their first challenge

241
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,300
as well is how we can
monitor, how we can audit

242
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,410
who did what when working with AI agents.

243
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,230
So before diving into the solution,

244
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,798
let's understand what is the complexity

245
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:41,798
that we see when a granting
an access to an AI agent.

246
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,780
So we have an example of an
AI agent, a reporting agent

247
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,800
that can be used by different
persona in the organization,

248
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,620
HR, marketing, finance, sales, and so on.

249
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,650
That reporting agent can have access

250
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,680
to different databases
within the organization.

251
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,500
But we want to make sure
that as an HR employee,

252
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,560
I can access only my HR databases.

253
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,310
As a finance employee,
only my finance databases.

254
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,259
And as a finance manager, I
might have different permissions

255
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,610
on my finance database.

256
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,520
And on top of that, even
as a finance manager,

257
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,450
if my AI engine is trying
to attempt some risky

258
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,230
or sensitive action, I want
to provide the approval

259
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,610
for that access.

260
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,000
So whenever we are looking
at the access of the agent,

261
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,610
we need to understand that
we have the same agent,

262
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,670
different users, different
intents of what that agent

263
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,503
might be doing,

264
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:40,230
and therefore we need to
grant different access.

265
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,339
So as Venu mentioned,

266
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:47,339
AI agent identity is privileged
identity by definition.

267
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,640
It has access to the
most sensitive resources

268
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,170
in the organization.

269
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,389
Our SaaS applications, the
database where we store

270
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:58,020
our customer's data,

271
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,800
our environment where we
run our solution, okay?

272
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,250
So as an identity we need to treat them

273
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,290
as a privileged identities.

274
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,050
And again, AI identity
at the end of the day

275
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,720
is a combination of a machine identity

276
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,910
that behaves like a human.

277
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,140
That's the reason that we need

278
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,600
to take the controls from both identities

279
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,270
and combine them into a single solution

280
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,930
that actually addresses
the unique characteristics

281
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,430
of an AI agent.

282
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,230
And with that, I'm happy to share

283
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,700
that we are introducing
CyberArk AI Agent gateway.

284
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,560
Our gateway is an enforcement
point between the AI agent

285
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,940
and the tools and the targets
that AI agent can access.

286
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,160
With the AI agent gateway,

287
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,440
we can actually control the access,

288
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,670
we can ensure to have human
in the loop whenever needed.

289
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,910
We also ensure that we have
least privileged permissions

290
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,310
and we will talk why it is so important

291
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,280
to control on the permissions,
to control the permissions.

292
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,100
And lastly, we will be able to provide

293
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,143
audit and traceability.

294
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,900
So let's talk about the access.

295
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,420
So the traditional access controls

296
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,320
and policies that we have
in place are too static

297
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,520
for the dynamic and the
complex nature of AI agent.

298
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,340
We need to move to a
different access policy

299
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,100
and access controls for AI agents.

300
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,550
It needs to take into
consideration different factors

301
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,850
such as the user that
is using the AI agent,

302
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,350
the AI agent itself,

303
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,790
the risk, the context of
the request and much more.

304
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,800
So that's the reason
that we are introducing

305
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,910
a dynamic context aware
policy to address the access

306
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,490
and to control what are the actions

307
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,370
and what are the tools
that AI agent can do

308
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,720
or shouldn't be doing when
accessing their target resources.

309
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,580
So this is the first piece.

310
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,320
So let's now talk what happened

311
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,913
and how we can prevent
any unintended action.

312
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,000
So again, as mentioned,

313
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,020
AI agent identities have access

314
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,850
to the most sensitive environments

315
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,670
and targets in the organization.

316
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,420
Now, we already know that
excessive permissions

317
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,180
is a huge problem both
for human and machine,

318
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,430
but we are not going to talk about that

319
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,320
in the session right now.

320
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,630
But because of those excessive permissions

321
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,351
and taking into consideration

322
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:30,240
the way that AI agents works,

323
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,190
just imagine what will happen
if the AI agent identity

324
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,280
is being compromised or the
underlying human identity

325
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,550
is being compromised with
those excessive permissions,

326
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,610
the damage can scale immediately.

327
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,970
We can run thousands of
privileged permissions

328
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,010
in minutes and not in days

329
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,610
because AI agent operates
at the machine speed.

330
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,290
That's the reason that we need

331
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,760
to control the permissions
an AI agent has.

332
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,520
We need to ensure they always operate

333
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,220
under the principle of least privilege.

334
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,070
The permissions are granted just-in-time

335
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,070
only when needed and revoked
afterward in order to ensure

336
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,120
that we don't have any
excessive permissions

337
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,193
that someone can abuse.

338
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,630
Already today we have a
solution for least privilege

339
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,530
and just-in-time access for
AI agents with our MCP server,

340
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,833
which is available in AWS Marketplace.

341
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,010
So let's move to the last target

342
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,710
or the last, sorry, challenge.

343
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,860
So we actually want to restore visibility

344
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,740
because again, the current audit trail

345
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,740
that we have today are not
sufficient for the AI domain.

346
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,410
We need to understand
if we have an AI agent

347
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,020
operating on behalf of the user

348
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,780
who actually ran the action on the target,

349
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,840
is it me as an add, or it's my AI agent

350
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,300
that worked on behalf of me?

351
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,110
What was the actions that
were run on behalf of the user

352
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,660
or as an autonomous AI agent?

353
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,690
And most importantly why, okay?

354
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,420
So with our AI agents
sitting in the middle

355
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,280
between the agent and the tools,

356
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,733
we are able to restore
that visibility again.

357
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,720
So before wrapping up,

358
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,720
I do want to share something
with our AI agent builders.

359
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,100
So we know that there
is a common practice,

360
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,020
it is not a best practice

361
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,590
where developers are
actually loading API keys

362
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,740
and secrets into environment variables.

363
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,490
And that introduces
several security risks.

364
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,360
Among them is memory exposure
and unintended leakage

365
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,670
because the information is available

366
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,910
in those environment
variable and we are exposing

367
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,620
a very sensitive information
using those environments.

368
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,630
That's the reason that we are very happy

369
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,580
to share our open source
security toolkit with you.

370
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,740
With that security toolkit,

371
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,060
you are able to reduce the risk

372
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,700
and integrate the toolkit

373
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,490
with your AI agent without code changes,

374
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,460
ensuring that the credentials are injected

375
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,720
just-in-time, remove by when
they are not needed anymore.

376
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,870
And we are integrating
with the most common

377
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,933
security stores like AWS Secrets Manager,

378
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,740
and CyberArk Conjur.

379
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,680
So this is available
already today at GitHub

380
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,440
and I'm inviting you to
use it in order to reduce

381
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,813
the risk that we already have today.

382
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,020
So with that let's summarize.

383
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,450
- Sure, thank you Anat.

384
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,350
So I hope that you've all
found this session helpful.

385
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,630
Again, just a quick takeaway, right?

386
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,440
The fact is that AI agents
are here to stay, right?

387
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,170
And you need to start thinking about

388
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,420
securing those agents today

389
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,790
while the numbers are still manageable

390
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,350
and most of those agents are still not

391
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,700
fully in production, right?

392
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,840
So you need to start thinking about

393
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,540
securing these agents today, right?

394
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,930
The fact is that these are
gonna open up new attack vectors

395
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,000
and as the number of agents increase

396
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,980
and as the scope of access increases

397
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,600
because these agents get mature,

398
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,610
it's gonna be harder and
harder to control them.

399
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,600
So the time to think about
securing those agents is today.

400
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,510
The way to do that is
using identity security

401
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,340
as your foundation, right?

402
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,010
You ensure that these agents from get go

403
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,210
have least privilege.

404
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,890
You are putting in
tight privilege control.

405
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,540
You're having just-in-time access

406
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,760
and just enough access
so that you are able

407
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,793
to keep the attack surface minimal.

408
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,820
Alright, so what's next?

409
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,520
Now our solution is gonna
be generally available

410
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,790
the end of this month, so feel
free to swing by our booth

411
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,320
if you want more details about it

412
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,450
or you wanna talk to
one of our specialists.

413
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,100
We also have some
interesting white papers.

414
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,230
We had done an interesting
study with McKinsey

415
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,340
to look at how organizations
are really adopting agentic AI

416
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,250
and what are the type of
risk is surfacing, right?

417
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,324
And it talks about why
identity is the foundation

418
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:11,760
for the defense against
these agents, right?

419
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,440
So do download that white paper.

420
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,760
The other one is a white paper

421
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,680
that talks a more technical one,

422
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,390
which talks about the key requirements

423
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,100
to securely manage these identities.

424
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,970
So feel free to download
this or scan those QR codes.

425
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,120
Now if you're not the
exactly fond of reading

426
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,340
and you are itching to try something,

427
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,470
then we have some cool developer tools.

428
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,980
Anat had said about why it is
really important to shift left

429
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,170
and start having those best practices

430
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,600
as a part of building your agents, right?

431
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,390
So here are the QR codes for
a couple of interesting tools.

432
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,993
The CyberArk MCP server
for our secure cloud access

433
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:47,760
as well as CyberArk Agent Guard.

434
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,387
Both are available in the
AWS Marketplace to download.

435
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:52,620
So you can try them out.

436
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,000
Thank you for your time again.

437
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,310
I hope you enjoy the
rest of this conference.

438
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,890
We will be around to take any questions.

439
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,723
Thank you.

440
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:00,556
- Thank you.
