1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,583
- All right.

2
00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:03,150
All right, all right, all right.

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,690
Hey, thanks everyone who sat down.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,430
We'll get into it in just a second.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,980
I appreciate, maybe you're
here to take a break.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,530
Maybe you just really want
to know about agentic AI

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,360
and cloud security.

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,430
Either way is fine with me.

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,920
So let me dive right in.

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,160
And along the way, I may
raise your hand or something,

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,330
but let's see how that goes.

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,040
So let's get started.

13
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,130
I'm gonna talk a little bit
about what makes AI agentic.

14
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,890
You probably all know very well

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,810
about that at this point in time,

16
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,350
especially having been here
for a few days at at re:Invent.

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,620
We'll talk about how it can
play a role as a new teammate

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,380
and why that's gonna be valuable.

19
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,020
And then how can this shift

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,210
how we do things in cloud security.

21
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,340
And I'm gonna show you
one of the workflows

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,670
that Sysdig has
implemented using AI agents

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,010
to help relieve some of the toil,

24
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,020
some of the pain that exists

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,910
when we're talking about
securing our clouds,

26
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,260
our workloads and so on.

27
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,420
I'm actually gonna show
you a little bit of that,

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,310
and then at the end, invite
you to come talk to us

29
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,180
in our booth.

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,070
So with that, let's get started.

31
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,930
So what makes AI agentic?

32
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,740
Again, I think most of you are
clear on this at this point,

33
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,910
but let's go over it, right?

34
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,880
We wanna move from just
being able to ask a question

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,770
and getting some sort of information back

36
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,790
to actually giving AI a
job to do for us, right?

37
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,090
So that it can then act with
autonomy around the clock.

38
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,713
I don't need to be there saying,

39
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,050
how should I do this?

40
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,340
What should I do next and so on?

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,930
It's gonna do things
for you independently.

42
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,310
It's gonna learn, it's gonna adapt,

43
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,250
it's gonna use things
that are at its disposal

44
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,530
to do whatever job you give it.

45
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,970
And we're gonna talk about the job

46
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,360
that it can do for you in
the world of cloud security.

47
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,650
And it thinks it collaborates.

48
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,970
I like the collaborate word

49
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,790
because if you were here
for the last presentation,

50
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,940
there's a lot of fear about
this is gonna take my job.

51
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,140
Well, what we really want to do,

52
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,240
and I've experienced this in my own role,

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,140
is use AI to help make
what I do more effective,

54
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,080
and maybe I can even get
some time back in my day,

55
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,913
so to speak.

56
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:12,120
So we wanna use AI to do things
that are relatively complex

57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,350
that we can allow it to do,

58
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,600
that I don't have to do any longer.

59
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,483
And it becomes not just a
tool, but like a teammate.

60
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,090
And by that I mean, just think about,

61
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,100
regardless of the use case,

62
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,680
think about having something
that can do analysis

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
that normally I'm doing, but
it can present findings to me,

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,380
concise, clear,

65
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,570
so I get exactly what's needed.

66
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,253
Or maybe it's a recommendation.

67
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,370
This is the thing you should do next,

68
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,870
and here's how to do it.

69
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,430
That's awesome.

70
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,810
And then in the future,

71
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,760
and I don't think we're there yet,

72
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,290
you may agree or disagree with me,

73
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,320
but I've actually said, this is your job,

74
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,540
when necessary, do it.

75
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,890
In the world of cloud security,

76
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,380
we're still a little nervous about having,

77
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,620
or in any world, having AI making changes,

78
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,110
tweaking something for fear that

79
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,850
something catastrophic will happen.

80
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,820
I really believe we're gonna get there

81
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,850
to where we'll allow
AI to do things for us.

82
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,940
Maybe it's that I can quickly
look and say, yep, go do it,

83
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,110
but we will get there.

84
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,210
So what we want is
something that helps us,

85
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,240
that grows with us, that
helps every step of the way.

86
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,280
Now, when we think about this
in the world of security,

87
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,280
I want to know anyone here, a
security person, professional,

88
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,030
got a couple, anyone in dev

89
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,610
that has to fix things
like vulnerabilities?

90
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,480
Exactly.

91
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,920
Posture, so on and so forth.

92
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,360
So you know what I'm talking about.

93
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,890
There's all this world of data.

94
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,570
The bigger we get in our clouds,

95
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,520
the bigger we get with our workloads,

96
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,450
the more signals come our way.

97
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,150
And it can become a bit painful

98
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,400
because I need to analyze that stuff.

99
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,930
Hopefully the tool's doing it for me,

100
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,330
but often I get it just
a dashboard, right?

101
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,400
And then what am I gonna
do to filter through that?

102
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,370
What am I gonna do to prioritize

103
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,300
the list of things that
could impact my business?

104
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,300
What am I gonna do to
notify the right people?

105
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,220
How can I get the right recommendations

106
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,070
without having to go swivel in my chair

107
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,760
and ask you what's the best
way to fix this thing, right?

108
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,920
And eventually, again,
getting to a world of action

109
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,890
so that I, on the right hand side,

110
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,280
have a much more concise set
of insights and information

111
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,640
that I can deal with and be
more effective at what I do

112
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,840
when trying to secure
workloads, infrastructure,

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,193
all the things in my cloud.

114
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,100
We are seeing it like this.

115
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,400
And what typically is the case today

116
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,800
is that an alert will happen, right?

117
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,130
And when that alert happens,
I'm gonna do some things.

118
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,660
What is the problem?

119
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,820
Let me go investigate.

120
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,653
Is this real?

121
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:46,950
Is this not real?

122
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,510
Who's involved?

123
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,560
Maybe you are,

124
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,584
oh, I need to go talk to John

125
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:52,410
because this is something that he did.

126
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,430
What is the impact,

127
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,920
whether something that
actually has happened

128
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,640
or something that could be
the impact of the issue?

129
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,749
Then I get around to figuring out

130
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:02,253
what am I gonna do to fix it.

131
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,920
In the world of AI,

132
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,640
using agents to help us get
more insights immediately

133
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,220
when something happens,
I still get alerted,

134
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,650
Hey, this thing happened or is happening.

135
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,820
Maybe it's a runtime event,

136
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,710
maybe there's just
vulnerabilities or whatnot.

137
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,300
But what I get immediately

138
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,390
is this is the impact or potential impact.

139
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,780
This is the set of suggestions
and recommendations

140
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,510
that we make for you so that
you can make a quick decision.

141
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,960
And then again, in the world
of getting trust eventually,

142
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,000
saying, go auto fix that for me.

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,490
So I am bypassing all of these steps

144
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,910
that take minutes, hours, sometimes days,

145
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,650
and I'm getting all that upfront.

146
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,380
And then if I need to go verify,

147
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,240
I have all the evidence that I can say,

148
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,430
okay, why do you think this is important?

149
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,400
What are the signals that led to this

150
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,020
that came from this problem?

151
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,390
So we want to kind of shift the workflow

152
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,850
from this long process
before I start fixing

153
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,290
to understanding fixing

154
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,380
And then if I need to, I get
more insights and information.

155
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,610
So one of the use cases that
we're using this at Sysdig

156
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,920
is around vulnerability management.

157
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,170
Now, one of the big complaints we hear,

158
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,700
especially in the world of containers,

159
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,140
anyone doing containers in here?

160
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,973
Kubernetes?

161
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:14,806
Yeah, most of you.

162
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,970
I'm using these things, I scan them,

163
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,240
but so many findings that
I can't stay ahead of it.

164
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,700
And I'm not sure exactly how to prioritize

165
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,780
or I do know how, but I'm
bouncing between a CMDB

166
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,680
or a spreadsheet,

167
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,023
and I'm doing this and I'm doing that.

168
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,250
I've gotta gather my own context.

169
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,190
Well, what if we could leverage
AI to make that better?

170
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,052
This is where I'm just
gonna tell you a little bit.

171
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:38,790
I'm from Sysdig.

172
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,140
Anyone heard of Sysdig before?

173
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,460
This is the risky question, right?

174
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,293
Yeah, okay.

175
00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:44,550
We are a cloud security platform.

176
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,440
And as a cloud security platform,

177
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,025
we bring a number of
different disciplines,

178
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:50,670
different, let's call them use cases

179
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,320
from vulnerability management, posture,

180
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,960
all the way through what
we're well known for

181
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,820
is real time threat detection.

182
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,400
And so this is where we have

183
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,770
a lot of good insights, good data,

184
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,220
really deep telemetry, excellent context.

185
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,880
And all of this stuff can be
grabbed and leverage by AI

186
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,470
when trying to solve a problem.

187
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,090
So let me paint the picture of the problem

188
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,930
that we're solving.

189
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,840
One, I saw a lot of head nodding,

190
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,460
a lot of vulnerabilities, right?

191
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,290
Thousands and thousands, right?

192
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,280
And then what do I need to do?

193
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,990
I need to answer a bunch of questions.

194
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,420
Is it really something
I need to worry about?

195
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,530
Is it running in production

196
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,120
or is this just something
we're playing with

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,710
in the back, right?

198
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,080
Is it a business critical app?

199
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,590
Is this particular vulnerable
thing even being used?

200
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,423
Is it in memory?

201
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,900
Is it loaded?

202
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,040
Is it exposed?

203
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,090
Is there a fix?

204
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,080
Who owns the fix?

205
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,680
These are all things that
someone in your business

206
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,318
is figuring out and
spending hours and hours

207
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:48,270
and hours and hours on this weekly,

208
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,863
daily, weekly, monthly, yearly.

209
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,830
Then I need to prioritize that list,

210
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,870
open tickets for the right people.

211
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,000
Then I need to determine how to fix it.

212
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Not I, but the person I just
shipped it off to, right?

213
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,410
They get a Jira ticket and they're like,

214
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,870
okay, now what?

215
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,920
A bunch of CVEs.

216
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,100
Which it's like, okay,
that's a bit of a challenge.

217
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,890
And then of course, I want to
be able to report on progress.

218
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,210
And so this is something

219
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,170
that AI can be very good
at helping us to solve

220
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,690
by pulling together a lot
of these pieces for us.

221
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,980
Here's how we're doing it at Sysdig.

222
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,900
One is looking into your environment.

223
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,250
And in this case, I'm thinking about

224
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,980
like a Kubernetes, EKS, ECS,

225
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,080
maybe some Fargate and so on, right?

226
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,710
I'm looking and identifying,
is this a production cluster?

227
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,780
Does it look like a business application?

228
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,250
Is there data that's at a task,

229
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,510
or is it just some file server

230
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,190
that no one really cares about so on?

231
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,330
Getting that insights.

232
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,660
Then understanding from
a runtime perspective.

233
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,380
Is the vulnerable thing actually in use?

234
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,320
Because that's important, I
want to fix those things first.

235
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,290
And then is it exposed externally?

236
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,790
That's not that hard to do,

237
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,410
but think about pulling that insight in.

238
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,000
And then is there a known exploit?

239
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,290
Can I actually even fix it

240
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,050
or do I need to put a
mitigating control in?

241
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,150
And how am I gonna fix this?

242
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,610
So on this first one is kind
of assisting innovation,

243
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,310
where we're actually looking
into your cloud environment

244
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,890
and looking for business signals.

245
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,723
Why?

246
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:13,140
To put them in buckets.

247
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,360
Buckets to say this, this.

248
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,890
Let's say I'm in the gaming industry,

249
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,840
like this application
is running everything

250
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,850
that all my users are betting,

251
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,200
doing all the things we're in Vegas.

252
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,220
That makes sense, right?

253
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,020
So identifying that for me

254
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,910
versus something that's less important,

255
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,560
reasoning about it,

256
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,560
and then giving that
information back to me.

257
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,330
Then we can get from
this really big number

258
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,800
to this really small number.

259
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,230
Where then yes, we want
a human to be involved.

260
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,360
We want a human to take action for us.

261
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,448
So let me show you the implementation

262
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,170
that we have at Sysdig.

263
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,850
Then we'll wrap up, we'll
be pretty much done.

264
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,170
We're halfway through.

265
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,750
Alright, I'm gonna switch to my demo.

266
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,360
So I'm just on my home screen here.

267
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,970
Sysdig does a lot of things around vulns,

268
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,320
around runtime events.

269
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,140
So runtime is a very important aspect

270
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,580
of your cloud security.

271
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,950
Things around compliance
and so forth, right?

272
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,990
So what I'm gonna go to

273
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,450
is where we have implemented today

274
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,170
our agentic insights around
vulnerability management.

275
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,483
Now you see my funnel, right?

276
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,980
This is something that
happens to most of us.

277
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,610
We get up with thousands,
thousands of vulnerabilities.

278
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,610
How can something help
me narrow that down?

279
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,800
And in this case, I'm
talking about AI agents

280
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,060
for each one of these steps

281
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,710
going and getting the information,

282
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,360
pulling it together for me.

283
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,280
And then even in the end,

284
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,580
providing a strategy
on how I'm going to fix

285
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,520
said vulnerability or vulnerabilities.

286
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,870
Let me go through each
one of these things.

287
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,550
So one, we've already scanned,

288
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,980
we figured out that there's
some critical vulnerabilities.

289
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,830
Most of us want to fix those
first and foremost, right?

290
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,150
Then is it loaded in memory?

291
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,100
That's some other signal
that Sysdig has as a platform

292
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,890
that AI will,

293
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,020
okay, yeah, we've got
that, we've collected that.

294
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,420
Then what environment is it in, right?

295
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,909
So if automatically identified

296
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,600
some of my environments for me,

297
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,190
I haven't had to go out
and tag these things.

298
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,350
So let's say I'm just
worried about production.

299
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,700
Now that number went
down from not enough from

300
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,800
1200 to just over a thousand.

301
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,050
So I still got a lot in production.

302
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,850
And that's concerning,

303
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,420
but which ones are actually
exposed to the internet

304
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,610
that somebody can get
to and start to exploit?

305
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,620
I'm now down to a much smaller number.

306
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,750
And then are they exploitable?

307
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,641
So from our CVE databases,
is there a known way

308
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:30,360
that the bad guys are actually getting in

309
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,410
and messing around with this

310
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,460
to try and get into my AWS
cloud or my Kubernetes clusters?

311
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,460
And then there may be
some that are exceptions.

312
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,530
Now today, someone has to go in and say,

313
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,260
yeah, this is their
boss, but it's critical.

314
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,430
But it's a Windows thing

315
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,850
and we use no Windows packages
in anything that we do.

316
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,200
So what if AI could identify
that characteristic for me

317
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,790
and say that's exception.

318
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,920
If I need to dig under the cover

319
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,100
and get an explanation
of why it's an exception,

320
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,410
I can easily get that as well, right?

321
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,350
So that's step one, what
we call removing the noise.

322
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,530
Step two is I'm plotting these
things against the graph,

323
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,970
a graph that says,

324
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,670
one, how important do we deem this to be

325
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,070
and how pervasive I should go this way,

326
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,230
how pervasive is it in my environment?

327
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,700
Meaning is it deployed a ton
across all the things I have?

328
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,500
And you'll see one outlier here,

329
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,790
it's not so high up here,

330
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,850
but it certainly is
deployed in a lot of places.

331
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,750
Now I may think,

332
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,720
okay, you're telling me that
this is probably one to fix?

333
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,833
Explain that to me.

334
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,490
So already, there are
some things I can do.

335
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,020
One is I can just ask.

336
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,363
Explain to me why you
think this is important.

337
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,180
And now this is part of
the generative piece,

338
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,480
which is going to give me
some insights and information

339
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,430
as to why this is deemed one
of the more important images.

340
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,800
This is a container image
I'm talking about here.

341
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,820
And I get some information,
I get various things.

342
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,050
I can actually do things like,

343
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,600
well, then highlight just
critical ones for me.

344
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,700
But I also get is something
that says, fix here.

345
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,068
Now, remember what I said earlier?

346
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:10,170
We're not quite ready to have AI

347
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,340
just go out and start
making updates for me,

348
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,740
but I can,

349
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,760
I'll call it a recipe.

350
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,580
I can get a recipe for what to do.

351
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,510
And now, instead of me sending
over to you a Jira ticket

352
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,170
that says, here's your list
of CVEs, please fix them,

353
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,635
I can say here's the list of CVEs,

354
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:31,200
here's where they're running.

355
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,730
By the way, these are in use

356
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,860
and let me go ahead and click this button.

357
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,120
And here's what we recommend that you do.

358
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,980
Now, this is a set of recommendations,

359
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,765
both from a app level,

360
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:45,480
in this case, again, container image

361
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,630
as well as a base layer to say, do this.

362
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,660
Now, it's smart enough to
understand your environment.

363
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,493
Number one, again,

364
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:54,300
AI agents have understood
your environment.

365
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,850
Two, it's smart enough not to say,

366
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,670
okay, yeah, bump up from
version three to four of Redis

367
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,503
or whatever, right?

368
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:01,560
We don't want to do that

369
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,640
because that might introduce
some things that break.

370
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,850
So that's the benefit of having this,

371
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,640
is that now I get everything that I need

372
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,080
enumerated, listed,

373
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,380
even some commands that can be
ran by the dev who gets this.

374
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,120
And I can easily say,

375
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,676
okay, let's create a Jira ticket

376
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:21,753
and I'm off and flying, right?

377
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,200
So what's cool about this

378
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,720
is that that payload or that recipe,

379
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,460
let's call this,

380
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,830
I'm gonna put it in my area here

381
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,840
and we'll call it a task,

382
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,390
is that that payload of
insights and information

383
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,670
gets dropped into ticket.

384
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,560
And now that is nicely formatted

385
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,850
for the person who receives it

386
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,320
and they can go about fixing it.

387
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,940
So now instead of having this

388
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,350
really, really long process

389
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,230
of filtering, prioritizing,
figuring out how to fix it,

390
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,510
AI has sort of brought
that to my doorstep.

391
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,710
And that's what I love about this,

392
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,320
is that we're gonna end up
helping save a lot of time,

393
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,700
a lot of sneaker wear.

394
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,380
Again, a lot of trying to ask a friend

395
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,710
or go on search the
internet for things, right?

396
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,760
So I can create that ticket.

397
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,230
If I already have one open,

398
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,670
it knows I already have one open.

399
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,690
And that's beautiful.

400
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,080
So that's one of the ways that
we've implemented agentic AI.

401
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,450
And then again, for most of us,

402
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,250
let me go,

403
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,130
I'm gonna do this the brute force way.

404
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,810
We also want to track how are we doing?

405
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,750
Typically, you want this to
go down into the right, right?

406
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,480
So AI can help us keep track of that too.

407
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,840
I can show this to my boss,
I can show this to whomever

408
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,970
and have a nice track record.

409
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,230
Or if it's going the wrong way,

410
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,290
I'm going to put a little more
time and effort into this.

411
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,630
And so that's a little bit about

412
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,630
how something like a
well-guided set of AI agents,

413
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,480
agentic AI, if you will,

414
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,680
let me go back here,

415
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,330
can help you

416
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,490
get out from under some
of this really hard work.

417
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,783
Now we see this being applicable

418
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:57,150
across all of the domains
of cloud security,

419
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,970
posture management, threat detection,

420
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,970
finding ways to have AI help us

421
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,630
do some of the jobs that
today I just I'm having to do

422
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,690
and it's not really that important of work

423
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,260
other than I'm spending time

424
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,280
filtering through various
pieces of information.

425
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,660
Let's let AI do that.

426
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,270
I can get down to the fixing.

427
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,070
So I'm gonna close it here.

428
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,000
Nothing too heavy.

429
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,740
Hopefully that's okay
with you guys, right?

430
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,750
It's helping to transform things.

431
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,150
We're getting help with
defending our clouds.

432
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,360
We're help getting help
making faster decisions

433
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,473
for response,

434
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,430
which is key to staying ahead
of threats in the cloud.

435
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,440
And now I'm empowering every one of you

436
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,220
to have the information in a
little bit of an easier way

437
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,860
than is currently the state-of-the-art

438
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,800
for most security tools out there.

439
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,350
You can come see this, learn
more over in our booth,

440
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,670
ask us some questions over there.

441
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,590
So with that, I'm gonna wrap up

442
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,570
and just say thank you for being here.

443
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,280
Hopefully you get some insights into that

444
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,920
and start looking for these kind of things

445
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,650
in your shop when you
need to actually deliver

446
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,130
security tooling and security
approaches for your business.

447
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:05,963
That's all I got.

448
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:07,050
Thank you everyone for being here.

449
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:07,981
Appreciate it.

450
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:08,889
(audience clapping)
