1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,560
- Thank you.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,690
My name's Pete Di Stefano.
I'm with SolarWinds.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,170
I'm here with Ryan Lauer from Paciolan.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,820
We are going to spend some time today

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,883
kind of taking you down
their cloud journey.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,500
So, let me quickly take
you through the agenda.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,013
We got industry challenges,
artificial intelligence,

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,323
Paciolan's overview, generative AI,

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,290
the cloud journey of Paciolan,

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,670
artificial intelligence,

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,830
AI, agentic AI.

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,230
Okay, I just wanted to make sure

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,090
we got a few words in there about AI

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,560
because I know we want to

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,720
kind of get the jump
on all the people here

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,150
because nobody out here
has talked about AI yet.

17
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,060
So, I thought we'd come out
there and start with that.

18
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,020
Seriously,

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,080
we both probably talk a
little bit about AI later on,

20
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,040
but we are going to take you

21
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,670
through Ryan and his company's journey.

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,560
But before I do that,

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,900
I want to talk a little bit
about industry challenges

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,370
that we're all facing.

25
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,230
Now, I'm not going to read this list,

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,410
whether it's troubleshooting
or root cause analysis,

27
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,763
visibility gaps.

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,340
If I add up all your challenges

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,930
that you're all facing today,

30
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,390
one of them is time.

31
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,370
Time when things are not going right,

32
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,500
time when things are down,

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,510
and really, what does
that really boil down to?

34
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,420
It's the challenge of
delivering on services

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,090
in today's very complex environment.

36
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,270
So, I'm not sure what your
environment looks like.

37
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,150
You might be pure cloud,
you might be pure on-prem,

38
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,340
you might be some hybrid world.

39
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,570
I believe most of us are in
some type of hybrid environment.

40
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,380
Well, you're going to hear
a lot more about SolarWinds

41
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,830
and this concept of
operational resilience.

42
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,910
Well, resilience,

43
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,620
you guys who are working in industry,

44
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,510
it means when something goes wrong,

45
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,700
how quickly, how resilient can I be?

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,190
How quickly can I get up and running?

47
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,380
Well, operational resilience

48
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,860
is the concept of I know
something is going to go wrong.

49
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,800
I might have a bad change
that causes an issue.

50
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,450
I might have a bug in some software

51
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,640
or a system that goes down.

52
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,750
How can I plan for the fact
that things are going to happen?

53
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,480
How do I plan for when there is an issue,

54
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,600
I can continue to deliver
a level of service

55
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,240
without any impact to my business?

56
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,110
That's what our entire company,
our portfolio is about,

57
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,590
is helping you become
operationally resilient.

58
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,610
Now, our goal is to help you

59
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,270
and your people be able to
be operational resilience,

60
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,000
and that's with the
workflows, the processes,

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,660
and of course the
technologies that you're using

62
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,140
to support and observe
your IT environment.

63
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,810
Now, instead of me talking about that,

64
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,680
what I'd like to do

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,770
is we're going to have Ryan talk about

66
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,160
why time is of the
essence within his company

67
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,920
and how important, how critical it is

68
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,640
to deliver on service for
the success of his company.

69
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,050
So Ryan, why don't you take
us through who Paciolan is.

70
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,920
- So, here at Paciolan, what
we do is live event ticketing

71
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,710
and most of our clients

72
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,770
are in the college athletics arena.

73
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,470
So, what we do is we provide people

74
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,940
the ability to buy the tickets,

75
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,040
scan 'em at the stadium when they come in.

76
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,790
And there's different times

77
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,830
that we have traffic spikes

78
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,810
and that's basically
centered around the time

79
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,540
that we do on-sales for our clients

80
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,460
when we have people
coming into the stadiums

81
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,590
and scanning and coming
into the the stadium

82
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,850
and stuff like that.

83
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,760
- All right, so especially
this time of year,

84
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,470
I'm so thankful

85
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,840
that Paciolan was willing
to spend time with us,

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,860
'cause this is really

87
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,930
the bread and butter part of their year

88
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,220
and they're spending time with us.

89
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,780
So, thank you for that.

90
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,960
Let's kind of go through a
little bit of this journey

91
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,700
that Paciolan has gone through.

92
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,370
Let's start with just talking about...

93
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,810
Tell us about your IT environment.

94
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,220
I know you're hybrid, right?

95
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,583
- Correct, we have a couple
of Kubernetes clusters,

96
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,290
some in EKS, some on-premises,

97
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,000
and we have different AWS
architecture that also works

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,820
with some of our other
on-premises architecture.

99
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,660
- Okay.

100
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,560
So, I talked about
challenges just a moment ago.

101
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,110
I talked about things like root cause,

102
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,640
getting to the root cause quickly,

103
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,390
or how do I understand, do
have visibility to everything.

104
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,470
What are some of the historical
challenges Paciolan has had?

105
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,490
- So, when we started to containerize

106
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,790
and move all of our on-premises services

107
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,920
to a microservice architecture

108
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,590
in either EKS or on-premises Kubernetes,

109
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,720
some of the challenges we
found were we weren't sure

110
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,630
how some services would
interact with other services

111
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,980
and how they would act being containerized

112
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,503
instead of being, say,
in a Beanstalk or an EC2.

113
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,690
And what we did is we
installed the SolarWinds APM,

114
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,970
which helped us kind of get an insight

115
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,270
into how our services were
interacting with other services,

116
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,070
any kind of network latencies

117
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,680
or anything like that that we could find,

118
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,990
SolarWinds would show
us in their dashboards.

119
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,210
And then, that way we could
better tune our services.

120
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,380
We can set more realistic
limits and requests

121
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,230
based on what we see in our traffic.

122
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,020
- All right, so you've been using,

123
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,170
they've been using SolarWinds for a while

124
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,510
and there was a variety
of different tools,

125
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,050
but what was the new approach
you guys decided to use

126
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,820
and why?

127
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,913
- So, the APM was relatively new.

128
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,920
We kind of wanted to see

129
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,810
how everything would
interact with each other

130
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,970
as we were doing our migrations.

131
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,450
And then, when we do those big on-sales

132
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,250
or we have those big football Saturdays

133
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,750
where people are coming into the stadium

134
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,920
and scanning their tickets,

135
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,750
we wanted to be able to have insight

136
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,120
into how all of those services were acting

137
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,350
as well as our infrastructure,

138
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,860
so that we could see
CPU, memory, disk writes,

139
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,530
network, that kind of stuff
with our infrastructure

140
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,180
as well as the APM.

141
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,350
And then, also show all
of our AWS infrastructure

142
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,380
behind that single pane of
glass that SolarWinds gives us

143
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,470
so that we can sit behind
and look at these dashboards

144
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,920
and, say, we have a dashboard for SREs,

145
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,590
we have a dashboard for
development, for customer service.

146
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,260
Everybody watches their own dashboards

147
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,110
to be able to tell how
their services are reacting,

148
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,910
what kind of impact they're seeing

149
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,640
in their different areas.

150
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,230
- [Pete] Yeah, would you
mind telling the folks

151
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,210
what you had to do this morning?

152
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,240
- So yeah, this morning,
there's a couple big on-sales.

153
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,340
I know bowl selections are coming.

154
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,040
So, as I was watching the AWS keynote,

155
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,230
I was monitoring our on-sales.

156
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,710
Our sister company SIDEARM also
has early signing day today,

157
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,360
which is a big day in college athletics.

158
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,820
A lot of people are coming to the sites

159
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,653
just to see, you know,

160
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:56,010
who their colleges are picking

161
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,770
from the high school students.

162
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,520
And what we like to see is
how everything's operating,

163
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,070
and the SolarWinds
dashboards gives us that,

164
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,380
as well as setting up alerts

165
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,720
for some of those key
services and bottlenecks

166
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,400
that we've seen in the past.

167
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,630
We set up alerts

168
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,270
so that if we kind of see
something going wrong,

169
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,090
we're notified well before
our clients are calling us,

170
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,700
saying, "Hey, our systems are down."

171
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,720
- All right, thanks.

172
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,720
So, you've been an AWS
customer eight, nine years?

173
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,720
- Yeah, it's been about eight years,

174
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,370
I believe.
- Yeah, so, you know,

175
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,400
what have been the benefits
of now leveraging AWS,

176
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,490
'cause you guys migrated
from on-prem into the cloud.

177
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,500
Why AWS?

178
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,700
- So, AWS gives us the
ability to scale quickly.

179
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,940
If we're noticing that our
nodes are high on memory or CPU

180
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,960
from one of our dashboards,

181
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,370
we can go ahead and scale up.

182
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,840
If we notice our services

183
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,000
or maybe a service is
getting bottlenecked,

184
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,590
the request time isn't
where we want it to be,

185
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,993
we can always scale those services up.

186
00:07:56,993 --> 00:08:00,090
And AWS and EKS allow us to do that

187
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,980
whereas on-prem it's a little more,

188
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,700
requires more planning to add
hardware into our clusters.

189
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,180
- [Pete] All right. So, monitoring.

190
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,340
You monitor a network,

191
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,013
you monitor a database,
you monitor an application.

192
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,043
Why observability?

193
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,000
- Just so that we can get
a jump on any issues we see

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,940
and we can better plan
for the upcoming on-sales

195
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,830
for the upcoming football seasons.

196
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,840
We know where our services are at

197
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,540
and even though we do a lot of our changes

198
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,253
in the off time during the summer,

199
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,090
come full load and even though
we do load testing, you know,

200
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,370
sometimes it just doesn't
react the same way

201
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,570
as live traffic.

202
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,570
So, what we like to do is
those first couple weeks,

203
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,660
we're all on a call,

204
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,800
we're watching our dashboards

205
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,420
and making sure we're all
talking to each other,

206
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,470
making sure that everything

207
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,150
is working the way we want it to.

208
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,103
And if we start to see issues,

209
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,310
we can make adjustments
right then and there.

210
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,590
And SolarWinds gives us
the ability to do that

211
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,470
with the real-time metrics
for either our APMs

212
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,280
or Kubernetes clusters, EC2s,
databases, stuff like that.

213
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,480
- All right. Well, thanks.

214
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,920
So, first of all,

215
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,680
I didn't mention AI once
through his whole...

216
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,513
But don't get me wrong,

217
00:09:11,513 --> 00:09:13,680
I'll get that in here in
the next couple of minutes

218
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,580
before we're done.

219
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,890
And by the way, if you
do have any questions,

220
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,300
I've just got a couple more slides,

221
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,670
we'd like to open it up
if you have any questions

222
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,800
for Ryan or for myself.

223
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
So, I do want to talk a
little bit about SolarWinds

224
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,520
and our overall platform across the board.

225
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,310
On the left, you'll see our
observability offerings,

226
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,110
and I say Monitoring and Observability

227
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,730
'cause monitoring is a key element.

228
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,460
It's a foundational
element of observability.

229
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,960
But if you truly want to understand

230
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,610
the state of your system,

231
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,920
you need to look at all
the elements together.

232
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,300
And as Ryan said,

233
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,530
when you have multiple teams

234
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,980
being able to look and have
the same single source of truth

235
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,280
and to be able to look at the impact

236
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,030
that a database or an
application or an infrastructure

237
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,740
is having on the overall system

238
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,810
and looking at it together on a platform,

239
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,010
that's why we've built out

240
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,230
a full-stack observability platform.

241
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,190
And with SolarWinds,

242
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,920
you can do that from SaaS

243
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,170
or you can do it from on-prem, your call.

244
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,003
Full stack.

245
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:12,960
Wherever your stack is running,

246
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,540
you can run it SaaS or on-prem.

247
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,170
We've included incident response
to really connect the dots

248
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,960
between all of the things that
are happening in real time

249
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,340
and communicating to the people

250
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,200
that need to solve that problem.

251
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,120
And then, to complete the lifecycle,

252
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,120
all integrated into our
service management offering.

253
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,310
So, whether it's your
help desk, your problem,

254
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,070
your change management,
your incident response,

255
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,410
and your monitoring and
observability at SolarWinds,

256
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,730
we believe these three things
together can help your people,

257
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,620
your processes and workflows,

258
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,510
and help you with your technologies

259
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,460
to be operationally resilient.

260
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,040
Now, just to give you an idea on the...

261
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,390
Whoops, sorry.

262
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,970
To give you an idea, when
I talk about full stack,

263
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,220
when I talk about observability offerings,

264
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,320
we're talking about your
networks, your infrastructure,

265
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,470
your applications, your user experience.

266
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,810
To not understand the user's perspective

267
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,760
of availability and performance,

268
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,200
you're not looking at the whole picture.

269
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,620
It doesn't matter how
many green lights you have

270
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,010
in your network operating center.

271
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,130
What matters is the user's
perspective of performance.

272
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,650
So, being able to look at
all that stuff collectively

273
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,823
is really important,

274
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,240
as well as your databases, security.

275
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,020
And by the way, all built
on a common platform

276
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,270
that delivers dashboards and alerting,

277
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,470
intelligent alerting systems.

278
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,220
And yes, machine learning
engine, generative AI,

279
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,710
and newly announced agentic AI.

280
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,100
We'd love you to come by our booth, 1380.

281
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,050
Let our guys show you some of the stuff

282
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,660
that Ryan and Paciolan is doing

283
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,650
and some of the other things

284
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,630
that SolarWinds can bring to the table

285
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,680
so you can understand

286
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,980
how your company could be
operationally resilient.

287
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,713
Any questions for Ryan or myself?

288
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,063
Thank you for taking the time.
