  "abstract": "AI code generation is fast. Your ability to validate and ship it? Probably in need of an upgrade. Join Michael Webster, Principal Engineer at CircleCI, to learn about CircleCI’s AI engineering team’s experience deploying AI agents and coding assistants. Discover why 10x output is overwhelming traditional DevOps, which patterns unlock velocity without chaos, and why the solution isn't more tooling complexity, but smarter abstractions that make AI-generated code safer to ship. This presentation is brought to you by CircleCI, an AWS Partner.",
