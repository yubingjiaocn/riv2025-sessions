  "abstract": "See how AI-powered automation is revolutionizing digital operations at organizations like Warner Brothers Discovery. AI agents now work across the entire lifecycle, reducing toil by adjusting schedules, diagnosing issues, scribing incidents, executing remediation, and standardizing responses, freeing teams for higher-value work. Discover how organizations apply agentic AI to three types of operational work: well-understood, partially understood, and novel or major events. Learn how to evaluate which tasks are best for agents, where GenAI adds value, and what still demands human expertise so your teams can innovate faster, operate smarter, and continuously improve. This presentation is brought to you by PagerDuty, an AWS Partner.",
