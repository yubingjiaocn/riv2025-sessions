1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,760
- Good afternoon folks.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,233
Hope everybody's doing fine.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,657
So what we'll do is,

4
00:00:08,657 --> 00:00:10,320
it is, as all of you know,

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,540
it's an exciting time to be in tech.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,240
There is a significant
expectations from AI

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,390
to give productivity
in our day-to-day work.

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,170
On the right you see
that by next three years,

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,010
15 to 20% of our day-to-day work

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,320
is to be done by agentic AI.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,600
But the reality is on the left.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,980
Everyday in an enterprise,

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,830
an average employee on an
overall enterprise level,

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,510
there are a thousand applications

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,763
that employees use to get their work done.

16
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,610
How do we bridge the gap between

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,730
the complexity and the
promise of productivity?

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,690
That's where IBM has
IBM watsonx Orchestrate.

19
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,430
It's an open-end governed
interoperable platform for agents

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,353
targeted for business users.

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,320
Agents sprawl is real.

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,790
Every ERP vendor,

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,230
every hyperscaler as you see

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,420
around our building agents.

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,620
For business users,

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,290
abstracting this complexity
is very important.

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,910
Orchestrate plays a role of that,

28
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,813
or that simplification of this agentic

29
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:11,280
escheat for an end user.

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,960
On the left you see that

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,480
Orchestrate supports agents
coming from anywhere.

32
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,070
You can build natively.

33
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,460
You can bring agents built
in an open source platform.

34
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,650
You can connect agents running on a third,

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,120
third party platform.

36
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,440
And we have pre-built agents

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,453
for specific domains built by IBM.

38
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,750
And you also have traditional business

39
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,750
automation tools like
robotic cross automation,

40
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,660
or business automation
workflows that you always,

41
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,360
that companies have already
invested in, and they want,

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,270
they can connect into
orchestration engine through MCP.

43
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,420
So that's on your left.

44
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,030
And you have an end-to-end
management layer at the bottom,

45
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,400
which essentially allows you to govern

46
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,660
and monitor these agents
that are built anywhere else,

47
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,090
but running in orchestrate.

48
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,370
And we have the unified experience layer

49
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,710
for end users to abstract
away this complexity.

50
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,030
All they have to care about is

51
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,830
what is the goal that they wanna achieve.

52
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,480
And the orchestration actually delegates

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,800
the task to every agent,

54
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,940
whether they're built natively

55
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,500
or they're built across anywhere.

56
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,270
Or it could be traditional automations,

57
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,340
especially for the things that you want,

58
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,790
fixed set of actions to
be taken by the agents.

59
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,160
Over next 17 to 18 minutes,

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,200
what we'll go through is, what is it...

61
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,430
We'll take a use case,

62
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,650
a complex use case in enterprise setup

63
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,870
and how agents that are built natively

64
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,400
and elsewhere can orchestrate

65
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,470
and fulfill that goal of end users.

66
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,360
I have Jyotsna taking over.

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,680
- Thank you, Sampath.

68
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,230
Hi everyone. Hey.

69
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,500
So let's look over the shoulder of Sam,

70
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,980
our persona, who is an
order fulfillment manager.

71
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,960
This is the day in her life.

72
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,650
Her primary job is to make
sure she receives the orders

73
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,750
and ensures they're delivered on time.

74
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,400
So she goes to Sterling OMS,

75
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,380
which is her order management system

76
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,420
to look at the status of the orders.

77
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,550
And if there are any suppliers,

78
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,230
information that she requires,

79
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,450
or has to create purchase requisitions,

80
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,710
she goes to a procurement
system like Coupa or SAP.

81
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,190
And to see if there are any
tickets raised by her customers,

82
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,790
she goes to Salesforce,
ServiceNow, those sort of systems.

83
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,950
And then to just to make sure,

84
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,870
and she works in heavy industry.

85
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,970
To make sure all of
her shipping is on time

86
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,740
and is not disrupted due to weather,

87
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,380
she of course has to check
the weather information,

88
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,890
and goes to Google, or a news informa,

89
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,310
a news outlet to make sure that the global

90
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,090
supply chain policies have not changed.

91
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,610
And then she does a lot of analysis

92
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,990
by pulling information over to
Excel and does manipulations.

93
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,680
And finally, if she's stuck
anywhere or need help,

94
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,830
there's really not much
place that she goes to.

95
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,150
So now we wanna show how
her life can be transformed

96
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,610
when IBM watsonx Orchestrate

97
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,460
and AgentCore comes together

98
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,830
to really transform her experience

99
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,080
through a conversational AI.

100
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,180
So all she has to do as somebody

101
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,740
who's new to the organization

102
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,660
and who might not be familiar

103
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,150
with all of the different
backend applications

104
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,560
and the nuances to it,

105
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,500
she can interact with Orchestrate

106
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,240
through the natural language query

107
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,370
so that it understands her intents,

108
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,590
it routes it to the various agents

109
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,720
that it has at its disposal,

110
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,490
triggers the right tools,

111
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,070
and helps her accomplish her task.

112
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,980
So upcoming, I have a
recorded demo that's embedded.

113
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,970
I'll talk through it,

114
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,270
but you can watch her
experience on the screen.

115
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,700
So this is Orchestrate Chat experience.

116
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,360
It comes with the builder
tool, observability tool,

117
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,330
all under one unified platform.

118
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,280
So she starts her day with

119
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,857
showing the orders for Steelix,

120
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,780
her primary account.

121
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,970
Orchestrate understands the intent

122
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,220
and pulls together a series of tools,

123
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,620
changes them to accomplish the outcome,

124
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,730
and surfaces that outcome back
to her in a readable format.

125
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,230
So the first thing first,

126
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,810
all of her interactions are registered

127
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,940
through the AgentCore Memory Services.

128
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,920
Now this, as you heard Swami this morning,

129
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,220
really helps in
personalizing her experience

130
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,010
as these memory gets saved
over a period of time.

131
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,280
And you could also enable analytics on it.

132
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,907
Like, "How are the suppliers?"

133
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:23,587
"Where are the delays?"

134
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:25,230
"How are my orders doing?"

135
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,960
So on and so forth, over a period of time.

136
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,280
Now the agent was able to
invoke the sterling OMS tools

137
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,290
where the order information is stored,

138
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,620
and render it back to her
in a consumable fashion,

139
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,260
so she understands her orders at a glance.

140
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,600
And it also provides a narrative on what

141
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,630
are the orders that are
actually in blocked status,

142
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,120
and what are the impact due to it.

143
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,760
Now she can also double click on certain

144
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,560
orders to understand more.

145
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,120
Now this order specifically,

146
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,500
she got a query about,

147
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,690
so it has to go on time.

148
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,240
So now she understands it's back-ordered,

149
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,060
and also it's a platinum customer.

150
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,840
So she can't offer any
sort of (indistinct) here.

151
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,780
So the agent provides
a root case analysis on

152
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,430
why the order is blocked,

153
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,740
and also provides her with strategies

154
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,930
on how to fulfill these orders.

155
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,220
So there are a number of strategies

156
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,340
that are laid out here from
reallocation inventory,

157
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,410
from a lower tier to platinum,

158
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,540
or finding an alternate sourcing.

159
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,780
So in this case she
picks alternate sourcing.

160
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,270
So she creates this complex query

161
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,030
to search the catalog for a certain item,

162
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,810
find the suppliers who
can provide that item,

163
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,020
and also find the cheapest
supplier amongst them,

164
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,140
and go ahead and to create
the purchase requisition.

165
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,400
Orchestrate has the Coupa
agents ask its collaborators.

166
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,730
As I mentioned, it can collaborate
across multiple agents.

167
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,560
So now it understands
this is not something

168
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,330
for the Sterling OMS agent,

169
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,100
but for the procurement agent,

170
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,060
and routes it to that in
order to fulfill her ask.

171
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,760
It breaks it down into multiple tasks

172
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,700
and accomplishes, accomplishes
them in a sequence.

173
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,067
It also identifies that she's
missing a few information.

174
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:11,160
"Okay. You asked me to
create a requisition,

175
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,690
but for how many items?"

176
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,980
So she, it has that multi-turn
conversation with Sam

177
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,870
to guide her through the process

178
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,970
to get the missing information,

179
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,810
and then go ahead and create
the purchase requisition.

180
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,000
It also provides her the rational

181
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,250
of why it selected supplier two.

182
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,755
Because you asked me for
the cheapest supplier,

183
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:35,010
and then all of the in information

184
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,260
in a consolidated manner.

185
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,660
Again, shipping information is missing.

186
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,750
So it comes back and asks
for that information next.

187
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,900
Now once all of the purchase
requisition is completed,

188
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,970
it then now asks her to the next step

189
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,640
in the process is to go ahead and submit.

190
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,500
The other key pieces.

191
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,260
This, as you can imagine within Coupa,

192
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,270
and there is another system, Sterling OMS,

193
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,210
which does not have an
integration between them,

194
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,680
but because they both are

195
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,990
collaborating agents on Orchestrate,

196
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,770
Orchestrate provides that
soft bridge integration

197
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,220
so that organizations don't
have to spend the time

198
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,970
and effort integrating all
of these systems yourself.

199
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,440
Now she was able to take

200
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,380
the purchase requisition from the Coupa,

201
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,780
and then sync it back to Sterling OMS,

202
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,090
or to the ServiceNow, you know,

203
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,580
whatever systems of
record that's required,

204
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,110
with the required information.

205
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,000
So this is the Coupa in the backend

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,850
where the purchase requisition
is actually created

207
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,340
by the trigger from Orchestrate.

208
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,800
Now, because all of these information

209
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,340
has been recorded using
AgentCore Memory Services,

210
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,720
she can retrieve it back,

211
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,670
both in this chat interface,

212
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,553
as well as in a different thread,

213
00:08:46,553 --> 00:08:49,080
and continue the
conversation from then on.

214
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,290
So it really helps to
store that long-term memory

215
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,870
so she can pick that conversation back up

216
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,060
on different day or on a different thread.

217
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,310
Now she wants to make sure
she did the right things.

218
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,700
So she's asking the agent
to summarize what she did,

219
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,980
and send it as an email to her manager

220
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,890
so her manager can be
rest assured that Sam,

221
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,470
a new employee followed the procedures,

222
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,400
and the policies that are
required within the organization.

223
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,990
Now let's take a quick look at

224
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,090
behind the scenes on what happens.

225
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,430
So this is the catalog of Orchestrate,

226
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,950
the primary landing page for builders.

227
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,490
And we have around 200
pre-built domain agents

228
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,610
across different domains and
to different applications.

229
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,217
I mentioned about the IBM systems,

230
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:34,470
but we also have for
ServiceNow, Oracle, Workday.

231
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,110
Depending on what your
starting point use cases,

232
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,840
you can come here to pick the agent,

233
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,660
and then explore the agent that you need.

234
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,240
And with a click as used as template,

235
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,510
you can take it back to
your builder experience.

236
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,370
Within the builder experience,

237
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,130
you have full control
to customize your agent.

238
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,670
Because we understand every
organization is unique.

239
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,080
Pre-built agents could take you
to 30, 40% of your use case,

240
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,330
but then the controls are in your hand.

241
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,670
You can pick and choose
the model of your choice.

242
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,700
In this case, we have integrated
with the bedrock models.

243
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,780
So we are using the

244
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,740
Claude Sonnet 4.5 from the, from Bedrock.

245
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,810
And I can add additional tools,

246
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,790
I can add additional agents,

247
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,730
and I also have the
control to add instructions

248
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,210
through the simple no-code
experience to make sure

249
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,130
that the agent behaves in the way

250
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,080
that I want it to behave.

251
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,400
Now, we saw Sam in
interacting with the agent

252
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,920
through the Orchestrate chat experience.

253
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,750
But this can also be embedded

254
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,430
within the channel of her choice.

255
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,150
If Sam is always on Teams or Slack,

256
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,610
then this agent can also
be integrated there,

257
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,220
so it provides that easy access for her.

258
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,830
And then any tools, we can consume tools,

259
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,170
we can add tools here from MCP server,

260
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,140
or we can also create our
own tools through Python

261
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,020
and add it to the Agent
Builder experience.

262
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,210
And as I mentioned
about the collaboration.

263
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,520
So orchestration is key for any

264
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,890
business use case that we have out there.

265
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,780
We know it's not just one task,

266
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,900
it's a series of tasks that
needs to be accomplished.

267
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,210
And the more and more
you're able to orchestrate,

268
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,540
the more time and effort that
you're actually able to save.

269
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,730
So we are able to add agents

270
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,100
that are natively built on Orchestrate,

271
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,660
or are built elsewhere,

272
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,970
and bring them back
through the A to A protocol

273
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,000
or the chat completions API.

274
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,781
And this preview on the site

275
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:32,550
gives the builder an
easy experience to test

276
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,590
and make sure that the agent behaves

277
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,420
the way it intends to behave.

278
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,930
And then we have a
unified connection manager

279
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,510
which allows the the builder to give,

280
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,810
give authentication security connections

281
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,590
to all of the backend tools
that Sam's supposed to have,

282
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,150
like the Sterling OMS connections,

283
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,710
or the Coupa connections which are

284
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,350
seamless behind the
scenes so agent is able

285
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,050
to hop across these
different collaborating

286
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,213
agents to accomplish the tasks.

287
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,360
Now moving on, what did we see?

288
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,860
We brought together IBM's
orchestration engine

289
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,220
along with the AgentCore services in order

290
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,370
to create a real life use case to life.

291
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,200
So as a fulfillment team,

292
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,010
the IBM watsonx Orchestrator
has two types of personas.

293
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,740
The business users who are able to

294
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,160
with little technical expertise
build their own agents

295
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,990
through the no-code agent builder.

296
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,640
And of course the developers,

297
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,650
we have an agent development kit

298
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,700
through which they're able

299
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,740
to build Pro-code agents,

300
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,180
and then make them available

301
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,750
on the UI experience as well.

302
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,690
And there's any channel
of engagement as we saw.

303
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,720
And then a series of
agents from the catalog,

304
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,690
or from the external agents
that are built elsewhere,

305
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,790
or natively built on Orchestrate

306
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,600
can all be put together through
our orchestration engine.

307
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,082
And then Orchestrate runs on AWS.

308
00:12:58,082 --> 00:12:59,940
We are available on AWS marketplace

309
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,700
and use all of the services
that are available.

310
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
And also now we are able

311
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,170
to leverage the AgentCore services.

312
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,440
We showed memory, we
showed the Bedrock models.

313
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,170
We are able to do the same
thing with observability,

314
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,530
and really provide that
one unified experience

315
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,110
to understand how are your agents running,

316
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,960
where are the errors, how many failures,

317
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,360
what are the, what are the
tools that were in worked,

318
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,910
whether any tool
hallucinations that happened,

319
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,680
how many tokens were exchanged.

320
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,200
All of them can also be monitored

321
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,650
on Orchestrate's in-built
analytics dashboard.

322
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,254
So the benefits as I me mentioned,

323
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:41,280
the way these agents
can be brought together

324
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,190
is really up to the
creativity of the end user.

325
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,680
So it provides that
proactive intelligence.

326
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,050
You are able to now,
the next time I log in,

327
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,510
if it nodes Steelix is my primary account,

328
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,167
it can surface up and say,

329
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,950
"Hey, here are the orders from Steelix."

330
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,130
And then it can provide real
time insights and show it here.

331
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,300
But imagine having a,

332
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,347
we can have a weather tool which says,

333
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:05,730
"Okay, your shipment node
is coming from city one,

334
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,320
where at this time of the year,

335
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,360
there are a lot of weather disruptions."

336
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,090
So you might wanna choose
an alternate sourcing route

337
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,380
through a different city.

338
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,750
So it's able to now provide you that level

339
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,400
of recommendations without me

340
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,000
having to go do those look-ups.

341
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,850
And then I spoke about the
multi-agent collaboration.

342
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,140
We saw what it could do

343
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,720
by bringing in two disparate systems

344
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,280
like Sterling and Coupa and
SAP onto a unified platform.

345
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,690
And then the observability,

346
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,910
no we were not able to go deeper into it,

347
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,710
but do in the platform,

348
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,543
we have the analytics
dashboard which provides

349
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:43,543
a unified observability,

350
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,450
and we are soon adding observability

351
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,890
even for third party agents

352
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,530
because that's been the biggest challenge.

353
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,470
Now I have observability
on my native agents,

354
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,450
how do I know what's
happening on the third party?

355
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,320
But you're able to bring

356
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,630
all of them on a unified experience.

357
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,230
And then the memory is able to
provide you with preferences

358
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,753
and analytics based on
the past experience.

359
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,200
Now, so I really wanted to close

360
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,150
with this slide where we are,

361
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,820
what works available today
are the AI assistance.

362
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,103
We are all using co-pilots in different,

363
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,260
you know, capacities now
where we are working high,

364
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,930
high now is this high impact workflows

365
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,950
which really provides the lift
on productivity, and becomes,

366
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,670
AI agents become part of your
everyday business use case,

367
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,610
be it sales, procurement, talent, finance,

368
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,340
support, HR and so on and so forth.

369
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,350
And these are the starting point use cases

370
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,390
that we have as part of our catalog.

371
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,850
And this really becomes
that stepping stone

372
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,650
for that next level,

373
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,300
which is really the frontier

374
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,480
for fully autonomous AI agents to play in.

375
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,470
Because there are a lot of issues,

376
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,290
problems to solve in
from trust, reliability,

377
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,140
and you must have heard
a lot about it this week.

378
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,000
But that's truly unlocks

379
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,310
and enables really small teams

380
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,193
to be able to do high impactful work.

381
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,160
Thank you so much for listening to us.

382
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,350
So we are at booth there,
the IBM booth there.

383
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,240
You can walk right up there,

384
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,060
and then do sign up for a
free trial of Orchestrate.

385
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,611
Thank you.

386
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:14,894
