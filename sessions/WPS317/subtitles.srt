1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,257
(audience chattering)

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,150
- Good to go?

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,580
Okay. Hello everyone.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,380
Thanks for joining us today.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,430
I am Amanda Quinto

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,440
and I am a solutions architect in Brazil

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,920
responsible for public finances
for the past six years.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,975
Today we are going to
talk about a little bit

9
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:22,230
so our secure AI agents
in delivery efficiency

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,060
in high regulated environments.

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,810
I'm here with two really nice
customers, Edson and Andries.

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,130
They are over there

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,440
and they will be presenting with me today.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,760
So again, thanks for joining.

15
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,760
It's really nice to be in
re:Invent this year with you guys.

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,960
There's a little bit about our agenda.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,720
So we are gonna talk about
high regulated environments

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,207
and how we can operate AI workloads

19
00:00:44,207 --> 00:00:47,010
on top of those kind of environments.

20
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,570
And then, we are going to talk about

21
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,120
how we can use Amazon EKS to run

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,600
AI agents and AI workloads on AWS.

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,883
Edson will explain how is Sicoob using

24
00:00:56,883 --> 00:01:00,630
this kind of environments to run workloads

25
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,270
for gen AI in high regulated environments.

26
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,180
We are going then to
move to Amazon Bedrock

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,480
and understand how can Bedrock help us

28
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,700
to deliver AI agents

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,360
and also stay inside of our regulations.

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,900
And then Holland casinos
represented by Andries

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,960
will be showing here for
you guys to understand

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,640
how they are using AgentCore

33
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,140
to run their workloads on AWS.

34
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,360
Okay. So let's get started.

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
We have about an hour here

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,310
and I will try to make you guys up.

37
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,680
I know it's really heavy event

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,570
and you guys walk a little bit

39
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,340
long distances to be here with us today.

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,333
So thank you again.

41
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,890
When we are talking about
high regulated environments,

42
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,780
we are no longer just thinking about

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,013
deploying models on AWS.

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,670
We need to operate inside
of dense amount of laws,

45
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,600
standards and patterns to
stay inside of the regulations

46
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,310
of our current countries.

47
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,500
Here we are representing
two different countries,

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,360
that's Brazil and Holland,

49
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,840
but we can see these movements
all around the globe.

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,020
Europe, for example,
has the Europe AI Act.

51
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,579
That is a movement with
strict risk based framework

52
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:13,620
that then some uses completely from AI

53
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,922
and also determine some
different obligations

54
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:21,240
for high risk systems to run both on cloud

55
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,370
or in the on premises environments

56
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,270
when we're talking about
data and AI workloads.

57
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,576
Brazil is combining their
emerging AI legislations

58
00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:35,940
with the legislations that
already have on top of data.

59
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,730
Something like LGPD for example.

60
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,340
We also took two different patterns.

61
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,590
We have some obligations that's federal

62
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,620
for mostly data from public sector.

63
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,739
For example, we should stay with this data

64
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,700
inside of the Brazil.

65
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,730
And we also have some discussions
around data sovereignty.

66
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,160
And we also have some determinations

67
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,050
around specific industries.

68
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,850
So for example, my industry,
finances and public finances,

69
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,600
have some obligations that is
determined by central bank.

70
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,930
So we have, we received the
normatives from Central Bank

71
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,510
and we should make our customers to run

72
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,440
inside AWS respecting
this kind of obligations.

73
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,000
This is a worldwide movement.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,670
We have today more than 1,000 different

75
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,770
AI regulations around the world.

76
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,740
This is representing
more than 69 countries.

77
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,559
So it is not easy to stay
inside of the regulations

78
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:32,430
as of providers such as AWS.

79
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,210
So we work specifically
in each customer cases

80
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,130
to deliver the best architectures

81
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,713
that fulfill this kind of requirements.

82
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,240
There is something common
when we are talking about

83
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,190
this kind of frameworks and obligations.

84
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,600
When we look into Brazil or
South America or United States

85
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,453
or Europe, there are always some pillars

86
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:56,910
that is similar in different scenarios.

87
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,010
So we have compliance and governance,

88
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,180
we have legal and privacy,
controls and risk management.

89
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,827
These four pillars always appear

90
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:08,280
in different normatives and
regulations around the globe.

91
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,773
And that can make for us
the bottom layer that we can

92
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:15,447
look into this and deliver
different architectures

93
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:18,240
that work for mostly
cases around the globe.

94
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,176
But again, there is different obligations

95
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,680
in different countries,
in different industries

96
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,570
that we need to always make sure

97
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,520
that we are responding correctly

98
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,793
for this kind of
environment and obligations.

99
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,737
So there is some patterns
that we can follow

100
00:04:34,737 --> 00:04:38,400
so we can understand the customer needs,

101
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,540
their regulation needs

102
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,750
and stay on top of this
kind of obligations.

103
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,610
We can see this in a layered
pattern that can help us here.

104
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,200
So we have at the bottom,

105
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,380
we have the gen AI
application for example.

106
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,080
On top of this we have regulatory layers.

107
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,150
So as I said, it's
different from each country.

108
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,469
It's different for Europe,
it's different for Canadians,

109
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:02,850
it's different from Chile
and China for example.

110
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,160
And we need to be specific to here,

111
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,832
but there is other layers
that we can understand

112
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:09,330
in a broader way.

113
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,420
So for example, when we
talk about responsible AI

114
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,600
and in AWS responsible AI
is a really half pillar

115
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,512
that we are following from our customers

116
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:19,800
and also our services to deliver

117
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,810
Gen AI solutions for the customer.

118
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,199
So when we talk about responsible AI,

119
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,934
we have some pillars and
patterns when we talk about data,

120
00:05:28,934 --> 00:05:32,790
when we talk about
safeguarding our customers,

121
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,694
when we're talking about security

122
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:37,954
and prompting engineering
structures that we can

123
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:41,211
be aware of malicious users for example.

124
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:44,670
So all of these kind of
discussions are inside

125
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,160
of the responsible AI layer in AWS.

126
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,890
So this is a really interesting content

127
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,970
that you guys should,

128
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,784
if you guys like this
kind of documentation

129
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:56,664
is really have documentation
and you should read about it

130
00:05:56,664 --> 00:06:00,750
because there is a lot of
good instructions over there.

131
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,150
And if you follow the
responsible AI patterns,

132
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,430
you are probably going to be inside

133
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,533
of the obligations in your countries.

134
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,340
We also have compliancy and standards

135
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,680
and here we are talking
about ISOs we are going

136
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,510
to talk a little bit further about ISOs,

137
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,080
but it's important just to know
that there is specific ISOs

138
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,870
for specifically Gen AI workloads already.

139
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,580
So we are also looking to this

140
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,553
and we are also delivering
architectures on top of it.

141
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,850
And here we are talking more,

142
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,520
the technical aspects here in tow,

143
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,200
so it's a layered approach.

144
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,870
So we have the bottom
layers on the regulatory

145
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,390
and on top of this, we can think about

146
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,130
more technical perspectives.

147
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,903
So we can see NIST framework for example,

148
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,690
NIST 600 framework for example,

149
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,270
is a risk management framework for AI.

150
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,420
But as you know, NIST is just
a pattern that we can follow.

151
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,390
They don't really audit
your environment for this,

152
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,400
but we can look into this framework

153
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,020
and see if we are architecturing
our systems on Gen AI

154
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,640
following these patterns.

155
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,220
And then when we are going
to solve for some auditation

156
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,530
from the responsible
government or something,

157
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,273
we are going to probably be inside

158
00:07:09,273 --> 00:07:11,610
of these obligations, okay.

159
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,630
So NIST AI framework 600
is a really good framework.

160
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,750
It's the main framework that United States

161
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,370
is following for their obligations,

162
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,930
and the laws and definitions

163
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,880
that you guys are following here in US.

164
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,007
On top of this, there is OWASP.

165
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:29,970
So OWASP are really common
when we are talking about,

166
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,900
for example, OWASP Top 10
vulnerabilities for security.

167
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,900
There is also the OWASP LLM
AI cybersecurity pattern.

168
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,770
So you can see the, it's improvement.

169
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,840
Actually it's been improved, actually,

170
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
but you can see what is the most common

171
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,487
vulnerabilities that can
appear in Gen AI workloads.

172
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:56,126
You can see how we can
achieve some techniques

173
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:58,290
to avoid this kind of problems.

174
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,140
So OWASP is always a good idea.

175
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,840
There's also OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities

176
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,199
for LLM applications.

177
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,067
So you should also be aware
and there are also changes

178
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:10,260
because it's really new.

179
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,563
So we are always having new,
new vulnerabilities here.

180
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:14,550
It's not a good thing,

181
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,430
but it's a pattern in the marketing.

182
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,800
And on top of all of this
we already have the AWS

183
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,640
well architected framework
layer for Gen AI applications.

184
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,260
So you guys should know the AWS
well architecture I believe.

185
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,502
And we have a bunch of different layers

186
00:08:30,502 --> 00:08:33,390
for our six pillars and there is already

187
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,850
a layer for Gen AI workloads as well.

188
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,541
So it's a live document.

189
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,260
It's being proven as well,

190
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,650
but it's already live for our
customers to follow, okay.

191
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,926
So this layered regulation
and controls should help us

192
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:51,330
to build this kind of workloads on AWS,

193
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,330
following and maintain ourselves
inside of the regulations

194
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,803
from our countries, right?

195
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,930
Regulatories should not
stop the AI adoptions.

196
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,990
We think regulatory requires AI adoptions.

197
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,610
We can also improve regulatory
obligations using AI.

198
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,190
We can use AI to understand the regulatory

199
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,270
and then accelerate the AI

200
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,830
workloads on high regulated
environments, okay?

201
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,570
We can see this in government in Brazil,

202
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,950
we see this in financial sector,

203
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,840
we see this in health sector as well.

204
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,763
So we can also,

205
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,200
we can make them work together.

206
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,453
One should not stop the other, right.

207
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,320
Okay, so now we discuss a little bit about

208
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,410
how high regulators
works around the world,

209
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,890
how AWS positions
themselves on this matters.

210
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,760
Let's go dive deep into the
technical perspective now.

211
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,610
When we are talking about Gen AI in AWS,

212
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,793
there is three layers and
you're probably going to see

213
00:09:47,793 --> 00:09:49,619
this is like a lot on re:Invent.

214
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:51,930
I'm going to be real quickly here

215
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,110
because this is most
probably the most used slide

216
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,710
for the AWS solutions
architects around the world.

217
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,410
But this is the AWS three layer

218
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,290
for generative AI stack, okay?

219
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,610
So from the top to the
bottom we have the Q family,

220
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,380
so the applications family.

221
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,230
We have the Amazon
bedrock, that is our suite,

222
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,710
our solution for all gen
AI workloads running.

223
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,703
We can run,

224
00:10:17,703 --> 00:10:19,250
use different models,

225
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,160
we can use everything
on top of APIs on AWS.

226
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,020
And in the bottom here, we
have the infrastructure layer.

227
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,180
So we are going to talk about,

228
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,800
more about the infrastructure layer here

229
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,630
because of the Sicoob use cases.

230
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,400
And then we will detail this for you.

231
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,740
The infrastructure layer here,

232
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,990
there is, I don't know
two names here that makes

233
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,250
a lots of noise in the marketing.

234
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,750
There is Trainium and Inferentia.

235
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,630
They are ships specific developed by AWS

236
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,490
for machine learning workloads.

237
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,110
We also have SageMaker.

238
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,690
And in SageMaker there's a
whole world of solutions.

239
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,560
You can deliver different
kinds using machine learning

240
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,660
or Gen AI models if you want to.

241
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,000
But we are going to
talk about specifically

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,800
GPUs workloads here.

243
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,530
So in AWS we have a bunch
of different types of GPUs.

244
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:12,530
There is a disposability of
a lot of GPUs on our stack

245
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,024
and you're gonna understand
how we can use GPUs

246
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:16,950
to deliver Gen AI solutions

247
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,130
for high regulated environments, okay.

248
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,573
But in the heart of Gen AI,
there is a model, right?

249
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,620
There is some commonly used models here,

250
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,270
but before I think about the model,

251
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,770
you should understand your use case.

252
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,750
So what I'm trying to solve here?

253
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,780
What is my pain that I
needed to solve with Gen AI

254
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,398
and check if there is
actually a Gen AI solution

255
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,100
that I should use for this pain,

256
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,140
for this problem in my company.

257
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,574
Yes it is makes sense to use Gen AI

258
00:11:44,574 --> 00:11:47,430
for this kind of workload.

259
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,263
All right.

260
00:11:48,263 --> 00:11:51,120
So now then you should
find a model for this.

261
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,950
There's a bunch of them in the marketing.

262
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,650
We have also Amazon Nova and AWS.

263
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,755
After this you are
probably going to use two

264
00:11:57,755 --> 00:12:00,750
or three models for your workload.

265
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,138
And you will probably going
to change this after a while.

266
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:06,019
Weeks and months after months,

267
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:08,863
we are seeing different models
arriving in the marketing

268
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:09,927
and one is better for one thing,

269
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:12,180
the other is better for another thing.

270
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,240
You should not be in love with your model.

271
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,700
You should use the best
model for your use case.

272
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,530
But there's a bunch of them models there.

273
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,720
You choose two or three that works better

274
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,800
for your use case, for
your scenario and go ahead.

275
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,554
So you use a foundation model.

276
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:30,859
You can both use it, RAG for example,

277
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:34,170
are prompt engineering
tools to solve your problem.

278
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,474
And just to make one quick comment here,

279
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:39,360
this is a 300 sessions.

280
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,010
So I'm sorry, my hair.

281
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,180
This is a 300 sessions.

282
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,535
So we're not going to explain what's RAG,

283
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:46,290
we're not going to explain
what is the prompt engineering,

284
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,477
but we are going to state
all of the events here

285
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,910
the solutions architect to help you with

286
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,520
that if you have some doubt, right?

287
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,852
So you choose your model,

288
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:57,240
you have your problem solved.

289
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,280
You need to understand if you're
going to use, for example,

290
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,410
prompt engineering or
RAG to make your data

291
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,900
inside of this model or in
parallel with this model.

292
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,350
That should work for you too.

293
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,750
If that doesn't work, you
can fine tune your model.

294
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,347
So there's a model you
can fine, get your data,

295
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:18,030
your specific data for
your specific industry

296
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,240
and fine tuning your model to fulfill

297
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,820
your use case, to solve your problem.

298
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,898
That works too.

299
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:27,184
It's not a easy task to do.

300
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:30,090
You need a lot of data
to do this properly,

301
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,740
but it works well when we are talking

302
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,880
about specific industries.

303
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,190
For example, in Brazil
we are seeing a movement

304
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,280
of financial sectors using
this, health sector using this.

305
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,510
And also public sector,

306
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,670
the government is
thinking about developing

307
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,150
and fine tuning the
large foundation models

308
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,230
with specific data.

309
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,770
So that should work for
some large use cases here.

310
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,540
But it's not an easy task to do

311
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,103
and you need lots of data.

312
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,790
Or you can train your own model.

313
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,870
This is really is a
heavy task to do as well,

314
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,149
but should work.

315
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:04,265
You should have a lot of data again.

316
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:07,432
You should use a bunch of
GPU to train your models,

317
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:09,450
but that works as well.

318
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,550
So you need to understand
which approach is better

319
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,260
for your workload, for your use case,

320
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,113
for the size of your company
and then move forward.

321
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,980
We have a model now that we can do.

322
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,420
We need to do the inference.

323
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,633
So in the heart there is a model,

324
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:26,070
but we need to deliver this model

325
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,790
for our application in a way
that we can do predictions.

326
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,790
we can do prompt engineering,
top of this model faster,

327
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,133
easier, with low latency

328
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:40,320
if you're talking about some

329
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,510
production workload for example.

330
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,490
You can also do batch predictions,

331
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,000
but you also need inference endpoint

332
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,520
that is generally
available, that's resilient,

333
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,380
that's secure as well for your workload.

334
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,793
So this is important here.

335
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:57,861
In AWS, there is three
different ways to do this.

336
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:59,640
We can use Amazon Bedrock

337
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,770
and we are gonna talk with
this a little bit further.

338
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,390
You can use SageMaker as well.

339
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,371
So there are specific models

340
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,060
that you can deploy on SageMaker

341
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,146
and you can also deliver endpoints

342
00:15:08,146 --> 00:15:10,890
for making inference on SageMaker.

343
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,080
And you can use Amazon EKS.

344
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,460
There is a really interesting
movement running right now

345
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,589
and we are seeing this growing
on the AWS with Amazon EKS.

346
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:26,589
So if you search for
due on EKS, data on EKS,

347
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,242
there is a bunch of interesting materials.

348
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:31,680
We have a bunch of customers
using this around the globe.

349
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,680
But to use Kubernates
as your main platform

350
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,363
you need to understand that this is,

351
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,890
there's overhead on top of
your infrastructure team here.

352
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,160
So if already you are
using Kubernates to run

353
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,460
other kinds of workloads,
to run your workloads

354
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,150
in production in AWS, your
team already know the solution

355
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,160
that probably a path to go.

356
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,339
But if you don't know AWS,
don't know Kubernates rather,

357
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:00,403
you don't know Amazon EKS

358
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:03,270
and you're going to
discover this right when

359
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,470
you are trying to implement
generative AI workloads on AWS.

360
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,800
That's probably going
to be a hard task to do.

361
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,780
But I am a really fan of Kubernates,

362
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,720
and if you're doing this
here, you're probably going

363
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,840
to get some really outcomes

364
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,370
after all the overhead on your team, okay.

365
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,920
So, when you are using
Kubernates as the main platform,

366
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,890
here, we probably going
to already have some

367
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:33,890
main pillars for
production workloads on AWS

368
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,890
such as disaster
recovery, cost visibility.

369
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,090
We can have deployment
automations as well on Kubernates.

370
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:47,010
And we can deliver and
deploy our inference endpoint

371
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,350
and our generative AI
workloads on Kubernates.

372
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,530
So instead of deploying
Amazon EC2, for example

373
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:56,490
with GPU and run everything
inside of these EC2

374
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,200
and have problems with scalability

375
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,907
and have problems with
deployment automations

376
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:01,410
and disaster recovery,

377
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,620
you can put this inside of
Kubernates with Amazon EKS

378
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,020
and then run your Gen AI workloads

379
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,900
in these kind of architectures, okay.

380
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,540
I'm talking a little
bit more than I used to,

381
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,650
and it's really cold in here.

382
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,060
So I'm going to take some water here

383
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,013
but let's keep it going.

384
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,280
So, why customers choose EKS for inference

385
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,350
as we were discussing?

386
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,060
There's a bunch of good things

387
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,190
such as disaster recovery, scalability,

388
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,330
cost predictions as well.

389
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,090
We can have some tools for this.

390
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,027
But for me, the main goal,
the main reason is for

391
00:17:37,027 --> 00:17:39,240
open source ecosystem.

392
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,280
So the open source
ecosystem for Kubernates

393
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,280
has been really good, really
dense material for the past,

394
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,450
I don't know, more than 10 years,

395
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,580
for different kinds of workloads

396
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,740
and for Gen AI workloads,
this is indifferent.

397
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,660
So there is a really good materials

398
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,030
for Kubernates in AI workloads

399
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,700
with the open source community.

400
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,370
They are always developing
new solutions for this,

401
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,683
so when this starts, I don't
know, one year and half ago,

402
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:11,373
we didn't have solutions for
deploying clusters with GPU.

403
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:16,373
We didn't have for example,
images that was GPU prepared.

404
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,420
We didn't have infrastructure
as code solutions for these.

405
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,990
But one year and half later,
we already have some project

406
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,990
that is really mature
and open source ecosystem

407
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,170
that supports this kind of
workloads all around the globe.

408
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,530
So again, if you guys like
this kind of materials,

409
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,500
you should search for data on EKS.

410
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,800
There is a bunch of interesting
materials over there.

411
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,170
We also have all these pillars here

412
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,487
for the recently introduced Kubernates.

413
00:18:46,748 --> 00:18:51,030
The open source secret system
is the most interesting one.

414
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,160
You can also run this everywhere.

415
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,990
So you can run this on AWS,

416
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,520
you can run this in different providers.

417
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,860
You can run this inside of
your own infrastructure.

418
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,130
If you have, for some reason
you have GPUs over there,

419
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,763
you can make some tests on your on,

420
00:19:04,763 --> 00:19:07,050
on premises environment for example.

421
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,943
So there's a bunch of
different reasons used here

422
00:19:08,943 --> 00:19:10,540
that we can use EKS

423
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,220
And now, Edson will share a little bit

424
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,935
of the Sicoob case with us

425
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:19,080
and how they are using
this kind of architectures

426
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,770
to fulfill their business needs.

427
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,563
Okay, so Edson please.

428
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,103
Thank you.

429
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,980
- Thank you Amanda. Hello, everyone.

430
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,280
As Amanda said, my name is Edson Lisboa.

431
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,190
I am IT executive at Sicoob.

432
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,570
And Sicoob is one

433
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,256
of the largest cooperative
financial system in Brazil,

434
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:45,630
the cooperative union in Brazil.

435
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,800
And it's my pleasure to
be here with you today

436
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,530
during the next few minutes

437
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,410
to share on the re:invent stage

438
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,520
to share a little bit more
about our generative AI journey

439
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,260
and how a highly regulated
financial institution

440
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,340
is successfully adopting generative AI

441
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,340
at scale, keeping security,
governance, compliance

442
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:17,343
as non-negotiable pillars.

443
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,930
So let me start with who we are.

444
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,763
As I said,

445
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:27,763
Sicoob is a cooperative
financial institution in Brazil

446
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,440
and Sicoob is present in all

447
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,850
over the country.

448
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,300
As you know, Brazil is
almost a continental country

449
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,630
and Sicoob is present there.

450
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:44,430
And Sicoob offers almost the same

451
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,630
financial products and services
as a traditional bank does.

452
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:53,630
Sicoob is present in almost
2,500 Brazilian cities.

453
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,390
And it's very interesting to emphasize

454
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,830
that over 400 Brazilian cities

455
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,200
there is only Sicoob there.

456
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,520
We have more than 300 credit unions

457
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,940
integrated with our cooperative system.

458
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,940
We have 14 central co-ops

459
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,940
and we have 4,700 brands
in all over the country

460
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,040
with more than 60,000 employees.

461
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,680
All this structure serving

462
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,730
more than 9 million people in our country.

463
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,750
And it's very important to emphasize that

464
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,750
even considering this
presence in our country,

465
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,170
over than 98% of our transactions

466
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,740
are performing on our digital channels

467
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,340
such as mobile app and internet bank.

468
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,880
And as a financial institution in Brazil,

469
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,880
it means that we are living
under a very strict regulation

470
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,660
from our Brazilia Central Bank.

471
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,660
And for us governance it's not
only a compliance check box,

472
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,790
but it's really a true
competitive differentiator.

473
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,750
So we decided to create
a centralized structure

474
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,050
to control the decisions about governance

475
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,240
with clear accountability,

476
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,353
risky classification and
continuous monitoring.

477
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,810
And when we started our
generative AI journey,

478
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:41,700
we defined four unbreakable pillars

479
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,090
such as the first one, security.

480
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,580
As a financial institution for us,

481
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,820
the security of our credit unions

482
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,420
and members data is our priority.

483
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,180
The second one is scalability.

484
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:02,180
Considering our actual
numbers, as I had showed you

485
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,860
and considering our goals
for the next few years,

486
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,620
we really needed an environment

487
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,070
and a solution to support our size

488
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,130
and our growth needs.

489
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,750
So it was very important to us.

490
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,040
The third one, efficient cost management.

491
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,110
It was very important to us

492
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:32,250
run the large models
considering the strategy

493
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,000
pay as you go and considering the strategy

494
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,680
related of open source LLM adoption.

495
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,020
It was very important to us too.

496
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,160
And last but not least,
multiple LLM models.

497
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,140
We wanted to use the right
model to the right task.

498
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,140
We really believe that only one
model doesn't fit all needs.

499
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,910
And these are the open sources,

500
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,420
LLM models that we are using.

501
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:11,420
We are running on AWS using
Amazon EKS as Amanda said.

502
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,740
And the models Llama from Meta,

503
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,050
Mistral, PHI 4,

504
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:22,170
the Chinese model, DeepSeek R1

505
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,950
and the model from IBM named granite.

506
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,190
Sometimes we are using multiple models

507
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,240
side by side in the same use case

508
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,590
and in other case we can
choose a specific model

509
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,780
considering the fastest

510
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,780
or considering the most
accurate to this that subject.

511
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,100
And considering all this
strategy and this information,

512
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,900
Ms. Amanda will explain
a little bit more about

513
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,530
technical information of our environment.

514
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,730
Amanda, help me.

515
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,596
- Yeah. Thank you Edson.

516
00:25:03,596 --> 00:25:05,640
Thanks for sharing.

517
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,977
Okay, so again, we have
a model as Edson said,

518
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:10,221
they choose their model,
they choose their problem,

519
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:13,290
what they are trying to
solve with generative AI,

520
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:16,317
they understand the regulated environment

521
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:19,860
and what obligations they should achieve.

522
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,740
And this is the architecture
that they are running

523
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,280
on AWS to solve these problems.

524
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,160
So we are going to discuss a little bit

525
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,663
about this architecture here.

526
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,270
It's actually a simple architecture.

527
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:38,220
In the core of this, we have
an Amazon EKS cluster, okay.

528
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,510
In Amazon EKS cluster,

529
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,390
we are deploying EC2 instances with GPUs.

530
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,730
To do this, there is a
bunch of best practices

531
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,070
that we are discovering with our customers

532
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,280
from the past one year,
one year and a half or so.

533
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,980
And we are trying to
bring here for you guys

534
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,670
when you're going to try
this on your specific cases.

535
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,010
So for example, you guys should

536
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,230
think about using specific AMIs

537
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,290
for generative AI workloads,
for GPU workloads.

538
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,616
So there is, for example,
drivers from Nvidia

539
00:26:09,616 --> 00:26:12,900
that you don't want to
deploy it by your own.

540
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,580
There's a bunch of different versions

541
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,450
that you can have some problems
when you're deploying this.

542
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,940
So use specific AMIs.

543
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,427
Other good idea is to
download all the models

544
00:26:23,427 --> 00:26:25,650
for Amazon Street for example.

545
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,432
So instead of downloading the model,

546
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:31,140
every time you run a new
pod inside of Kubernetes,

547
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,090
you can use this on Amazon Street

548
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,805
and it's really quickly
to deploy it on EKS

549
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,500
when you already have
the model here, okay.

550
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,170
So this is a good idea

551
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:45,330
when you are deploying this
kind of infrastructure.

552
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,912
But actually this isn't a
Kubernetes presentation,

553
00:26:48,912 --> 00:26:50,490
so I'm trying not to go

554
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,040
so dive deep into the
Kubernetes perspective.

555
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,770
But there is two solutions,
two open source solutions

556
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,820
that's really helping

557
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,430
and making this workload,

558
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,620
makes sense for this workload on Sicoob.

559
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,170
So we know GPUs are expensive.

560
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,410
They are not cheapest
infrastructure. We know this.

561
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,250
So they are using Karpenter
to scale Kubernetes

562
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,220
with GPU instances on AWS.

563
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,203
So instead of just deploying
the instances based on the,

564
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,560
I don't know,

565
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,410
this model needs this shape of GPUs,

566
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,780
I will deploy my cluster

567
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,240
with this node groups and that's all,

568
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,640
they are using Karpenter to do this

569
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,703
using spotting instances
on EKS, on Kubernetes.

570
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,859
So instead of just leaving the GPUs

571
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:38,220
over there without utilization,

572
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,850
they pay as you go, as they
go, as you go as Edson said

573
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,970
and use these GPU instances
based on their needs.

574
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,640
But there is another
solution on top of this

575
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,000
that is also an open source
solution that is KEDA

576
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,569
that's for the grow,

577
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:57,877
I'm trying to not use
Kubernetes concepts here

578
00:27:57,877 --> 00:28:01,950
to scalability the depots
inside of the cluster.

579
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,460
So whenever they received a
request from the environment.

580
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,310
So if they are not using the final users,

581
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,260
they have both inside users

582
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,480
and customers using this environment.

583
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,940
But the users are not
using the environment,

584
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,620
they don't run any pods,

585
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,956
so they don't deploy any GPU instances.

586
00:28:18,956 --> 00:28:21,180
So they don't pay for it.

587
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,900
So the KEDA is used to scalability depots

588
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,220
based on the request.

589
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,590
So you receive the request
in this environment,

590
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,100
then we will deploy it for the end user.

591
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,460
It's something that you think about it

592
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,560
because took some time to deploy it,

593
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,730
but if there isn't, I dunno,
transactional workload

594
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,157
that's running inside of the
cluster, maybe the customer,

595
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:48,270
the end user or the
final customer can wait,

596
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,720
I dunno some seconds
over there to deploy this

597
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,998
to then start using
the generative AI model

598
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,530
or something like this.

599
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,363
So this works better for Sicoob

600
00:28:56,363 --> 00:29:00,180
and that's why these
environments make so much sense

601
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,560
with this kind of architecture

602
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,590
combining Karpenter and
KEDA using EKS clusters,

603
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,810
they can deploy different models,

604
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,630
they can achieve different business cases

605
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,680
using these environments.

606
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,450
So there is a bunch of
different cases here.

607
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,240
Edson will explain for
you a little bit later

608
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,040
inside of the same cluster.

609
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,410
So the same cluster is running this.

610
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,540
To operationalize this,

611
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,060
they are using other two
open source solutions.

612
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,279
So as I said before, that's
one of the core reasons

613
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,320
that I believe that
Kubernetes makes so much sense

614
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,090
for Gen AI workloads.

615
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,530
The open source solutions,

616
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,670
I already talk about two.

617
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,410
Karpenter, it is developed by AWS

618
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,840
but it is an open source
solution and KEDA.

619
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,980
There's also another two.

620
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,840
So we have LiteLLM.

621
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,840
So instead of managing these
models inside of the cluster,

622
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,190
I dunno, in common line,

623
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:55,020
we can expose this for the
final users using LiteLLM.

624
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,000
So this is also an open source solution.

625
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,240
It's also somehow choose
how to deploy this on AWS

626
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,667
in our documentation.

627
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,992
It's a really nice
solution that you can use

628
00:30:03,992 --> 00:30:07,710
to manage all these models
inside of the cluster.

629
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,347
So we have a customer interface,

630
00:30:09,347 --> 00:30:13,350
end user interface that
you can run the models.

631
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,437
And also vLLM.

632
00:30:15,437 --> 00:30:19,140
vLLM is a solution that is
actually new in this environment,

633
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,190
in Sicoob environment.

634
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,560
Before this, they were using a Llama,

635
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,970
but they achieve that using
vLLM, they have much more,

636
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,820
it is much more faster,

637
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,120
it's more compute optimized
to run the models.

638
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,054
And vLLM is actually a new solutions

639
00:30:36,054 --> 00:30:37,890
and new open source tool

640
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,190
and is receiving improvements
from the community.

641
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,750
So it's probably going to be

642
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,555
even cheaper than we
started using this kind of

643
00:30:45,555 --> 00:30:50,370
engine to run LLM models
on top of Kubernetes.

644
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,923
So this is here four open source solutions

645
00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:56,250
that really makes sense for
them to run this workload,

646
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,288
to run different kinds of workloads

647
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:01,290
inside of the same cluster here.

648
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:06,290
And then we can also use other
AWS services around this.

649
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:09,000
So for example, we have Amazon ECR.

650
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
For the images, we are using Ingress

651
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,893
to expose the endpoint of the
models for the solutions with

652
00:31:16,893 --> 00:31:20,400
AWS load balancers and
other other solutions.

653
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,020
But the main of the infrastructure

654
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,070
of the architecture here
is inside of the cluster.

655
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:29,400
So this kind of solutions
is really making sense

656
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,600
for this workload for them

657
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,870
and also deploying GPU instances on AWS.

658
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,223
When we use Karpenter,

659
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,243
we don't need to work on the heavy lift

660
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:41,123
of thinking about which
different instances

661
00:31:41,123 --> 00:31:44,460
there is available in
this zone for example.

662
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,100
You can put three, in
Brazil, you have three zones.

663
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,290
We can put those three different zones

664
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,630
inside of the Karpenter manifests

665
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:56,280
and say, I should use this shapes of GPUs,

666
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,418
which one is better,
which one is available,

667
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:00,870
which one of these is cheaper?

668
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,780
You should deploy it on the cluster for me

669
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,280
and then let Karpenter works.

670
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,690
He does the works for you.

671
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,390
You can use budgets on Kubernetes

672
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:14,160
to arrange the way that
they took off your instance,

673
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,930
but they only took off your instances

674
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,490
or your spotting instance

675
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,290
after you have another one deployed.

676
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:24,009
So there is some ways to work
with spotting interruptions

677
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,490
when you are talking about
Kubernetes environments.

678
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,220
So there's a bunch of solutions

679
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,731
and tricks and tips here
that we can understand

680
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:35,700
how we can operate generative AI

681
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,990
inside of Amazon EKS cluster on AWS, okay.

682
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,110
But the main idea here is that we can run

683
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,540
different workloads
inside of the same cluster

684
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,290
with cost management achieved.

685
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,520
We are going to,

686
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,454
we are being able to run
this with some low overhead

687
00:32:55,454 --> 00:32:57,150
on top of the team.

688
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:57,983
Okay.

689
00:32:57,983 --> 00:33:00,390
So Edson will now explain
which are the outcomes

690
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:05,043
and what are the business
solutions that they are achieving.

691
00:33:07,627 --> 00:33:08,766
- Thanks, Amanda.

692
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:09,750
Thanks, Amanda.

693
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,930
And now for me, is the most important part

694
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,807
considering the real use case

695
00:33:14,807 --> 00:33:18,360
and considering the business results

696
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,440
using all these platform,
all these environment,

697
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,440
using these LLM models
as Amanda showed to you.

698
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,400
First of all, I would like to share

699
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,910
a little bit about our
internal intelligence

700
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,840
development assistant named Sisbr code AI.

701
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,040
Sisbr is the name of our
core banking platform

702
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,556
an we decided not to pay

703
00:33:46,556 --> 00:33:49,470
or not to buy a specific solution

704
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,500
to integrate to our platform.

705
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,760
We decided to create our own solution

706
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,380
using these LLM models that I showed you.

707
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,380
And we integrated this solution
with IDEs of our developers.

708
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:14,330
Nowadays we have almost 1,500
developers in our company.

709
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:22,320
And there are a lot of benefits
of using Sisbr code AI,

710
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,011
like automate coding sites,

711
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:28,620
automate code recommendations
to the developers,

712
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:33,620
accelerate the process of
onboarding of new developers

713
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,060
was another benefit,

714
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,833
saves time to deliver new features

715
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:44,700
and new solutions to our
credit unions and our members.

716
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,680
And not only save times,

717
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,450
but also improves the
quality of our solutions

718
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:55,473
and continue support throughout
the development cycle.

719
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:00,600
The second one, our Backoffice automation.

720
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,550
Nowadays we have almost
eight digital robots

721
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,500
automating manual tasks

722
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,890
and not only simple manual tasks,

723
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,710
but complex manual tasks too.

724
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,480
And it's the reason

725
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,757
that we are using generative AI

726
00:35:17,757 --> 00:35:22,757
integrated with our robots, AI agents.

727
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:29,060
And it was possible to save
almost 400,000 human hours

728
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,353
with this kind of solution.

729
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:40,190
Another interesting real use
case is our investment advisor.

730
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,120
It is a specialized support

731
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,660
for investments using generative AI

732
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,860
and it's possible to
create good recommendations

733
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,160
about investments to our investors

734
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,700
considering the member profile,

735
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,700
considering the best market practice

736
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,606
and for sure considering our products,

737
00:36:05,606 --> 00:36:09,955
investment products offered
by our credit unions

738
00:36:09,955 --> 00:36:11,970
to our members.

739
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,330
It was another very good solution

740
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:20,310
to our business every day.

741
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,200
And last but not least,

742
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,201
I would like to share about our core bank,

743
00:36:25,201 --> 00:36:30,060
smart assistant named Sisbr AI.

744
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,350
There are a lot of
features in this solution

745
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,450
and it's possible such as,

746
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,780
it's possible to interact with documents,

747
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,160
not only normal documents,
but legal documents, contracts

748
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,160
and it's possible to interact
using natural language

749
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:55,220
and get good answers using generative AI.

750
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,750
And it's possible to do intelligent search

751
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,890
and it's possible to create analysis

752
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,760
and generate automatically

753
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,970
decision, credit loan decision reports

754
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,810
using generative AI
using this solution too.

755
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,909
And finally, I would
like just to emphasize

756
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:21,880
that there are a lot of other benefits

757
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,817
and results for the business considering

758
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:29,024
these use cases using generative AI

759
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:32,700
and other use case that we have.

760
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,580
And it is a good option,

761
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:40,260
a good option for our business
using this kind of solution.

762
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,050
So thank you for your attention.

763
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,990
And Amanda, stage is yours again.

764
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,280
- Again.

765
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,510
Yeah, thank you Edson.

766
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,533
Thanks for sharing.

767
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,760
Thanks for sharing the Sicoob journey.

768
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,950
For me, it's a pleasure
to be here with Sicoob.

769
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,124
We've been working together
for the past six years

770
00:37:58,124 --> 00:37:59,455
in AWS with Sicoob.

771
00:37:59,455 --> 00:38:01,111
So it's a really nice
case. Thank you Edson.

772
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:03,810
Thanks for your presence.

773
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,810
But okay, let's dive to the
second part of the presentation.

774
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,846
So we were talking about
high regulated environments

775
00:38:08,846 --> 00:38:12,630
on top of Amazon EKS
and GPUs infrastructures

776
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,229
and now we are going to
talk about how we can build

777
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:18,180
AI agents on Amazon bedrock,

778
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,513
also covering the regulations
perspective, okay.

779
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:26,790
So let's go again in the most used slides

780
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,200
in the re:Invent.

781
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,570
So we have the, our two layer here

782
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,600
and now we are going to
talk about the middle layer.

783
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,740
So Amazon Bedrock is tool focus
on builders and developers.

784
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,440
So we are using building blocks

785
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,040
to deliver generative AI
solutions for our customers.

786
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,900
We start just, I don't know,

787
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,745
maybe in 2023 I believe
just with some models

788
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:53,250
and some endpoint for our
customers based on APIs.

789
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,224
And now there is a
fully completed solution

790
00:38:56,224 --> 00:39:00,547
that hosts models but also
covers wide array of security,

791
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,880
prompt engineering, prompt caching.

792
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,629
There's a bunch of different solutions

793
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:08,940
that you can use on top
of Amazon Bedrock, okay.

794
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,459
So we are here to talk about

795
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:12,180
high regulated environments again

796
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,280
and we start talking about ISOs

797
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,396
and I said we are going
to return on this matter

798
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,650
further on the presentation.

799
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,640
So now it's the time.

800
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,764
When we are talking about
Amazon Bedrock compliance,

801
00:39:22,764 --> 00:39:25,255
there is a bunch of different regulations

802
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,150
that we are already achievements.

803
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,490
So there is different ISOs as well.

804
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:33,240
We have SOC 1, 2, 3,
we are high PA eligible

805
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,090
and there is a different
for kinds of regulation

806
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,860
for different kinds of countries.

807
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,480
But there is one specific ISO

808
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,100
that I would like to highlight here.

809
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,490
So is the ISO 42001

810
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,610
and it is specific for
generative AI workloads.

811
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,419
And AWS with Amazon Bedrock
was the first provider

812
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:52,110
to get this iso.

813
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,360
So this is a real interesting thing

814
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,920
for when we are discussing this kind

815
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,260
of high grade environments and this ISO

816
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,780
is a really important
thing for the product,

817
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,283
for the Amazon Bedrock.

818
00:40:03,678 --> 00:40:05,400
Here.

819
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,931
But the most common question

820
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:09,930
that I receive with my customers

821
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:14,930
and even around data and AI
concerns is about the data.

822
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,590
So I would like to highlight here is that

823
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,990
customer data is not used for AWS

824
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,450
to improve any foundation models.

825
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,791
And the customer data is not shared

826
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,620
between the other customers.

827
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,420
So your data is isolated

828
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,293
and AWS doesn't use this to retrain models

829
00:40:33,293 --> 00:40:36,300
or to improve the Bedrock, okay?

830
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,995
So this is really important

831
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:40,530
when we are talking
about every environment

832
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,843
but for high regulated
environments as well.

833
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,863
Going forward,

834
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:48,630
so you can also choose which
model you would like to use.

835
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:52,290
So there's not a black box
where you have an end point

836
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,780
and then you send your
data and you don't, sorry,

837
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,450
and you don't know which
model you are using.

838
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,250
You choose the model that you wanna use.

839
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,330
You also put the correct permission

840
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,070
for your developers and builders

841
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,320
to use those models
inside of Amazon Bedrock

842
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,550
for your specific region.

843
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,882
So this is also important here, okay.

844
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:13,920
It's your choice which
model you're going to use,

845
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,990
which size of model you're going to use,

846
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,000
which region you're going to use it.

847
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,240
When you put your data in
a specific region on AWS,

848
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,850
your data remains in this specific region.

849
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,620
For some countries, like as Brazil,

850
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,880
this is really important.

851
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,250
We have some regulations around data,

852
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,091
data remains inside of Brazil.

853
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:36,060
The country of Brazil,
we cannot take this data

854
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,130
from the public sector of Brazil.

855
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,930
So this is important for our customers

856
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,303
and we'd like to highlight it here, right.

857
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,130
But you can do cross region
inferences if you want to.

858
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:52,130
So for example, you are using
Amazon Bedrock in Europe

859
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,877
and you you'd like to have
more latency for example

860
00:41:58,706 --> 00:42:01,980
for your models, you can use
different regions for this,

861
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,340
but it is your choice which
region you're going to use.

862
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,617
So for example, if you are in Europe

863
00:42:07,617 --> 00:42:10,020
and you are based on Europe AI Act,

864
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,230
you can use data inside all the Europe,

865
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,870
not only one country,
one specific country.

866
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:19,229
So you can create inference
profiles inside of Bedrock

867
00:42:19,229 --> 00:42:22,020
with specific countries
that you can use it

868
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,440
and then make cross region
inference for your data

869
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,690
based on your regulations as well.

870
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,860
So this is your choice.

871
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,755
This isn't made by
default on Amazon Bedrock,

872
00:42:31,755 --> 00:42:34,086
but you can use it to
improve the performance

873
00:42:34,086 --> 00:42:38,823
but staying in your
regulated environment, right?

874
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,430
But let's talk about Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore, all right.

875
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:48,180
So over the last year
we've seen a AI evolves

876
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,460
from assistance to agents, right.

877
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,720
So now agents is the hype of the moment.

878
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,240
The main difference here is that

879
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,370
when we are talking about agents, agents,

880
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,730
we are talking about a solution
that works autonomously.

881
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,560
So it's not task defined.

882
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,450
He can work autonomously.

883
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,540
you can create your own agents using

884
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,400
open source solutions for example.

885
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,980
And I'm gonna let
Andries talk a little bit

886
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,790
how you can do this and what
is the have lift on top of it.

887
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:22,080
But AWS understood that this
is a need from our customers

888
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,520
and that's why we deliver

889
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,650
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for the customer.

890
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,740
So if you guys doesn't know AgentCore yet,

891
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,450
you should take a look into it.

892
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,620
It's a real nice solution,
a real nice service.

893
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,150
We are probably gonna have a bunch

894
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,620
of new things in Re:invent

895
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,400
in the next month is a really new service.

896
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,410
But here, let's highlight some parts

897
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:45,780
of the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore that works

898
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,630
for high regulated environments
and that can help you

899
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:52,110
to stay within your regulations, okay.

900
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,120
So we have AgentCore runtime.

901
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,900
So you can run and host
your agent's purpose built.

902
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,340
It's serverless.

903
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,260
It's totally serverless, totally.

904
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,430
You don't need to deploy any
infrastructure inside of AWS

905
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,530
but each session of your agent.

906
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:10,467
So you defining some tasks for customers,

907
00:44:10,467 --> 00:44:12,030
specific customers.

908
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:14,880
So for example, in financial
sector, you have a customer

909
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,660
that is running one solution
inside of the internet banking,

910
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,410
you can make each session
isolated from one to another.

911
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,530
This is really important
for regulated environments.

912
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,608
And Amazon AgentCore does this by default

913
00:44:27,608 --> 00:44:30,059
when you are using AgentCore runtime.

914
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:32,083
So this is important,

915
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:34,257
one interesting solution on AgentCore

916
00:44:34,257 --> 00:44:36,333
for high regulated environments.

917
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,510
The other one is AgentCore identity.

918
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,546
So it helps you to maintain,
secure your authorization,

919
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:46,080
authentication and
credentials for the customers.

920
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,600
So it's by the default you can put

921
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,430
the credentials for the customer

922
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:54,279
or in any kind of authentication
flow inside of AgentCore

923
00:44:54,279 --> 00:44:56,947
and he will remains isolated

924
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:59,288
and can keeps this secure for you.

925
00:44:59,288 --> 00:45:01,920
So it also helps when you are deploying,

926
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,403
developing your own agents on AWS.

927
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:07,463
Okay.

928
00:45:07,463 --> 00:45:09,416
We also have sandbox environments

929
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:12,660
for code interpreter and browser tools.

930
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,470
You can also does this inside of AgentCore

931
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,450
without needing to developing anything

932
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,722
or deploying anything.

933
00:45:19,722 --> 00:45:24,180
It's a solution, a service
that is inside of AgentCore

934
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,890
and you can just arrange which kind

935
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,134
of code interpreter you wanna use

936
00:45:27,134 --> 00:45:29,610
or which kind of browser tool you wanna do

937
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:32,429
inside of the whole mechanism of Bedrock

938
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:36,180
with security, with
authentication inside of AWS.

939
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,900
So there's a bunch of other
solutions in AgentCore,

940
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,194
but I would like to highlight this three

941
00:45:41,194 --> 00:45:44,280
because it's for the high
regulated environments,

942
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,813
Could be used for you guys
develop your agents on AWS, okay.

943
00:45:50,325 --> 00:45:54,030
So going forward, when we
are talking about LLM models,

944
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:57,886
there's also a discussion
around which data was used

945
00:45:57,886 --> 00:46:00,126
by this model to train.

946
00:46:00,126 --> 00:46:03,600
How can I know if this
data has bias or not?

947
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:08,032
If it follows what I believe
it's correct for my company.

948
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:11,520
I would like to highlight here
the anthropic system cards.

949
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,740
So I dunno if you guys have heard of it.

950
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,270
You should read.

951
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,350
It's a really interesting
reading of 140 pages probably,

952
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:20,550
but you can read it.

953
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,400
It's really interesting and
explains how it was trained

954
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,670
and why is this trustworthy, okay.

955
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:28,813
So Anthropic is doing a real good job

956
00:46:28,813 --> 00:46:33,192
inside of the transparency of
how they train their models

957
00:46:33,192 --> 00:46:35,823
and which kind of data they are using.

958
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:40,530
We also have AWS
scorecards for Amazon Nova.

959
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,370
So you can see this on the
documentation of the Bedrock

960
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:45,870
and the Nova model

961
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,330
and there's also a bunch
of information over there

962
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:49,620
of how they were trained

963
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,450
and which kind of data they are using

964
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,570
and what AI responsible that
we were talking earlier.

965
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:57,600
That's also described for Amazon Nova

966
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,500
in this service cards, okay.

967
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,950
But even when we are talking
about all these different

968
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:10,440
perspectives of AI of regulated AI,

969
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,100
LLM models are a non-deterministic
technology, okay.

970
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:18,240
So you can also use guard
rails from Amazon Bedrock

971
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,130
to stay within what you believe

972
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,980
is the correct answer for
your end users, all right.

973
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,940
So don't believe that
the models will always

974
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,140
write the same thing.

975
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,130
He won't.

976
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:32,595
You should be able to prepare
to define your architecture

977
00:47:32,595 --> 00:47:35,190
on top of this using solutions

978
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:38,430
such as guardrails should
stay within what is correct

979
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,950
for your end user when you are using

980
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:42,750
LLM solutions for end users.

981
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,550
This is really important, okay?

982
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:48,680
So you can also be aware of what the model

983
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,920
is going to respond and
also prepare for those

984
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,010
malicious user that we were
discussing with OWASP 10,

985
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:59,376
for example, the different
kind of users for Gen AI

986
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,750
for cyber attacks.

987
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,850
You can also use AWS guardrails

988
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:07,293
to help you with this
kind of issues, okay.

989
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,680
Sorry.

990
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,670
All right.

991
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:14,206
So now I will ask for
Andries to join me here.

992
00:48:14,206 --> 00:48:16,620
He will explain how Holland Casino

993
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,080
is building their agents on AWS.

994
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,580
Andries please.

995
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,580
- Thank you, Amanda.

996
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,290
We are running about five minutes late

997
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:28,957
but I'll share very useful
tips at the end so please stay.

998
00:48:28,957 --> 00:48:30,573
They are very important.

999
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,810
My name is Andries Krijtenburg

1000
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,303
and I do indeed work for Holland Casino.

1001
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:38,820
It might surprise you,

1002
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,680
but Holland Casino was started

1003
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,830
by the Dutch government about 50 years ago

1004
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,090
with a clear mandate to offer

1005
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:47,700
a safe environment for players.

1006
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,400
Currently we run 13 casinos in Holland

1007
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,723
and one online casino.

1008
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:55,410
We operate under a very
strict gaming oversight

1009
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,660
through the Dutch Gaming Authorities

1010
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,120
that centers around player safety

1011
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,463
and detection of fraud
and money laundering.

1012
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,840
Now the stakes for us
are very high, right?

1013
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,940
If you fail to meet these regulations,

1014
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,410
casinos will close until
compliancy has been restored.

1015
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,570
We will suffer reputational damage.

1016
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,610
We have a very strong brand name

1017
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:19,293
even by people that do not play.

1018
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,710
Financial penalties,
they are seriously high.

1019
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,570
It's more than a headache

1020
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,613
and we face possible license suspension.

1021
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:29,970
So apart from meeting these regulations,

1022
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,740
we have other problems as well.

1023
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,839
You see, regulations are subject

1024
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,270
to political decision making,

1025
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:40,260
changed frequent, sudden
and with fixed deadlines.

1026
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,940
Sometimes we have three months,

1027
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,773
a month even to change things.

1028
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:47,250
Now the casino depends on
third party applications

1029
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,820
for gaming concepts, gaming
machines, jackpot concepts,

1030
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,710
casino management systems.

1031
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:55,830
And the problem is that
these third parties

1032
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:58,533
cannot move fast enough
as we like them to.

1033
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,921
So we, Holland Casino,
need to have an environment

1034
00:50:01,921 --> 00:50:06,240
where we are in control and
have rapid response capabilities

1035
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,570
and that's where we
ended up in Amazon Cloud.

1036
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:12,600
In Amazon Cloud we build
our regulatory flows,

1037
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:17,010
our regulatory reports and
the regulatory alerting.

1038
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:19,470
And we do this since 2017.

1039
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,700
And we do this with a very group

1040
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,830
of very talented colleagues of mine from

1041
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,686
not only technical people
like testers and developers,

1042
00:50:24,686 --> 00:50:29,340
but everybody like architects,
product owners, IT managers.

1043
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:32,490
And we are assisted by
colleagues from Easytocloud.

1044
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:35,449
Now over the years, as
a team, we really have

1045
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,950
to come understand Amazon Cloud very well

1046
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:41,520
to implement our regulatory use cases.

1047
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,693
It's a growth period.

1048
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,800
Now our success in internal believe in AWS

1049
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,400
has seen us grown in Amazon
Cloud with more workloads.

1050
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,490
So now we host our central
casino management system,

1051
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,480
business intelligence, data
analysis using SageMaker

1052
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,120
and even our legacy enterprise bus

1053
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,483
we host in the cloud on EC2
because of its stability.

1054
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,370
Now why am I telling you this?

1055
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,990
You see, well our business culture

1056
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:12,270
and maybe many of yours as well,

1057
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:15,360
is to start small with an architecture,

1058
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,580
gain confidence with it,

1059
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:21,873
and then build the capacity to
execute regulatory use cases.

1060
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,020
And this is exactly what we wanna do

1061
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,420
with our AI architecture.

1062
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,220
We wanna start small,

1063
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,780
gain company-wide confidence
in the technology and then grow

1064
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,510
and eventually have agents assist us

1065
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,343
with regulatory use cases.

1066
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:42,930
So briefly, our journey so far in Gen AI.

1067
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:45,420
About a year ago we started
using code generation

1068
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,393
with the Anthropic models in Bedrock.

1069
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,183
Then we looked at Bedrock agents.

1070
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:56,670
In Q2, Q3, we started
looking at Strands Agents

1071
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:59,220
and those, we really liked
because they're really simple

1072
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,380
and they show you laser on.

1073
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,572
Then we started evaluating
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

1074
00:52:03,572 --> 00:52:06,120
to host these agents on.

1075
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,470
I'll show you that as well.

1076
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:09,600
AgentCore just came out of preview

1077
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,250
and we are right now busy
putting them in production.

1078
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,650
So we've been looking for a
small but important use case

1079
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:19,560
and we found this in what we
call the management inside gap.

1080
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,940
You see, management is always a need

1081
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,033
for cost, security and
compliance oversight.

1082
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,260
They will not log into the
Amazon console to get the data.

1083
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,993
It is not the right tool for them, right?

1084
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,890
So management, stakeholders,

1085
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:37,350
especially the security
department came to us,

1086
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,790
the internal team, my team,

1087
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,770
to provide 'em with ad hoc reports.

1088
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:44,430
And we created many Python
script to provide these reports

1089
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:46,440
and this creates an unnecessary dependency

1090
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,510
and it does not scale.

1091
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:52,320
Now, the scripts that we write
for these ad hoc reports,

1092
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,970
they come back later when we talk

1093
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,290
briefly about Strands Agents.

1094
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:56,890
So keep them in mind, all right?

1095
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,430
So as a first use case,

1096
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:01,560
we give management and stakeholder agents

1097
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,420
that give them information they need

1098
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,790
on a self-service basis.

1099
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,370
And because we start off,
these are single agents

1100
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:12,120
not yet busy with orchestration, yeah.

1101
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:15,930
These agents centers around
costs, security and operations

1102
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,490
and they can have a dialogue with them.

1103
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:18,993
That is very important, right?

1104
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:22,830
We use Strands Agents, why?

1105
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:25,630
They're very simple and I'll
show you in the next slide.

1106
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:30,150
They compact with tools
that you could use,

1107
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:32,880
but it is very easy to
integrate your own tools

1108
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,560
and your MCP servers.

1109
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,860
It is Python based, we're a
Python shop, so it's easy for us

1110
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,810
and it is open source so you
know exactly what is going on.

1111
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,363
And this is a Strands Agent, yeah.

1112
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,363
In the middle I declare my agent,

1113
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,550
I give the model, in
this case a Bedrock model

1114
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:58,440
and sonnet 4.5 and I
give it a system prompt.

1115
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,080
Normally we craft a system
prompt. It's quite long.

1116
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,650
We spend quite a lot of time
creating our system prompts.

1117
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:08,010
But for space purposes,
I redacted it here.

1118
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,800
And then they give it a tool,
in this case a billing tool.

1119
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,470
Now remember, the scripts I
was talking about earlier on

1120
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,263
these ad hoc scripts, it turns
out that this is fairly easy

1121
00:54:17,263 --> 00:54:20,880
to transform them into
tools for your agents.

1122
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,820
So don't throw the scripts away, right?

1123
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,820
Just make sure that you write
your system specification

1124
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,187
or your tool specification really well.

1125
00:54:28,187 --> 00:54:30,963
That is really, really important.

1126
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:35,430
Now I had an ad hoc report for billing

1127
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,970
and I transformed it into IT
tool for my Strands Agents.

1128
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:40,644
And once I've set it up,
I can invoke my agent.

1129
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:41,910
I can say like,

1130
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:44,360
well, what are my costs
so far this month, right?

1131
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:46,790
And then it gives an answer.

1132
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,610
And if you use sessions
IDs, you can delve into it,

1133
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:51,450
you can have a dialogue.

1134
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,760
You can ask like, well,
what were my costs?

1135
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,920
What was it compared to last month?

1136
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,470
Or I can delve into a service.
So you have a dialogue.

1137
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:00,970
And this is what we want
to give our stakeholders.

1138
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,353
Okay.

1139
00:55:03,353 --> 00:55:06,120
You got your Strands Agent,
it works on my machine

1140
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,380
and I can guarantee you it works

1141
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,210
on every one of yours machine.

1142
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:10,410
It's easy.

1143
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:13,833
However, we need to give it
to our stakeholders, right?

1144
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:17,400
So we need to host it in Amazon Cloud.

1145
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,530
We want it to scale,
we want it serverless,

1146
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:21,510
we need to stream the responses,

1147
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:23,370
and security is a non-negotiable.

1148
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:24,420
So how do we do that?

1149
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:26,853
So we take our agent,

1150
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,530
we wrap it in fast API for streaming,

1151
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,750
you package it in the Python project,

1152
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,510
create your docker
files, your Lambda stack,

1153
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:39,660
you build it for authentication
and authorization,

1154
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,380
you make sure it versions very
well and then you deploy it.

1155
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,560
And this will work. I've
done it, we've done it.

1156
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,110
And if you wanna go this route,

1157
00:55:49,155 --> 00:55:49,988
you are fine.

1158
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:52,770
However, if you say to me like,

1159
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,760
Andries, that is a lot of boilerplate code

1160
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,990
for a simple Strands Agent.

1161
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:59,490
Is there another way?

1162
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:03,030
Yes, there is, Bedrock AgentCore.

1163
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,880
If you look at the right
hand side of the slide

1164
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,590
in its simplest form, what you can do,

1165
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:11,640
you can bring your agent
into the AgentCore run time

1166
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:16,230
by wrapping it into an
Invoke Python method.

1167
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,460
And your decorated method

1168
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,640
with an app.entrypoint decorator.

1169
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,770
You test locally as you normally would.

1170
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:25,500
And some point you say,
AgentCore configure

1171
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,790
on the command line.

1172
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:29,580
And this builds all the boilerplate code

1173
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,103
I just talked about in the previous slide.

1174
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:34,328
Once you're happy with that,

1175
00:56:34,328 --> 00:56:37,278
you say AgentCore launch and
it launches it into production

1176
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,320
into your Amazon environment.

1177
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,960
So it's very easy for CICD integration,

1178
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,393
even more brilliant for rapid prototyping.

1179
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,910
If you go this route, you benefit

1180
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:51,750
from all the other AgentCore
services that it offers

1181
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,583
that Amanda spoke about earlier on.

1182
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:57,540
So how does the architecture look like?

1183
00:56:58,410 --> 00:56:59,580
Simple.

1184
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:03,843
We take the services as native
as possible, no magic sauce.

1185
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,050
So in the middle here we
have our AgentCore agents.

1186
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,570
They have access to
foundation models, guardrails,

1187
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:12,150
memories, knowledge basis.

1188
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:14,460
We use knowledge basis, RAGs as a service,

1189
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,840
a better knowledge basis

1190
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,263
to obtain our regulatory
information tools.

1191
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,230
And then we've got two sets of apps

1192
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,360
because in-house apps we develop ourselves

1193
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,310
and third party apps.

1194
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,930
The in-house apps we
host in Amplify Hosting

1195
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,153
with Cognito User Pools,
federated to active directory,

1196
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,610
Cognito Identity Pools.

1197
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:39,180
We obtain temporary SDS access keys

1198
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,910
and this gives you direct
access to the Amazon APIs.

1199
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:43,680
In this case, InvokeAgent.

1200
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,720
That is really powerful.

1201
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,275
Third party applications that
do not have the capability

1202
00:57:48,275 --> 00:57:50,610
to access SDS tokens,

1203
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:52,860
we just put an API gateway in between.

1204
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:55,563
It's a bit more effort but
well worth the compromise.

1205
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,870
If you look at the overall
picture on how we do this,

1206
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:04,727
we basically has host our AI
architecture in two accounts

1207
00:58:04,727 --> 00:58:07,530
in pre-production and production.

1208
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,035
Not different than any other application

1209
00:58:09,035 --> 00:58:11,013
we host in our environment.

1210
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,460
And it is surrounded by what we normal,

1211
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,920
in our normal multi account architecture

1212
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,530
that takes care of security, compliance,

1213
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:20,913
monitoring and networking.

1214
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:27,243
Okay, my last slide and
hand back over to Amanda.

1215
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,660
The lessons we learned in this path

1216
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,277
of Gen AI in Holland Casino is that

1217
00:58:32,277 --> 00:58:36,420
AWS democratizes the use of Gen AI.

1218
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,731
You do not have to study
four years at a university

1219
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:44,370
in order to create well-crafted, stable

1220
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:48,360
and scalable AI architectures.

1221
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,240
So you can keep your DevOp methods,

1222
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,510
you can keep on investing in
your current AWS knowledge,

1223
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:57,630
especially Bedrock and Bedrock AgentCore.

1224
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:58,860
Now this is important.

1225
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,860
These are the tips I was speaking about.

1226
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:05,193
That's why we place it
also in the box, right?

1227
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:09,990
Expect non-deterministic
behavior of your agents

1228
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:11,730
and mitigate the risks.

1229
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,743
And here are some of our tips.

1230
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:17,460
Fine tune your system
prompt of your agent.

1231
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,500
Really important.

1232
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,190
Give very clear instructions,
give the dos and the don'ts

1233
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,230
and give a very clear output format.

1234
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,420
That is really important.

1235
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,673
You combine this with Bedrock guardrails.

1236
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:33,069
Then agents must focus on one thing

1237
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,683
and do this very well.

1238
00:59:36,069 --> 00:59:38,269
I had my first agent, I got very excited.

1239
00:59:38,269 --> 00:59:41,070
I uploaded all the tools that I had.

1240
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:43,590
So one agent to rule them all.

1241
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:45,540
The agent did not perform.

1242
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,500
Why?

1243
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,600
Because my tool specs
were not really specific

1244
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:51,990
and the model struggled

1245
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:55,290
to select the right correct tool, right?

1246
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:57,600
So make sure that if you
need your lot of tools,

1247
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,660
make sure that you're very
clear in tool specification.

1248
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,190
Make sure you're very,

1249
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:05,010
that the tool specification
don't overlap with each other

1250
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,210
so that the model can
select the right tool.

1251
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,833
If you set up knowledge basis,

1252
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,584
what you must do is you must
invest in very realistic

1253
01:00:15,584 --> 01:00:19,650
evaluation jobs and you can
use Bedrock for that as well.

1254
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,303
They give you very nice metrics.

1255
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:24,660
Especially if your
knowledge base is in flux

1256
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,700
when the data changes all the time

1257
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,190
or where your agents start
using different models,

1258
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:32,460
you need to rerun your evaluation jobs.

1259
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,293
And the last one,

1260
01:00:33,293 --> 01:00:35,130
and that one is very
simple, but very important,

1261
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:39,510
make sure that your end
users have a very easy way

1262
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,333
of giving your feedback of
your agents in production.

1263
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,540
Thank you. That's it for me.

1264
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,240
I'll hand you back over to Amanda.

1265
01:00:49,348 --> 01:00:50,439
- Thank you, Andries.

1266
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,272
Thank you Andries.

1267
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:53,280
Thanks for sharing the Holland Casino.

1268
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,918
So all right, guys.

1269
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:56,100
Some final thoughts

1270
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,350
and thank you guys for staying by the end.

1271
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,733
It's a lot of content here.

1272
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,219
In summary, we can use AI

1273
01:01:02,219 --> 01:01:04,785
to accelerate regulatory compliances.

1274
01:01:04,785 --> 01:01:06,810
Sicoob demonstrated how we can do this

1275
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:09,360
on top of infrastructure using EKS

1276
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,640
and Holland Casino with
Andries showed this,

1277
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,000
how they develop this
using Strand Agents, okay.

1278
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,520
So there is a bunch of
different paths to follow,

1279
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,030
but you can achieve your regulatory needs

1280
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:24,243
using generative AI on AWS, all right.

1281
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:27,480
Where do I start? That depends.

1282
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:32,100
That's the architecture
answer for all the questions.

1283
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,260
You can start with a compliant foundation.

1284
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:38,160
So you need to have a
standardized foundation

1285
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,190
for run your workloads on AWS,

1286
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:43,590
select your models as we discussed here.

1287
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:47,040
Build your agents the way
that works better for you

1288
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,010
and then deploy it in production in AWS

1289
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:53,190
with your regulatory needs.

1290
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,330
Okay.

1291
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:55,710
Here's some resources.

1292
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:57,990
So this is the first day of the event.

1293
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:59,456
I hope you guys are enjoying the event.

1294
01:01:59,456 --> 01:02:01,789
There's some resources here
from the both perspective

1295
01:02:01,789 --> 01:02:04,402
that we discussed, both
with free infrastructures

1296
01:02:04,402 --> 01:02:07,530
and with Amazon Bedrock.

1297
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:10,530
We are waiting for you
guys to take the photo.

1298
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:11,363
Okay.

1299
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,980
Some sessions to watch at re:Invent.

1300
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,200
So saying again, this is
the first day of the event,

1301
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,570
so we're gonna have a lot
of different contents here

1302
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:21,210
with our colleagues from AWS.

1303
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:24,150
You can take the pictures too. Okay.

1304
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,740
Thank you all. Thank you for joining us.

1305
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:27,750
Thank you for watching,
Staying by the end.

1306
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,139
And I would like to also ask for you guys

1307
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:31,800
to go into the app

1308
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,465
and say if you like the
presentation or don't.

1309
01:02:34,465 --> 01:02:35,755
If you have any questions,

1310
01:02:35,755 --> 01:02:38,670
we'll be outside of this
stage from, I don't know,

1311
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:40,560
maybe five or 10 minutes, okay.

1312
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,331
Thank you, guys, and have a great event.

1313
01:02:42,331 --> 01:02:43,289
(audience applauding)
