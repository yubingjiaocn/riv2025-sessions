1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
- Good evening everyone and
thank you for joining us.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,280
Whether you're here in person

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,523
or joining us virtually,
we're excited to have you.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,370
My name is Andrei Okhotnikov

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,990
and I lead product management

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,530
for AWS Marketplace
deployments experience,

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,350
which includes the fast growing category

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,420
of AI agents and tools.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,240
And I have two amazing
co-presenters with me today.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,130
Salman Tahir and he is
the global AI partner lead

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,350
who's working closely
with many of the partners

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,790
who are building the next
generation of AI agents and tools.

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,290
And we have a special
guest today, Mira Rajaram

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,013
head of AI core services
at Workday Planning,

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,360
who's bringing the practitioner experience

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,933
of building and
operationalizing AI agents.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,580
We're excited to take you
through today's session,

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,040
build agentic workflows on AWS

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,370
with third party agents and tools.

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,760
Before we dive in, let's
do a little warmup.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,203
Please raise your hands if
you have built an AI agent.

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,893
Nice.

23
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:13,726
Please keep them up.

24
00:01:13,726 --> 00:01:14,559
I see a few.

25
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:15,630
Keep them up, keep them up.

26
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,159
Keep them up if you have more than

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,493
five AI agents running in
production in your organization.

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,993
Nice.

29
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:28,653
I see a few hands, more than 10?

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,230
Okay, less hands but still we got a few.

31
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,063
Cool.

32
00:01:35,063 --> 00:01:38,331
So the goal of today's
session is to show you

33
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,350
how AWS

34
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,040
and the partner ecosystem
give you a strong foundation

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,413
for building agentic solutions.

36
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,140
By the end of the session,

37
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,530
we want to make sure you
get the strong understanding

38
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,760
of all the foundation

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,900
and actually get ready to put
your hands on the keyboard

40
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,350
and get started building
the agentic workflows.

41
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,390
So here's the plan for
the next 60 minutes.

42
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,980
We'll start with the basics,

43
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,070
the overview of AWS agentic stack,

44
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,110
which includes the core services,

45
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,120
some of the architecture principles,

46
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,090
and the recommendations
which we have collected

47
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,140
from our customers who are building

48
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,813
agent applications right now.

49
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,580
After that I'll give a quick
overview of AWS Marketplace

50
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,170
and how AI agents

51
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,310
and tools from third party
vendors can help you building

52
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,870
agentic applications

53
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,120
and specifically how you can use them

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,150
in the new set of agentic services

55
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,620
on AWS in AgentCore runtime
and AgentCore gateway.

56
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,447
After that I'll pass
Mira to walk us through

57
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:47,160
Workday's example of
building the planning agents.

58
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,640
So you'll hear some inside
stories of what's going well,

59
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,203
what's not going well of
building and operationalizing AI.

60
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,120
Next Salman will walk us
through a hands-on experience

61
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,900
of building an agentic workflow
using third party tools.

62
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,840
So you'll see how to get started from zero

63
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,670
to a ready to go agent and
we'll wrap up this presentation

64
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,340
with the demo of a prebuilt agent

65
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,110
which you can get from Marketplace

66
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,630
and which you can deploy in a few minutes.

67
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,763
So let's get started.

68
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,870
- Fantastic, thank you so much Andrei.

69
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,310
Hi everyone.

70
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,900
So agents, when we talk
about agents, it's important

71
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,250
to acknowledge their agency,
they need to be able to act

72
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,063
and with AI there are two additional

73
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:39,660
attributes that are important.

74
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,840
They need to be able
to take on instructions

75
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,780
and form a goal and an objective

76
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,330
that they would be able to achieve.

77
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,240
And then the second one is that
we should be able to reason

78
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,970
and plan in order to be
able to take advantage

79
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,980
of those tools that are available.

80
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,630
So agency is super important

81
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,710
and with AI it's able to
capture a high level goal

82
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,570
and it's able to reason

83
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,450
and plan in order to invoke
the right tools in order

84
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,730
to serve the outcome to the user.

85
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,470
And today we'll see that, you
know, not only we'll see it,

86
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,570
we'll hear about these
experiences that we've had with

87
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,730
AgentCore and building agents

88
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,030
and Mira's gonna be
talking about it later on.

89
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,970
So it's very much an evolution.

90
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,970
We've had RPA bots in the past
where for static workflows

91
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,680
we've been able to bring automation

92
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,760
over time That's evolved
into cognitive automation,

93
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,560
enhanced workflows with ML
capabilities and AI capabilities

94
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,260
and generative AI assistance came about

95
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,570
where we were forming these prompts

96
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,020
and queries, sending them
over to a foundation model,

97
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,270
getting a response back.

98
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,550
But now with agents as I highlighted,

99
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,370
they can really do a reasoning, planning

100
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,830
and they can form that collaboration

101
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,150
where they can take on an
objective more than just a task,

102
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,300
fulfill that objective and
return a response to us.

103
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,930
And over time we're gonna
see fully autonomous systems.

104
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,400
So there's a maturity curve
shifting from low agency

105
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,010
to higher agency bot agents

106
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,960
and the role of a human from, you know,

107
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,640
actually doing the work in the past

108
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,403
is shifting over to more of an oversight.

109
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,600
Now in AWS there are three areas

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,550
that we're deeply focused on.

111
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,070
First one, choice,

112
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,130
bringing the latest market
leading capabilities

113
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,970
to our customers and partners
so they can freely innovate,

114
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,970
innovate fast, realize ROI
and value quickly is important

115
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,510
and then move in, move along
with the latest capabilities

116
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,300
that come within the market landscape.

117
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,250
Second one, trust.

118
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,380
AI has been probabilistic

119
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,170
it will likely remain probabilistic.

120
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,340
So it's important to be
able to control, govern,

121
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,250
establish guardrails and compliance

122
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,233
for using these agents production.

123
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,530
And the third one is around scale,

124
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,037
because whilst the key
component of these LLMs

125
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:16,380
and so the tools are fundamental,

126
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,700
the end-to-end solution
compromise of multiple components

127
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,210
and having enterprise grade capabilities

128
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,360
that would allow you to quickly innovate,

129
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,550
move those into production

130
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,340
and then scale that
production as your demand

131
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,620
and adoption grows is super important.

132
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,900
And that's what we bring from AWS.

133
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,960
I'm gonna briefly touch
upon each one of these

134
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,630
firstly around choice.

135
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,340
So with choice, the
ability to buy or build

136
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,620
or partner depending on the use case,

137
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,010
depending on your strategy,
is extremely important.

138
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:57,210
So at the top you see some of
our AWS native capabilities

139
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,680
with quick suite and
third party capabilities

140
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,380
that Andra is gonna be talking
about from Marketplace.

141
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,470
In the second layer you have
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

142
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,200
as well as Strands agents as a framework

143
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,140
where you can build any custom agentic

144
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,060
solution of your choice.

145
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,700
And this is where you know if
your use case in particular

146
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,100
does not fit one of those
out of the box models,

147
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,350
we see that the ability to be able

148
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,903
to build your custom agent is important.

149
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,720
Lastly, bringing partners
who have the expertise

150
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,243
and experience within AWS

151
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:41,340
with the AWS Generative
AI Innovation Center,

152
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,120
but also our partners
professional services is important

153
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,190
and that's an area where you can partner

154
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,900
in order to build those solutions.

155
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,400
Take advantage of the lessons learned

156
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,840
and the best practices

157
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,870
that has been accumulated over many runs

158
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,583
and many build scenarios.

159
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,540
And in this context, we're
providing the capability

160
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,480
that would be able to work with any models

161
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,670
and any frameworks and
that's a flexibility

162
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,920
and the choice that
would speak to our value.

163
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,410
Now in terms of trust,
security, governance, audit,

164
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,390
I wanna highlight three points here.

165
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,180
The first one around transparency
is extremely important

166
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,180
to acknowledge what are the
models that are available,

167
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,810
how services are developed,
what are the intended use cases?

168
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,840
In fact, we started this
with our AI services

169
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,370
where we had AI service cards

170
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,960
and we've now extended those

171
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,270
into our agentic AI capabilities

172
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,400
where we talk about how
they've been trained,

173
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,380
what type of data it's been used,

174
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,000
what are the intended applications,

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,530
how do they fare against bias,
transparency, explainability,

176
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,770
extremely important when
you consider responsible ai,

177
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,710
as well as providing IP identification

178
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,273
for Amazon NOVA models.

179
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,770
In the second part it's
around having control.

180
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,470
Now this is a shared responsibility model.

181
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,110
We're working closely with
model providers around

182
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,320
how to make the models themselves safe,

183
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,390
but also we need to have
the right guardrails

184
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,770
around the models

185
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,890
and this is where Bedrock
Guardrails comes into play.

186
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,740
In order to be able to
help you govern those

187
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,270
for specific applications,

188
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,850
make sure that you control the ingress

189
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,493
as well as the egress of those LLM models.

190
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,410
Lastly, when it comes
to audit, data lineage,

191
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,220
observing what's happening
across the agent runs,

192
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,920
this is where I'll talk about
AgentCore observability,

193
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,326
but also our services such as CloudTrail

194
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:38,403
and CloudWatch have been there
in order to support that.

195
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,550
Now I talked about AgentCore,

196
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,220
I want to, you know, double
click on it slightly more.

197
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,220
There are three key areas with AgentCore.

198
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,670
We talked about agents having agency,

199
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,690
that's the first part.

200
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,290
It's around having tools and
memory to be able to realize

201
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,380
what is the session information,
what is the short term

202
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,370
as well as the long term so
that each time an agent is run,

203
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,070
it's able to learn from its experiences,

204
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,920
take those information
into account as memory

205
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,270
and enhance its output, but
also having access to tools.

206
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,020
And here I've highlighted two
of our native capabilities,

207
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,470
the code interpreter where
you can basically sort of

208
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,780
generate code but also securely

209
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,880
within a sandbox
environment, test that code

210
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,880
and run the code as well as browse tool

211
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,430
that would allow your agent to browse

212
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,073
and utilize a browser much
like a human would do.

213
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,880
In the second part it's
around deploying these

214
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,010
securely at scale.

215
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,180
So runtime and identity, which
I'll cover in the next slide,

216
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,880
are the key services in this area.

217
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,580
Lastly, but not least, it's important

218
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,700
to have view on the whole end-to-end

219
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,290
execution of these agents.

220
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,840
That's where AgentCore
observability comes into it.

221
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,520
So briefly, when it comes
to deploying these securely,

222
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,280
we have AgentCore runtime
which would allow you

223
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,200
to containerize your code
deployed into a cloud environment

224
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,820
within a customer VPC
securely and operate that.

225
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,590
So that's extremely important

226
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,590
to allow customers leverage
the IP of a partner per se

227
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,520
and run it within their own environment

228
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,880
and have guarantees around
what data can go outside

229
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,990
and what data can stay

230
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,090
within their own customer VPC environment.

231
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,790
AgentCore identity in particular

232
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,690
addresses one of the key
challenges that is access control.

233
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,530
Access control for the
user who's using the agent

234
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,870
because based on your
credentials you would have access

235
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,060
to certain resources and information

236
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,720
and every one of us would have
a different level of access

237
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,960
but also access control
for the agent itself

238
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,203
as it tries to access
resources across systems.

239
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,190
When it comes to tools and memory,

240
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,720
we have AgentCore Gateway
that would provide access

241
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,320
to a list of tools and
capabilities that are available

242
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,633
for the agent to be able
to take advantage of.

243
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:11,880
AgentCore memory would allow
you to, as we talked about,

244
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,140
improve your run based on taking account

245
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,110
of the shared context
between different agents

246
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,443
across sessions, be it
short term or long term.

247
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,090
And the last two I talked
about these from a browser

248
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,090
and code interpreter capabilities

249
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,010
and later on we'll see a demo

250
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,140
where we're actually
using a third party tool.

251
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,953
So these two are the native
tools provided by AWS.

252
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,840
Lastly, when it comes to
AgentCore observability,

253
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,430
we have integrations with
standard models such as OTel

254
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,636
and we are bringing that
data into CloudWatch

255
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:54,720
and CloudTrail so that users
can inspect agent runs,

256
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,170
perhaps diagnose any kind
of root cause of issues,

257
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,150
understand why certain patterns

258
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,240
and why certain traces were executed

259
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,590
and improve that over time.

260
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,620
With that said, I'm
gonna hand over to Andrei

261
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,510
to talk about Marketplace.

262
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,343
There you go.

263
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:11,176
- Thanks Salman.

264
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,290
So when we talk about
agents, they by default

265
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,060
consist of multiple components

266
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,750
including the LLMs in
many cases the tools,

267
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,670
the knowledge bases.

268
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,790
And one of the key challenges that I hear

269
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,860
from customers building or
experimenting with Agenda AI

270
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,480
is not how to build the agent,

271
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,350
but it is how to get access to
all the tools that they need.

272
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,620
Think of the new vendor
onboarding, security reviews,

273
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,490
legal reviews, payments set up,
all that can take from weeks

274
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,000
to months, slowing down
innovation and adoption.

275
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,240
And AWS Marketplace remove that friction.

276
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,230
Marketplace is an
enterprise-ready digital catalog

277
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,390
of software services and data.

278
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,450
And now also AI agents and tools.

279
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,528
For the developers who
are building agentic AI

280
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:07,380
Marketplace brings three key benefits.

281
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,060
The first one, the procurement
time drops from months

282
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,070
to days or minutes.

283
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,498
If Marketplace is already
configured in your organization,

284
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:20,100
Your developers can go to Marketplace,

285
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,700
find a tool they need and
subscribe in a single click

286
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,900
with the full transparency

287
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,840
about the pricing contractual terms.

288
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,950
So that's a big advantage
for the getting started time.

289
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,040
The second benefit is the unified billing

290
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,833
and the cost control transparency.

291
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,830
All the spend through AWS Marketplace

292
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,620
goes through your AWS
bill so your developers

293
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,570
don't need to put their own credit card

294
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,229
and do the expense reports for any tools

295
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:50,490
that they're experimenting with.

296
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,550
But in to that Marketplace integrates

297
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,903
with AWS cost tools such as budgets

298
00:14:56,903 --> 00:14:58,620
and the cost explorers.

299
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,590
So you could set up
the certain spend goals

300
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,440
and have full transparency
on who's spending

301
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,590
and what they're spending
building agentic AI.

302
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,440
And finally that's the
actual developer experience.

303
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,903
It's a simplicity of deployment.

304
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,760
Marketplace products natively
integrates with AWS services.

305
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,097
So in a single click
you can deploy an agent

306
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:22,050
on AgentCore runtime.

307
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,013
I'll show you that in a later
part of my presentation.

308
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,850
So when a developer wants to
start with building an AI agent

309
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,890
or exploring a tool, evaluating a tool,

310
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,373
they can get started in
Marketplace with just a few clicks,

311
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,500
making it a one stop shop
for AI agents and tools.

312
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,970
We launched this category
just a few months ago in July

313
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,820
and it's been growing very fast.

314
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,990
Right now we have over 2300 agents, tools

315
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,110
and agentic applications
including professional services

316
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,583
from our partners.

317
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,040
They fall into different categories.

318
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,783
So let me break this down for you.

319
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,120
On the right hand of the slides

320
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,330
are the API based agents and tools,

321
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,780
those are the remote tools ISV hosted.

322
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,950
So for example, Tavily search
tool, you'll see it later

323
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,610
in Salman's section of the presentation.

324
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,250
From the developer standpoint,

325
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,770
they act as external targets.

326
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,870
So developers go to Marketplace,

327
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,880
they subscribe in a single click

328
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,450
and they can also in a single
click import those tools

329
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,410
into AgentCore Gateway as external targets

330
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,410
and then they can use or reuse those tools

331
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,690
in multiple agents for different kind

332
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,060
of applications they're building.

333
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,310
And then what's great is the automation

334
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:55,020
'cause AgentCore Gateway
automatically pulls down

335
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,080
all the metadata, the API, schema

336
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,080
and actions also we automate
the API key rotation

337
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,250
and give the full transparency

338
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,530
into what's happening with those tools.

339
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,490
So no manual wiring,
no schema translation,

340
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,940
gateway handles, all of that.

341
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,370
The second category on the
left portion of the slide

342
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,430
are container based agents and tools.

343
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,740
Those are containerized agents

344
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,693
that are designed specifically
to run on AgentCore runtime.

345
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,670
The key benefit, those
are run inside your VPC

346
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,560
on AgentCore runtime.

347
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,330
So you're getting all the benefits

348
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,290
of AgentCore service
including the VPC isolation,

349
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,730
Bedrock IAM based identity

350
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,150
and resource policies,
tool level permissions,

351
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,160
and of course observability.

352
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,030
So you're getting all the
benefits of the partner logic,

353
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,982
the partner defined
agents who have prebuilt,

354
00:17:54,982 --> 00:17:57,000
who have done all the prompt engineering

355
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,133
but it runs within your VPC.

356
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,770
And the third category on the
bottom are agent applications

357
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,460
and also the professional services.

358
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,620
We hear from many of our customers

359
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,620
who are saying we need
some help to get started.

360
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,950
You can go on agent on AWS Marketplace

361
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:21,300
and find support from a broad
network of the partners.

362
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,480
So before we go deeper
into building the agents

363
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,750
and showing how that works, I
want to ground all the theory

364
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,880
that Salman and I have covered

365
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,790
in a real customer implementation.

366
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,900
Workday has been one of the early adopters

367
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,900
of AgentCore and other
AWS agentic services.

368
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,130
And please welcome on stage Mira

369
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,470
who will share their experience

370
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,293
of building a planning agent.

371
00:18:51,021 --> 00:18:54,386
(audience clapping)

372
00:18:54,386 --> 00:18:56,386
- Okay, thank you Andrei.

373
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,720
So I'm Mira Rajaram

374
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,493
and I head the AI core
services for Workday Planning.

375
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:11,930
So Workday, I think we
are perfectly positioned

376
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,470
to help our customers manage their money,

377
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,080
people and agents.

378
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,730
Now this is a marketing slide,
these are the list of agents

379
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,260
I'm allowed to show you

380
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,900
because these agents are
actually gonna be coming out

381
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,290
by end of this year in
the hands of customers.

382
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,336
There's a whole other
spreadsheet of agents

383
00:19:34,336 --> 00:19:35,640
that we are working on

384
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,893
and that are gonna be following shortly.

385
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,513
So how are we getting
all these agents out?

386
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,710
Workday has an agent platform team

387
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,400
that's essentially making
some of these, you know,

388
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,200
common stack consistency to
how we are building agents.

389
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,490
So we leverage land graph,
we are using Lang Smith

390
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,680
for our evals and traces

391
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,130
and we have something
like a centralized gateway

392
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,290
to the LLM models, right?

393
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,940
So this is what we end up
leveraging across the board

394
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,830
and the planning agent is no different.

395
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,783
We are also leveraging that platform.

396
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,263
But let's dive into the planning agent.

397
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,250
So planning agent is one agent

398
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,700
that represents four personas

399
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,570
to give this complete
planning intelligence, right?

400
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:35,310
So the personas here, our analyst modeler,

401
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,550
the planner and the admin persona.

402
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,450
And based on the role like
we are essentially offering

403
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,930
the skills for those personas.

404
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,080
So if we dive a little
into the analyst role,

405
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,523
like one of the key things an
analyst does is explore data.

406
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:56,970
So let's dive into that.

407
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,240
So the data exploration
skill that we offer

408
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,590
essentially allows our end
users like these analysts

409
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,540
to leverage natural language

410
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,540
and conduct ad hoc analysis
on vast amounts of data.

411
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,063
And trust me when I say vast, it is vast.

412
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,360
So how did this this go about, you know,

413
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,030
for us, how are we successful at it?

414
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,330
Well I'll tell you, it
took us multiple tries.

415
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:31,530
Iteration one, let's get all this data,

416
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,420
let's send it to the LLM

417
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,290
and have the LLM do the
data analysis for us.

418
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,250
Okay.

419
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,040
We ran into a bunch of issues with that.

420
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:46,040
First we ran into token limits
because it was a lot of data.

421
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,810
Two, if we didn't run into token limits,

422
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,820
it was still an expensive solution

423
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,343
because we were sending
a large number of tokens,

424
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,240
and three, well LMS aren't
really very accurate with math.

425
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,800
So you know, this was not
a good solution for us.

426
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,820
Okay, let's see what else we can do.

427
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,580
And the team came up
with another solution.

428
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,203
So this was iteration two.

429
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,410
Token limits, we know how to solve it,

430
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,070
we will chunk the data
and send it to the LLM

431
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,450
and that's exactly what we did.

432
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,300
So it was a multi-step process.

433
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,880
We will chunk the data,
send it to the LLM,

434
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,430
get the output and send that output

435
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,330
and the next chunk of data to the LLM.

436
00:22:35,217 --> 00:22:38,880
And of course this was not
a perfect solution again

437
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,903
because one is it introduced latency.

438
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,500
Two, we did solve for the token limits

439
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,680
but the solution is still expensive.

440
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,193
And three, we are still
not solved for accuracy.

441
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,953
Why?

442
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:59,370
Because at the heart of it,
LMS aren't great at math

443
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,170
but LMS are really good at writing code.

444
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,590
And so we figured that we
would rather get the LLM

445
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:12,030
to write code, Python code
that can do the data analysis

446
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,807
that we need and then the
LLM can leverage that output

447
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:18,030
and and be able to explain it right

448
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,760
and natural language to our end users.

449
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,510
So that's really what we went with.

450
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,860
Now why do we need a
sandbox code interpreter

451
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,660
and what exactly is this?

452
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,660
Well, show of hands for how
many people have raised kids.

453
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,290
Okay, okay.

454
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,390
We've got a few folks.

455
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,470
Well if you have got a high
energy toddler at home,

456
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,720
one way to deal with with that toddler

457
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,780
is to maybe create a playpen,

458
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,880
put them with all their toys,

459
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,090
they can create whatever mess
they want to in that playpen.

460
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,580
And the beauty is your fancy carpet

461
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,490
and walls are not disturbed.

462
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,810
So that's one way of doing it

463
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:08,810
and that's exactly what the
sandbox code interpreter is.

464
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,210
Think of your code like your toddler,

465
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,150
it can go wild, it can create a mess

466
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,340
and you wanna put it in a sandbox.

467
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,390
So that's exactly

468
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,094
what a sandbox code
interpreter allows you to do.

469
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:26,460
It is to ensure that your code can run

470
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,703
in a safe, secure environment.

471
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,270
Now we evaluated a lot
of different options.

472
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,700
One is should Workday build

473
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,833
our own sandbox code interpreter?

474
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,820
That's not the core of what Workday does,

475
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,463
so that's not gonna be
a good solution for us.

476
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,200
We then started looking at
different frameworks and tools.

477
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,800
Now if you've been in
this industry long enough,

478
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,820
you have seen a lot of demos
and these demos are amazing

479
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,410
because they tell you how
to build agents in an hour.

480
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,393
You can create POCs in an hour.

481
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,670
But taking that POC from POC stage

482
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,900
to production is a whole other matter

483
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,640
because you have to incorporate
all the enterprise controls,

484
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,680
you have to think about security,

485
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,080
you have to think about
like customer data,

486
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,570
which is so precious.

487
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,570
And so we said, hey, you know what?

488
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:35,103
We need a good solution that's
gonna help us address it.

489
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,930
And AgentCore essentially
provided that solution

490
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:43,260
like that was the answer
to what we were looking for

491
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,920
because one, it manages security for you.

492
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,520
So as far as your code is concerned,

493
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,030
that code is running in a very secured,

494
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,000
like a virtual computer, right?

495
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,760
The data that you have, your customer data

496
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,490
is uploaded into that environment

497
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:07,170
and as soon as you are done,
all of that data is wiped clean

498
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,450
and I'm now starting with
a, with a clean slate.

499
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,340
So that was super critical.

500
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,987
Second thing that the, you know,

501
00:26:13,987 --> 00:26:17,420
AgentCore code interpreter
does, which is is kind

502
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,810
of a differentiator compared
to a lot of the other tools

503
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:26,580
is that it handles stateful
multi-step analysis.

504
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,480
So for that entire
session it's actually able

505
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,140
to do a multi-step
analysis process to ensure

506
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,750
that you get the most accurate results.

507
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:41,190
And then scalability, we are
actually able to send a ton

508
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,743
of data to the code interpreter,

509
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,310
at least with what we saw last.

510
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:52,260
We were able to upload anywhere
between a hundred MB file

511
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,060
for like inline processing

512
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,650
and of course we are compressing that file

513
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,950
and sending it over, but you
could also leverage S3 for it

514
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,220
where you can have up
to gigabytes of data.

515
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,260
So that's where we landed.

516
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,410
Now what did it take
us to get this solution

517
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,260
with AgentCore code
interpreter in production

518
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,230
took us one software developer,
two engineering managers

519
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:19,560
and three days to get this from POC

520
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,770
to something that can be production ready.

521
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,190
And that is is huge.

522
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,640
Like, you know, how many folks can say

523
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,690
that you can get something
from POC to production

524
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,123
in such a short span of time.

525
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:41,990
That's exactly what we got with
the agent code interpreter.

526
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,700
And by the way, we just went live

527
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,440
with our solution two weeks back.

528
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,820
So customers are actually
using this in production,

529
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,263
which is amazing.

530
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,480
So let's talk about some
of the results, right?

531
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,403
With the code interpreter solution,

532
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,610
what we ended up seeing is,

533
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:10,050
I mean yeah we are adding some
latency with code interpreter

534
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:14,760
somewhere in the ballpark
of 400 to 500 milliseconds.

535
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,310
If you look at the 90th percentile,

536
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,250
somewhere between one to two seconds.

537
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,490
But what we gained

538
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,490
is the token size reduced significantly.

539
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,390
So we are almost seeing

540
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,420
like when we have these large payloads,

541
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,690
we are seeing up to a 50%
reduction in the tokens

542
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,100
that we end up sending

543
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,493
and that's significantly
reducing the cost for us.

544
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:47,688
Two, the other benefit that we
are getting is the accuracy.

545
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:51,390
Like we ended up getting
much better results

546
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,120
with this solution than you know,

547
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,450
what we had done previously
so this was huge.

548
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,950
And three, scalability.

549
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,877
Like we now didn't have to worry about

550
00:29:01,877 --> 00:29:05,340
are we gonna be hitting
token limits or any of that.

551
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,470
This solution is scalable

552
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,270
and at the end of the day,

553
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,420
like what is it our
customers are looking to do?

554
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:17,420
They wanna analyze large
reports, vast amounts of data

555
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,493
and this is exactly something
that's solving for it.

556
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,230
With that, I do want to thank

557
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,720
the close partnership we have had

558
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,640
with the planning agent team,

559
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,310
our own Workday agent platform team

560
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,780
and AWS, folks, like
this was a very strategic

561
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,170
partnership that helped us to innovate

562
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,660
at a really rapid pace.

563
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,333
With that, I will hand it off to Salman.

564
00:29:48,468 --> 00:29:49,583
(audience clapping)
- Thank you Mira.

565
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,920
Okay,

566
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,020
we're gonna be building an agent.

567
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,020
Now disclaimer number one,
we're gonna be seeing some code

568
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,768
disclaimer number two, you can
definitely use AI to help you

569
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,290
with any form of coding.

570
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,753
I actually did use AI
to generate this code.

571
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,080
Third one, I gotta do this in 10 minutes.

572
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,660
So I'm gonna focus on the bare bones

573
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,880
of that capability that I talked about.

574
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,560
How do you bring that tool
and agency within the agent?

575
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,780
Where do you bring the
LLM that does a reasoning?

576
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,283
How do you bring in the query?

577
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,700
And then I'll give some pointers around

578
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,600
how you can start off but
also strengthen that in order

579
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,853
to move such a solution into production.

580
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,390
Now in this example I'm gonna be showing

581
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:40,440
how to build an agent using a
third party tool from Tavily.

582
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,820
So Tavily is an internet search
tool, provides a capability,

583
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,850
I'll talk to you about
how can you, you know,

584
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:51,813
take that tool, integrate it
within the code and and run it.

585
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,680
First is first what is the use case?

586
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,120
That's important, right?

587
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,680
And in this particular case,

588
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,270
I am gonna be demonstrating

589
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,000
a company research agent for sales team.

590
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,460
This happens to be a popular use case

591
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,920
that I'm seeing in production.

592
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,620
Reason being that many of the sales teams,

593
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,750
they focus on creating,

594
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,180
searching information from the internet,

595
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,940
creating these tailored briefing documents

596
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,040
ahead of their customer meetings.

597
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,030
So this is one use case that
I've seen emerge in production

598
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:28,800
and I thought, you know, like
create a simple, bare bone

599
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,320
capability to show how these are built.

600
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,750
Next one steps that we need to follow.

601
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,270
Step number one, we need
to architect the solution.

602
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,830
So we're gonna go over that.

603
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,977
Step number two, we
need to set up the tools

604
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:41,730
in the cloud environment.

605
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,070
I'll briefly touch upon that as well.

606
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,660
And then step number three,

607
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,153
we have to have the code
and then run it, right?

608
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,563
So step number one, solution components.

609
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,130
This is an overly simplified version

610
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,430
of solution components
involved in an agent.

611
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,620
You have the user that will be interacting

612
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:06,120
with an agent executor and
that executor takes on the role

613
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,980
of an orchestrator, right?

614
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,320
It sort of determines where's the LLM

615
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,050
that I need to sort of
take, take advantage of

616
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,630
in order to do that
reasoning and the planning.

617
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,130
What are the tools that have access

618
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,360
to me and what does that mean?

619
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,390
So in this case, in this
example, we have two tools.

620
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,830
One to represent information

621
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,530
that is coming from the
web and the internet.

622
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,660
And the second one is information

623
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,360
that is residing within
the enterprise environment.

624
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,220
In this particular
case, I just have a file

625
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,790
sitting on an Amazon S3 storage, right?

626
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,970
Just to show how the
two information can come

627
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:43,053
and be combined curated and
present a response to the user.

628
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,370
Now with each one of them we
need to have some decisions

629
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,380
around the technical capabilities.

630
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,910
So with the agent executor,

631
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,410
there's a number of
frameworks that are available.

632
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,300
Mira talked about land
graph, Lang chain is one

633
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,590
that is very close to that,

634
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,310
comes from from the from
Lang Chain provider.

635
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,870
So that's a framework we're gonna be using

636
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,720
in order to orchestrate
these capabilities.

637
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,820
From a reasoning LLM,

638
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,180
we have access to more than
200 models from Amazon Bedrock.

639
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,160
In this particular case
we're gonna see an example

640
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,700
from Anthropic Claude.

641
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,160
And then when it comes to the tooling,

642
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,390
the AgentCore gateway is gonna
be presenting us the option

643
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,980
of connecting to Tavily's tool

644
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,050
in order to se search internet.

645
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:32,340
And the local data search is
simply a tool function within

646
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,889
Python environment.

647
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:37,620
I think I've skipped that
part for the interest of time.

648
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,300
So we're gonna go over the example

649
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,060
and I'm gonna cover how
to now set up the tools

650
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,440
and the cloud environment

651
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,360
and then we'll go into
the code piece, right?

652
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,000
And I'll walk you
through what each section

653
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,043
of the code is doing so you can follow.

654
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:55,200
So the first thing around
the choice of the model,

655
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,540
you can go to Amazon Bedrock,
as I said, you've got access

656
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,460
to more than 200 models.

657
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,140
In this particular case the
use case seems simple enough.

658
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,790
So a model like Claude
3.5 high Q should be able

659
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,330
to, you know, provide a decent result.

660
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,800
Now within Bedrock

661
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,900
you have the Bedrock evaluation capability

662
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,150
where you can actually
test model side by side.

663
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,160
And those are some of the best practices

664
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,110
when you're moving and and executing

665
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,420
on a proof of concept
to be able to identify

666
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,980
what is the optimal model
for your particular use case.

667
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,890
But here for the sake of simplicity,

668
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:35,493
I'm going ahead with
clock 3.5 High Q model.

669
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,710
You can select the model

670
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,510
and then you can generate keys,

671
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,950
either short term or long term.

672
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,740
So in this instance we're
generating short term keys

673
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,860
and then we're storing these
within the secrets manager

674
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,480
as well as taking it and incorporated

675
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,210
into the code development that we have

676
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,610
that I'll show you later on.

677
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,280
Second part is around the tooling.

678
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,210
So as I talked about, you
know, we're using Tavily's tool

679
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:03,420
to search internet,
you'll be able to access

680
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,420
and get keys from Tavily.com.

681
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,840
And then again, same
practice with those API keys.

682
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,200
You can store them securely
within your Amazon environment

683
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,910
in the Secret Manager

684
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:19,260
and within AgentCore gateway
you can register this.

685
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,450
As it so happens within AgentCore gateway,

686
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,760
we have a number of native integrations.

687
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,150
So one of the options that
is the furthest to the right

688
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,850
talks about some of the
built-in integrations.

689
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,070
You'll be selecting that, Tavily is one

690
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,260
of the options tools available there

691
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,260
along with some other third party tools,

692
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,730
you'll be able to select that,

693
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,560
select your key and you'll be given

694
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,980
an AgentCore gateway URL and ARN.

695
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,270
They'll be using as part of your tool.

696
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,583
So that's your cloud
environment now set up.

697
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,960
Now let's move on to the code, right?

698
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,960
So in the simplest form, you
know, having that Lang Chain

699
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:03,630
that I talked about and
setting up the agent executor,

700
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,250
it's not that difficult.

701
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,900
So if you could just follow,
you know, the Python code here,

702
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,240
you'd be basically pulling
in some of the libraries

703
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,950
in this case Lang Chain.

704
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,620
And then there are a couple
of, you know, lines of code

705
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,740
where this agent executor comes

706
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,950
and sort of orchestrate all
the capabilities from the LLM,

707
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,240
the tools and the prompts.

708
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,060
You create that tool calling capability

709
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,520
and then you form an agent executor.

710
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,960
And once you have this object,

711
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,090
you can actually call invoke against that.

712
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,190
So then you can give a
user's query in order

713
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,770
to invoke this agent and
it would operationalize

714
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,350
and it would generate the response.

715
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:44,340
Three parts are key, the LLM,
the tools and the prompt.

716
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,230
These are the three
parameters that are provided.

717
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,240
So I'm gonna be talking about those three

718
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,193
parameters in the subsequent slide.

719
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,860
So this code highlights all three.

720
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,800
The first one is the LLM.

721
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,880
So in this case, again,

722
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,820
within Lang chain you'll
have native integration

723
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,530
with Amazon Bedrock.

724
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:08,220
You can simply use chat Bedrock
in order to select the model

725
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,770
and provide information
around, you know, the region

726
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,080
and the AWS credentials that you have.

727
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,610
So here you see the example

728
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:18,370
of Anthropic Claude 3.5
High Q being mentioned there

729
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,170
on the second one you
need to provide prompt.

730
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:25,560
So we talked about agents
following an objective.

731
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,180
Here I have an objective

732
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,170
and a read such as your
company research agent.

733
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,080
Your goal is to answer
questions about companies

734
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,210
using available data sources.

735
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,100
You have access to two tools, right?

736
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,160
To number one, search local documents,

737
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,580
search internal company
documents for information.

738
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,010
Number two, search the web, search the web

739
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,810
for current company information.

740
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,930
Fun fact, with AgentCore you
can't even have a separate

741
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:56,490
tool to say you can access,
you know, inquire on the list

742
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,190
of tools so you can get what
are the tools available.

743
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,500
Passes on to this reasoning LLM,

744
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,750
so that it can actually
in the subsequent stages

745
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,200
determine out of those
tools which ones to use.

746
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,570
But in this case, again,
I've kept it simple, right?

747
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,790
So I've provided those
tools that are relevant

748
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,863
to this agent directly within the prompt.

749
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,090
And the third one, you see that, you know,

750
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,620
we have tools as an array

751
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,170
that talks about these
two, search local documents

752
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,850
and search web,

753
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,280
I'm gonna skip the search local documents,

754
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,530
but again, I wanna show you
the code for search web.

755
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,230
So you can see how easy it is to bring all

756
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,113
of this capability into a
Python code and execute it.

757
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,990
First part, again, bringing
some of those configurations

758
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,910
that we have set up in
the cloud environment

759
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:45,942
in AWS environment from your
A WS region, your S3 buckets

760
00:38:45,942 --> 00:38:49,650
or for the, you know, the local
search that I talked about.

761
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,960
And then the AgentCore URL and tool.

762
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,090
So those are the information
that we already had

763
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,560
from the AWS console.

764
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,810
You're gonna be able to
take advantage of it.

765
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,980
And then the search
web that was, you know,

766
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,430
mentioned in the array
is basically a function

767
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,950
and this function is decorated as a tool.

768
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,740
So then Python interpreter
environment will be able

769
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,420
to understand this is one of the tools

770
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,430
available for that agent.

771
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,850
And within that, you
know, we capture the name

772
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,280
of the tool from the AgentCore service,

773
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,630
we're gonna be able to
package this as a JSON RPC,

774
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:29,630
sign the query and then send
it over to AWS for invocation.

775
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,610
So in this case where you're seeing

776
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,940
the payload is packaged up
with some of the information

777
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,460
around the JSON RPC information,

778
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,810
also having arguments and
argument says query is query

779
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,630
the query parameter is
what the user provides.

780
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,090
And I'll show you the example,
you know, that we have

781
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:51,060
in the run, in the recorded run.

782
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,130
And then post that
you're gonna create this,

783
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,890
encapsulate this as a request, AWS request

784
00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:00,240
and basically send this
request as a post operation.

785
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,073
So that's it.

786
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:03,900
This is whenever the agent de decides

787
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,910
to call the search web,

788
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,220
it would go through this,
it would have the response

789
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,800
and the response is being sent to the LLM

790
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,200
for further decision making
as to whether he needs

791
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,700
to further call tools

792
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,220
or whether he needs to
just curate the response

793
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,690
and provide an output to the user.

794
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,360
That's a decision that is left

795
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,403
with the LLM decide in this case.

796
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,640
So now I wanna show you

797
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,620
how this comes together when you run it.

798
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,440
And in this particular case
we need to have an example

799
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,550
of the query.

800
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,150
So the query here is
how has AWS's approach

801
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,330
to sustainability and
green computing evolved,

802
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,640
particularly focusing on their commitment

803
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,190
to run on a hundred
percent renewable energy.

804
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:47,130
So that's a query we're
gonna be pro providing it

805
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:50,370
to this agent and we're
gonna have the agent run

806
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,660
and I'm gonna show you the screenshots

807
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,970
of the run in this case.

808
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:57,930
So firstly, once you sort of run this,

809
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,580
it would actually try to figure out,

810
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,370
hey, do I have the
information or do I need to go

811
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,410
and use the tools that are available?

812
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,320
So the green is the JSON output

813
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,420
of what the LLM has determined.

814
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,790
It's determined that I
need to actually invoke

815
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,280
the search web tool that I have available

816
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,170
and it's also formed a query

817
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,000
that is different to the query that I had

818
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,410
in order to determine what is it

819
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,360
that I'm gonna be searching the web for?

820
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,760
So in this case it says
I wanna search the web

821
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,260
with the information AWS,

822
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,160
Amazon Web Services,
sustainability, renewable energy,

823
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,803
a hundred percent commitment progress.

824
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,130
So this is the determination of the LLM

825
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:38,580
saying I've seen the query and
I'm gonna be using this tool

826
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,310
and the tool is gonna be used
with this argument, right?

827
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,760
It's formed its own argument.

828
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:47,640
This tool is gonna be
invoked through, as I said,

829
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,100
AgentCore gateway and Tavily's tool

830
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,050
and it reverse with information.

831
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,970
Now you see a dense piece of text

832
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,640
is because it brings back
search results from the internet

833
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,870
relating to that argument,
relating to that query

834
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,787
and this particular case that you see

835
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:06,120
the information around
the Amazon Web Services

836
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,793
sustainability, renewable
energy commitments,

837
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,700
URLs so that you can have citations

838
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,090
and sort of, you know,
linkage the original material

839
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,770
as well as text.

840
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,050
Now I'm not gonna read over this text,

841
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:21,780
but what I'll highlight is ultimately

842
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,730
the LLM processes information

843
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:26,070
combined with the S3
information that it has

844
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,300
and it brings it and provides
this raw format in in JSON,

845
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,090
which can be, you know, processed further

846
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:36,120
in order to have a much
more human readable text.

847
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,120
But in this case, the
output that is provided

848
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,850
is based on the web search results.

849
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,620
I can provide a comprehensive overview

850
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,140
of AWS's approach to
sustainability and green computing

851
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,090
renewable energy commitment,

852
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,440
AWS has achieved its a hundred percent

853
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,900
renewable energy goal, seven years ahead

854
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,080
of scheduled target in 2021.

855
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,840
So I'm not gonna read the whole text,

856
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,730
but as you can see three steps.

857
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,240
One, we provided the sort
of query, step number two,

858
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,220
it's determined which tools to call

859
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,490
and which parameters to provide
for each one of those tools.

860
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,890
Step number three, curated the responses

861
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:16,023
and provided a response as an outcome.

862
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,880
So next steps from here,
this is the, you know,

863
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,730
the core building blocks
of building an agent,

864
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:27,270
but this in itself should
not be moving to production.

865
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,420
So number one is around
security and governance.

866
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,460
So with AgentCore Runtime,

867
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,040
and I didn't cover this
within today's session,

868
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,980
you'd be able to containerize this code

869
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,378
and push it into AgentCore
Runtime to operationalize.

870
00:43:40,378 --> 00:43:42,780
So that's step number one.

871
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,200
Step number two is as I've
talked about these LLMs,

872
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,650
it's important to place
guardrails around the application.

873
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,660
So having those guardrails implemented

874
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,883
with Bedrock Guardrail is quite important.

875
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:58,440
Step number two is in terms of
performance and reliability.

876
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,080
In many of these applications
we see caching to be effective

877
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,760
because there's a lot of repeat queries

878
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,340
with the same kind of
company names or information.

879
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,640
So very much depends on
the application context

880
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,640
and having reliability say in
terms of failing over properly

881
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,760
in case a tool cannot be called

882
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,410
or the answer does not exist,

883
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:21,090
how do you recover from that?

884
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,500
Lastly, cost control.

885
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,440
You need to have mechanism
in place in order to realize

886
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,060
how much of LLMs are you calling,

887
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,380
what kind of token based pricing

888
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,870
is being generated here per request,

889
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,520
what the tool calls that you have.

890
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,560
All of those aspects would help you

891
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,480
to strengthen this in order to move it

892
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,610
into a production grade environment.

893
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,440
With that said, I'm
gonna hand over to Andrei

894
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,860
to talk about deploying a pre-built agent.

895
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,693
There we go.

896
00:44:44,693 --> 00:44:46,080
- Thanks Salman.

897
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,220
So we just saw how to build
an agent from scratch,

898
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,620
Pick your LLM, pick your tools,

899
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,260
do the prompt engineering,
test that it's working,

900
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,810
which is great when you
want to have flexibility

901
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:01,650
and when you have the granular
control over the tool.

902
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,680
But many teams don't want
to start from scratch.

903
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,650
And sometimes the fastest path

904
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,070
is to start with a production
ready prebuilt agent

905
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,503
that you can get from
a third party vendor.

906
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,720
I'll be using a CRM AI sales agent

907
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,730
that is built by one of the vendors

908
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,750
available on AWS Marketplace

909
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:27,660
that can help you automate
the routine CRM tasks.

910
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,120
This is the fully packaged solution

911
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,920
with defined action schemas
with defined prompt engineering,

912
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,400
which has the recommended
LLM already baked in

913
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,880
and it is already packaged

914
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,970
and optimized to run on AgentCore runtime.

915
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,950
And that means you can
deploy it in minutes.

916
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:50,010
And I'm gonna show you
in just a few slides,

917
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:52,980
I'll show you the demo of
how that's gonna be done.

918
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,200
And this is the power of prebuilt.

919
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,570
You inherit all the vendors work

920
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:00,030
and they're kind like testing,

921
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,940
making sure that all things
and components work together,

922
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,420
but it can still run
securely in your environment

923
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,310
within your VPC.

924
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,340
Getting started experience
is extremely simple.

925
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,200
It is just three steps.

926
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,180
You first discover the agent

927
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,180
or the solution based
on your business needs.

928
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,660
We have the new agent
mode on AWS Marketplace

929
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,580
where you can describe
your business problem

930
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:28,580
or attach to your
internal requirements doc

931
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:32,730
or your plan for what
you're trying to build

932
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:35,730
and we'll give you the best
optimal solution for that.

933
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:39,123
The second is subscription
flow, which is a single click.

934
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,880
This particular tool is free

935
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,010
but it still requires
you to accept vendors'

936
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,450
terms and conditions.

937
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,460
And finally is the deployment process,

938
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,920
which is almost as
simple as a single click,

939
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,653
I'll talk about it a little bit more.

940
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:58,910
So Marketplace has
standardized the framework

941
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,640
for how to package, how to build

942
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,650
and package those containers.

943
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:08,820
And they come with vendor
authored instructions

944
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,500
and all the configuration

945
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,520
and require users to
provide only minimal inputs.

946
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,130
In this case users to deploy the agents

947
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:20,790
need to provide the environment variables

948
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,750
such as the CRM access credentials.

949
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,230
And what's important about Marketplace

950
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:32,910
is that it acts as the
supply and chain guardrail,

951
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,620
think of it this way,

952
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:39,240
all the agents that are
containerized applications

953
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,620
are stored in Marketplace
private ECR repo.

954
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,790
That means that vendors

955
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:48,120
cannot just swap the
image whenever they want.

956
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,950
All the images that they provide

957
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:54,300
goes through the rigorous
scanning process and they are

958
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:58,470
behind the entitlement enforced access.

959
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:01,350
So only users who are entitled

960
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:03,570
to use this product can
read them and the vendors

961
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,610
before pushing the new version have to go

962
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:09,213
through the full publishing
flow, full security reviews,

963
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:14,700
once it goes to the
AgentCore Runtime site,

964
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,740
that's where you get all the benefits

965
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,860
of running those agents within your VPC.

966
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,350
So you get IAM role configurations

967
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:25,860
where you start by either
creating a new IAM role

968
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:29,520
or selecting existing IAM
role if you have one already

969
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,460
where you define the minimal
required set of permissions

970
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,710
for this agent to upgrade properly,

971
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:37,950
which usually requires
access to Bedrock LLMs,

972
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:41,430
access to the tools you are using

973
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:44,913
or other internal resources
they require for the agent.

974
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:50,230
The secure runtime
environment within AgentCore

975
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,790
gives you the full control.

976
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:57,840
The agent would never leave
the boundaries of your VPC,

977
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,040
it's isolated from inbound
requests from the internet

978
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,810
unless you allow that

979
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:08,160
and you remain full control
over what the agent does

980
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,410
and how that operates.

981
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:15,000
So Marketplace in this case ensures

982
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,040
the trusted delivery of the agent

983
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:22,040
while agent call runtime
enforces secure governance

984
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,933
of the agents at the execution step.

985
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:30,690
So just to summarize, here's the flow.

986
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,180
If you want to get a third
party prebuilt agent,

987
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,280
again, it's very simple, you subscribe,

988
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,680
you find the Marketplace, subscribe,

989
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,740
you provide the environment variables,

990
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,110
in this case CRM credentials,

991
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:46,770
you deploy it on AgentCore
Runtime and you invoke the agent.

992
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:49,050
So let's see that in action.

993
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,730
I got a short prerecorded demo

994
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:53,070
just to put all this together.

995
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,650
We're starting on the Marketplace website

996
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:58,540
and we go to the new search experience

997
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,080
where you can describe your
problem in a natural language.

998
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:08,820
In this case, I'm looking for an AI agent

999
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:13,330
to automate my routine CRM actions.

1000
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:18,393
And as you can see,
I'm typing very slowly.

1001
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:24,270
If think for a few seconds,
you can also upload a document

1002
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:27,090
with your requirements if you need more

1003
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,640
and precise recommendations here.

1004
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,020
And you'll see a few options,

1005
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,150
with the generic recommended summary

1006
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,870
and we just launched a new version

1007
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,610
of that experience where
you can also create

1008
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:41,280
an AI build comparison of different tools

1009
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,880
so you can compare them
across different dimensions.

1010
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,100
Once you identify the
tool that works for you,

1011
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,570
you go to the product detail page

1012
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,190
where you can read all the information

1013
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,930
about how the tool works

1014
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:54,450
and also see the deployment instructions

1015
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:59,450
including the tool or in
this case agent schema

1016
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:03,930
and the all the inputs
that are require from you

1017
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:07,050
to make sure that this
agent operates properly.

1018
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:10,710
Once you're ready, you
move to the purchase step

1019
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,470
where you review pricing
in terms and conditions.

1020
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,280
This tool is free but
you still need to hit

1021
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,330
the subscribe button

1022
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:22,440
to make sure you agree with
vendors' terms and conditions.

1023
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,180
Once you're subscribed,

1024
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,883
you can proceed to launching the software.

1025
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:32,040
And this step, there are two options.

1026
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,810
You can either proceed

1027
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:36,490
with CLI if this is your preferred method

1028
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:40,350
and we'll provide you a you pre-built,

1029
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,410
pre-generated prompts for the CLI.

1030
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:47,283
The first step would be
creating an IAM role.

1031
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,133
Let's see.

1032
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,080
Here it is.

1033
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,270
So the first step will
be creating IAM roll.

1034
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:55,630
So you can copy that

1035
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,210
and execute this command
attaching permission policies.

1036
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:04,670
And finally actually deploying the agents

1037
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,963
with the container image
provided by the partner.

1038
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,060
Or alternatively, you can
get the same work done

1039
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,000
directly in the AgentCore console,

1040
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,410
which we'll be using for this demo

1041
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:23,580
and the AgentCore console.

1042
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,100
Again, your inputs are fairly simple.

1043
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,840
Provide a name for the agent.

1044
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,170
It's pre-populated already,
but I prefer a different one.

1045
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:33,123
Let's call it a Salesforce agent.

1046
00:52:34,078 --> 00:52:37,260
The ECR containers URI is
all already pre-populated

1047
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,580
from the Marketplace.

1048
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,710
The solution that you have just purchased,

1049
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:42,840
you select or create a new IAM roll.

1050
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,240
I have one already selected

1051
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:49,140
and almost ready to hit the
hosting engine, but not yet.

1052
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,900
I need to provide the
environment variables.

1053
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,800
In this case I need to provide

1054
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:00,300
four keys with respective values

1055
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,240
and that's my CRM username.

1056
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,170
This is my CRM password

1057
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:11,520
and the token and the domain.

1058
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,550
Again, this information
never leaves the boundaries

1059
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,830
of your VPC.

1060
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,500
This information is never
shared with the vendor.

1061
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,350
And you can also store those credentials

1062
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:23,850
in the Secrets Manager

1063
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:26,730
and instead of providing variables here,

1064
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:30,240
you can reference them
from the agent directly,

1065
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,520
which is much better for the production

1066
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,190
and when you need to do
the regular rotation.

1067
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:39,090
So now let's test this
agent and see if that works.

1068
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:44,090
I'm asking to provide me a
summary for the specific account.

1069
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,533
And let's see.

1070
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,950
We'll take a few seconds
to think and here we go.

1071
00:53:55,950 --> 00:54:00,820
So here's an example of an
agent that can help automate

1072
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:05,100
the routine work of your sales teams.

1073
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,180
And there are multiple ways

1074
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,710
how we can plug in this agent

1075
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,800
into your own individual workflows

1076
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,400
with all the data, never
living the boundaries

1077
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,970
of your VPC with you
having the full control,

1078
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:22,970
but at the same time with
no building, no coding,

1079
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:25,710
and no prompt engineering.

1080
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:28,560
The one thing I also want to mention,

1081
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,930
this particular agent built by Partner

1082
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:34,020
is built using Strengths framework,

1083
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,190
which already has Bedrock LMS baked in.

1084
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:41,130
So in the previous example
you saw how we need

1085
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:44,120
to pick an LLM, how we need
to configure the LLM access.

1086
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,290
In this case you don't
need to do any of that.

1087
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:48,123
It's kind of comes prebuilt.

1088
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,700
And with that, that's the
end of our presentation.

1089
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,410
We'll be wrapping up in a second.

1090
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,783
Please join me on stage.

1091
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:01,650
We are running a little short in time,

1092
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:03,680
but as soon as we wrap up

1093
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,350
we will be around here for Q and A.

1094
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,670
- Thank you Andrei.

1095
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,760
Despite his slow typing, I'm
still impressed, you know,

1096
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,650
getting an agent into production

1097
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,780
in five minutes as pretty impressive.

1098
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:19,560
So what we saw today was AWS capabilities,

1099
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,620
you know, providing prebuilt
agents, tools, models,

1100
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,840
infrastructure and expertise.

1101
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,810
Generally the best way to go about this

1102
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,850
is to identify a use case

1103
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,580
and start this flywheel cycle, right?

1104
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,690
What is the use case?

1105
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:36,150
What is the business pain
point or opportunity?

1106
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:38,550
Identify how, whether
we should be building

1107
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,500
or buying or partnering.

1108
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,890
And then, you know, create
this flywheel effect

1109
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:45,453
that you can improve over time.

1110
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:48,300
There are some resources
that are available

1111
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,990
and this recording is
gonna be available as well.

1112
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:54,990
So we've got information
around some of the sample code

1113
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:56,520
with AgentCore,

1114
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,630
but also some training
material to improve your skills

1115
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,940
with our agentic AI offerings.

1116
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,830
And lastly, I wanna close off with some

1117
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,180
of the relevant sessions

1118
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,720
that are also covering
similar topics at reinvent.

1119
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,550
Thank you so much for being with us.

1120
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:12,498
Thank you.

1121
00:56:12,498 --> 00:56:13,593
- [Andrei] Thank you.
