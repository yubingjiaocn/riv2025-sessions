1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,180
All right. So good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:04,368
Day before 2 p.m.

3
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:06,828
And you're all here with,

4
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:09,528
I was, I'm glad to see the presence,

5
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:10,390
the room.

6
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:11,509
Um,

7
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,228
my name is Ayan Data. I'm from Tara Consultancy

8
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:16,548

10
00:00:19,158 --> 00:00:20,829
two of our eminent speaker today

11
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:23,408

12
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:24,920

and Sean, managing director, crew,

14
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,289
uh, modernization.

15
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:31,170
I, I'm not going to take much time. It's just

16
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:31,708
that

17
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,149
I will hand it over to Shubu to introduce

18
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:34,770
the program.

19
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:37,500
Uh, this is where

20
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,639
we wanted to highlight.

21
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:40,728
In the next one hour, how

22
00:00:41,348 --> 00:00:43,630
the partnership, a three-way partnership

23
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,709
of TCS.

24
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,959
United and AWS

25
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:48,590
came together.

26
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:50,700
To display a real

27
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:53,399
business modernization, right? We always talk

28
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,560
about technology modernization. You'll see that

29
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,598
how a business is impacted, a

30
00:00:57,598 --> 00:00:58,679
process is reimagined.

31
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:01,118
And with the help of technology,

32
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:02,829
and 3, the customer.

33
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,778
The the technology provider and

34
00:01:05,778 --> 00:01:08,019
a service provider hand in hand came

35
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:10,129
together to make that happen, right? With

36
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:10,808
further ado,

37
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,338
I'll just ask Subu to introduce the

38
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:15,448
program. Thank

39
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:17,489
you. Good afternoon, everyone.

40
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:20,650
So my name is, uh, Subramanian Kussubu.

41
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,528
So I'm the account director for United Airlines, part

42
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:25,599
of, uh, TCS, uh, Travel,

43
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:26,989
Transportation and Hospitality

44
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:28,829
North America unit.

45
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,719
So I'm privileged to have, uh, Sean Carson here, uh,

46
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:34,088
to talk about some of the work we did in crew,

47
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:36,730
a little bit more deeper on some of the challenges, some

48
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,750
of the best things we did, and how we went,

49
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:40,888
uh, through this whole journey and how it

50
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:41,730
has helped, uh.

51
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,250
Uh, United to deliver business

52
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,198
value to their end customers, right?

53
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,799
Uh, TCSN United go a very long

54
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,808
way, uh, with over

55
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:52,370
20 years of togetherness,

56
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:55,049
uh, we have worked together in multiple

57
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,198
transformation programs

58
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,230
delivering, uh, business value to, uh, customers.

59
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,088
The strength of our partnership always relied

60
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,650
on our ability to leverage,

61
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:06,269
uh, domain expertise,

62
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,050
uh, business, uh, knowledge, contextual

63
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,069
knowledge. Uh, innovation

64
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:12,379
and, uh,

65
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,929
uh, the ability to, uh, do all

66
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:17,069
the things right at first, actually, right, those are

67
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:18,729
the key elements which has actually driven

68
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:21,189
us to partner and to deliver value to

69
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:23,288
the, uh, to United and to their,

70
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:24,929
uh, business as well, right?

71
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:27,750
Uh, with that, uh, you know, uh,

72
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,830
I would go a little bit more on the crew

73
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,649
side of the world

74
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,308
where, uh, TCS and United has been working

75
00:02:33,308 --> 00:02:34,710
together for almost the last 10 years,

76
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:37,270
especially in the last 5 years there has been an aggressive

77
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,429
transformation approach that we have adopted together.

78
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,199
Along with the help of AWS,

79
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,899
uh, to see how we can better deliver business

80
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:45,520
value, uh, to the end customer,

81
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,409
uh, with that, uh, you know, we took a lot of, uh,

82
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,538
efforts and steps towards, uh, adopting

83
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:52,580
latest and greatest technology, including some

84
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,008
of the GEA aspects as well,

85
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,669
and also, uh,

86
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,500
uh, looked at, uh, industry best transformation

87
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,618
approaches to transform some of the elements of

88
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:02,808
crew and deliver value to the investors,

89
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,250
right? So with this, I have the privilege of

90
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,669
letting Shawn speak further,

91
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,288
a little bit more deep diving on, uh, some

92
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:10,449
of the work we did.

93
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:11,439
Uh,

94
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:12,449
here you go, Shawn.

95
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:14,808
Thank you. I think I'm good.

96
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:19,710
Thank you Subu. Thank you, Ian. Uh,

97
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,000
I am Sean Carson. I am one of the managing

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
directors in the digital technology division

99
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,558
at United Airlines. Uh, I

100
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:27,308
have

101
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:29,919
had the privilege of working in the

102
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,020
travel and hospitality industry for

103
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:34,278
roughly 30 years or so, 25 of

104
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:35,199
those at United.

105
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,520
Uh, an industry that has gone through

106
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,558
significant changes over that time period.

107
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:42,308
Uh, we've been a big part of it.

108
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,960
Uh, United's strategies and goals have been

109
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,219
innovation and, uh,

110
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,038
Uh, evolution, uh, and certainly

111
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:52,868
has, uh, changed the way that it tackles

112
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:53,860
industry problems.

113
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,929
Uh,

114
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,479
this program, I think is a good example of the type of

115
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,879
resiliency and innovation that

116
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,520
we've been encouraged to incorporate into our daily jobs

117
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,460
as we move forward, uh, and

118
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,118
transform the industry together.

119
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,520
I see a few industry colleagues out there, so

120
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,439
hopefully some of the

121
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,919
things that we covered today will resonate with some of you,

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,258
but it's, uh, uh, I'm happy to be here and share,

123
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:15,969
uh, some of the story with you guys today.

124
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,689
Uh, today we'll talk about a journey

125
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:21,829
that we have been on. We'll talk a little bit about United

126
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,949
and its background, where we are at,

127
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:25,488
uh, and where we are at,

128
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,250
uh, as an overall company.

129
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,028
Uh, the challenges of crew

130
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:32,028
operations, that's, uh, the centerpiece for

131
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:34,230
today's discussion, uh, and the way that we have

132
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,480
met and. Treated those challenges

133
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,920
as an opportunity to overcome, uh, and

134
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,358
the approach that we've taken, um, as well as

135
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:43,420
the partnership, uh, that was needed

136
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,579
in order to execute,

137
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:47,238
uh, on those, uh, uh, on

138
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:48,119
those changes

139
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,559
and then we'll talk a little bit about where we're headed, um, and if

140
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,790
we have a little bit of time, we'll leave a little bit of time for some

141
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,439
questions at the end.

142
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:57,528
First, a little bit about United. Uh,

143
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,160
United, uh, is the world's

144
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
largest airline by available

145
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,278
seat miles. That is just one of many

146
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:06,309
measures for how airlines measure

147
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:08,399
themselves. Uh, it is not the only one, but in this

148
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,480
measure, United is currently

149
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,439
leading the industry. We are proud to say.

150
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:15,470
Uh, this year we had a pretty important milestone.

151
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:17,509
We were able to eclipse, uh,

152
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:20,278
uh, operating more than 1000 aircraft.

153
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:22,699
That is a, uh, definitely a company first for us,

154
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:24,600
um, and it's certainly a statistic that we're proud of.

155
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,470
We service 380 destinations

156
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,238
worldwide,

157
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,678
uh, that is domestic and

158
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:31,238
international.

159
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,170
Uh, we have 7 domestic hubs,

160
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:35,358
um, in the US,

161
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:37,838
um, and at least one, you could

162
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,500
argue 2 international hubs.

163
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:42,269
Uh, we have more than 5000 daily

164
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:44,439
departures. Uh, that is a

165
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,588
milestone that has been growing

166
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:48,838
and is continuing to grow. It's a measure

167
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:49,480
of our

168
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:51,019
growth trajectory.

169
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,670
Uh, we flew nearly 175

170
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,869
million customers this year. Uh, that is a

171
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:59,230
big number, um, and certainly something that we are tracking

172
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,209
and certainly proud of.

173
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:03,069
Over 100,000 employees, uh,

174
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:05,149
I think we just eclipsed 110,000 this

175
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:06,009
year, as a matter of fact.

176
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:08,670
That is a number that grows, um, flows and

177
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,750
ebbs, uh, but it typically hovers around

178
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,129
that, a very large company.

179
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,949
Inside that company, we have more

180
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:17,108
than 18,000 pilots

181
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,269
and 28,000 flight attendants, and

182
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:20,649
this story is about them

183
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:23,048
and the, the teams that support those

184
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:23,569
organizations.

185
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,420
Uh, crew operations

186
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,459
services those two primary work groups.

187
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,720
So let's talk a little bit about what crew operations is.

188
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,660
Uh, our pilots and our flight attendants both

189
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,170
have,

190
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:36,798
uh, collective bargaining agreements, uh,

191
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,858
with United Airlines that govern their

192
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:41,119
work rules, and typically the way that

193
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,459
their flight schedules are organized, they

194
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,858
will bid based off of their seniority

195
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:48,319
and other work rules against their flight schedule,

196
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,920
uh, and then that

197
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:52,379
flight schedule is awarded on

198
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,528
a monthly basis, uh, based off of those

199
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:56,480
work rules, uh, that's applied to them,

200
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:59,319
uh, it becomes part of their, uh, strategy

201
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,199
and, um, is executed by it.

202
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:04,149
Uh, all goes well, they fly that

203
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:06,269
schedule and then we move on to the next month and the

204
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:08,428
process cycle is over again, but every month

205
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,250
there's some kind of disruption,

206
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,970
um, an unplanned disruption, and we have to.

207
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:15,500
Uh, adjust to the schedule. Uh,

208
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,980
typically this can be on a day to day basis

209
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,980
because of maybe a maintenance activity where we have

210
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,290
to pull an aircraft out of the, uh,

211
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:24,379
schedule and adjust things and make

212
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,980
adjustments to your flight schedule in order to still accommodate,

213
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,000
uh, passengers

214
00:07:28,488 --> 00:07:30,579
on or close to, uh, your

215
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,738
flight schedule. If you've ever had a flight where your

216
00:07:32,738 --> 00:07:34,819
flight adjusted by 15 minutes, typically that

217
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,559
was maybe the driver behind all of that.

218
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,100
Um, but with 7 domestic hubs and

219
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,220
most of the uh, the hubs in the US

220
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,759
are in

221
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:45,000
weather prone locations, uh,

222
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,879
uh, operational disruption is

223
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:50,000
not uncommon and so

224
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:52,449
what happens then is if we have to

225
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:55,009
cancel or reschedule,

226
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,369
uh, a flight in order to accommodate around a hurricane

227
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:57,920
or a

228
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,220
huge snowstorm in the south, uh, in

229
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,069
the northeast,

230
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:04,178
uh, we have to perform an irregular

231
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:04,980
operations activity.

232
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:08,009
Uh, that means that because of work rules associated

233
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,170
with the crew, that monthly flight schedule

234
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,189
gets disrupted,

235
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:13,689
um, and those, uh, flights become what we

236
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:15,790
call open time flights, um, or,

237
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:17,889
uh, part of a vast puzzle that needs

238
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:18,600
to be solved

239
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:21,230
with 7 flights with 7 hubs

240
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,528
in a complex interconnected series

241
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:25,928
of, uh, network and all of those passengers

242
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:26,750
to accommodate,

243
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,389
uh, it's a pretty complex puzzle to solve.

244
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,988
And there is a group, uh, there are 2 groups

245
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:34,158
at United that work on this puzzle every

246
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:36,250
day. They are called crew scheduling. One is

247
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,259
for the pilot side, the flight

248
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:38,918
ops team.

249
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,908
And one for the flight attendants, the

250
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:44,058
in-flight. They all have different and independent work

251
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:44,590
rules,

252
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,229
which means their teams need to understand those rules and

253
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:49,349
be able to solve that puzzle. Uh, it takes

254
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:51,009
about a year and a half in the,

255
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,210
uh, current structure to

256
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:55,629
hire a new employee into this

257
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:56,599
crew scheduling team,

258
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,298
um, and get them to a point where they are adept at being able to

259
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:02,190
solve this puzzle, um, in one of those er circumstances.

260
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:05,279
That creates a challenge and

261
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,940
it means that it is an area rife for

262
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,119
uh solutioning

263
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,719
um and technology tools and that is where we come into

264
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,190
play. So, uh,

265
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:16,690
crew ops is subject to several

266
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,739
challenges.

267
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,389
Now, the industry is, is,

268
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,029
has, has been around for quite a while

269
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:26,489
and some of our technology is quite aged.

270
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:29,048
Some of that technology is famously aged

271
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:31,090
and uh that means that what

272
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,168
we have right now, the primary system

273
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:35,239
that we had been using historically in

274
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,250
order to manage

275
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,609
our crew environment was um

276
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:41,389
a legacy mainframe application.

277
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:43,700
Uh, now, mainframe applications are very

278
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:46,750
Uh, solid and structured, but they can be constrained.

279
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:49,548
Uh, what that means is that as the ecosystem

280
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,869
around that environment evolves and changes,

281
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:54,570
uh, making adjustments to our

282
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,099
mainframe environment, uh, become more and more complicated,

283
00:09:57,109 --> 00:09:59,219
and that can limit what we can do, uh,

284
00:09:59,229 --> 00:10:01,609
around things like innovative changes around adopting,

285
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:04,229
uh, automation standards and things like that.

286
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:06,000
Uh, the industry,

287
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,859
particularly the cruise side, is subject to regulatory

288
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,158
disclosures. Uh, safety is something

289
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,619
all domestic airlines, all airlines worldwide

290
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:16,649
take extremely serious. Uh, it's an

291
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,119
area where we often

292
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:21,019
and famously indicate we do not compete.

293
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:23,580
Uh, we share information and strategies

294
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,399
around safety. All airlines do,

295
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,658
um, and a big part of that is disclosing regulatory

296
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:30,739
changes and making sure that we are connected. In

297
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:32,739
particular in the US, that means disclosing

298
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:33,979
data points to the FAA.

299
00:10:34,548 --> 00:10:36,558
In aligning with some of the work rule strategies so

300
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:38,558
that they are clear that we are operating under their

301
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:39,379
guidelines.

302
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,119
Uh, our legacy systems, especially

303
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:45,558
some of our mainframe environments, means that the resources

304
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:48,200
available that know how to operate that environment,

305
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:50,840
um, are not as readily available as they used

306
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,279
to. Uh, some of the, the aging technologies

307
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,090
mean that we

308
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:56,519
finding resources, people that can manage

309
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,538
those activities,

310
00:10:58,038 --> 00:11:00,418
uh, are, uh, fewer and farther,

311
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:01,759
uh, between to find.

312
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,369
And the resources themselves and the tooling

313
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:06,619
themselves, uh, as we grow, uh,

314
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,668
the system is quite,

315
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:10,190
uh, stable, but as we wanna integrate into,

316
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,288
uh, the broader path of the ecosystem,

317
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,729
uh, the, uh, the

318
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:17,229
available resources to be able to handle that become challenged.

319
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,359
We are subject to operational reliability, uh,

320
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,489
issues. Uh, it is not just weather events,

321
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,019
industry challenges,

322
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:26,879
uh, uh,

323
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,479
let's just say rub points that are part of our

324
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,580
integrated into our network strategy,

325
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:34,099
aging, uh, airports, um, and

326
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:36,200
staffing issues that are kind of beyond our control.

327
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,269
Uh, and then our utilization

328
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,548
for crew itself. We are in the middle of a very

329
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:43,629
large growth, uh, trajectory which we'll talk a

330
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,538
little bit about later on in the presentation,

331
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,070
uh, but it means that we're hiring significantly and

332
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,229
we need available staff in order to be able to handle

333
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:51,509
a growing network.

334
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,149
So being able to optimize our network, um, and

335
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,080
make sure that we're

336
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:57,788
taking advantage of the resources that we have in an optimized

337
00:11:57,788 --> 00:11:59,529
way, um, is a big challenge for us.

338
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,619
Uh, when things go wrong, disruption

339
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:04,700
becomes a significant problem, and managing through

340
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,859
that and solving that puzzle, um, is a

341
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,239
keystone of what it is that we do.

342
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:10,859
And as you might imagine, when we build our

343
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:12,859
data structure, we build a little bit at a

344
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:15,538
time and the opportunity to become siloed,

345
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:16,928
uh, becomes significant.

346
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:19,580
Certainly as we moved into a much more analytics

347
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,399
focused age, uh.

348
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,408
Uh, bringing all that data together into a centralized

349
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:26,408
place, uh, has become a significant priority

350
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:28,710
and breaking down some of those four decade long,

351
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,830
uh, bad habits, um, is a big challenge.

352
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:35,820
Never let a challenge go to waste. So, uh,

353
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:38,399
United, uh, took a look at this environment

354
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,399
and many years ago, about 8 or 9 years

355
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,399
ago, uh, started to undertake a

356
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,859
transformation journey

357
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
to take a look at that environment, um, and

358
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,479
try to adjust and evolve

359
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,899
that environment as we went forward.

360
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,440
Uh

361
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:54,859
What you see here are just some of the core tenets that we leveraged

362
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,899
in order to uh try to set sail

363
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:58,940
um and set some some targets

364
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,830
and strategies.

365
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:02,719
Uh, first and foremost, building a system

366
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:05,178
that helps improve operational reliability

367
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:07,500
was one of the foremost pillars of what it is that we wanted to undertake

368
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,288
as we thought about transforming,

369
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:11,149
uh, the technology platform,

370
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:14,080
uh, things like, uh, getting proactive

371
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,139
with our crew scheduling teams in

372
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,798
order to be able to anticipate

373
00:13:18,178 --> 00:13:19,979
and, um, uh.

374
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:22,750
Uh, position crew where they need to be, uh,

375
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,239
anticipating issues, um, and schedule adjustments

376
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:25,820
where possible,

377
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,639
became a big part of what it is that we, uh, wanted to

378
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,700
try to have the technology help enable.

379
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:32,798
So what if scenario building, uh, for

380
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:34,038
example, is a big part of our,

381
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:36,558
our, our platforming, uh, demands.

382
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,428
Uh, scheduler empowerment means

383
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,479
taking, uh, the information and

384
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,759
presenting it to the scheduler so that they have the

385
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,139
tools and means to be able to operate efficiently,

386
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,808
uh, creating a lot of decision support tools

387
00:13:49,808 --> 00:13:52,029
and, um, making those easy to consume,

388
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,639
um, especially trying to breach that, uh, 18

389
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,639
month learning curve for new hires in order

390
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,320
to make the tools a lot more intuitive.

391
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,200
One of the, um, drawbacks of a mainframe

392
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,399
environment, once you learn it, it's a really powerful

393
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,259
tool, but it involves using.

394
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,849
Legacy green screen commands, things like that,

395
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:09,158
and it means that you really need to

396
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:10,940
operate within that modality.

397
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:14,509
Uh, ensuring that we are compliant

398
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:16,979
with all of our contract rules,

399
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:18,599
uh, and, uh,

400
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:21,070
the evolution of those contract rules every 4,

401
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,710
let's say every 4 to 6 years, uh, we go

402
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,969
through a new contract renewal with each of the,

403
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:28,570
uh, labor unions that we work with, uh, that govern

404
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,210
the flight attendants and the pilot groups.

405
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,298
That means that rules change. Um, in

406
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:35,408
fact, we just recently finished,

407
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:36,519
uh, an agreement,

408
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:38,279
uh, with the pilot union,

409
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:40,710
uh, about, about a year and a half ago or so, which

410
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,739
means we're on the eve of making more adjustments to

411
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:43,279
them. But,

412
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,058
um, coming off the heels of COVID, there were

413
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:48,239
significant adjustments that were related to,

414
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,960
uh, schedule enhancements, um, as

415
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,519
pilots wanted to

416
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,418
shift their mindset away from, um.

417
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:58,210
Compensation being their primary focus and

418
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,210
uh starting to balance our work-life balance. That was

419
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,210
a key change that happened and that had a direct

420
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,759
impact on some of the things that we needed to adjust

421
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,389
and be flexible on in our environment.

422
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,418
Uh, the employee experience is a big part of our

423
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:10,058
focus.

424
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:11,798
Legacy green screens are

425
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:14,178
reliable but not super great when it

426
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:15,000
comes to

427
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:17,580
work, uh, optimization. And

428
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,658
so our crew scheduling team had a lot to say

429
00:15:19,658 --> 00:15:21,779
about the way that we tool things out

430
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,820
in order to make their jobs easier and more efficient.

431
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:26,979
And then above all making sure that we had a a

432
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:29,019
strategy to handle uh uh

433
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,719
a reduction in overall disruption

434
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,529
from a crew scheduling perspective that means avoiding

435
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:35,700
what we call secondary cancellations.

436
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:38,090
Um, a flight will cancel because of a weather event,

437
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,700
but if we can't re-crew uh the

438
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,168
flight that got displaced,

439
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:44,558
we can cause a secondary cancellation

440
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:46,619
uh as a result of that and avoiding those is

441
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:47,918
paramount to

442
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:49,580
the strategy behind this environment.

443
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,609
Our approach, uh, effectively

444
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:57,250
required a grounds up approach to the

445
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,629
entire environment. Our

446
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:01,369
platform itself, uh, our

447
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:02,320
mainframe environment,

448
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:04,649
monolithic, handled everything in

449
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:05,759
an independent way,

450
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:08,288
and so an opportunity to really break through

451
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:10,450
that, uh, paradigm and think through things

452
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,099
differently,

453
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:13,729
uh, was, uh, I think at the forefront of what we undertook.

454
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:16,529
Um, at the beginning, uh,

455
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,570
and at the, uh, the primary elements of

456
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,509
that was rethinking the platform itself.

457
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,808
Um, instead of

458
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:24,969
having a single monolithic platform,

459
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,590
instead breaking that model out, um,

460
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,408
so that we could

461
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:30,979
take the different elements of what make up crew

462
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:31,649
operations,

463
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,590
uh, pay structure, the scheduling elements,

464
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:36,769
things that are, uh, handing off data

465
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:38,288
to downstream consumers

466
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,259
or elements that are consuming, uh, data from upstream,

467
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:44,109
um, into compartmentalized subsections

468
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:46,109
so that if one area of the environment

469
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:48,349
went down or was challenged

470
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:49,750
because of latency or some other.

471
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,090
Maybe unexpected data problem,

472
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,288
um, it did not bring the entire environment down.

473
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,090
Um, the other, uh, opportunity

474
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,570
here is to, uh, take a look at our legality

475
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,729
rules. Uh, so this is a key part of the way

476
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,599
our environment operates.

477
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:06,368
Uh, today in our mainframe-based environment, or

478
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:08,400
I should say yesterday in our mainframe-based environment,

479
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,989
those rules were embedded,

480
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:12,608
um, there's one more element of the cobalt logic

481
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:13,549
that was, um,

482
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,789
driving the way that mainframe environment was built,

483
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,449
uh, which means changing those rules is

484
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:20,880
complex. So if we shift from.

485
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:23,709
A 5 hour shift um

486
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,969
opportunity to a 5.25 hour shift

487
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:28,059
opportunity and then going in and hard coding and coal

488
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:28,890
that change

489
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,088
instead shifting into a centralized,

490
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:33,848
uh, queriable,

491
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,189
uh, legalities engine, uh, became a

492
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,189
key part of our, uh, a central part

493
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:39,568
of our architecture standard.

494
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:43,160
And then, uh,

495
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,140
channeling the way that, uh, we think

496
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,180
through the the data structure itself, uh, became

497
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,640
a, a big part of our approach,

498
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:53,219
uh, shifting our entire environment into microservices

499
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,390
instead of funneling everything through single integrated

500
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,219
work cues,

501
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:58,930
really about trying to accelerate and speed, uh,

502
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:01,160
the nature of the way the environment itself operates.

503
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:03,108
Uh,

504
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,828
centering an environment around automation

505
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,130
and then building trust in that automation,

506
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:08,890
those are,

507
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,848
I, I would, I would characterize that as a people and a

508
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:13,920
process, uh, uh, a change in

509
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,029
addition to technology.

510
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:17,848
Um, it's not just about building tools that allow

511
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,848
automation, but we need to ensure that the people

512
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,930
that are using those tools are relying on that

513
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,009
automation and, um, uh, can support

514
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,140
it. Especially when we're talking about things

515
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,400
as personal as

516
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,979
um an individual crew member's schedule that

517
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:30,838
will influence

518
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:33,180
the most personal data point of all for them, which is

519
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,250
their pay. Um,

520
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:36,618
and most important of all,

521
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:38,969
United is in the middle of a massive growth cycle,

522
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,380
uh, a program that we call United Next,

523
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:44,469
uh, that is a program that involved, uh, purchasing

524
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:45,519
and growing,

525
00:18:45,818 --> 00:18:47,910
uh, the, the fleet exponentially.

526
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,098
Uh, might be a little bit

527
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:52,170
optimistic to indicate a 100%, uh,

528
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,559
capacity increase, but that is our target

529
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,439
and, uh, what we are shooting for

530
00:18:56,939 --> 00:18:59,009
in order to, uh, to truly grow the

531
00:18:59,009 --> 00:18:59,920
airline into

532
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:02,618
Uh, uh, something unprecedented and

533
00:19:02,618 --> 00:19:04,559
so that means having a system that can support

534
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:07,019
a 100%, uh,

535
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:09,380
increase. We have to make sure that the environment that we

536
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,699
build is futureproof for that,

537
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,380
um, it can handle, uh, the intake for all

538
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,199
the different, uh, crew members that are coming in.

539
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:17,150
But not just that,

540
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:19,910
the ecosystem around the environment is also evolving

541
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,949
and changing. The tools that other groups

542
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:22,479
are using,

543
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:24,828
including gathering crew information to be able to

544
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:26,209
make strategic decision,

545
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:28,489
those tools were evolving as well.

546
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,459
And so we need an environment that could align

547
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:33,489
with those types of uh uh changes

548
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:36,029
um so that we could continually provide

549
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:38,269
greater and greater data elements into those environments.

550
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:39,608
Our centralized

551
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:42,269
legality strategy where the query and

552
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:44,309
response strategy was a big part of that

553
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,469
plan, um, and is part of the execution of that plan.

554
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,509
As a result, uh, we ended up building a

555
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:53,529
platform and again we started

556
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,380
on the, um,

557
00:19:55,868 --> 00:19:57,868
on-prem side. Uh, so this

558
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:59,949
journey goes back about 8 or 9 years or so before

559
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,029
United really got deep into, I'd say pivoting

560
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:03,430
into a cloud strategy.

561
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:06,029
Uh, the architecture underpinnings, I think, were

562
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:07,969
initiated many years back.

563
00:20:08,469 --> 00:20:09,049
Um,

564
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,789
interactive channels for transactions

565
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:12,750
and monitoring.

566
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,229
Um, that different work groups can use

567
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:16,529
in order to be able to oversee,

568
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,068
um, and then introduce observability

569
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:21,140
objectives we were thinking about that, um,

570
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,180
even as we were starting the on-prem architecture

571
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,368
itself. Uh, we started to shift

572
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:28,108
into a, um, a multi-domain,

573
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,769
uh, integration strategy.

574
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,598
So that meant instead of having a single monolithic

575
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,130
application, breaking things up into sub-applications,

576
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:35,880
um,

577
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,559
that sounds inefficient, but the way

578
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,640
crew operations work,

579
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:42,170
we don't need to have everything inside a single application. We

580
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,449
began to kind of challenge those mores a little bit,

581
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:47,049
um, and build bespoke tools that were

582
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:49,229
designed to be a little bit more customized for

583
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:51,529
specific applications. Crew scheduling needs

584
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:52,598
are different than what the

585
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,670
Uh, the pay team needs in order to be able to evaluate

586
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,729
and, and, um, audit the, the pay cycle

587
00:20:57,729 --> 00:20:59,189
which is also on a monthly cycle.

588
00:21:00,848 --> 00:21:02,930
Uh, the validation engine and

589
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,969
establishing that and then building the

590
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:07,328
ability to be able to evolve and adjust

591
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:08,529
that validation engine.

592
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,189
Our legality rules themselves, uh,

593
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:13,449
became a key part, uh, uh, of our

594
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:15,868
program. We didn't just centralize

595
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:18,088
that, we had to build a, uh, platform

596
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:20,630
that could handle millions of transactions.

597
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:23,088
Um, that's the area that I think

598
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:25,170
we'll experience the most growth, especially over

599
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,410
the next 5 to 10 years as we continue to leverage

600
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,309
and evolve this platform.

601
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,368
More and more tools, both internal

602
00:21:31,368 --> 00:21:33,828
and external, are going to query and respond

603
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,670
to challenge and understand

604
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:37,750
what a scenario is based off of,

605
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,170
uh, whether or not a crew member could

606
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,348
or should be able to fly on a given route.

607
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:44,989
Uh, we can use that internally for our own air ops

608
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:47,130
related management in order to try to think through different

609
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:47,949
scenarios

610
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:50,009
or external tools to say.

611
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,430
Hey, I wanna maybe make a

612
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,848
decision to cancel this flight,

613
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,380
but I don't know what that's gonna do to the crew team.

614
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:59,029
So now we can with this structure

615
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,689
begin to

616
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,890
um enhance those applications,

617
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,189
provide a system of record insights around what

618
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,568
might happen if they were to

619
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,949
make decision A instead of decision B, and

620
00:22:07,949 --> 00:22:09,949
then we can begin to work really interoperably with

621
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:11,989
the other teams that are making joint decisions

622
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:13,789
around the way that we operate.

623
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,549
Uh, and then, uh,

624
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:18,729
um.

625
00:22:20,078 --> 00:22:22,160
That is the, the starting point. Uh,

626
00:22:22,229 --> 00:22:24,279
now, so the cloud journey became a

627
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,519
big part of the way that we executed on this

628
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,519
about 4 to 5 years ago or so,

629
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,900
United started to really pivot into,

630
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,479
uh, centralizing its long-term resiliency

631
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,680
plan, not just for crew,

632
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,529
uh, technology, uh, but for, um,

633
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,108
many of our tier 1 and tier 0

634
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:43,420
applications. Today, I believe something like 80

635
00:22:43,838 --> 00:22:45,880
critical applications are on the

636
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,920
AWS platform, a significant

637
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,779
transformation journey that we have been on.

638
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:53,009
Uh, ADBS has become a big partner of ours,

639
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,680
um, as has TCS in order to help us,

640
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:57,709
uh, execute on at least the crew scheduling

641
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,809
plan. Uh,

642
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,979
once we started to select, uh, the cloud

643
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:02,868
migration

644
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:04,630
plan as part of our journey,

645
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:07,348
all kinds of long-term, uh, tooling

646
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:09,449
and strategies started to become, uh,

647
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:11,630
available to us to potentially, uh, leverage and move

648
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,858
forward, um, and a

649
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:16,390
big part of the, uh, transformation journey involves evaluating

650
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,390
those, uh, platform opportunities, picking the

651
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,140
right one for us, the one that meets our

652
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,180
specific servicing needs,

653
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:23,769
um, and moving us forward,

654
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:24,949
uh.

655
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,250
As a result,

656
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:28,769
our opportunity for increased compute power

657
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:30,108
has grown exponentially.

658
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:32,608
The way as we're transforming, we

659
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,650
can make a much more structured approach to the

660
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,189
way that we catalog and manage data,

661
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,920
certainly operating with that insider cloud

662
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,910
environment and matching that up against some of the

663
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,410
other partner systems that have also moved into that

664
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,029
same platform.

665
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,880
Uh, and

666
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,799
standardizing and modernizing the way that we

667
00:23:49,358 --> 00:23:50,299
think about the platform,

668
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,598
uh, promote changes, um, and support those

669
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:53,439
changes long term.

670
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:56,650
Uh, today we have a much more resilient

671
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,650
application, um, as a result of this, uh, short

672
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,489
term decisions.

673
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:04,489
Uh, the environment itself, uh, becomes,

674
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,699
uh, a state of the art crew

675
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:08,739
scheduling application, uh, that

676
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,279
we are quite proud of. Uh, it is something that was built internally,

677
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,420
uh, through blood, sweat, toil, and tears,

678
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:16,979
and, uh, is a competitive

679
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:19,180
advantage for United now. It's, uh, I'd

680
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,229
say how we tend to think of this.

681
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,039
Crew disruption can be a very,

682
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:24,670
um.

683
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,799
Uh, visible disruption, um,

684
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,000
and, uh, it also can snowball and can

685
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,430
create lots of problems and becomes very visible to customers.

686
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,140
So being able to, to proudly articulate

687
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,439
and leverage these tools in order to be able to

688
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:38,779
reduce risk in the space,

689
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,479
um, is significantly important. It becomes significantly

690
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,078
important to continue to evolve for United.

691
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,709
Uh, central to all of that is our alerting

692
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:49,170
engine. Uh, those are using the, uh,

693
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:52,130
Uh, the legality rules in order to be able to

694
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,410
draw attention and provide

695
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,949
decision support, uh, uh,

696
00:24:56,368 --> 00:24:58,088
mechanisms for our schedulers,

697
00:24:58,608 --> 00:25:00,680
uh, that has now become a,

698
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:02,729
uh, centerpiece of the way that we, our, our

699
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:04,009
schedulers think of the, um,

700
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,650
application instead of simply, uh, trying

701
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,650
to look at the next flight to, uh, to resolve. They are

702
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,368
able to prioritize and evaluate

703
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,598
alerts based off of priority and,

704
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,068
uh, what is, what needs to be addressed now

705
00:25:15,068 --> 00:25:16,608
versus first in, first out.

706
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:20,009
Uh, we have our centralized rules engine,

707
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:22,009
uh, that is now, uh,

708
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,709
platformed and ready for us to start, uh, building

709
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:25,900
automation, uh,

710
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:28,750
uh, strategies on top of. That is our current

711
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,269
plan, uh, and the

712
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,890
current slate of work that we are undertaking,

713
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:35,108
uh, for our business partners as we think about their

714
00:25:35,108 --> 00:25:35,989
long-term roadmaps.

715
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:39,578
Cloud also offers a couple of different

716
00:25:39,578 --> 00:25:41,578
options, uh, but probably the most important one

717
00:25:41,578 --> 00:25:43,618
is it's, uh, auto scaling

718
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:44,380
capability.

719
00:25:44,939 --> 00:25:47,059
Uh, we can scale on

720
00:25:47,068 --> 00:25:49,098
on-prem and we can certainly scale even on

721
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:51,650
our mainframe-based environments, but there it's,

722
00:25:52,098 --> 00:25:54,180
it's more costly. Um, you sort of have

723
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,479
to build a lot of extra space anticipating,

724
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:59,219
uh, uh, ebbs and flows,

725
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,380
uh, especially around irregular operations when

726
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,259
data flows tend to.

727
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:04,779
Start to spike, um, and, uh, the

728
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:05,920
processing needs increase.

729
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:08,420
One of the main advantages of cloud is to be able to

730
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,680
allow the platform itself to kind of evolve with,

731
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:13,059
um, uh, those data demands and

732
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:14,199
then pull back,

733
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:16,900
um, so that we're being a little bit more optimal

734
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,140
once we have Blue skies day, um, that is

735
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,189
definitely in place,

736
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,660
um, and it is a big part of an advantage that we are now

737
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,318
taking, uh, able to take advantage of.

738
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:26,680
Uh, and

739
00:26:27,568 --> 00:26:29,650
I think when we were on our mainframe environment we were

740
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,739
able to enjoy platform stability,

741
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:34,130
but that's not the same thing as redundancy

742
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,449
and resiliency. As we grow the network,

743
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:39,000
uh, we stress that network and that

744
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,088
means that the systems that are kind of surrounding

745
00:26:41,088 --> 00:26:43,199
our environment, our mainframe may be stable, but the

746
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:44,348
data feeding into it

747
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:47,049
or the consuming systems that are pulling data

748
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:49,170
out of it may not be quite as stable. And

749
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,608
so, uh, by being able to shift

750
00:26:51,608 --> 00:26:52,588
to a more

751
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,449
data-focused resiliency strategy, we

752
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:56,890
can do things like park data.

753
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,259
Um, in a, uh, holding space and buffer

754
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:01,279
it so that we can create a much

755
00:27:01,618 --> 00:27:03,989
more efficient recovery strategy for downstream

756
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,019
consumers if something goes wrong with the

757
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:08,199
way they're, uh, taking data into their environment.

758
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:09,939
If something happens upstream,

759
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:11,680
uh, we can be in a position where,

760
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:12,939
uh, we can.

761
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:15,559
Um, whole processing in a much

762
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,009
more structured fashion now,

763
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:19,969
um, and be able to integrate, um, and wait for those, the,

764
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:21,949
uh, the, the upstream data to catch up,

765
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:23,618
um, so that we don't lose,

766
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,000
uh, or have to throw away records, um, and

767
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,039
then do a bunch of manual work, uh, and spend a day

768
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,500
and a half trying to recover from, uh,

769
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:32,140
a one hour system outage, those types of things.

770
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:35,098
We are taking advantage of the, um,

771
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,318
automated, uh, disaster recovery

772
00:27:37,318 --> 00:27:38,779
structure that comes along with cloud.

773
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,309
Um, and the more applications

774
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:43,588
that we move into the AWS cloud, the more we can take advantage

775
00:27:43,588 --> 00:27:45,689
of that of automated recovery.

776
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:50,439
No, we didn't just

777
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:52,449
uh re-platform. This is not a lift

778
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:54,568
and shift strategy. We worked with our partners

779
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:56,568
in order to adjust, um, and

780
00:27:56,568 --> 00:27:58,769
try to meet their needs as we evolved. Uh, we

781
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:01,029
completely revolutionized the front end screens,

782
00:28:01,449 --> 00:28:03,689
um, and today we have 4

783
00:28:03,689 --> 00:28:05,890
independent, uh, crew

784
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,930
applications that are all managed by different teams that

785
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,729
all integrate and combine with each other.

786
00:28:10,868 --> 00:28:13,328
All of those monolithic, uh,

787
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:15,598
independent cues that all went through a single

788
00:28:15,598 --> 00:28:17,949
independent queue have been broken down into more than 380

789
00:28:17,949 --> 00:28:19,380
microsurfaces now.

790
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,059
That is probably the,

791
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:23,269
uh, the,

792
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,630
uh, the, the, the single most advantageous

793
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,848
change that we made.

794
00:28:28,578 --> 00:28:30,809
In order to try to maintain resiliency,

795
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,219
one minor cue goes down. It won't clog

796
00:28:33,219 --> 00:28:35,259
the pipeline, um, and prevent critical

797
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:37,199
data from flowing into our environment now,

798
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:39,578
and it'll buy us time, especially in a,

799
00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:41,078
in a, uh, situation

800
00:28:41,578 --> 00:28:43,608
where we can monitor and see a microservice is, uh,

801
00:28:43,618 --> 00:28:46,250
struggling because of some unexpected data

802
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,279
condition, uh, to be able to recover and,

803
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:49,199
uh, quickly respond.

804
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:51,848
Um, overall,

805
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:54,818
um, the effort reduction for transactions,

806
00:28:54,838 --> 00:28:57,098
um, has diminished significantly. This isn't,

807
00:28:57,479 --> 00:29:00,250
um, a, uh, something our,

808
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:01,509
uh, resources, uh, have,

809
00:29:01,838 --> 00:29:03,900
uh, specifically, uh,

810
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,739
uh, come to appreciate.

811
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:07,779
Uh, we are growing and so

812
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,939
our manpower demands have not lessened, uh,

813
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:12,059
but the work that they do and the, uh, the

814
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,180
ease with which they operate is much easier

815
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,160
now that they have

816
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,420
decision support tools that are

817
00:29:17,818 --> 00:29:19,979
a lot more, uh, focused and, um, and

818
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:20,539
put together.

819
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,680
And uh on the data

820
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,779
uh front, we uh have been able

821
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:28,779
to centralize everything um and also take

822
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:30,318
advantage of a different uh

823
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,000
uh change that United has been putting in place

824
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,328
uh to centralize all of our data into a centralized

825
00:29:35,328 --> 00:29:36,009
data hub.

826
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:38,500
That is not necessarily and only part of the

827
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,489
program that we have built,

828
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:42,160
but by restructuring the data, uh, itself,

829
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:44,598
um, and putting it into a position where it could be

830
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:47,358
integrated into a centralized data hub strategy,

831
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,219
we've been able to enable a much bigger enterprise

832
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:51,509
change, um, and then.

833
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,390
Be able to plug in an entire analytics

834
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,309
industry into

835
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:57,789
uh trying to take advantage of that data in order to

836
00:29:57,789 --> 00:29:59,949
be able to create decision support tools to go even

837
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:00,578
beyond our

838
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,549
uh our system's capabilities.

839
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:06,380
Um, and then last but certainly not least,

840
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,568
uh, our training costs, uh,

841
00:30:08,578 --> 00:30:10,059
have, uh, have gone down.

842
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:13,219
Not to mention our, uh, attrition rates.

843
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,979
Uh, so the system that we have today is more nimble.

844
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,410
It's easier to use, uh,

845
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:20,180
it's more intuitive and

846
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,598
more aligned, I think, with, um,

847
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,939
the types of tools that people are expecting when

848
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:26,759
they come to work at a modern company.

849
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:29,549
Uh, tools that allow mouse clicks

850
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:31,410
instead of, uh, memorizing,

851
00:30:32,108 --> 00:30:32,729
um,

852
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,180
mainframe commands, uh, things like that,

853
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,828
um, and that is significantly, uh, reduced

854
00:30:37,828 --> 00:30:39,828
and created new opportunities for training.

855
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:40,848
It still takes a while,

856
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,828
uh, to become an expert crew scheduler. You

857
00:30:43,828 --> 00:30:46,019
still need to learn the puzzle and you need to understand the

858
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:48,410
network and the terminology and the impacts,

859
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:50,868
the fleet types and all of the rules that come along

860
00:30:50,868 --> 00:30:52,868
with it. But we

861
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:54,880
can now compartmentalize roles, um,

862
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,799
and make it easier so that maybe your

863
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,029
initial role when you join the team is a,

864
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:01,779
uh, uh, less impactful

865
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:04,219
role so that you can learn the ropes, um, and not

866
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:06,539
create disruption and that team now

867
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,618
has a lot those teams have much more flexibility

868
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:10,578
in managing new hires.

869
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:13,140
So at the end of the day what we have is, I think an

870
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,500
environment that takes into account people process and

871
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,539
technology changes all at once.

872
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,930
Going forward, uh, so we have

873
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:22,750
a few.

874
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:25,348
We're we're nowhere near done.

875
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,078
This is a transformative journey. Transformation

876
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:30,279
is a journey, not a destination, um.

877
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:34,239
Probably don't need to tell you that, uh, that's uh

878
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:35,338
stands for itself.

879
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,420
The when we stop innovating, uh, we start stagnating.

880
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:41,400
So these are just a few of the thoughts

881
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,420
that we have um as we move forward and I can talk

882
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,479
a little bit about what some of the strategies are

883
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:47,559
to undertake these activities, but.

884
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:50,469
Uh, one thing we can do, we can transform

885
00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:53,459
our environment now that we have a resilient

886
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:55,670
application, uh, that can, uh, integrate

887
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,809
with, uh, changes in a more efficient way

888
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:00,098
and the external applications that we're operating.

889
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,910
We can start to think about transforming the platform into

890
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,489
an intelligent workspace.

891
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,789
Uh, so what that means is, and

892
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:09,309
today the way our operating center works,

893
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,489
there is a central ops group, uh,

894
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,009
that manages the network schedule.

895
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,640
They themselves have to make decisions based off

896
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,439
of what crew are available,

897
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,959
uh, the maintenance schedule, and then the

898
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,150
ground handling operations that might be available,

899
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:24,680
all of which are mobilized resources

900
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,219
that make up important parts of our,

901
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,920
our fleet management and the way that we manage schedule

902
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,439
changes.

903
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,130
Uh, by

904
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,588
transforming the space we can feed

905
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:34,848
information into a centralized

906
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,469
tooling strategy in a much more efficient

907
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:38,529
manner and begin to get

908
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,489
predictive analytics,

909
00:32:40,989 --> 00:32:43,250
uh, and, um, other tools

910
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,309
embedded into those spaces so that all

911
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:47,670
of those teams can begin to work together in a much more efficient

912
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,189
manner.

913
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,750
That is probably the most exciting part of what we've

914
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,890
done here by enabling

915
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,750
and sort of, um, breaking the shack levels

916
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,068
or oral mainframe environment.

917
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,559
We can now

918
00:32:57,959 --> 00:33:00,140
start thinking about taking this data and um

919
00:33:00,318 --> 00:33:01,559
connecting it to

920
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,949
uh some of the AI tools that we have in order to be able

921
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:04,660
to proceed.

922
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:07,680
Um, we will talk a little bit more about the TCS partnership

923
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,680
shortly, but one of the areas that we've been looking

924
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,519
at with them.

925
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:13,828
TCS has a tool called Mastercraft.

926
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:16,199
This is an embedded platform that they have

927
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:17,098
inside their environment.

928
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,719
Um, that is used to drive

929
00:33:20,858 --> 00:33:22,979
a variety of, um, AI

930
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:24,189
related solutions.

931
00:33:24,578 --> 00:33:26,660
Uh, it's got an embedded large language

932
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,019
model and, uh, can also be connected

933
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:30,729
to a variety of applications.

934
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,920
We've started with some proof of concept evaluations

935
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,500
and what we would like to do with those tools,

936
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,979
um, is to take a look at some of

937
00:33:38,979 --> 00:33:40,979
the challenges that we have in this space and see if we

938
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:43,098
can plug in and embed

939
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:44,519
a, uh, integrated,

940
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,059
um, AI tool into the space so that we

941
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,430
can. Start to have the AI environment,

942
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,229
uh, start making decisions for us

943
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,769
and then also use those tools in order to evaluate

944
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:55,848
the requirements that we have in order

945
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:57,848
to facilitate making some of those adjustments

946
00:33:57,848 --> 00:33:58,809
as we go forward.

947
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,358
Those types of possibilities were not

948
00:34:01,358 --> 00:34:03,729
possible, uh, five years ago when we were

949
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:05,068
talking about leveraging a,

950
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:06,108
um,

951
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:08,628
uh, a centralized environment

952
00:34:08,628 --> 00:34:09,889
on a legacy platform.

953
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:13,590
Uh, observability

954
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:16,030
and, uh, evaluation,

955
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,849
uh, and reliability is a big part of

956
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:21,050
United's current focus and, and will

957
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,820
continue to be a part of that focus.

958
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,728
Um, establishing concepts like, uh,

959
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,000
creating a digital twin.

960
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,699
Now this is an interesting concept, I think. Um, it's

961
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,079
not just about platform transformation or creating

962
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,820
tools that technology resources can use

963
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,478
in order to be able to evaluate.

964
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,489
The health um um of the application

965
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,599
itself and maybe proactively get in front of preventing

966
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,239
issues although

967
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,878
this type of thing will help with that.

968
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:46,559
It also is, I think, a transformative change

969
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,719
for the, um, schedulers themselves, the people

970
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,449
that are using the platform.

971
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,300
They will eventually

972
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,119
shift away from transactional based

973
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,500
processing, thinking about how do I repair this flight.

974
00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:00,119
We'll move in the direction of letting the

975
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,579
tool take care of that instead.

976
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:05,530
And they will instead shift more towards a holistic

977
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,610
view and so

978
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:09,128
a digital twin will allow our resources

979
00:35:09,128 --> 00:35:11,050
to take a broad look at the spectrum,

980
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,648
think about how crew fits into a broader ecosystem,

981
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:15,849
and then begin to partner with their business teams in order

982
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:16,590
to be able to make

983
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,239
strategic decisions.

984
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,409
There are certain things that are always going to be, uh, unanticipated

985
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:22,708
changes that are going to come in.

986
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:24,949
Uh, some route will close,

987
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:26,148
uh, because of a.

988
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:29,168
Political, uh, circumstance or

989
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,208
an unprecedented change that was just

990
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,869
not anticipated related to

991
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,579
something like a COVID event or a crowd strike event,

992
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,250
we're going to need, uh, people in humans

993
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,110
in the loop

994
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,610
in order to be able to, uh, aggregate

995
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,728
those, uh, decision trees into

996
00:35:43,728 --> 00:35:44,949
an automated solution

997
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:47,389
and if we can start to think differently, um,

998
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:49,449
and bring our tools up a level and

999
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,449
have the people think differently about the way that they're thinking about their

1000
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,250
ecosystem.

1001
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:54,889
They can be a lot more effective and then respond

1002
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:56,969
much more quickly and effectively against those

1003
00:35:56,969 --> 00:35:59,128
types of um those types of events that

1004
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:00,610
that occur. Uh,

1005
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:02,289
and then, um.

1006
00:36:03,478 --> 00:36:06,269
Probably one of the most exciting changes, uh,

1007
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,849
big, uh, adjustment, I think

1008
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:10,599
on the analytics space, um, but

1009
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,539
thinking through agentic AI.

1010
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,898
Uh, Agentech AI is,

1011
00:36:16,398 --> 00:36:17,039
uh.

1012
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,668
You know, I think a buzzword, uh, thrown around,

1013
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,389
um, it's, uh, a, um, aspirational

1014
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,550
goal, uh, but if you think about what

1015
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,969
crew scheduling is, um, and what its

1016
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:30,228
operation is, it's a series of complex

1017
00:36:30,228 --> 00:36:32,228
decisions. It's not one giant decision, it's

1018
00:36:32,228 --> 00:36:34,750
a, a subseries of of

1019
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,769
repeatable but integrated tasks

1020
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,750
that require a little bit more than just predictive

1021
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,550
decision tree making.

1022
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:43,349
Um, but need to aggregate information

1023
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:45,610
from other sources. It is an ideal platform,

1024
00:36:46,188 --> 00:36:48,188
uh, for building an agentic AI, but it is

1025
00:36:48,188 --> 00:36:49,269
a complicated

1026
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,889
execution. And so

1027
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,539
that is where we're turning attention next. So we're trying to

1028
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:56,409
think about innovative ways to, to think through identifying

1029
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:58,139
commonality points,

1030
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,110
look for automation potential,

1031
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,789
um, and, um.

1032
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:05,039
Execute on trying to uh build

1033
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,579
a strategy where we

1034
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:08,938
uh can have the uh

1035
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,000
machine learning take care of the decision tree for us

1036
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,539
rather than rely on human capital.

1037
00:37:13,918 --> 00:37:16,199
If we can do that, we really free ourselves,

1038
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,579
I think from the uh the confines of,

1039
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,320
uh, transaction-based processing,

1040
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,840
um, shift people into a different mindset where they're trying

1041
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,159
to just make that,

1042
00:37:25,478 --> 00:37:26,860
uh, system work better

1043
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:29,559
by injecting more and more insight into

1044
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:31,599
the decisions that, uh, the machines themselves are

1045
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,360
making so.

1046
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:34,840
That is where we will take the space next, um,

1047
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,030
especially now that the core platforming is in place,

1048
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:38,188
um, and as

1049
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,849
AI tooling evolves and partners

1050
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:43,530
like AWS and TCS begin continue to evolve

1051
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,789
their platforms, United will continue to take advantage

1052
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:48,039
of the expertise that comes from,

1053
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:49,418
from those spaces.

1054
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:53,438
Um, and that takes me a little bit to the partnership model.

1055
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,478
Um, so I wanna talk a little bit about this, um.

1056
00:37:57,728 --> 00:38:00,269
United is an expert in um

1057
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:02,648
airline management, right? We are a,

1058
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,949
we're, you can argue we're

1059
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,610
maybe not just one company but a host

1060
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,648
of different companies. We're a digital technology

1061
00:38:09,648 --> 00:38:12,039
company. We're a catering services

1062
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,320
organization. We're a maintenance company.

1063
00:38:14,398 --> 00:38:16,648
We are an airline, uh,

1064
00:38:16,688 --> 00:38:17,409
we are a

1065
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,429
uh crew management, uh,

1066
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,329
organization. All of these things require disparate

1067
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:22,849
and

1068
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:24,429
distributed,

1069
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:26,148
um, expertise.

1070
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:28,958
Uh, I think somebody told me this the other day,

1071
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:31,199
it takes something like 30,000

1072
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:33,320
applications to get a passenger from the point where they

1073
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,039
purchase

1074
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:35,539
a ticket

1075
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,199
to the part where they arrive at their destination and take their

1076
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,260
bag off of the baggage carousel. Um,

1077
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:42,019
that is a lot of technology

1078
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,458
that's standing between you and your destination.

1079
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,039
Uh, it is a really complicated, uh, puzzle to

1080
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,418
solve, and it's a really exciting industry to be a part of.

1081
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,478
How do we do it? We do not do it alone. Uh,

1082
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,918
and so what we have found, and I think that this

1083
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,389
program is a really good example of that.

1084
00:38:56,878 --> 00:38:58,219
Uh, we've been able to take advantage,

1085
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,800
um, of, uh, some really strong partners.

1086
00:39:00,898 --> 00:39:02,909
Um, we see the

1087
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:05,219
implementation in particular of this

1088
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:06,378
program as a,

1089
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,860
um, example of the success that can come when you

1090
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:11,800
take a core domain based

1091
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,978
group that has its own,

1092
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:15,978
um, capability set in United

1093
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:18,579
leverage a powerhouse

1094
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:19,340
delivery partner

1095
00:39:19,878 --> 00:39:22,079
like TCS that leverages an on and

1096
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:22,739
offshore,

1097
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,820
uh, flexible delivery model.

1098
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,648
Um, and then marry that up against a, uh, best

1099
00:39:27,648 --> 00:39:29,989
in class platform that is also

1100
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:32,090
replete with its own expertise

1101
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,320
that we can take advantage of

1102
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:35,809
for innovative changes and platforming tools

1103
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:37,878
like AWS. Uh, all three

1104
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:38,590
of those,

1105
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,530
uh, those groups

1106
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,688
are, I think, uh, paramount to the success

1107
00:39:43,688 --> 00:39:44,550
of being able to,

1108
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,500
to truly take an indus uh, an industry platform,

1109
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,208
uh, that goes back maybe 4 decades and transform

1110
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:52,369
it. This pattern you are seeing,

1111
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:53,010
um.

1112
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,309
Repeated elsewhere at United, we have other mainframe

1113
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:56,820
applications.

1114
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,429
We have other, uh, challenges to solve

1115
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:00,309
and, uh,

1116
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:03,010
simply leaning in on this model um has yielded

1117
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,070
really great results and enabled for us

1118
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,989
to accelerate our cloud migration journey.

1119
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,389
It doesn't come for free.

1120
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:11,688
Uh, there is a cost, uh,

1121
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:13,539
uh, for partnership,

1122
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,070
you get out of a partnership what you put into it,

1123
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,849
and I think

1124
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:19,429
really thinking through how we work with

1125
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:21,369
these partners and engage with them,

1126
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:24,070
uh, is what's paid, is what's paid dividends.

1127
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,369
We have to change our own,

1128
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,228
uh, strategies for how we think about our

1129
00:40:28,228 --> 00:40:30,309
technology, break through our own silos, and challenge

1130
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:30,969
our own,

1131
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,128
uh, notions in order to be able to accept insights.

1132
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,369
What I think I really like about this model.

1133
00:40:37,389 --> 00:40:39,688
If we, we have built a model where we,

1134
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:42,309
uh, try to make sure that everybody has a voice, all

1135
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:44,590
three, parties, all three

1136
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,489
partners,

1137
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,849
uh, and

1138
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:49,188
by creating an inclusive environment where

1139
00:40:49,188 --> 00:40:51,469
everybody has a chance to, to bring in their,

1140
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:52,789
their insight,

1141
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:55,429
the opportunity and chance to have somebody who maybe can

1142
00:40:55,429 --> 00:40:57,628
bring us all forward becomes much greater, and that

1143
00:40:57,628 --> 00:41:00,030
is, I, I think a pattern that has emerged, especially

1144
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,110
as we, um, uh, reached

1145
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:02,860
challenges.

1146
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:05,309
TCS and their expertise became, uh, an

1147
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:07,010
important partner of ours as we worked through.

1148
00:41:07,978 --> 00:41:09,610
Critical deadlines and

1149
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:11,519
addressing unexpected

1150
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:14,099
challenges as business partners' needs

1151
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:15,139
shifted over time.

1152
00:41:15,938 --> 00:41:18,019
Um, and we certainly leveraged AWS,

1153
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,500
um, and, um, not just their domain

1154
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,969
experience through their techno account,

1155
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,340
technical account managers, uh, that were part

1156
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,878
of our day to day operations,

1157
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,409
uh, but their own professional services

1158
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:30,918
organization to be able to tool up, uh, incremental expertise.

1159
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:34,050
United also has a, a structured

1160
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,409
series of enterprise teams that has been growing

1161
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:38,429
and, uh, in particular, I'd

1162
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,780
say in the last couple of years with some.

1163
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,309
Uh, recent leadership adjustments has created

1164
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:44,599
a significant platform for domain experience.

1165
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,469
So we can take that expertise from, uh, AWS,

1166
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,119
learn from it, and then capitalize on it and distribute

1167
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:52,179
it. I'm gonna repeat those patterns for

1168
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,349
other, uh, teams that are maybe implementing similar

1169
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:55,128
technologies.

1170
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:59,429
Uh, at the end of the day, what

1171
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:02,128
we have is a platform that, uh, yields

1172
00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:04,409
significantly increased resiliency,

1173
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:06,989
um, and, uh, has, um, paved

1174
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:09,269
the way for, uh, future opportunities.

1175
00:42:12,438 --> 00:42:14,969
Uh, real pleasure to be with you today. Uh,

1176
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:17,250
we do have a little bit of time for some

1177
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,289
questions. Uh, I think I'm told we can,

1178
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:21,469
uh, meet over here if you would like to

1179
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,208
probe a little bit deeper on anything that we've done today, we

1180
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,489
will make ourselves available and, uh, stay connected

1181
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:27,039
on the,

1182
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,840
uh, fringes here so that we can talk to you a little bit more about the

1183
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,590
solution that we've put together.

1184
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:33,539
Um, hope you're enjoying the conference

1185
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:35,869
and I look forward to seeing you, uh,

1186
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:38,530
in future years where we, uh, maybe evolve

1187
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,769
the platform to the next layer, uh, of delivery.

1188
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:41,570
Thank you for your time.
