  "abstract": "The AI-Driven Development Life Cycle (AI-DLC) represents a transformative approach to software engineering that positions AI as a central collaborator throughout the development process. Unlike traditional AI-assisted development methods, AI-DLC reimagines the entire software lifecycle through two key dimensions: AI-powered execution with human oversight and dynamic team collaboration. The methodology operates in three phases - Inception, Construction, and Operations - where AI initiates workflows while maintaining persistent context across all stages. This innovative approach delivers significant benefits including increased velocity, enhanced quality, improved market responsiveness, and better developer experience, all while ensuring critical human oversight and collaboration.",
  "abstract_cn": "AI驱动开发生命周期(AI-DLC)代表了软件工程的一种变革性方法,将AI定位为整个开发过程中的核心协作者。与传统的AI辅助开发方法不同,AI-DLC通过两个关键维度重新构想整个软件生命周期:具有人工监督的AI驱动执行和动态团队协作。该方法分为三个阶段——启动、构建和运营——其中AI发起工作流程,同时在所有阶段保持持久的上下文。这种创新方法带来了显著的优势,包括提高速度、增强质量、改善市场响应能力和更好的开发者体验,同时确保关键的人工监督和协作。",
