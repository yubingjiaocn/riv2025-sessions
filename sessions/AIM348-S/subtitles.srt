1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,170
- So, a little bit about myself

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,730
before we kinda jump into it.

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,290
Adrian Estala, as you
guys can read up here.

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,760
I'm the CDO at Starburst.

5
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,830
I was a CDO before I joined Starburst,

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,980
so oftentimes when I look at
these types of discussions,

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,840
it's not from a Starburst perspective,

8
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,280
it's from an ecosystem perspective,

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,040
and so I hope to kind of bring
to you a broader conversation

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,990
of strategy that includes Starburst.

11
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,053
So very nice to meet everybody.
Roger, why don't you tell us

12
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:23,040
about yourself?
- Yep. I am Raja Palaniswamy.

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,510
I work at MUFG, manage the enterprise data

14
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,390
and then do the data strategy
for the team right now.

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,650
- Fantastic, fantastic.

16
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,200
I had an opportunity
before we got started.

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,750
I always love to do this. So,
I walked the room a little bit

18
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,790
just to kinda get a
pulse for who's in here

19
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,020
and what the interest is,

20
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,630
and we have a, I won't point names,

21
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,300
but I've got some chief
product officers over here,

22
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,190
people that are in charge of product.

23
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,710
I've got teams on this
side that we talked to

24
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,230
that were really interested
in driving adopting

25
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,530
on the business side, really
pushing business self-service,

26
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,700
and those are two great topics.

27
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,950
Poor Raja's gonna have to work around me.

28
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,090
What we wanna do today here,

29
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,530
kind of in the conversation is

30
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,440
really bring to light the importance

31
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,260
of letting your business
teams really feel empowered

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,330
when they're driving the AI solutions.

33
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,070
And AI is very generic,

34
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,470
and I'm talking more on the GenAI side.

35
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,390
I'm talking more on the Agentic side.

36
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,060
I'm talking more about the
kind of conversational AI.

37
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,380
Maybe it's a bit more simpler.

38
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,450
I'm not talking machine learning.

39
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,900
I'm not gonna let my business
teams kind of drive ML ops,

40
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,260
but I do think when we get
business teams more involved

41
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,240
on actually being creative,
owning the art of the possible

42
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,670
with our AI capabilities, magic happens,

43
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,380
and a lot of the customers
and business teams

44
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,400
that I work with, I'm working
directly with business teams,

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,520
getting them excited,
building solutions together.

46
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,970
If you sat in on any of the
cloud sessions this morning,

47
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,803
it's amazing, right?

48
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:50,310
It feels so easy.

49
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,770
The ability to create,
the ability to build,

50
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,440
the ability to understand
how skills come together

51
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,970
to solve a solution.

52
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,070
These are all things
that our business teams

53
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,100
should be able to own
and drive on their own,

54
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,420
but there's a gap, right?

55
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,620
There's a gap that maybe it's
where some companies struggle

56
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,210
to drive that empowerment,

57
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,970
and that gap really comes down
to understanding your data

58
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,950
and being able to access your data, right?

59
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,130
And so, I kinda draw this
up in three simple blocks,

60
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,180
and Raja is down kind of
the journey over at MUFG,

61
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,890
and so what I wanna do
here is I wanna kinda

62
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,110
set the foundation for the talk track

63
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,880
in three simple layers,

64
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,850
and then I wanna dig
into Raja's experience

65
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,980
and what they're doing at MUFG

66
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,960
and the work they're doing to drive

67
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,510
business-driven AI innovation, right?

68
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,490
But let's start with the foundation first.

69
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,950
The first part of any foundation,
as I said a second ago,

70
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,630
the challenge is getting the data.

71
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,460
What we do is we allow our teams

72
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,050
to get data where it sits, right?

73
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,130
So I don't care if it's in the cloud,

74
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,390
I don't care if it's prem.

75
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,150
I prefer it to be in the lake.
It isn't always in a lake.

76
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,310
But Federation for a long
time is always what kinda

77
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,630
made Starburst famous, right?

78
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,180
That's what we've been
good at for a long time,

79
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,143
and that's great,

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,050
but if I can get to my data where it sits

81
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,120
without having to migrate
it, whether it's in the cloud

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,140
or on-prem, this next block is
what's most exciting, right?

83
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,420
And now you're hearing
a lot of excitement.

84
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,480
You're hearing a lot of buzz
around the semantic layer.

85
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,240
It's this business-facing semantic layer

86
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,070
that's the real game changer.

87
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,520
If I can access my data where
it sits without migrating it,

88
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,720
and I can start to organize

89
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,660
that data into logical data products

90
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,730
that my business teams can understand,

91
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,250
I told Raja this once before,
I said, "We wanna create

92
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,460
an experience when the business
teams walks in the room,

93
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,080
they recognize their data."

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,190
It's like walking in a family.

95
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,693
You know your cousins,
you know your family.

96
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:38,430
- Yep.
- You recognize your data.

97
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,350
It's easy for you to understand.

98
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,813
When you can create these
logical data products,

99
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,630
now, I don't care where the
data sits, I can organize it

100
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,910
into packages that my
business can understand,

101
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,050
it's a real game changer.

102
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,310
It's a true semantic layer

103
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,160
where you're abstracting
the legacy complexity

104
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,680
and you're giving the business
team something they can use.

105
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,450
And when you've done that,

106
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,970
now, business teams feel
a little bit more comfort.

107
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,090
Now, business teams feel
a lot more confidence

108
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,460
when they enter the room
and they say, "Look, I wanna

109
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,690
test out a new agent in Amazon.
I wanna test out a new agent

110
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,930
in any system. I just
need to get the data."

111
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,000
If they can ideate very quickly

112
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,680
because they can say, "I
need a little bit of this,

113
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,570
a little bit of this,
a little bit of this.

114
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,120
I wanna bring these governed, curated,

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,490
secure data products into my agent

116
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,640
and I wanna use them to
do an analytical exercise,

117
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,160
I can do that because
the data is already there

118
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,020
and I have the access in terms of security

119
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,180
and availability that
I need to get there."

120
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,290
Those are the three layers.

121
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,030
If you wanna think about what's the bridge

122
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,360
to get to business enablement for AI,

123
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,000
it's getting access to the
data through Federation.

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,760
It's creating a
business-facing semantic layer

125
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,110
that they understand.

126
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,750
In many cases, I build these
with the business teams.

127
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,580
Raja'll tell you, we've been building this

128
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,230
with his business teams,

129
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,240
and the third layer is in just

130
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,800
adopting these data products, right?

131
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,890
Using 'em directly in BI or AI solutions.

132
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,280
That's kind of the framework
that I like to talk about.

133
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,750
You don't wanna hear it from me,

134
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,010
you wanna hear it from Raja.

135
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:05,843
(Raja chuckles)
So, I apologize

136
00:05:05,843 --> 00:05:07,980
for the long intro, Raja,
but I've set the stage.

137
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,720
- Yep.
- Before I kinda

138
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,880
jump into some questions,

139
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,200
is there anything you would correct

140
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,060
or anything you would add
to what I just talked about

141
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,893
in that foundation?

142
00:05:15,893 --> 00:05:19,890
- I would say data needs
AI and AI needs data.

143
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,723
You know what I mean?
- Love it.

144
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:22,740
- It's a cycle.

145
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,420
So, I think I would say,
we started the journey,

146
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,850
like the traditional data strategy

147
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,620
where we'll consolidate everything

148
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,920
into physical consolidation,
move the data, curate the data,

149
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,680
profile the data, and then
do things accordingly.

150
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,960
We pivoted that and then
said, "Okay, can we create

151
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,060
data products in a logical way?"

152
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,070
And then those data products,

153
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,830
or what Adrian talked about, I will add is

154
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,750
the semantic layer is nothing but

155
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,620
from a business product
lens in a corporate world,

156
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,950
if you're from corporate
banking, you have lending,

157
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,250
like we have term loans, several
of those business products,

158
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,140
we aligned our business products

159
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,180
and data products to be identical,

160
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,037
so when a business user comes in,

161
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:08,580
there are business data producers

162
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,090
who create these curated data sets

163
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,000
from the semantic layer
so that they can create,

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,370
if, let's say we have
commercial loan operations,

165
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,730
that team wants to see the data
quality of the loan booking.

166
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,800
They are able to really curate the data

167
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,300
from the core products,

168
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,870
and then create a functional data model

169
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,540
or a data product that
is specific for them.

170
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,140
So, we gave the business users,
we created three personas

171
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,990
to Adrian's point,
business data producers.

172
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,510
We call them specifically
business data producers,

173
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,760
not IT or a CDO, am I right?

174
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,210
The data elites are in with the business,

175
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,610
so they know and speak the same language

176
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,200
that they can understand the data,

177
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,010
so I would add that for
us, it was more towards

178
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,538
how do we enable business
for self-sufficiency.

179
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:59,430
They should not be coming to IT

180
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,550
or data elites to understand
what data is there,

181
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,320
how it is related to the product,

182
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,420
how do I get access to that data?

183
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,870
So, this Starburst
provided us that capability

184
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,360
to pull data from multiple data sources,

185
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,820
whether it is distributed
environment, whether it is SaaS,

186
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,910
whether it is PaaS, whether
it is embedded systems

187
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,710
like Salesforce or any of those,

188
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,420
so we pulled that data in to create

189
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,220
the curated data products.

190
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,520
That enabled business for
them to be self-service.

191
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,900
- Perfect.

192
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,910
Was there a trigger, Raja,

193
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,760
that kinda, I don't wanna say forced,

194
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,110
but really kinda got you guys

195
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,460
to rethink your data strategy?

196
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,487
At what point did you guys say,

197
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:38,460
"Look, we've gotta do something different.

198
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,910
We have to maybe move
closer to the business.

199
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,460
We have to drive more self-service.

200
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,650
We have to find a way to
get our business teams

201
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,330
to trust more data." I don't
wanna give you the answers,

202
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,331
but (chuckles)-
- Yeah.

203
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:52,710
- What was the trigger at MUFG

204
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,530
to kind of force you to
rethink your old data strategy?

205
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,020
- I think time to market was the key.

206
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,980
How do we enable...

207
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,830
Because businesses making money as of now,

208
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,830
how do we in increase our
revenue generators' capability,

209
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,200
who are sitting within the
business, time to market?

210
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,387
Like how soon can we get the data

211
00:08:12,387 --> 00:08:14,880
for them to prepare
the data for themselves

212
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,033
rather than they coming
to IT, I'm from IT,

213
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,330
coming to IT or CDO.

214
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,880
How do we enable the
business to prepare the data

215
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,960
to be self-sufficient?

216
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,430
That was the pivotal point

217
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,530
that triggered us to be in this journey.

218
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,363
- Love it.

219
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:31,320
Let's give the audience an idea

220
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,970
of what a semantic layer might look like,

221
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,530
without giving away too
many of your secrets,

222
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,430
and so I'm gonna stay high level here.

223
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,820
When I talk about a semantic layer

224
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,590
that business teams can understand,

225
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,090
and then, forgive me, you
stop me if I go too far.

226
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,400
Within MUFG, we've got this
notion of core data products

227
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,530
and functional data products.

228
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,720
You can think about the
functional data products

229
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,610
as derivatives of the core.

230
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,680
Core data products are well curated.

231
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,140
I got data from maybe a hundred sources

232
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,510
and I've organized them into a small set

233
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,220
of core data products.

234
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,460
I've got one for customer,
I've got one for channel,

235
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,350
I've got one banking, I've
got one for like kind of

236
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,270
all my different big things,

237
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,500
and then functional,

238
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,207
you can imagine having
a lending team saying,

239
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:15,210
"I need a little bit of that
one, a little bit of that one,

240
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,190
a little bit of that one,
to make this data product,

241
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,023
and that a little..."

242
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:19,740
And so they're building
their own derivatives

243
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,800
in their function to kinda
answer their specific

244
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,290
functional questions or analytical needs,

245
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,123
so to speak, right?

246
00:09:26,123 --> 00:09:29,642
So, that's a model that
we're building at MUFG.

247
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:32,790
Now, tell me about your consumer,

248
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,310
your business teams on the function side.

249
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,330
Do they feel empowered?

250
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,750
Are they all jumping in,
or how is that working?

251
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,652
I didn't mean to do that. My
kids would go crazy, but...

252
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:42,673
(Raja laughs)

253
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:44,070
(Adrian laughs)
- It's a journey.

254
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,120
- Yeah.
- We have mixed

255
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,510
business users.

256
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,910
Some are very excited to see the data.

257
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,950
Some are like, "Okay,
get me halfway through.

258
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,510
I need to understand the data."

259
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,660
So we mixed up that with
data literacy programs

260
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,240
so that we can educate what data is there,

261
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,590
how they can access.

262
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,260
So it's mixed, like 50 50.

263
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,810
I would say some of the
users who are power users,

264
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,410
they are like, "Okay, I have my data

265
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,657
where I need from 50
different systems. I'm happy."

266
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,060
And then they can sail on their own.

267
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,050
They are self-sufficient.

268
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,400
- We're empowering business teams

269
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,950
to organize data in the
way that they need to.

270
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,890
Now, let's go back to the
third box, the AI box, right?

271
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,710
'cause that's kinda what we
really wanna talk about here.

272
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,740
If I can build a data
product that's curated,

273
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,870
the secret is business metadata.

274
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,370
It'd be one thing if
I'm just building data

275
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,690
from technical metadata.

276
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,970
- Yep.
- If I build a data product

277
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,640
with business metadata
at the column level,

278
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,230
at the table level, at the role level,

279
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,520
I've got real business
descriptions of that data product.

280
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,473
When you put that in front of an LLM,

281
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,380
you get very accurate analytics,

282
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,450
you get very performant analytics,

283
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,400
and so we can sit down
with a business team,

284
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,630
a lending team for example,

285
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,860
and say, "Here's your lending
data product. Go for it."

286
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,870
And it's not that you're
just giving them a solution

287
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,300
that they're gonna own forever.

288
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,670
You're giving them a capability

289
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,200
that they're going to evolve.

290
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,120
You want your business teams

291
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,780
to be able to look at the capability

292
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,030
and say, "Wait a minute, can it do this?

293
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,010
Can it do this? What if I add this skill?

294
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,570
What if I add that skill?"

295
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,400
The magic happens when the business teams

296
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,370
understand the data, and
they get the confidence

297
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,660
to work with AI.

298
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,430
They're not afraid to break something,

299
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,820
because in a data product,
you're only exposing this data.

300
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,323
That's it. Nothing else.

301
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,330
In a locked-in system,
there's really clear,

302
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,820
I love your three Gs.
What are your three Gs?

303
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,710
- Guidance, guardrails, and governance.

304
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,100
- You're giving 'em the
guardrails and the governance

305
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,830
and the guidance to experiment,

306
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,180
and so at the end of the day,

307
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,270
you're decreasing the time to experiment

308
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,190
and you're lowering
the cost to experiment.

309
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,720
So, I always say, I wanna do
10 AI projects in 10 weeks

310
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,510
versus one AI project in 18 months, right?

311
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,610
And they're all going to succeed,

312
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,340
but you can succeed on the three

313
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,140
and keep going forward
and fail on the seven.

314
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,720
If that's the, that's probably
not the right failure, right,

315
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,130
we all want, but that's the reality

316
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,150
when you're experimenting.

317
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,203
Not everything works.

318
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,700
On the AI side, Raja, I know
that we're just kinda starting

319
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,790
to build that foundation
for those data products.

320
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,280
How are you looking at the
Agentic front end to this

321
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,470
in the future?
- I think we are looking

322
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,860
at the AI landscape in two forms.

323
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,220
One is to make use of
all the data management,

324
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,900
enable the data management capabilities,

325
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,260
whether it is profiling,
whether it is lineage

326
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,850
or any of those.

327
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,850
Second part is we want our business users

328
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,471
to start chatting with the data.

329
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:43,837
We want our business users to say,

330
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:46,320
"Okay, can you give me
all the middle-market

331
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,360
banking customers."

332
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,670
We wanted to provide them that capability,

333
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,650
and then we provide them that list.

334
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,720
We also make sure that we integrate that

335
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,910
with our authentication mechanism.

336
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,740
We don't want middle-market
banking customers

337
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,130
to be exposed to who is
not authorized to do it,

338
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,580
so it's a mix of getting the chat,

339
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,390
using AI to enable data products,

340
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:14,190
get the lineage, get the
profiling, get the cataloging,

341
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,080
tagging, those kind of things.

342
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,140
That's part one, because
by having Starburst,

343
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,670
what's happening is it's enabling us

344
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,240
to go into one location, rather
than 50 different systems

345
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,790
that we have to go and do that across.

346
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,160
The other part of is people can,

347
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,100
as soon as they come to
Starburst, they can click on it.

348
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,310
We want to invoke the
chatting with that data,

349
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,620
using the Agentic
features that is available

350
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,830
to us, using Amazon
Bedrock and other features,

351
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,380
where everything is in one box

352
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,120
so that they can come to something called

353
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,950
real data marketplace.

354
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,800
So, that's kind of the objective of that.

355
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,960
- There's a point that I
wanted to underscore there,

356
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,970
'cause it's agility on the two sides.

357
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,860
If I have a semantic layer that I built

358
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,830
with my business teams, and
the semantic layer, logical,

359
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,570
doesn't care where the data comes from.

360
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,240
You can leave it there.
You can connect to it.

361
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,300
It's also the agility on the
front of that semantic layer,

362
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,340
saying, "I can build an agent."

363
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,000
I mean, if you look around
here, there's so many cool AI

364
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,130
or Agentic-type solutions, right?

365
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,370
If I'm a CEO, I wanna try them all,

366
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,870
but if every one of them is attached

367
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,120
to some core platform, it's expensive.

368
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,410
If every one of them requires me

369
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,230
to go model data a certain
way, it's expensive.

370
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,760
If I can deliver data
products to any agent,

371
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,910
and I can tell my business
teams, "I've got the guardrails,"

372
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,847
I'm gonna steal this from you,

373
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:35,610
"Got the governance and the guidance.

374
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,587
I will deliver the data to you."

375
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,670
Maybe you can build, you
can try any agent you want

376
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,170
on the front end, I don't care.

377
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,283
Build any agent. I'm gonna make
sure you get the right data.

378
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,730
Use any source, I'm gonna
make sure I connect to it

379
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,563
in the right way.

380
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:54,480
It's just incredible flexibility
and incredible agility

381
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,660
and ultimately offers you at longer term,

382
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,640
the opportunities to make better choices.

383
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,900
- Yep. Yeah.

384
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,810
What I would add is in this journey,

385
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,703
business plays a pivotal role.

386
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,690
Business is in partnership with us

387
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,110
for us to enhance the data
capabilities across the board,

388
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,190
and that comes by, I would say

389
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,170
it's a trust-building scenario

390
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,500
where we allow them to prepare data,

391
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,170
and also, it's a centralized location

392
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,530
where you have all the data
that you can really curate,

393
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,270
get things to the next level.

394
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,600
In fact, we improve our
data quality indexes

395
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,970
by pulling data through Starburst so that

396
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,480
when it's fed into any AI for modeling,

397
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,730
it has much more rich data quality.

398
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,467
- I like what you said earlier,
we were talking, you said,

399
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:46,530
"I use AI for data

400
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,607
and I use data for AI."
- Yeah. Yeah.

401
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:49,200
- Can you explain that a little bit?

402
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,200
- Yeah, so, when I say I use data for AI,

403
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,240
is to learn through the LLM models,

404
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,210
the entire content that is rich content

405
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,860
that we have in the organization.

406
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,070
Whether it is structured data
sitting in our deal file,

407
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,810
whether it is, sorry, unstructured data

408
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,370
that is sitting in our deal file,

409
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,740
or structured data that is in our systems,

410
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,980
so that data, we can feed it into AI

411
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,860
for learning more about the insights.

412
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,760
The other side is where
we need AI for data,

413
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,250
we wanted to use AI for tagging purposes.

414
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,280
We want to use for AI
for lineage creation.

415
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,650
We want to use AI for profiling.

416
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,050
So, those are the insights
that we can create.

417
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,462
So data for AI and AI for data.

418
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:34,590
- Love it. I love it.
- Yeah.

419
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,840
- Fantastic. Fantastic.

420
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,782
I'm gonna pause to see if
I've got any questions.

421
00:16:38,782 --> 00:16:40,920
(crowd drones)

422
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,930
Awesome. Thank you very
much for your time.

423
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,971
Really appreciate your interest.

424
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:44,804
- Thank you.
- We have a booth,

425
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,530
just down the hall here at 550.

426
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,460
Happy to talk some more.

427
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,622
- Yeah, thank you. Thank you guys.

428
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:50,022
(crowd applauds)
Thank you.
