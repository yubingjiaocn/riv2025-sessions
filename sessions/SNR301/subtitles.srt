1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,170
- All right, good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,880
My name is Jake Burns.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,880
Today we're gonna talk about migrations.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,240
So this stat is interesting

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,213
because it hasn't changed
much in the past few years.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,580
Cloud computing generates

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,540
over 100 billion in annual revenue,

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,430
yet still 85% of the global
IT spend is still on premises.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,043
So the question is why?

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,140
And it's been my observation
that this is not a choice,

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,530
most organizations want
to be in the cloud.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,453
It's just that most of the
ones that I've worked with,

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,170
they're not having an easy go at it.

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,330
They're struggling in some way.

15
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,350
And so I've spent
probably the last 10 years

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,410
analyzing this in some shape or form,

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,510
either migrating personally

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,220
or talking to and advising
executives on how to do it.

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,980
And in the past 12 months,
really focusing on this,

20
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,000
like, why is this the case?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,033
Why is migrating so difficult?

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,320
And so I'm going to attempt
to answer that here.

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,210
and I'm gonna try to leave
a lot of time at the end

24
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,580
for Q&A, because some of
the things I talk about,

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,800
it starts off very simple,

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,650
but a lot of it can be counterintuitive,

27
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,000
so I wanna give you an
opportunity to ask me questions.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,820
So I have a very interesting
role here at AWS.

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,850
I'm part of the Executives
in Residence team.

30
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,297
We're a team that's comprised
of former CIOs and CTOs

31
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:40,827
and other senior leaders

32
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:43,530
who have all led large
scale transformations

33
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,810
using AWS cloud in our prior roles.

34
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,030
So we've been on the customer side

35
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,600
and we've all successfully
led a transformation.

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,310
And so on top of that, we have
a lot of these conversations

37
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,930
with senior leaders across
all industries globally

38
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,000
on various topics, but
I tend to talk about

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,320
the ones who wanna talk about migration,

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,790
I get to talk to those.

41
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,640
So I've had hundreds
of those conversations

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,690
in the last seven years.

43
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,260
And so I've got to see the
good, the bad, and the ugly.

44
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,340
So before this, I was with
Live Nation/Ticketmaster

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,320
and I led a all-in migration to AWS.

46
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,183
Now I had a 12 month deadline.

47
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,600
Largely legacy systems,

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,830
things that were not born in the cloud,

49
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,080
not meant to be run in the cloud,

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,730
no budget and frozen head count.

51
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,290
And the team that I had at the time

52
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,610
had no experience with the cloud.

53
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,860
And cloud wasn't really cool at the time.

54
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,690
It was back in 2015,

55
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,690
it was the stone age
when it comes to cloud.

56
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,240
Now we didn't do it in
12 months, we did in 17,

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,450
but we were able to get some
impressive metrics out of it.

58
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,130
So impressive that we still talk about

59
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,180
this migration a decade later,

60
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,950
reduced our total cost of ownership

61
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,590
by nearly half after optimization.

62
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,080
Before optimization, it was about 18%.

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,110
So that's a result of having no budget.

64
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,600
It's either do it cost neutral or fail,

65
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,150
and we weren't willing to fail.

66
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,600
Our availability got better,
our resiliency got better.

67
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,723
All of our performance
issues got resolved.

68
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,850
And so a lot of the questions I get

69
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,350
are like, how did you do that?

70
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,770
Well, the cloud, I think
most people know by now,

71
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,910
is very elastic,

72
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,100
and so it's very easy
to find the bottlenecks.

73
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,220
So the key is really
matching your capacity

74
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,430
and your utilization

75
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,490
so you can reduce your costs

76
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,200
while reducing or eliminating

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,880
your performance bottle
necks at the same time.

78
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,293
That's basically the key.

79
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,970
Now, there's six things
that I've identified

80
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,550
because I've looked at a lot
of migrations since then.

81
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,190
What's different between the
experience that I went through

82
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,560
and the experience that I
see on a almost daily basis.

83
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,770
And I hear from customers
on a almost daily basis.

84
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,870
And to be clear, some
of them are successful,

85
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,010
but not all of them are.

86
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,500
And it's my goal to make
all of them successful.

87
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,290
So what are the successful
ones have in common?

88
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,543
Well, I've identified these six pillars.

89
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,990
First is they have a compelling why.

90
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,870
Now, this can't be because
we wanna save money

91
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,030
or because the CEO said so.

92
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,370
It has to be something that the people

93
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,850
who you're depending on,
hopefully your own employees,

94
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,380
are going to really care about.

95
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,940
This should be your company's mission.

96
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,940
This should be, you know,
something that drives them.

97
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,495
Because when things get hard,

98
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:33,420
they're gonna need to be
able to push through that.

99
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,100
Two is utilize constraints,

100
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,380
and this is one that
could be counterintuitive.

101
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,480
You know, when people hear about my story,

102
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,130
you know, 12 month deadline,
no budget, frozen headcount,

103
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,890
and then still was able to be successful,

104
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,350
I sometimes say "That's
why we were successful."

105
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,210
A lot of the migrations that I see fail

106
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,730
are the ones that have too many resources,

107
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,860
and we'll get into that
a little bit more later.

108
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,450
Third is the invest in people,

109
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,580
and this one should be a no brainer.

110
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,740
The more skilled your
workforce is in cloud,

111
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,900
the better they're gonna be
at migrating to the cloud

112
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,400
and at operating in the cloud.

113
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,090
And so the investment is completely key.

114
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,020
Building momentum in a
migration or any transformation,

115
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,230
and a lot of this applies to
AI transformations as well,

116
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,860
it's super key because things
tend to start off slow,

117
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,340
and then as you start
winning that compounds.

118
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,220
And inertia can compound as well,

119
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,710
you could just keep going slow as well.

120
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,269
Embracing simplicity is is the next one.

121
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,850
And I would say this is probably

122
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,100
the biggest one that I see violated.

123
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,100
I see, excess complexity in
my opinion, is the root cause

124
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,590
of failed migrations and failed
transformations in general.

125
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,530
And so what this means is most
of the things that people do

126
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,450
when they migrate are
simply not necessary.

127
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,570
Or the ones that are necessary,
they're far too complex.

128
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,620
And last but not least,

129
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,530
and this is a hard requirement,
is having strong leadership.

130
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,660
You have to have somebody
who's accountable,

131
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,660
and they have to be, have
the authority to do things

132
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,100
and it doesn't have to
be a lot of authority,

133
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,870
but they need to be accountable

134
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,580
for those things that
they have authority for,

135
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,730
and they need to have
a little bit of guts.

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,090
So for past seven years, like I said,

137
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,400
I've been talking to
hundreds of executive teams

138
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,350
on the topic of migration

139
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,240
and I hear the same objections
over and over again.

140
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,470
So Live Nation/Ticketmaster,

141
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,890
we were, Live Nation is an
entertainment company, right?

142
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,050
So I'll talk to an energy company,

143
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,460
they'll say, "Well that would never work

144
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,380
for an energy company," right?

145
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,628
So we're special, right?

146
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,600
Or the scope is too big.

147
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,040
So we migrated, you know,

148
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,120
we're $11 billion revenue
runway business at the time,

149
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,730
much more today, but there are companies

150
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,780
that are much bigger than that

151
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,700
and they can very easily say

152
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,010
it would never work at our scale.

153
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,913
And the third most common,
it's almost always these three,

154
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,060
is that we have unique
regulatory requirements.

155
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,220
So like the cloud won't work for us,

156
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,730
or it's hard for us to migrate
that quickly because of that.

157
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,650
But the thing is, when you strip away

158
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,020
all the assumptions and complexity,

159
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,390
cloud migration is really simple.

160
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,460
It's really moving your
applications and data

161
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,410
from one place to another,

162
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,930
sometimes it's a virtualized environment

163
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,010
in your data center,

164
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,290
to a virtualized environment in the cloud.

165
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,810
And yes, maybe it's a
different technology,

166
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,110
but most of us who are
doing cloud migrations,

167
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,120
we've done data center
consolidations in the past,

168
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,170
it's very similar.

169
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,390
It doesn't have to be that much different.

170
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,070
So I could say this with
confidence because I've done it,

171
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,570
but I could say it even
more with confidence now

172
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,300
because I've helped so
many others do it as well.

173
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,500
It really is the simple.

174
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,040
Now there are workloads that
are difficult to migrate,

175
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,510
you know, mainframes for example,

176
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,430
that require full refactor.

177
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,170
But those are unique edge cases.

178
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,273
Those are not the most common.

179
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,890
So a more generalized
approach is a better approach.

180
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,860
Let's manage the exceptions as exceptions.

181
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,060
And let's take the complexity

182
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,373
out of the 99% that could be easy.

183
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,680
So a good migration
framework is universal.

184
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,530
It'll work in every industry
because your servers don't care

185
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,350
what industry your business is in.

186
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,980
It's effective at any scale
because a good framework,

187
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,560
any good framework is
a scalable one, right?

188
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,340
You take something that
works and you scale it up.

189
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,670
And this has been proven with
this methodology as well.

190
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,380
And it should have compliance built in,

191
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,480
a good framework should
not violate compliance,

192
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,933
it should be flexible
enough to handle compliance.

193
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,700
So there's some lessons that I've learned

194
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,200
through this process,

195
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,330
and some of them can be a
little bit counterintuitive.

196
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,680
This is one of them.

197
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,880
You're more likely to fail

198
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,740
from too few constraints
than from too many.

199
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,780
This is one that people find surprising.

200
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,860
It's like, "Wait a minute,

201
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,390
you're gonna take resources away from me

202
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,560
and I'm gonna be more successful."

203
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,150
Yes, that's usually the case.

204
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,360
Most cloud migrations are overfunded

205
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,180
and their deadlines are
way too long in the future.

206
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,210
I had a 12 month deadline,
it took me 17 months.

207
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,163
If I had a 17 month deadline,

208
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:06,330
I think it would've taken me two years.

209
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,590
If you gave me two years,

210
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,963
maybe it never would've
get done at all, right?

211
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,450
So some of you may be
familiar with Parkinson's Law.

212
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,750
Basically it explains why, in college,

213
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,750
when your homework is due,
you do it, you start it

214
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,760
the night before instead of like a week

215
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,810
when it was assigned.

216
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,470
We typically have too much time

217
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,790
and too many resources do things.

218
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,560
Now you can take this too far,

219
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,800
but work will expand to fill
up that time that you have.

220
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,530
So if you give yourself five
years to do a migration,

221
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,990
it's going to take five years minimum.

222
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,177
Nobody sets out to do
a five year migration

223
00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:44,880
and it takes two years, right?

224
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,160
But you could set out to
do a one year migration,

225
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,120
it take a year and a half,

226
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,010
that's a much more common pattern.

227
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,160
So what this does is when you set

228
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,050
these seemingly unrealistic goals,

229
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,650
it gives you a sense of urgency.

230
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,000
And if you don't have
that sense of urgency,

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,730
if you have too much time,
you never get started.

232
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,250
If you have too much time,

233
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,500
say you have a hundred things to do,

234
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,170
most of us, we're gonna
pick out of that hundred,

235
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,570
which one to attack first,
the easiest one, right?

236
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,160
Let's just take the easy one off the list.

237
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,950
But if you had to pick
only 10, you're gonna pick

238
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,470
one of the most top 10 impactful ones.

239
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,900
And that's what the sense of
urgency does, the constraint,

240
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,850
it forces you to focus on what matters.

241
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,310
And innovation, why innovate
if you don't have to?

242
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,630
As human beings, we're lazy.

243
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,150
This isn't a bad thing,
it's efficiency, right?

244
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,040
So if it's worked for us in the past,

245
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,450
it's probably gonna work
for us in the future.

246
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,390
So if we've been doing
migrations like this

247
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,450
for this amount of time, why
not keep doing it that way?

248
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,070
Well, the reason is because we can't.

249
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,210
And constraint forces that.

250
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,310
So you're more likely to
succeed with constraints

251
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,143
than you are without.

252
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:53,220
This is one of my conclusions.

253
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,400
And nobody wants their
budget taken away from them.

254
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,830
Nobody wants to be under
an unrealistic deadline.

255
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,580
But you can, this is where
the innovation comes from

256
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,590
and this is where the
efficiency comes from,

257
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,030
and it makes for a much
more interesting story

258
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,480
when the odds are stacked against you

259
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,540
and you succeed anyway,
and you'd be surprised.

260
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,540
So instead you put
constraints into motion,

261
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,860
and then you find a way.

262
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,080
So a deadline forces you to find a way.

263
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,930
So for me, I had to begin
before I felt ready.

264
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,461
This is something that I was told,

265
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:32,670
begin before you feel ready, right?

266
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,150
So I was given the mandate
to migrate in December.

267
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,340
I started beginning of January, why?

268
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,480
Because I had 12 months.

269
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,090
I'm not gonna waste any days, right?

270
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,230
I had to focus on what mattered.

271
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,510
I couldn't get distracted by things

272
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,460
and had to work backwards from a goal.

273
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,440
All right, so it's
easy, 12 month deadline,

274
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,270
we're gonna be done by Christmas

275
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,770
and work backwards from there.

276
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,960
So a budget, and more
specifically a budget

277
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,160
that's smaller than you
would like it to be,

278
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,360
forces you to become lean,

279
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,393
forces you to invent and
simplify, as we say at AWS.

280
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,700
You have to find a new way of doing things

281
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,750
because the old way,

282
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,910
we just don't have the
money to do it anymore.

283
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,730
And that's where new things get invented.

284
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,940
And in my case, a limited
headcount, what it did,

285
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,840
it forced me to motivate my existing team.

286
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,100
So I talked about in the beginning

287
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,930
how I had a frozen headcount, no budget.

288
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,730
So I couldn't hire cloud experts

289
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,590
to come in and do the migration.

290
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,840
So I had to develop a skill.

291
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,640
In order to be successful,
I had to develop the skill

292
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,250
of motivating my team, getting
them upskilled very quickly

293
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,560
and enabling them to be successful.

294
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,250
Now, it's not an easy thing to do.

295
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,410
I'll give you the playbook
and I'll answer your questions

296
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,390
and I'll tell you exactly how to do it.

297
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,930
But once you do that, it is
like having a superpower.

298
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,890
When you can take people

299
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,180
who don't have the skill that you need,

300
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,370
and this is applicable
to AI right now too,

301
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,070
everybody's looking for AI talent.

302
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,860
Good luck hiring those people,
they're in high demand.

303
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,540
But you could take the people you have

304
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,190
and if you can get them interested in it

305
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,064
and you can get them able to learn it,

306
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:04,230
and then you can get them able to use it

307
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,440
and in a meaningful way
within your organization,

308
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,660
you could have an endless
pipeline of talent.

309
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,280
And that is, as a leader,

310
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,853
it's one of the most liberating
feelings you can have.

311
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,313
So one of the other things that I see,

312
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,990
I would say anti-pattern is conflating,

313
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,070
and this one's a little controversial,

314
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,020
conflating migration and modernization.

315
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,089
The way I look at it is this, migrating,

316
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:33,690
if people are having a hard time migrating

317
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,220
and people are having a
hard time modernizing,

318
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,360
if you combine both of them,

319
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,250
it's like complexity times complexity.

320
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,160
So your odds of success go down.

321
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,500
And then the common objection

322
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,950
is, "Well, a lift and
shift gives you no value."

323
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,450
Well first of all, I'd argue that,

324
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,283
because your data's in the cloud

325
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:51,150
and you can use that for AI workloads

326
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,790
and you can do other things as well.

327
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,220
But I'll largely agree with that.

328
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,250
But I'll also say that you
are more likely to migrate

329
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,070
or modernize more quickly,

330
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,920
like your apps will be more modern

331
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,803
and a date sooner than they would be,

332
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,460
if you were to migrate then modernize,

333
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,800
separate them, decouple them.

334
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,410
Separate the complexity
into different stages.

335
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,060
Your modernization will be done sooner

336
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,280
than if you try to do them
both at the same time.

337
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,320
So migrate so you can modernize sooner.

338
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,153
So you can be in the cloud

339
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,173
and you can use all the
great cloud services.

340
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,617
So this is a quote, this
is me from way long ago.

341
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:32,580
"I don't hire cloud
engineers, I build them."

342
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,960
This is what I would say because
that's how I felt about it.

343
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,690
I was building, it's kind
of a weird way to say it,

344
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,210
but I was building a
pipeline of cloud engineers.

345
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,390
I didn't hire a single
cloud engineer, ever.

346
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,870
I created them out of
people who had IT skills,

347
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,400
but they didn't have cloud talent.

348
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,160
I think we could do this with
AI as well, with any skill.

349
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,940
If they have competency and motivation,

350
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,640
you can build a pipeline
from existing employees.

351
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,140
And so this is the
strategy that I recommend.

352
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,890
Insource your cloud transformation.

353
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:13,190
If you outsource it, which is
the default that people do,

354
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,940
it's going to be seen as a threat.

355
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,337
And why wouldn't it, right?

356
00:15:16,337 --> 00:15:18,570
'Cause you're basically telling your team

357
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,370
that you have no confidence
that they could do it.

358
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,470
We're bringing in others to do it for you.

359
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,540
It also has a problem

360
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,910
of these people who you bring in to do it,

361
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,090
you're training them and
giving them experience

362
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,080
and then they take that knowledge
with them when they leave.

363
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,300
So in my experience, in my opinion,

364
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,190
they should be paying
you for that experience.

365
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,750
That experience is very valuable.

366
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,210
So you're robbing your
team of that experience.

367
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,160
And then it also incentivizes
short-term thinking.

368
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,300
Because if you think about it,

369
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,460
if you have some hired guns that come in

370
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,560
and they build it and they're gonna leave

371
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,240
and they don't have to maintain it,

372
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,530
they might cut some corners, right?

373
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,270
But if you know you're
gonna build something

374
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,530
and you know you're gonna
have to maintain it,

375
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,180
you're more likely to do it in a way

376
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,655
that is gonna be, have higher
operational excellence,

377
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:01,755
let's put it that way.

378
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,590
So my thought process here
is insource the migration,

379
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,213
let your own team do it.

380
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,150
You know, you're gonna
bring in external help.

381
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,480
Partners are an excellent resource

382
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,460
and AWS itself is an excellent resource,

383
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,540
and you should bring them in,

384
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,850
but their goal should
be to become irrelevant.

385
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,130
Their goal should be
to upskill your people

386
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,210
because your people are the ones

387
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,910
who are gonna have to
maintain this, right?

388
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,000
And so in DevOps, you say
"You build it, you run it."

389
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,290
I think that should be true

390
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,850
for just about everything, right?

391
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,770
You build it, you run it
with the cloud as well.

392
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,100
Bring in the experts to
transfer the knowledge.

393
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,990
Bring in lower cost resources
to kind of free up their plate

394
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,570
so they can work on it and
do your best as a leader

395
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,020
to allow them to focus on it.

396
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,793
So it has a lot of
advantages when you do this.

397
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,973
Just being purely selfish.

398
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,033
The people that work for you,

399
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:03,960
or the, all the people
in your organization,

400
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,890
they already know each other.

401
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,810
They already know how
to work with each other.

402
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,520
When you bring in new
people, there's onboarding

403
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,320
and there's complexity with that.

404
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,610
They know how your organization works.

405
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,100
Every organization has bureaucracy, right?

406
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,650
The way of doing things, that's a delay.

407
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,410
Think about it, if you have
to onboard a bunch of people

408
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,240
in the beginning of a
migration, then learning how

409
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,880
just to navigate your organization

410
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,610
is extra time that it's gonna take.

411
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,310
And not having to hire them is great.

412
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,630
The fact that they already work for you

413
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,500
makes it a lot easier.

414
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,020
So if, even just being purely selfish,

415
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,000
'cause a lot of times it
sounds like I'm saying

416
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,650
invest in your employees as like charity.

417
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,660
No, I'm saying do it for selfish reasons.

418
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,790
It's gonna make your
migration more successful

419
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,850
and you're gonna be able to operate it

420
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,680
more successfully in the long term

421
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,260
and it's gonna make your life easier.

422
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,480
So it's easier to teach your cloud skills

423
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,220
to your existing workforce

424
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,410
than how your organization
works to external people.

425
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,480
That's the key point there, right?

426
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,700
And if you think about
that, it makes total sense.

427
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,730
Cloud skills are a relatively
easy thing to learn,

428
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,830
especially if you're giving
them opportunity to use it,

429
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,270
which you should be doing,

430
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,950
learning how your organization works?

431
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,583
For some organizations, this
could be very difficult.

432
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,840
Okay, so I'm making this
sound so easy, right?

433
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,000
There are some problems, but
I'll give you some solutions.

434
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,300
So the first problem is,
yeah, they're too busy, right?

435
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,227
Every single time when you say

436
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,110
"We're gonna let you do the migration,"

437
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,360
they say, "We're too busy."

438
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,370
They're telling you the truth, right?

439
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,070
So my answer to that is, well
what are you so busy doing

440
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,730
that you can't do a cloud
migration or cloud adoption

441
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,080
or building this new app in the cloud

442
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,300
or whatever the case may be.

443
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,440
Whatever that answer is,

444
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,450
outsource that, that's undifferentiated.

445
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,630
That's stuff that you can
outsource at low cost.

446
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,490
That's just keeping the lights on.

447
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,740
Free up their time and
they'll appreciate it.

448
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,700
Now the next one, they're
much less likely to vocalize,

449
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,490
but it's typically true, they're fearful.

450
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,570
What are they fearful of?

451
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,970
They're fearful of the unknown.

452
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,300
They're fearful "If I do
this, can I even do this?

453
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,140
Am I gonna succeed?

454
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,280
I've never done it before."

455
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,193
For most people, when
they do a cloud migration,

456
00:19:09,193 --> 00:19:11,520
it's their first time doing it.

457
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,900
So it's natural to be fearful.

458
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,640
They're fearful "Will I have the skills

459
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,923
to maintain this new cloud environment.

460
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,230
Am I engineering myself out of a job?"

461
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,400
There's a lot of things that
they have to be fearful of.

462
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,950
So we need to address that.

463
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,273
So give them a safety net, right?

464
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:31,620
They might not vocalize it,
but they need the safety net.

465
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,903
So give them training, lots of training,

466
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,440
with a goal, right?

467
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,730
They need to know going into the training

468
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,280
that they're gonna be the
ones that are gonna drive,

469
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,400
bring in experts, AWS
Solutions architects,

470
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,770
professional services
partners, all these people

471
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,270
who can help them and guide
them in the beginning.

472
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,350
And you know, you really just
need to get buy in from them.

473
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,000
And this kind of speaks to the last point.

474
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,920
They may not even care, right?

475
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,513
So we need to get them to care.

476
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,010
If you're the boss and they work for you,

477
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,910
they may like, want you to be successful,

478
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,730
but I think if they have ownership of it,

479
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,480
they're gonna be a little bit more,

480
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,760
let's say receptive.

481
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,960
So outsourcing to enable,
solve those first two problems,

482
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,950
too busy and fearful.

483
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,350
So let's talk about how
we solve this last one

484
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,910
of them not caring.

485
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,580
'Cause outsourcing itself
is rarely the problem,

486
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,370
it's what we choose to
outsource that's the problem.

487
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,070
We outsource the fun
stuff, the cloud migration,

488
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,400
the building of the
new agenetic AI system.

489
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,690
We're outsourcing that to people

490
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,570
because we see the skills
gap in our organization.

491
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,950
We should let our employees do that

492
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,210
and we should outsource the boring stuff

493
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,310
they don't want to do to make time for it.

494
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,330
So how do we get buy-in?

495
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,820
Because that's really what
we're talking about here.

496
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,430
Well, I talked about a compelling why.

497
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,600
You have to have a compelling why.

498
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,100
It has to be something
they actually care about

499
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,360
and it should be related to your industry.

500
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,440
What does your company do?

501
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,690
What does your organization do?

502
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,960
Most leaders have this
advantage and they don't use it

503
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,660
because they just don't know
how to articulate it, right?

504
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,160
So for a live entertainment company,

505
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,310
it might be we're making the
fan experience better, right?

506
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,160
We're gonna make it easier to buy tickets.

507
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,610
And we're going to make,
when you go to a concert,

508
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,850
you know, we're gonna have
this interactive experience.

509
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,780
All these things that the cloud

510
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,810
will legitimately enable you to do, right?

511
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,010
Just you have to tell that story

512
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,320
because when they're asked
what they're doing at work,

513
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,610
what are they gonna say?

514
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,930
Right, "Well, I'm doing
stuff in the cloud,"

515
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,390
or, you know, "I'm doing IT stuff."

516
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,780
Let them tell a, you know, a good story.

517
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,773
So there's a, speaking of
stories, there's a story of JFK

518
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,400
going to visit the NASA
space center in 1962, right?

519
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,560
And he encountered janitor

520
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,690
and asked him, "What do you do here?"

521
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,523
Right, and the janitor said,

522
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,323
"I'm putting a man on the moon," right?

523
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,100
And this is the kind of
mentality you have to think of.

524
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,110
The janitor was not telling a lie.

525
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,520
He's helping put a man on the moon.

526
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,170
He had a part to play in this.

527
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,370
Everybody has a part to play

528
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,800
in the mission of the organization.

529
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,050
And when you instill
that mentality in them,

530
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,230
then they will be enthusiastic,
at least that's part of it.

531
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,483
That's one of three parts of it.

532
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,990
Second is sharing the how, right?

533
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,100
You'd be surprised how many leaders

534
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,453
keep their plans a secret.

535
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,300
If you don't share your plan,

536
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,447
then your team might just
assume you don't have a plan

537
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:32,160
and you might not actually have a plan,

538
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,830
so this will force you to create one.

539
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,880
But the other thing you need
to do is solicit feedback.

540
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,240
Allow them to, look,
it's not a free for all,

541
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,610
but like if you have a
better idea, tell me, right?

542
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,280
We have what we call tenants at Amazon

543
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,330
and it always says, you know,

544
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,650
these are kind of like principles,

545
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,140
leadership principles for
like projects and teams.

546
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,700
It always says, "Unless
you know better ones,"

547
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,380
these are our tenants
unless you know better ones.

548
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,720
And every single time it says,
unless you know better ones,

549
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,190
that should be the mantra.

550
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,668
Like, here's the plan,
unless you got a better one.

551
00:23:01,668 --> 00:23:04,110
This is my idea how to do it
unless you have a better one.

552
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,700
So listen to them, right?

553
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,650
Now, even if you don't
incorporate all of their feedback,

554
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,630
just the fact that you're asking for it

555
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,130
creates a sense of ownership.

556
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,470
And the fact that you're
sharing what you're gonna do

557
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,630
gives them confidence that
it actually can be done,

558
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,040
'cause like I could see the plan,

559
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,480
I could see how this could be done,

560
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,093
versus we're going to the
cloud and how we're gonna do it

561
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:23,460
is a just big question mark, right?

562
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,830
So make it our plan, right?

563
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,022
They might care about your plan,

564
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:29,127
they're gonna care about
our plan, their plan.

565
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:30,810
And then finally what's in it for them.

566
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,640
And this is I think an easy one with cloud

567
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,030
because you know, with the
cloud you, like I said,

568
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,100
you could transform people's careers

569
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,410
and you know, I like to reframe

570
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,540
we're engineering ourself
out of a job into,

571
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,480
we're engineering ourselves
into a better job.

572
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,120
And this is the truth,
it's just a reframe, right?

573
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,740
And so when they understand that,

574
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,500
when they understand that, you know,

575
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,940
if you're the type of organization

576
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,610
that's gonna give them training,
get them certifications,

577
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,650
allow them to actually be
hands-on and do the work.

578
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,730
That's rare.

579
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,410
And you happen to work
for a company like this,

580
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,390
at the end of this,

581
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,010
you're not gonna care about job security.

582
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,807
I'm gonna be fighting to keep you, right?

583
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:08,190
And you should ask me for a raise.

584
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,300
Doesn't mean I can give you one,

585
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,300
but you should definitely
ask for one, right?

586
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,053
I wasn't able to give many,
but I encourage them to ask.

587
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,990
So these are the three ingredients,

588
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,030
and you can use this not
just with your employees,

589
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,760
but with your peers and
with your management,

590
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,690
whoever you need to get buy-in from

591
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,703
for transformative change.

592
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,000
So then you upskill.

593
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,670
But the upskilling, there's
some very specific things

594
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,870
that I recommend you do with upskilling.

595
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,200
First you have to have buy-in,
which you just talked about.

596
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,430
Because if they don't care,

597
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,860
then like, it's just a paid vacation,

598
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,510
you send them to training, right?

599
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,830
Get the timing right, do
the training, like for me,

600
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,110
I had to do the training while
I was doing the migration.

601
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,420
So I actually had to get
so much buy-in from my team

602
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,930
that they were willing to do
three jobs at once, right?

603
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,970
Training in the morning,
migration in the afternoon,

604
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,080
and in your free time,

605
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,930
just try to keep the
business running, right?

606
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,520
So that was a lot to ask.

607
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,040
Now you don't necessarily have
to do 'em at the same time,

608
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,840
but the next best thing
is to do the training

609
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,790
immediately before the migration.

610
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,160
Any interval that you have in between

611
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,020
that knowledge tends to get forgotten.

612
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,340
So putting it into practice

613
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,730
as quickly as possible is super important.

614
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,500
And there's the other things here as well.

615
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,451
Use all available means.

616
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:25,200
AWS has a lot of free resources

617
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,520
that we can give you for training.

618
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,470
Solutions architects,
you know, our partners.

619
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,790
There's a lot of people who will come in

620
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,640
and help you get upskilled

621
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,650
and don't ever stop doing it.

622
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,483
It's a continuous process.

623
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,620
So now you may have to hire

624
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,110
after you've given everyone
in your organization

625
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,500
a chance to fill new roles in
the cloud, you may need to,

626
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,710
but please give everyone a chance first,

627
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,910
this is super important.

628
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,990
Now you may have gaps,
hire for those gaps.

629
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,890
Now it's gonna be hard to
find people who are qualified.

630
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,360
So you may need to do a couple things

631
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,610
like adjusting your requirements.

632
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,643
One thing I've found that
works here is everyone,

633
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,380
has anyone here noticed

634
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,860
how many agenetic AI engineer
job postings there are?

635
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,510
And they all want like
three years experience,

636
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,560
five years experience.

637
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,150
It's like, yeah, this technology

638
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,280
hasn't been around that long, right?

639
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,740
So hire people who are motivated,

640
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,300
hire people who want to learn.

641
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,410
That is a higher indicator of
success than existing skills.

642
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,770
Now, existing skills is a
good base to have, of course,

643
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,780
but do you wanna pay a premium for that?

644
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,790
So this is kind of a cheat code.

645
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,490
Get people who are early in their career

646
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,743
but are sharp and smart and want to learn.

647
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,920
Or maybe they're later in their career

648
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,970
and they just don't have,

649
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,890
they give a solid technical foundation,

650
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,723
they just don't understand cloud

651
00:26:47,723 --> 00:26:49,260
and no one's giving them a chance, right?

652
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,143
These people you can get for,

653
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,010
it's an incredible deal, let's
just put it that way, right?

654
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,190
And you upskill them and
then you have those people,

655
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,620
you have that pipeline
I was talking about.

656
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,500
And lastly, you have to
become an organization

657
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,640
that top talent, that attracts
top performers, right?

658
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,537
You may have heard the quote,

659
00:27:10,537 --> 00:27:13,290
"Become the person that
attracts success," right?

660
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,580
It's kinda a similar thing.

661
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,380
Like are you the type of organization

662
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,270
that top performers wanna work at?

663
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,103
You know, top performers

664
00:27:19,103 --> 00:27:20,760
wanna work with other top performers.

665
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,470
They wanna work on interesting problems,

666
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,030
they wanna be hands-on.

667
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,203
They don't wanna work for an organization

668
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:27,690
that just outsources the fun work, right?

669
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,040
They wanna work for an organization

670
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,920
that's gonna allow them to
become more valuable over time

671
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,210
through hands-on experience,

672
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,860
through training and all those things.

673
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,480
So become that type of organization.

674
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,700
Work on interesting stuff

675
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,979
and like as a leader,

676
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:44,130
care about making your team more valuable.

677
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,900
I'd much rather have the problem

678
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,120
of retaining valuable people

679
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,950
than the problem of having
people who are not valuable

680
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,240
or can't do the work, right?

681
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,340
So you don't get to choose
whether you have a problem,

682
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,310
you just get to choose which
of those problems you have.

683
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,710
So talent's something
your organization attracts

684
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,153
by what it becomes.

685
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,200
Spend less time on recruiting

686
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,873
and more time on becoming
that type of organization.

687
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,640
Think of like the top five
companies in the world.

688
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,130
They don't have to do a
lot of recruiting, right?

689
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,600
They have to do, recruiting for them

690
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,090
is sorting through all the
resumes that gets sent to them.

691
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,580
So be attractive to top performers

692
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,010
and the talent will come
to you that will help.

693
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,380
All of these help a little bit,

694
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,763
none of it's gonna get
you all the way there.

695
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,320
Okay, so another anti-pattern,

696
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,173
elaborate committees and org structures.

697
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,960
I don't think that this helps very much.

698
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,460
So I advocate for a very,
very simple structure.

699
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,380
And it's three parts and
it's very easy to set up.

700
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,550
First is your cloud team,

701
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,350
they're the people that do the migration.

702
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,460
You can call them whatever you want.

703
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,020
I call them the cloud team.

704
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,610
They're usually infrastructure.

705
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,230
In my case, they're a
former infrastructure team,

706
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,030
I rebranded cloud services.

707
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,653
This could be DevOps folks,

708
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,750
but these are the people who
are gonna do it, hands on.

709
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,920
You got an advisory board,

710
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,290
I like to call it minimal viable, CCOE,

711
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,693
minimal viable cloud center of excellence,

712
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,170
very lightweight, very informal.

713
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:14,340
You got finance, you got HR,
InfoSec, you got, you know,

714
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,967
one person, one leader from each of those.

715
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:20,610
Just to agree on, you know, policies

716
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,160
and how we're gonna do
things, but not to micromanage

717
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,260
and it shouldn't take very long to set up.

718
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,540
And then stakeholders,

719
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,610
which are everyone else in
the organization, right?

720
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,740
These are who you serve as the cloud team.

721
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,700
So these are application
owners or business unit owners.

722
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,410
If there's no application owner, right?

723
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,660
Typically it's application
owners, it's app folks.

724
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,030
So yes, infrastructure people
have to answer to that,

725
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,680
people just like always,

726
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,140
unfortunately for the
infrastructure folks.

727
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,100
But, now the app people
have to answer to business,

728
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,100
So it all ends up kind of
working out in the end.

729
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,880
But this is a very simple structure

730
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,070
and this is really all you
need, this is all I used,

731
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,930
and this works at any scale.

732
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,060
And this could be set up in a day, really,

733
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,560
it's not that difficult to do.

734
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,830
Now the stakeholders, you're gonna ask

735
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,300
as little from them as possible,

736
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,830
and we're gonna give
them as much as possible.

737
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,850
So all we're gonna ask for them

738
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,060
is agree to this cutover date,

739
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,100
agree to this cloud architecture,

740
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,140
if you even care about
how we architect it,

741
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,990
and just give us permission
to migrate it to the cloud.

742
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,560
And then do just however much testing

743
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,180
you think you need to do at the end of it

744
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,800
to ensure that it works.

745
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,270
And it's gonna work, because
as you'll see in a minute,

746
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,650
we're not gonna make very many changes

747
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,240
in the migration phase.

748
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,710
Kind of alluded to this earlier.

749
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,270
Another benefit of doing it that way

750
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,920
is that the migration tends to work.

751
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,590
The migrations tend to not
have to be migrated back

752
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,390
because we make very little changes.

753
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,090
Okay, so create a meritocracy.

754
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:53,090
Now what I found is that
within the cloud team,

755
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:57,213
your team members fall into
one of three categories.

756
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,820
This is usually the smallest category,

757
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,500
it's the early adopters.

758
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,580
These should be your new leaders.

759
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,620
These are people who are
enthusiastic about the cloud.

760
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,240
And they may not be your
senior level people.

761
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,130
They may be, but they may not be.

762
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,440
You know, in my case, one of
'em was very senior level,

763
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,850
one of them wasn't.

764
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,800
But put them in leadership positions

765
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,930
that enable them, right?

766
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,130
They're gonna be the ones that prove

767
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,950
that this could be done to everyone else.

768
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,660
You got the passive majority, right?

769
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,087
So obviously that's the
most amount of people.

770
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:25,237
'cause it's got majority
right in the name.

771
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,380
But they're usually just gonna
go which way the wind blows

772
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,730
if we're being honest, right?

773
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,680
If this thing looks like
it's gonna be successful,

774
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,513
I'm gonna support it.

775
00:31:32,513 --> 00:31:33,570
If it looks like it's gonna fail,

776
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,700
then I'm gonna have no part of it, right?

777
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,990
So they need to be won over,

778
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,300
which means we have to
start winning quickly.

779
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,240
And that's, as you'll see in
a minute, part of the strategy

780
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,700
is we've gotta start winning very quickly.

781
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,530
And then you got active resistors.

782
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,380
And most organizations have these, right?

783
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,990
And thing is don't fight them.

784
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,390
My suggestion is embrace that.

785
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,790
Because think about
it, the early adopters,

786
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,680
and to some extent the passive majority,

787
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,750
they're the ones who are
complaining, "We're too busy,"

788
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,550
Okay, the resistors,

789
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,368
the ones we lovingly call server huggers,

790
00:32:06,368 --> 00:32:07,290
(audience laughs)

791
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,793
in cloud migration industry.

792
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,760
You know, let them manage the servers,

793
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,840
let them keep the lights on,

794
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,860
let them do, someone has to do it.

795
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,450
Let them manage the outsource team

796
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,310
that's doing the quote
unquote boring work.

797
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,870
They love doing that kind of work.

798
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,520
They will come around eventually.

799
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,140
So other things you can do
here within this meritocracy

800
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,223
is create new career ladders.

801
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,580
You know, I did something funny.

802
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,380
You know, you have your technical track,

803
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,960
your manager track, and
then added a cloud track.

804
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,480
And you know, it sends a clear message

805
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,860
when the cloud track actually has

806
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,040
more rungs on the ladder
than the other two tracks.

807
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,690
So create incentives, right?

808
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,560
You want to get promoted,

809
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,450
you want to get a higher
level in this organization,

810
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,750
this is the path to do it.

811
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,650
Give opportunity to
everyone equally, right?

812
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,390
So one of the things that's gonna happen

813
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,380
is people are gonna complain.

814
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,670
They're gonna say, "How come that person

815
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,620
gets to be on the cloud team and I don't?"

816
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,217
So the way you get around that is you say,

817
00:33:00,217 --> 00:33:02,430
"Okay, cloud team, you
get to set the rules

818
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,770
of who's on the cloud team," right?

819
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,110
And now you live with your own rules.

820
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,540
So we're trying to make
this as fair as possible.

821
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,900
Again, not to be charitable,
but because it works.

822
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,820
When you create a meritocratic system,

823
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,380
you get better results.

824
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,250
Because what ends up
happening is the results,

825
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,390
however you define them,
those who produce more of them

826
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,250
get more responsibility, right?

827
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,360
And those who get less.

828
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,100
So it creates incentive
structures that work

829
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,380
and it also gets the
right people involved.

830
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,750
And then be transparent
about all of this, right?

831
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:38,610
Let them own it, and there's
no hidden qualifications.

832
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,290
All the qualifications are there.

833
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,210
And I don't care if you're
the most senior engineer

834
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,980
on the team, you still have
to get that certification

835
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,840
if you wanna be a senior
cloud engineer, you know,

836
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,610
if that's the rule that you make.

837
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,010
And I don't care if you're
just a lowest person

838
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,470
on the ladder, if you're
a help desk person

839
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:55,230
taking tier one tickets, if
you can get that certification,

840
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,730
you could be a senior engineer, right?

841
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,650
So create these rules.

842
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,223
Let the cloud team own it
and apply it to everybody.

843
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,840
All right, so now we're gonna cram

844
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,391
a bunch of more information
in the end here,

845
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:12,750
'cause this is where it gets a little bit

846
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,130
more into the mechanics of it, right?

847
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,090
How do we actually migrate?

848
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,700
I've been talking about
culture this whole time, right?

849
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,980
Well, 90% of the problems are culture.

850
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,240
But let me give you some tips

851
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,530
on the actual migration mechanics,

852
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,360
'cause this was a little unique

853
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,860
how we got this done so quickly.

854
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,480
And I've been able to replicate this

855
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,090
with other organizations
that I've worked with.

856
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,860
And so it is universal.

857
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,700
I do believe it works any size
organization in any industry,

858
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,320
and feel free to challenge me on that.

859
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,730
Hopefully we have Q&A at the end.

860
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,400
So I'll let you challenge
me in front of everyone.

861
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,880
So what we wanna do is focus on the goal.

862
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,230
We don't wanna get distracted.

863
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,580
We're gonna eliminate all the complexity,

864
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,200
all the things that have
nothing to do with migration,

865
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,340
we're not gonna do them.

866
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,340
And the things that are necessary,

867
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,600
but maybe don't make the
migration happen quickly,

868
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,240
we're going to simplify
it as much as possible.

869
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,500
So we're going to embrace

870
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,490
this minimal viable framework, right?

871
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,210
So we have minimal viable committees,

872
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,050
like I talked about before.

873
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,940
We have minimal viable migration plan,

874
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,590
which we're gonna talk about now.

875
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:14,310
I suggest creating a
minimal viable landing zone,

876
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:18,780
which is again, kind of
controversial, it should take days,

877
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,750
weeks, maybe, at most to
create a landing zone.

878
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,540
This is what we call a two-way
door decision at Amazon.

879
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,520
It's a reversible decision.

880
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,990
Your landing zone can evolve.

881
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,060
It doesn't have to be perfect
for you to start migrating.

882
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,160
So that should be done quickly as well.

883
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,470
And then finally, my favorite
minimal viable refactoring,

884
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,505
because that completely
gets rid of the 7Rs.

885
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:40,170
And I'm gonna go through that quickly.

886
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,580
So we wanna make the process

887
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,080
loosely coupled and non-blocking.

888
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,790
And if you're an engineer,
you know what that means.

889
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,220
It means one thing does
not block the other,

890
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,130
and each, it's almost like a
microservices architecture.

891
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,560
And that's how if you put an engineer

892
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,380
in charge of a cloud
migration, that's what you get.

893
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,190
And it worked for us, so
let's go over it in detail.

894
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,930
So here's the minimal
viable migration plan.

895
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:04,410
You first identify all
the in-scope applications,

896
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,200
then you identify an
owner for each of them.

897
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,910
Then you map the infrastructure

898
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,320
that belongs to each one of those,

899
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,080
so you know what
infrastructure to migrate.

900
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,700
You map the dependencies, if any.

901
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,440
And in my experience, there's far fewer

902
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,360
than what most people think.

903
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,980
We're going to determine the sequence

904
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,580
and there's a formula for that
that's really, really easy.

905
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,050
And then we're gonna create cutover dates

906
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,520
and we'll just work
backwards from the deadline

907
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,190
because we're gonna have a deadline.

908
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,950
So here are applications or
mock applications, right?

909
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,380
We're gonna just go over a
very simple example here.

910
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,730
These are our applications.

911
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,560
We're going to order them
from easiest to migrate

912
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,790
and least business critical
and most stakeholder support.

913
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,940
Those three dimensions are gonna go first

914
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,870
and then the most difficult to migrate

915
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,470
that are most business critical

916
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,940
and have the least stakeholder support.

917
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,770
Remember, stakeholders are
our application owners,

918
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,590
so they're the ones we have to satisfy.

919
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,210
We're gonna put them towards the end.

920
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,390
Now the idea is that we want
to get some quick wins here.

921
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,813
'cause we've gotta win that
passive majority, right?

922
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,920
So now we're gonna turn
that into a migration plan

923
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,150
and we can only be sure of two dates.

924
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,860
The first one, which is immediately,

925
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,810
and the last one, which is the deadline,

926
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,043
so that's quite easy.

927
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,553
So here's why I do it this way.

928
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,030
The importance of momentum.

929
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,980
You find when you talk to people

930
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,540
who've done successful transformations

931
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,590
or migrations, it's always
this very happy story.

932
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,210
And the story is that everybody

933
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,920
was a supporter from the beginning.

934
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,430
Everybody helped plan it,
everybody was a sponsor, right?

935
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,750
'Cause it's survivorship bias.

936
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,550
You're talking to the
successful ones, right?

937
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,400
You don't talk to the people
who did failing migrations.

938
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,833
There's no owners of those, right?

939
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,735
So how do we do this?

940
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:50,790
The problem is, in the beginning
you haven't done anything,

941
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,490
so why should anyone in your
organization support you?

942
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,930
Well, the way you break the cycle,

943
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,620
the way you get it started
is you start with a small,

944
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,820
very small, maybe like comically small,

945
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,293
like a single web server,

946
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,180
and then you build off of that.

947
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,300
You build a series of
wins, like once, twice.

948
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,640
You know, what is it like once
is, twice is a coincidence,

949
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,750
three times is a pattern.

950
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,010
You know, at some point it's like,

951
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,180
okay, this thing is successful

952
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,440
and you start getting people on board

953
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,770
and you make a lot of noise
each step of the way, right?

954
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,930
Say we just migrated like
a simple file server.

955
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,400
I'll throw a party over
that in the beginning.

956
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,440
I want everyone in the
organization to know,

957
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,880
I want those passive majority
to know that this is working

958
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,440
so that they come on board

959
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,410
so that it becomes this kind
of self-fulfilling prophecy.

960
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,769
Which by the way, can
go in reverse if you do,

961
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:39,420
if you have some disasters
in the beginning,

962
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,670
so we have to avoid that.

963
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,830
And then, yes, here's the quip, right?

964
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,410
So you get all the support
you need after you need it.

965
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,760
That's the thing at the end,

966
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,020
you have a perfect migration plan

967
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,970
and everyone's a supporter
of your migration.

968
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,190
But in the beginning, what
most people don't see,

969
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,490
and maybe some of you in this
room are in this situation,

970
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,020
you're usually all by yourself.

971
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,750
You usually don't have a lot
of support in the beginning.

972
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,760
My suggestion, once you're successful

973
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,220
is let them take credit for it, right?

974
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,520
It doesn't matter you won.

975
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,420
All right, migration planning credit,

976
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,950
so a minimal viable landing zone.

977
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,960
Not gonna spend a lot of
time on this except to say

978
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,050
that I could fit everything
you need in the landing zone

979
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,490
on one slide with room to spare.

980
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,233
So do it quickly.

981
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,650
You can add to it, you do
not need every single feature

982
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,450
that landing zone offers.

983
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:27,930
You can use the ones you like,
you can spend as much time

984
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,590
or as little time on it as you
want, but it's not migrating.

985
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,920
So I suggest you do a minimal viable one

986
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,350
that has the primary components you need

987
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:40,743
and then migrate and then
add what you need afterwards.

988
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,440
Okay, 7Rs, okay yeah.

989
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,880
This is the simple 7Rs.

990
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,470
I'm gonna go through this
quickly, like I said,

991
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:49,290
because I feel like I'm
beating a dead horse with this,

992
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:52,500
but I wrote it so you're
gonna listen to it.

993
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,510
So what are the 7Rs?

994
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:58,140
Can anyone even name three of these?

995
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,690
I mean, I can't, so I won't raise my hand.

996
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,130
They all start with R though.

997
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,470
See, that makes it extra confusing.

998
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,880
So I'm gonna break 'em down.

999
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,480
So repurchase means that
we're not migrating,

1000
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,080
we're replacing with SaaS, okay?

1001
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,930
Retain means that we're
not migrating, right?

1002
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,930
It means we're keeping
it on premises, okay.

1003
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,850
Retire means we're just gonna shut it off.

1004
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,440
So we're not migrating that.

1005
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,693
Okay, so that's outta scope by definition.

1006
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,580
So these three Rs do not
represent migration strategies.

1007
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,310
They represent decisions not to migrate.

1008
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:35,760
It's funny, I was talking to
an LLM about this the other day

1009
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,137
and what was the joke?

1010
00:40:37,137 --> 00:40:39,390
It's like deciding where not to go

1011
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,140
on vacation or something like that.

1012
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,430
But yeah, they don't help us.

1013
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:48,660
Now they might be useful
portfolio management strategies.

1014
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,130
They certainly are, but
they don't have anything

1015
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,350
to do with refactoring
and migration, right?

1016
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,750
So they don't need to be made upfront.

1017
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,330
We can make these decisions incrementally

1018
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,100
or we can just not, these decisions

1019
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,530
have nothing to do with
refactoring anyway.

1020
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,680
Now, if we talk about the
things that are refactoring,

1021
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,390
we have a couple choices

1022
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,550
and neither of 'em, none of
them are really good, right?

1023
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,530
So we have a full migration.

1024
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,500
Refactor in the 7Rs language

1025
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,810
means we're gonna change
the entire application.

1026
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,100
This is a mainframe, right?

1027
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,370
So I'd say that's like the
one of the very few examples

1028
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,020
where you really have to do that.

1029
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,570
But otherwise it's kind of a bad idea.

1030
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,820
That's a lot of changes to
make while you're migrating,

1031
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,080
a lot of things that could go wrong.

1032
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,190
You could do it afterwards

1033
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,290
and do it with all the tools in the cloud.

1034
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,170
Then you have replatform,

1035
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,713
which is a partial refactor, okay.

1036
00:41:39,715 --> 00:41:43,950
Rehost, which is no refactor,
known as a lift and shift.

1037
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:47,100
And then this really oddball one relocate,

1038
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,510
I think this was maybe
the most recent one.

1039
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,340
I guess they wanted another R.

1040
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,170
It's also a no refactor,

1041
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:55,080
but from hypervisor like VMware, right?

1042
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,017
The thing is, people could say,

1043
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:57,150
"Well, those two are different."

1044
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,520
But it doesn't represent a choice.

1045
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,440
You don't get to choose
whether the application

1046
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,170
is on hypervisor or not
or if it's physical.

1047
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,380
So it's not a choice, so you
don't need another R for it.

1048
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,540
So if remove the Rs that have
nothing to do with migration

1049
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,330
and remove the redundant R, right?

1050
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,010
We have three Rs left,

1051
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,330
you see now, and we have a 3Rs model.

1052
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,250
We've already simplified this.

1053
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,440
But if you look at this,

1054
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,760
something becomes very clear.

1055
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,430
These 3Rs are nothing, they're not useful.

1056
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:27,930
One is like a complete extreme refactor,

1057
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,910
which you know you can do if you have to,

1058
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,560
but otherwise it's probably a bad idea.

1059
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,880
But it's a valid choice
if you want to do it.

1060
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,520
You have a rehost, right?

1061
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,740
A lift and shift, which
really doesn't exist

1062
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,980
because you're not moving
your server to the cloud.

1063
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,330
Migrate is a misnomer, right?

1064
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,163
You're gonna rebuild it.

1065
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,630
There's gonna be some
changes that are necessary.

1066
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,930
And then you have well, replatform,

1067
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,760
which is something, right?

1068
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,680
Some amount of refactoring.

1069
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,430
So what we find is that
there's not seven Rs.

1070
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:01,020
It's really a spectrum, right?

1071
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,020
It's an infinite spectrum of
how much refactoring we do.

1072
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,880
Why are we choosing
these arbitrary buckets?

1073
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,150
In fact, these buckets
don't help us at all, right?

1074
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:12,270
We have rehost on one side,
refactor on the other,

1075
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,570
which are very small edge
cases, if we think about it,

1076
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,400
and then we have this
giant thing in the middle

1077
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,370
called replatform, which doesn't give us

1078
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,380
any meaningful guidance on what to do.

1079
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,720
It just says we're
gonna make some changes,

1080
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,280
but it doesn't say what
we're gonna change.

1081
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,003
So it's really a 1R model,
we're gonna do something.

1082
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:34,140
And yeah, I think a 1R model is good,

1083
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,150
but I'm gonna rename it and call it MVR,

1084
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,440
minimal viable refactoring.

1085
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,160
Again, my favorite minimal viable thing

1086
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,750
in this presentation.

1087
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,190
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna do

1088
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,260
the right amount of refactoring
to achieve our goal.

1089
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,093
And we're gonna do it as we migrate.

1090
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,570
So we're gonna do it iteratively.

1091
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,540
This is gonna be flexible,
fast, simple, and safe

1092
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,040
by doing it this way.

1093
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,870
So we're gonna start
with a lift and shift,

1094
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:58,950
conceptually, right?

1095
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,780
We're gonna say, if we took this server

1096
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,650
and we just rebuilt it exactly
how it is today in the cloud,

1097
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,270
what would it look like?

1098
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,600
And then we're gonna
realize that's not optimal.

1099
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,090
So, 'cause some of the
things are gonna get worse,

1100
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,430
so we're gonna do what I call
the hippocratic oath of IT.

1101
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:16,320
First, do no harm, right?

1102
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,080
We're gonna say for security, compliance,

1103
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,630
reliability, performance, and cost,

1104
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:23,310
we're gonna do just enough refactoring

1105
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:28,020
to make those things
not worse, but no more.

1106
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,000
And then we're gonna save
the rest of the refactoring

1107
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,440
for after we're in the cloud,

1108
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,480
because it's just so much
easier to do it then.

1109
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,987
And we want to get this
migration thing done quickly,

1110
00:44:35,987 --> 00:44:39,120
'cause the migration is kind
of, it should be a non-event.

1111
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,610
It shouldn't be this long drawn out thing.

1112
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,890
The key is to get to the
cloud as quickly as possible

1113
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,530
and do your refactoring in the cloud.

1114
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,310
Okay, so now here's the
really animated last slide.

1115
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,250
Well second to last slide,
what it looks like in practice.

1116
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,040
And so what I mean by loosely
coupled, non-blocking.

1117
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,603
Okay, here's our applications.

1118
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,790
It goes in two stages.

1119
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,620
So first stage is it goes, it gets scoped.

1120
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,230
So a project manager
identifies the app owner,

1121
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,450
QA tester, the infrastructure,
the dependencies,

1122
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,070
all those other things
that we talked about.

1123
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,360
They document it.

1124
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,320
Cloud engineer takes the application

1125
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,270
and designs cloud architecture for it,

1126
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,680
which will be really easy
'cause we're gonna make it

1127
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,080
very similar to what we have on prem.

1128
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,080
It gets approved by the
application owner or stakeholder.

1129
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,940
It gets built by the cloud engineer,

1130
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,620
hopefully using infrastructure as code,

1131
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,573
but that's optional.

1132
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,600
At the same time you start
transferring the data.

1133
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,300
So it's being built while
the data's being transferred.

1134
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,160
When both of those things are done,

1135
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,490
the app owner gets to do
their pre-cutover testing

1136
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,290
and approve it, or not approve it

1137
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:43,833
and say they approve it, you
cut it over and it goes live.

1138
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:48,027
Now we've gotta take
all of our applications

1139
00:45:48,027 --> 00:45:50,760
and we gotta put it through
this process, right?

1140
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,370
So this is the one thing I
needed help from the agency

1141
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,080
to help with the animation here.

1142
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,820
All right, so our monitoring
application gets scoped

1143
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,730
while, well, it gets moved
to architecture design

1144
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,290
while email gets scoped.

1145
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,150
And you can see kind of how things move

1146
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,110
through this pipeline.

1147
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:14,580
Now, this is very simple
when nothing's blocked,

1148
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,980
but as soon as, you know
something's gonna get blocked,

1149
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,030
'cause it always does, right?

1150
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,190
Let's say, okay, approval,

1151
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,380
we're always get blocked
looking for approval, right?

1152
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,520
This is very common.

1153
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,640
The guy's on vacation or just
doesn't wanna approve it.

1154
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,473
Doesn't like it.

1155
00:46:27,473 --> 00:46:28,440
So what are we gonna do?

1156
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,940
Normally what ends up happening here

1157
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,440
is the whole thing comes to a halt

1158
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,480
and web, email and
monitoring will go live,

1159
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,740
and then everything else waits.

1160
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,070
But we're good engineers, we
realize there's five places

1161
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,210
where things could get blocked,

1162
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:41,130
and we're just gonna put a queue on there

1163
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,540
and let things queue up.

1164
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,924
So then we route around the problem.

1165
00:46:44,924 --> 00:46:47,460
Hey, file servers can
stay stuck in that queue

1166
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,440
for as long as it we want

1167
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,540
while payroll application gets moved.

1168
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,050
And so everything goes
through the process.

1169
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,250
We keep routing around the problem.

1170
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,413
This is a simplified version of it.

1171
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,660
In reality, there's gonna be things

1172
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,280
queuing up all over the place.

1173
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,350
The key is we want things to
move through this pipeline

1174
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,700
as quickly as possible.

1175
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,570
Eventually the, whatever
it is gets unblocked,

1176
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:12,100
gets sequenced back in, and then

1177
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,070
you move it through this
process until you're done.

1178
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:20,070
This is basically how you can architect

1179
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,620
the mechanics of a migration in a way

1180
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,110
that can be done very quickly,

1181
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,790
and the key is you're
not waiting on anyone.

1182
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,773
Nobody's just sitting doing nothing.

1183
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,790
So just the principles as a recap

1184
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,950
and then hopefully we can
take a couple questions.

1185
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:39,660
So if you haven't found this out by now,

1186
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,523
I'm a fan of going fast.

1187
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:44,190
Go slow enough to figure
out what you want to do

1188
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:45,023
and then go fast.

1189
00:47:45,023 --> 00:47:46,290
You get your migration done quickly.

1190
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,510
It should be non-event,
get to the fun stuff.

1191
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:51,746
Simplicity is how you're
gonna do it primarily.

1192
00:47:51,746 --> 00:47:55,380
Simplicity increases
speed and de-risks things

1193
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,820
and it makes things less expensive.

1194
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,980
You've heard of the migration
double bubble, right?

1195
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,360
Well, I didn't have one

1196
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,120
because my migration
was so, so quick, right?

1197
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,530
And so the more you draw it out,

1198
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:05,790
the more you're double paying.

1199
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:07,380
So make it fast.

1200
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,510
Use constraints to force innovation,

1201
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,370
not just drive it and focus.

1202
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:13,341
Invest in your people
because that is gonna be

1203
00:48:13,341 --> 00:48:15,180
the make it or break it detail.

1204
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:18,150
If there's any one,
that's the biggest one.

1205
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,650
Momentum is the KPI.

1206
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:24,650
So if I talk to a customer
who's doing cloud migration,

1207
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,260
that's what I'm looking
for to determine, predict,

1208
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,460
whether they're gonna
be successful or not.

1209
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,780
Are they going faster?

1210
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,610
Are they going slower?

1211
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,310
It's momentum, is it
speeding up or slowing down?

1212
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:37,320
Doing always beats planning.

1213
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,880
A little bit of planning is good,

1214
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,180
but I've yet to see a migration
fail from lack of planning.

1215
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,660
I see migrations fail from too
much planning all the time.

1216
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,980
It's counterintuitive,

1217
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,280
but people love planning when
they don't want to do the work

1218
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,300
or they're unsure.

1219
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,370
Migrate, then modernize.

1220
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:55,140
Again, I'm not saying don't modernize.

1221
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,050
Definitely modernize it's the
whole reason for migrating.

1222
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:03,050
Just decouple them so they're
both simpler and less risky.

1223
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:07,770
And finally, anybody can do this,

1224
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:09,320
but only if they want to do it.

1225
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:11,783
Thank you.

1226
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:15,732
