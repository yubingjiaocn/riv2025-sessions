1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,723
- What is the cost of downtime?

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,750
I would like to start with the reality

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,540
we are facing in today's digital world.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,800
What you see on these slides

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,623
represents the true
impact of system failure.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,920
According to the information technology

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,210
in diligence consulting,
9% of the enterprise

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,320
are losing 300,000 plus
per hour of downtime.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,203
Plus 41% of the enterprise,

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,070
are losing between one to $5 million

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,393
per hour of downtime.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,080
But these are just numbers.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,910
These are missed opportunities,

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,100
damage to customer relationship,

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,840
loss of productivity,

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,770
and also, a hit to the brand's reputation.

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,150
But think like that this,

18
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,890
is not just an IT problem,

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,243
it's the business survival.

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,480
Today we're gonna talk about

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,060
building resilience systems,

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,280
doing effective observability.

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,540
And then at the end,

24
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,123
we'll be gonna show you
two demos using Gen AI.

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,120
My name is Matheus Canela.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,760
I'm a Senior Solutions
Architect based in Sydney.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,290
And today with me I have Jay,

28
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,940
who is a Senior Cloud Support engineer,

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,410
based in India.

30
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,243
Jay.

31
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,690
- [Jay] Hi everyone.

32
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,450
So what do we have for today's agenda?

33
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,710
First, I'll go through

34
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,770
the Resilience foundations
and best practice.

35
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,960
And Jay will take control and talk about,

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,840
how to observe, detect, and investigate.

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,650
So think about metrics, logs, and trace.

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,650
Also, how to use the alarms and tools,

39
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,970
for you to investigate.

40
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,980
And at the end, I'll show you a demo

41
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,410
on how to do a full troubleshoot,

42
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,863
and then solve a problem
with generative AI tool.

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,610
Alright, first is resilience foundations

44
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,753
and best practice.

45
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,820
Before we dive deep
into technical aspects,

46
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,490
I wanna share with you
a personal real story

47
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,080
that demonstrates how resilience

48
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,590
is critical for every
technology implementation.

49
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,553
So stay with me.

50
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,873
One year ago I decided to
fully automate my house.

51
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,180
And then as you can see,

52
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,590
that represents by the house.

53
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,320
And then because my house is not that new,

54
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,660
I had to use, you know, wireless protocol.

55
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,970
I couldn't use cables to connect

56
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,250
to the lights or to the appliances.

57
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,470
And then if you see, I
had a wireless switch,

58
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,980
and this wireless switch
used a dedicated channel

59
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,720
with specific protocols.

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,280
I also had wifi lights,

61
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,500
which uses the wifi signal.

62
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,850
So to have an idea,

63
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,700
if you press the wifi switch

64
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,410
that goes to the home controller,

65
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,000
the home controller then decides

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,040
where, you know, which lights in the house

67
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,210
we need to turn on.

68
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,760
So, as you can see, it
turns on the lights.

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,390
So as we all busy, I had
to do this after hours.

70
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,060
And around 1:00 AM when
I was about to finish,

71
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,980
I just deployed an update,

72
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,900
and then I went straight to bed.

73
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,950
So, during the night the server failed.

74
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,320
And then what happened is, the network

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,160
used by the wireless switches also failed.

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,500
And you can start guessing
what happened, right.

77
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,920
So the wireless switch became unavailable.

78
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,980
But then, my wife woke
up at 5:00 AM right.

79
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,450
She needs go to work,

80
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,680
and then you know, take a shower,

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,390
prepare her breakfast.

82
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,250
And then in Sydney,

83
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,470
there's no sunlight around 5:00 AM,

84
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,850
So, she relies on the lights,

85
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,930
you know, to do her stuff.

86
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,430
But I was sleeping,

87
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,110
and then she had no lights.

88
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,190
And you can start expecting

89
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,470
that she was really, really upset.

90
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,700
And you also maybe thinking,

91
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,040
you know, what happened
to me at that time?

92
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,090
- [Jay] I think you're in trouble Matheus.

93
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,120
- Yeah, I was in a big
trouble at that time.

94
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,250
So, but what I wanna do now,

95
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,450
is just go a little bit
deeper in the conversation

96
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,190
I had with her between, you know,

97
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,780
when she actually
figured out that problem.

98
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,640
So, one to two minutes of that discussion,

99
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,810
and you see how that relates

100
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,490
to your day-to-day business.

101
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,930
So, she first woke me up saying,

102
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,170
you know, Matheus, what
happened to the lights?

103
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,453
I just woke up a little
bit nervous, you know.

104
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:02,820
5:00 AM don't like
waking up in the morning,

105
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,980
said, I don't know, why?

106
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,200
And then she just said,
they're not working.

107
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,220
Or good, aren't you now, right.

108
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,230
So, it's expected as we discussed.

109
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,460
But, I want you to pay attention

110
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,710
to the next thing that I said to her,

111
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,570
which is basically what customers

112
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,880
are doing nowadays today customers.

113
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,700
I just said, well, the SLA for the lights

114
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,463
is five hours, and then you have to wait.

115
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,060
But, and then you see
the next conversation,

116
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,000
go like, What is that SLA?

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,290
Right, so, and that's what happened

118
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,790
to a lot of business nowadays.

119
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,240
When you have, you know,
that type of issue,

120
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,250
they don't know that SLA exists.

121
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,650
She may be expecting
the lights to be 24/7.

122
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,000
Who would expect the lights, you know,

123
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,350
to have a failure or you know,

124
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,500
a server that would impact that to work.

125
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,320
But now let's start
bringing that personal story

126
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,603
into how can we build it on AWS.

127
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,960
So first, if you see,

128
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,800
my home controller was a
single point of failure.

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,853
When it crashed, every
light stayed off, right.

130
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,190
So if you think about this,

131
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,400
we have the availability zones impairment.

132
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,630
And then availability zones

133
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,550
are isolated file domains,

134
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,570
with independent power,
cooling and network.

135
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,390
But, availability zones can also fail.

136
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,060
And that's why it's
important, you know, for you

137
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,870
to think about having
a multi AZ discussion.

138
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,360
So resiliency start with redundancy

139
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,803
across multi AZ.

140
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,830
So I wanna talk about two services,

141
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,720
they're not the only one available

142
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,750
for talking about, you
know, multi AZ discussion.

143
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,273
And the first one is
elastic load balancing.

144
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,820
So imagine if one AZ fails

145
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,800
or one node has an issue,

146
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,660
elastic load balancing can shift the load

147
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,580
to the next node, in a different AZ

148
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,590
if that's failing like a help node.

149
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,230
And it also applies to RDS multi AZ.

150
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,700
So imagine if you have an instance

151
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,096
of a database failing one AZ,

152
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:57,533
it can shift the load to the other AZ.

153
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,520
So the next one is,

154
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,770
I deployed things using click ops,

155
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,620
which makes it harder to roll back.

156
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,130
So that links to
misconfiguration and bugs.

157
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,570
So human error remains

158
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,730
the major source of incidents.

159
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,980
And the best defense is
treating infrastructure

160
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,240
like an application code.

161
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,163
So, no more click ops, right.

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,450
In that case we can talk about two things.

163
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,160
The first one is using a report storage

164
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,540
to store your codes.

165
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,150
But we also talk about
cloud development kits,

166
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,170
which is the CDK.

167
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,060
So, if you're writing your infrastructure,

168
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,060
like your database, you know your servers,

169
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,100
your network, all through as a code

170
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,980
in a type script for example.

171
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,630
You can then once you deploy it

172
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,190
becomes a cloud formation,

173
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,080
but can also become a terraform.

174
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,270
And you can even use
cloud formation directly,

175
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,103
if you like.

176
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:50,100
So the next one is the alarm

177
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,200
could have triggered my home-lab recovery

178
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,710
before my wife discovered
the outage, right.

179
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,780
So...

180
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,083
I'm just clicking the next one.

181
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,770
And that links to excessive loads.

182
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,390
So in that case we can have

183
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,920
for example, out scaling.

184
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,110
If you're having a spike in connections

185
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,207
to your web server, right,

186
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:10,470
then you can add and remove service

187
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,450
to cap with that load.

188
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,490
And then not everyone is aware of,

189
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,160
but we also have application out scaling.

190
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,230
So you have the out
scaling as I mentioned,

191
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,430
for your EC2's.

192
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,800
But if you have Aurora read replicas

193
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,167
or Lambdas or even DynamoDB,

194
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,550
the application out scaling

195
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,900
can also help you in that.

196
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,550
And talking about Lambdas,

197
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,670
it's important to think
about managed service.

198
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,710
Like lambda, DynamoDB,

199
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,100
or those servers can help
you manage, you know,

200
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,550
the requests without
managing the infrastructure.

201
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,740
And lastly, I never test

202
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,650
my lighting recovery
playbook until 5:00 AM

203
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,843
So game days could have helped the family.

204
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,240
So, think with me, if
you remember the network

205
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,610
for the switches was failing, right

206
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,520
But my wife was not
aware that using an app

207
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,380
could have turned it on the lights.

208
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,000
And that's why game days
is really important,

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,320
so you get the whole, you know,

210
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,280
in my case, the family,

211
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,380
but you can have the whole company

212
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,700
getting together to understand.

213
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,833
If there's a bad day, what should I do?

214
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,870
So, in that case I want to talk about

215
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,110
two services, AWS fault injection service,

216
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,000
which allows you to inject fault

217
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,330
in your environment,
in a controlled manner.

218
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,180
So, it can terminate,
since you can you know,

219
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,800
isolate an AZ.

220
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,927
And we also have the security hub.

221
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:35,340
No, not the security hub.

222
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,390
It's just hiding there.

223
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,523
- [Jay] Resilience hub.

224
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:39,631
- Yeah, the resilience hub.

225
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:42,000
So, in that case you can
import an application

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,590
and run a report on that.

227
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,240
And you can understand
how your application

228
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,893
will behave in case of a failure.

229
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,990
Alright, so this screenshot here

230
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,910
represents the fault injection service.

231
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,410
If you open that in a console.

232
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,886
And I want to highlight
two of the servers,

233
00:08:58,886 --> 00:08:59,719
not just the two,

234
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,583
but you have many as you
can see that page can,

235
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,820
you know, you have two pages there.

236
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,414
The first one,

237
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:06,270
is the availability power interruption.

238
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,760
So in that case you can inject

239
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,020
a failure in the AZ,

240
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,420
and see how your application behaves.

241
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,020
And then the second one is the EC2 stress,

242
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,520
that you can do in a CPU.

243
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,190
So you can simulate and
stress in your environment

244
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,113
to see how your application behaves.

245
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,490
And then those thoughts
that you can inject,

246
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,290
help you think about, what happened

247
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,110
if one of one part of
my application fails,

248
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,463
how is that gonna behave?

249
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,340
All right, I want to jump now

250
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,800
in the other service
that we mentioned before,

251
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,573
which is the resilience hub.

252
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,390
Before I show you reports generated

253
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,650
by resilience hub,

254
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,780
I wanna show you the infrastructure

255
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,210
that I ran the reports.

256
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,100
So think about this as a single AZ, right.

257
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,240
And in that single AZ,

258
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,610
I have a single RDS, right.

259
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,040
So, single instance of the database.

260
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,170
I also have elastic load balancer,

261
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,700
out scaling group and SG,

262
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,690
but they're irrelevant

263
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,440
for the reports I'm gonna show you.

264
00:10:06,643 --> 00:10:07,560
So in that case here,

265
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,060
once I import that application

266
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,590
into resilience hub,

267
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,320
I can generate reports
about the infrastructure.

268
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,297
And then I set up the RPO and the RTO,

269
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,930
which is a recovery time objective,

270
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,690
and the recover point objective,

271
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,520
to be only five minutes.

272
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,080
So, if I run the reports,

273
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,230
you see that says it's
unrecoverable, right.

274
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,030
And you may start thinking why?

275
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,323
Why it's unrecoverable?

276
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,290
So if you look down the report,

277
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,490
it's saying the database

278
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,220
cannot recover within that five minutes.

279
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,380
If you remember my infrastructure,

280
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,261
I only had one database in one AZ..

281
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:45,210
So if that database fails,

282
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,380
you won't be able to recover.

283
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,640
And that's where the resilience hub

284
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,822
is really important to help you

285
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:51,443
with your secure resilience posture.

286
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,320
Alright, let's change gears a little bit,

287
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,116
'cause I don't wanna forget

288
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:58,440
to talk about trade offs and risks.

289
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,330
If you remember my use case,

290
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,180
imagine if I want to
have multiple servers.

291
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,550
Multiple wireless network,

292
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,420
just in case you know,

293
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,830
I have an issue with the lights.

294
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,480
Is that a cost effective?

295
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,280
And that's why you need
to think about that

296
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,330
when you talk about resilience.

297
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,132
So, if you have critical applications,

298
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:15,965
it's really important.

299
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:17,820
Okay, invest time, engineering time,

300
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,130
and make that resilience.

301
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,170
But, if it's not a critical application,

302
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,540
it's also important to
understand the risks

303
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,313
and take that in consideration.

304
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,000
Right, before handing back to Jay,

305
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,540
I wanna talk about
Reliabilty improvement cycle.

306
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,940
So, first, resilience architecture

307
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,840
from the ground up,

308
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,760
we already discussed that.

309
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,070
And then, next is how to observe.

310
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,050
So think about the
metrics you can collect.

311
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,490
What is the information you can get

312
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,603
out of your platform?

313
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,030
And then how you detect, right.

314
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,887
So if you have that information,

315
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,760
are you getting an alert?

316
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,320
How you know that there's a problem

317
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,880
with your environment?

318
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,350
And then how you investigate?

319
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,600
How you get to the root cause.

320
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,400
And lastly, how you resolve?

321
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,140
How you get this back

322
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,690
to where it's supposed to be.

323
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,990
But, if you link that in a circle,

324
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,220
that's why it's really important

325
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,270
to keep, you know,

326
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,940
get stronger and more reliable.

327
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,500
So now I give back to Jay,

328
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,270
who will continue with the presentation.

329
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,120
- Thanks Matheus.

330
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,110
Alright, so let's talk
about observability.

331
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,080
So, I think it's a little
hard to spell, I think.

332
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,820
But let's try to make it simpler

333
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,740
in the next few slides.

334
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,050
So, how many of you are operating

335
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,030
and managing microservices

336
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,620
or distributed systems?

337
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,060
Can I get a raise of hands?

338
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,340
Like, yeah, quite a few
hands raised, right.

339
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,870
So you know, right that,

340
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,400
managing and operating these systems

341
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,840
is really complex.

342
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,610
There are multiple services

343
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,260
that communicate with each other.

344
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:48,420
Like you have lots of microservices,

345
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,400
your databases, maybe
your queuing systems,

346
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,520
all you know, distributed and scattered,

347
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,710
as you can see, like these blocks.

348
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,210
And then, they try to communicate

349
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,043
with each other,

350
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,220
and you might even not know

351
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,330
when a new dependency

352
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,040
is even added to that, right.

353
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,200
So when something breaks in that system,

354
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,300
you are just guessing that, okay.

355
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,100
Is it the service that has, you know,

356
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,090
causing the problem?

357
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,040
Or is it the dependency you know,

358
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,450
that is failing?

359
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,650
Or is it the network?

360
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,120
You know, it can be DNS.

361
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,770
Or it's always the DNS, right.

362
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,770
So yeah, so without observability

363
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,270
you are actually flying blind.

364
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,300
So this is where we want to get

365
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,310
with, with proper observability, right.

366
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,780
So, now everything changes.

367
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,600
You now see the exact
shape of your application.

368
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,150
Like, how each and every
service is interacting.

369
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,100
And how each and every dependencies

370
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,500
are interacting, with your services.

371
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,000
And then if something fails,

372
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,430
you are immediately able to understand

373
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,130
where to look and what is breaking, right.

374
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,160
But, to get here, you need to track

375
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,930
or monitor the right signals, right.

376
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,030
So let's look at that.

377
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,810
So to elevate your
application reliability,

378
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,090
you need to measure what
actually matters, right.

379
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,010
So let's talk about
some of the key signals.

380
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,990
So first, you always start

381
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,850
with the business, right?

382
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,550
So metrics, like let's say revenue impact,

383
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,660
the number of transactions

384
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,480
or the number of orders that you process,

385
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,520
can be something that actually shows you

386
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,510
some business outcomes,

387
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,880
or anything that relates to your business.

388
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,620
So for example, let's say

389
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,720
if your checkout service fails,

390
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,330
you know exactly how many
orders you're losing,

391
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,163
with your customer,

392
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:24,000
and what is the revenue impact, right?

393
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,530
So, this helps you to also drive

394
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,750
your service level agreements
with your customer.

395
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,890
Which is nothing but the promise

396
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,723
that you make to them,

397
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:32,840
that, hey, my platform or my service

398
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,310
will be up for let's
say, 99.9% of the time.

399
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,650
And if you're not able
to deliver that promise,

400
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,350
you know exactly what
is going to impact you.

401
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,980
The next set of signals,
are user experience.

402
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,970
So, these are very critical

403
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,070
because this helps you to understand

404
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,170
how your customers are experiencing

405
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,270
your application, or
let's say your website.

406
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,450
So, you can monitor the
core web vital metrics

407
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,940
like the Largest Contentful paint,

408
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,230
interaction to the next point

409
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,240
or cumulative layout shift.

410
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,200
So, let's take an example

411
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,190
of how this actually helps.

412
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,350
So let's say if your metric,

413
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,150
let's say Largest Contentful Paint

414
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,100
is actually increasing from let's say,

415
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,170
two seconds to five seconds,

416
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,730
that means that whenever a user

417
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,500
is actually loading your website,

418
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,910
it is taking a longer time

419
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,610
for them to load your
content on the website.

420
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,061
And that means,

421
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:19,973
that they might abandon the session.

422
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:21,720
And then they might go somewhere else,

423
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,330
and you know, drop from
the platform, right.

424
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,830
So that's why it is very important,

425
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,540
to measure the customer experience.

426
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,250
Like, how they're
actually using application

427
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,690
using these core web vitals.

428
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,770
And these are standard metrics

429
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,903
that you can always use and monitor.

430
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,540
The next set of services

431
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,220
are your service health metrics.

432
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,210
So these are metrics

433
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,890
such as the number of requests, right.

434
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,770
About how the services
are handling the request,

435
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,160
or how many errors it
is, you know, observing.

436
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,240
Or your latency.

437
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,540
Your P50, P95, or P99 percentiles, right.

438
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,510
So always use percentile,
don't use averages,

439
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,387
because averages can hide your, you know,

440
00:15:57,387 --> 00:15:59,280
bad customer experiences,

441
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,960
you know, so that's why.

442
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,960
So, measuring these will
help you to understand

443
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,970
like how your services are performing.

444
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,100
And it'll tell you exactly

445
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,080
whether a service is
healthy or not, right.

446
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,370
So, once you start tracking

447
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,660
all these signals together,

448
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,520
you can actually understand

449
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,980
and completely you know,

450
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,130
understand how your
reliability is working.

451
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,300
And then finally,

452
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,680
you have your reliability targets.

453
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,830
So, who here measures SLOs?

454
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,930
Can I take a see a raise of hand?

455
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,520
Okay, very few.

456
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,450
But yeah, that's good.

457
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,100
So, I really want to dive deep

458
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,810
into why SLOs are important

459
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,190
for measuring reliability.

460
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,290
So, let's take a look at that.

461
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,560
So, when you're defining your SLOs,

462
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,090
you always start with your end customers.

463
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,440
Like what are they expecting,

464
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,790
or what from your
application or your platform.

465
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:47,850
So, you start with that,

466
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,410
and then you decide or
give a promise to them.

467
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,500
Like, hey, our platform would be up

468
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,600
for 99.5% of the time.

469
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,938
That's the promise that you're making.

470
00:16:56,938 --> 00:16:57,870
And if you're not able
to meet that promise,

471
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,710
we will give you,

472
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,840
let's say, some kind of credits.

473
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,050
So, in order to then achieve this promise,

474
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,160
that you're making to your customer,

475
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,500
you define your service
sale objectives, right.

476
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,170
So this is an internal
target that you take,

477
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,210
and you work with your engineering team.

478
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,010
So for example, this
would be slightly higher

479
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,240
than the actual SLA.

480
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,250
Let's say 99.9%.

481
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,830
And the difference between
your internal target,

482
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,240
and the actual customer promise,

483
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,830
will give you the error budget.

484
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,663
So this is something

485
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:24,870
that will help you to, you know,

486
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,040
deploy new features,

487
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,780
new versions of your application,

488
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,700
and still be able to make sure

489
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,187
that the applications are reliable.

490
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:33,882
But how do you know

491
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:35,160
that you are meeting these targets, right?

492
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,250
So for that, you start measuring SLIs

493
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,410
or Service Level Indicators.

494
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,640
So these are actual metrics

495
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,560
like latency, error uptime.

496
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,390
So you basically create SLO,

497
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,790
which will track this
service level indicator

498
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,590
over a period of time.

499
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,120
And then that will give
you an understanding,

500
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,953
like whether you're able

501
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:54,120
to meet the targets or not, right.

502
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,580
So, doing all this will help you

503
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,260
to actually, you know,

504
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,600
make your reliability measurable.

505
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,550
And you can always track and improve it,

506
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,620
as in when you are not able to, you know,

507
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,733
deliver your promises.

508
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,340
So, measuring these metrics,

509
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,480
or deriving these metrics,

510
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,280
can be, you know, challenging.

511
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,050
Because you might have to maybe,

512
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,970
let's say change your application code,

513
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,230
add some libraries to it.

514
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,400
Create some custom, that sort.

515
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,780
That's why we introduced

516
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,910
Amazon CloudWatch Application Signals.

517
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,850
So this is a tool, that
you can now start to use,

518
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,080
to basically monitor

519
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,910
the health and performance of your system.

520
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,680
And it'll allow you to track

521
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,940
your business goals as well,

522
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,860
alongside your system performance.

523
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,990
So let us see what you get out of the box

524
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,502
for application signals.

525
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:39,335
So the very first thing is,

526
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,013
once you enable application signals,

527
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,920
it uses open telemetry

528
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,480
auto instrumentation method

529
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,840
to derive or extract all
the metrics and traces

530
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,160
from your services, right.

531
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,150
So you don't have to make

532
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,830
any application code changes.

533
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,680
And you can literally get
started within minutes

534
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,120
to get those critical metrics

535
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,100
and traces out of your system.

536
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,320
Second, once you enable it,

537
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,090
it allows you to discover

538
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,860
all your services and dependencies.

539
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,880
And you can visualize them

540
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,730
in a graphical way or a map view.

541
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,690
And then it also gives you

542
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,070
some prebuilt dashboards.

543
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,936
For example, what is the
health of the services?

544
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:14,769
How are they performing?

545
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:15,602
How many faultst hey have?

546
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:17,080
All these things, into this dashboard.

547
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,190
And finally you actually track

548
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,090
what matters, right.

549
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,430
So, it gives you the golden signals

550
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,280
like your latency error faults.

551
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,530
And then you also enable
distribution pacing

552
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,360
to get end to end visibility.

553
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,500
And then finally, it allows you

554
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,570
to natively track and monitor

555
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,020
service cell objectives
within Amazon CloudWatch.

556
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,310
So, let us now see,

557
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,220
actually how application signal works.

558
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,050
So this is one of the screenshots,

559
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,660
that I've taken from
my sample application.

560
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,760
So, you can see here at the bottom

561
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,720
in the highlighted section

562
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,390
that we have five services,

563
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,866
that got automatically discovered

564
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:55,110
once you enable application signals.

565
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,940
And then in the same dashboard,

566
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,320
you also get this widgets,

567
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,880
that will quickly show you

568
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,070
which services are, you know,

569
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,060
observing some faults.

570
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,516
So, here you can see

571
00:20:04,516 --> 00:20:05,580
that there are a few services.

572
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,040
Like let's say the front
end service is observing

573
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,563
some two and a half percent of faults.

574
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,110
So now, if you want to dive deeper

575
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,180
into what is happening with the services,

576
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,740
you can go and check

577
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,690
this individual service held dashboard,

578
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,770
from application signals.

579
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,450
So here in the center, you see

580
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,790
all the golden signals, which I mentioned.

581
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,190
And then if I just observe here,

582
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,960
I see a request spike,

583
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,540
which the service, you know, handled.

584
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,070
And then at the same time,

585
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,560
I see this spike in the number of faults.

586
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,410
You know, that were
observed on the service.

587
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,180
So that means that
there was some problems,

588
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,770
and the service might be overwhelmed

589
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,300
because of the spike.

590
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,340
So when you click on this
particular data point,

591
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,780
or point in time,

592
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,550
you will automatically be taken

593
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,380
to the correlated traces.

594
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,570
So you can see here in the, you know,

595
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,570
bottom right, you get
the list of trace IDs

596
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,520
or the traces, that are, you know,

597
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,740
correlated to this
particular point in time.

598
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,810
So now, you can use these traces

599
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,370
and you know, you can easily identify

600
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,420
how the request travels

601
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,070
from one service to another.

602
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,180
And then at which point

603
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,830
the fault was introduced, right.

604
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,440
So, without you doing
the correlation manually,

605
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,450
this gets automatically added,

606
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,750
using application signals.

607
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,730
So here is an example
of an application map,

608
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,613
that you get, once you
enable application signal.

609
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,100
So using this, you actually see

610
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,350
how each and every service are connected,

611
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,392
and communicate with each other, right.

612
00:21:27,392 --> 00:21:28,800
So in ,the earlier part
I mentioned that, right.

613
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,530
Like how critical it
is for you to visualize

614
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,930
and understand how each
services are connected.

615
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,190
So every node here,

616
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,110
as highlighted is your service,

617
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,180
that you are running as
part of your application.

618
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,910
And then every line here,
shows the dependencies,

619
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,060
which these services are
interacting with, right.

620
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,930
And then, and again, from here,

621
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,880
you can go from, you know,

622
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,890
this map view, to the
individual service held

623
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,990
dashboard very easily.

624
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,960
And finally, as we were talking about SLO,

625
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,150
so using application signals,

626
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,440
now you have a native way

627
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,870
to define and track and measure SLOs.

628
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,430
So using this, you can easily see

629
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,900
which SLOs are, you know,

630
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,520
you are able to meet the target.

631
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,620
What is your remaining error budgets.

632
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,289
You know, so the SLA team

633
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:11,190
can keep tracking and
monitoring this dashboard.

634
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,630
And they can work with
the development team,

635
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,190
if you know you are all, you know,

636
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,043
close to exhausting your
error budget, right.

637
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,760
So now, we have got the right signals '

638
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,900
for our systems.

639
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,020
So, let us try to see how
we can use this signals

640
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,300
to quickly detect any failures

641
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,800
so that we can act upon it, right,

642
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,000
if something goes wrong.

643
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,300
So in distributed systems, you know,

644
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,800
failures are inevitable, right.

645
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,450
You never know when a dependency

646
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,770
or service will go down.

647
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,560
But the real question
is, do you know about it,

648
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,780
before your actual customers comes to you

649
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,250
and complain about it, right.

650
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,020
So that's why we need to detect

651
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,880
these failures as fast as we can.

652
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,870
And there are two approaches

653
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,580
I just want to talk about.

654
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,100
So let's start with talking about

655
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,690
lagging indicators, right.

656
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,450
So these indicators are
basically telling you,

657
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,660
that something is already
broken in your system.

658
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,030
And then for example, let's say we saw

659
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,980
a spike, right, in the request.

660
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,930
So when a spike hits, it elevates,

661
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,580
let's say your error rate,

662
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,310
let's say from 0.5% to 20%, right.

663
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,440
So that's a, that's a
huge difference, right,

664
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,150
From 0.5 to 20%, right.

665
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,040
Or let's say your team, you know,

666
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,260
deployed a, a new version of the code,

667
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,360
and that broke a critical service,

668
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,970
and which then cascaded
to further services

669
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,680
which were relying on it, right.

670
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,280
So, once you know this
kind of failures happen,

671
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,960
you are actually firefighting.

672
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,490
And your customers are already impacted

673
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,920
through this indicators, right.

674
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,590
So most of the teams are here, right.

675
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,790
We all start with, you know,

676
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,620
identifying lagging indicators.

677
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,230
But then let's talk
about leading indicators,

678
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,330
and how they can help.

679
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,100
So leading indicators are something

680
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,510
that will tell you that a problem

681
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,920
is going to develop,

682
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,260
and it can be critical
so you can identify it,

683
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,360
before it actually impacts your customers.

684
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,300
So things like, let's say your API latency

685
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,740
is gradually increasing,

686
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,150
let's say from a hundred milliseconds

687
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,916
to 200 to 300 or a week of time

688
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,087
or a day, some time.

689
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:06,690
Or let's say your disc pace utilization,

690
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,010
very simple metric, right.

691
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,893
But it can also grow up in size,

692
00:24:10,893 --> 00:24:11,850
let's say 5% day by day.

693
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,530
And then gradually it'll hit the limit,

694
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,120
and you know, there will be something

695
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,650
going wrong with the service.

696
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,600
So all these indicators,

697
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,650
if you are able to identify,

698
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,770
will give you enough time
to act upon it, right.

699
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,270
So you can, let's say for example,

700
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,530
you can scale your capacity,

701
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,060
you can tune the performance

702
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,440
and prevent the problem

703
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,690
before it actually hits your customers.

704
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,150
So the key takeaway here, is as a team

705
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,810
or as an SRE engineer for example,

706
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,280
you can start to evolve.

707
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,930
We always start with lagging indicators,

708
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,430
because that is mandatory.

709
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,470
But then we can try to shift left

710
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,240
to these leading indicators as well,

711
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,688
in order to get, you know, more time

712
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:49,170
to prevent any issues

713
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,113
before they actually hit your customer.

714
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:54,630
So yeah.

715
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,400
So Amazon CloudWatch gives you

716
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,170
some building blocks to detect

717
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,700
both kinds of indicators.

718
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,500
So let us see what they are.

719
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,570
So we'll start with detecting, you know,

720
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,530
leading indicators,

721
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,940
using anomaly detection, right.

722
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,800
Using machine learning algorithms.

723
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,030
So the first feature we have,

724
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,250
is the logs anomaly detection.

725
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,280
It allows you to basically
surface any anomalies,

726
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,330
within your application logs.

727
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,850
So, once you enable it, it's always on.

728
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,320
And it keeps on scanning your logs

729
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,090
to surface any new anomalies

730
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,650
within this logs, right.

731
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,810
The second feature that
we want to talk about,

732
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,920
is metrics anomaly, right.

733
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,870
So, this is basically

734
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,060
when you enable this on
your CloudWatch metrics,

735
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,400
it constantly goes and understands

736
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,680
what is the past values of the metric,

737
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,240
and based on that it predicts

738
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,500
the future values

739
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,630
or the baseline behavior, right

740
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,390
And then if any metrics
goes above or beyond

741
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,400
that particular threshold,

742
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,320
it'll show you as an anomaly.

743
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,510
So together they always watch your data,

744
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,010
your logs, your metrics,

745
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,180
and they are always learning

746
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,030
based on the past data that you have.

747
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,670
So let us see, logs,
anomaly detection in action.

748
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,380
So, here is one of the screenshots

749
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,140
that I took from my log group.

750
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,550
So you can see here, you know,

751
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,650
once you enable log anomaly,

752
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,030
you see that there are three anomalies

753
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,830
that got de detected.

754
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,790
So, let's try to focus

755
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,870
on this particular one, right.

756
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,226
So you see here, that
an unexpected pattern

757
00:26:12,226 --> 00:26:15,240
got detected with the severity of error.

758
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,620
And then it sees that the priority

759
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,000
is also set to medium.

760
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,320
And then this is the pattern

761
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,290
that the feature was able to detect.

762
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,490
And you can also see that

763
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,740
how these anomalies are
actually trending, right.

764
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,000
How frequently they're occurring.

765
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,103
So, you can take action upon them.

766
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,600
Next is metric anomaly detection.

767
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,766
So here you can see that we have enabled,

768
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:37,050
you know, metric anomaly

769
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,310
on a standard metric called,

770
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,510
target response time,

771
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,640
which you might be using
in your load balances.

772
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,950
And then you can see this gray band here,

773
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,870
which shows you the baseline performance

774
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,490
or expected values.

775
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,680
And then anything outside of it,

776
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,000
either above or below

777
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,280
can be treated as an
anomaly as well, right.

778
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,170
So you can see here, this particular spike

779
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,370
can be used as an anomaly.

780
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,080
So what you can do is,
you can create alarms

781
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,440
on these metric enabled
with anomaly detection.

782
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,340
So you don't have to worry

783
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,110
about static threshold, right.

784
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,110
Because sometimes the
metric can, you know,

785
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,430
show some seasonal trends,

786
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,390
so you don't know actually

787
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,530
what is the right threshold, right.

788
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,150
So using anomaly detection

789
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,620
it automatically understands

790
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,630
what's the, you know, expected values.

791
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,160
And then you can set an alarm.

792
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,390
And it also helps you to reduce

793
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,040
the alert settings.

794
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,780
So Matheus, you had a customer

795
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,390
that actually used this in real scenario.

796
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,765
- That's true.

797
00:27:25,765 --> 00:27:27,630
So, I had a customer a few years back,

798
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,390
so what they had do, is
they managed buildings.

799
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,380
And then in the buildings

800
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,090
they install multiple cameras.

801
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,650
And then what happened is when someone,

802
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,090
you know go across those cameras,

803
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,230
it just triggered the motion,

804
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,743
and then sends a files to S3.

805
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,672
And then the customer's like,

806
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,540
how can I make that,
you know, cheap to know

807
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,100
if there's a party in that building.

808
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,300
Like if there's a lot of people

809
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,560
going through that camera.

810
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,393
So what they've done

811
00:27:47,393 --> 00:27:49,140
is they created a metric per camera,

812
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,450
'cause it's uploading files to S3, right.

813
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,190
And then they use anomaly detection

814
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,780
to actually note, if you know,

815
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,860
there's a lot of people crossing

816
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,660
that specific camera out of normal.

817
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,890
So if there's a party in afternoon ,

818
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,033
that was not supposed to,

819
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:02,970
then those files are
getting uploaded more often,

820
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,800
and then when that's when
the alarm was triggered

821
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,170
by using the anomaly detection.

822
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,012
Yeah, over to you.

823
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:09,540
- So yeah, that was a good use case.

824
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,037
So now let's talk about features

825
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:14,490
that can help you to
identify lagging indicators.

826
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,560
So again, I want to
talk about two features.

827
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,020
First is logs, pattern and compare.

828
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,060
So using this you can basically group

829
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,580
similar log events into patterns.

830
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,530
And then you can also compare

831
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,640
whether these patterns

832
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,160
are occurring in the past or not, right.

833
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,320
So you can maybe select
two particular timelines.

834
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,140
Let's say from now to
let's say last Wednesday.

835
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,490
And then you can compare

836
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,380
what is the delta of you know,

837
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,970
seeing this kind of patterns,

838
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,050
to understand if something

839
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,660
has drastically changed within your logs.

840
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,460
Second is contributor insight.

841
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,870
This is one of my favorite.

842
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,920
It is a very simple feature,

843
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,660
but it is very effective.

844
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,980
So what it does,

845
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,840
it helps you to find top talkers, right.

846
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,790
So whenever you want to understand

847
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,070
like what are my instances?

848
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,940
Which are you know,

849
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,710
actually degrading the performance.

850
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,870
Or what are the heaviest network users,

851
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,749
you know, that are consuming

852
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:03,582
the entire network bandwidth for example.

853
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:05,130
Or what are my API endpoints,

854
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,030
that are actually facing

855
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,470
the highest number of errors.

856
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,820
You can use contributor insights

857
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,550
to derive those
information from your logs.

858
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,130
So, let us try to see them in action.

859
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,650
So here is an example
of pattern and compare.

860
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,420
So as you can see on the top,

861
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,950
I have around 27 patterns,

862
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,410
but let's try to focus on some of them.

863
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,670
So, here is the highlighted area

864
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,810
which we can focus.

865
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,790
So one of the patterns
that we have derived,

866
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,530
is showing us that there's an error

867
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,630
called, database connection timeout.

868
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,890
And now what I'm also doing is,

869
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,510
I'm comparing it with, you know,

870
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,522
the current time to let's say

871
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:36,840
the last one day or last one week.

872
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,020
So I can see that the delta is plus 252.

873
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,030
That means that these are new events

874
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,040
that got generated after, let's say,

875
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,270
I made a new deployment, right

876
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,950
So this can tell you exactly

877
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,720
what is the difference of this error.

878
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,820
Like how many times it has occurred,

879
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,950
comparing it with the
past period basically.

880
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,780
So it can help you to quickly understand,

881
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,700
like whether you know,

882
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,810
the change that you've made

883
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,160
is actually working or not.

884
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,620
And here's an example

885
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,330
of contributor insights in action.

886
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,830
So what I'm doing here is, I've created

887
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,350
a contributor insight
rules on my log group,

888
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,790
and I'm tracking the, you know,

889
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,690
the payment failures for my customers

890
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:12,648
using their customer ID.

891
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:14,710
So you can see that here,

892
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,740
there is total of 12 unique contributors,

893
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,270
or 12 unique customers,

894
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,400
that are facing the failures.

895
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,400
And I'm just showing the top 10 here.

896
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,754
And here you can see,

897
00:30:24,754 --> 00:30:26,040
that this particular customer with his ID,

898
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,060
he is having the highest number

899
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,470
of payment failures.

900
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,310
And then on the top,

901
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,800
you also get the logs getting converted

902
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,960
into your time series automatically,

903
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,890
by creating the rules.

904
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,300
So you can act exactly see,

905
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,040
what is the error trend

906
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,693
for this particular contributor.

907
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,620
So now we have, you know,

908
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,720
our detection mechanism in place,

909
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,700
that tells you that there is a problem.

910
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,680
But then how do we go
about investigating them,

911
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,293
and understanding what actually caused it?

912
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,980
So as a support engine and myself,

913
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,840
I have been on a lot of incident calls

914
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,270
with our customers, and
there is a common pattern

915
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,470
that I see, right.

916
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,900
You start with seeing a lot of alerts

917
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,520
that are going off.

918
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,260
Most of them are noise, right.

919
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,580
Which doesn't tell you exactly

920
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,960
what is going wrong.

921
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,700
And then, you know, the teams

922
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,530
start to dig in between,

923
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,263
let's say go and check
one tool for metrics,

924
00:31:17,302 --> 00:31:18,180
maybe another for traces.

925
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,310
You know, and then check the logs.

926
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,805
They're trying to you know,

927
00:31:21,805 --> 00:31:24,420
to piece together what
is happening, right.

928
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,560
They have all the data,

929
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,550
but that is scattered

930
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,140
across all these different tools.

931
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,790
Which takes them a lot of time

932
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,700
to come to the, you
know, final understanding

933
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,810
of what is actually happening,

934
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,790
and why the problem is occurring.

935
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,370
But imagine that at 3:00 AM

936
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,140
you are an on-call, right.

937
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,560
And then there is someone
who is actually going

938
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,260
and investigating all
this information for you,

939
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,540
and then when you actually go and check,

940
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,550
it tells you exactly what happened.

941
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,410
Wouldn't that be great?

942
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,430
Yeah.

943
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,720
So let me introduce you

944
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,060
to Amazon CloudWatch investigation,

945
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,310
which is your AI companion,

946
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,190
that is built right into
your CloudWatch console.

947
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,540
So this actually helps you,

948
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,430
to automatically scan and correlate

949
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,350
all your telemetry data that you have.

950
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,630
It can be your metrics, logs, traces.

951
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,090
Your cloud trial even changes for example.

952
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,880
And then it generates AI powered findings,

953
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,359
and root cause analysis showing exactly

954
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:20,400
what happened and why, right.

955
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,650
So what normally would take you hours

956
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,170
for investigating an issue,

957
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,500
it'll be able to be
completed in just minutes.

958
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,510
So you actually, you know, going to focus

959
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,770
on how to fix the problem

960
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,870
rather than finding it, right.

961
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,770
So let me walk you through

962
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,870
how this actually works behind the scenes.

963
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,930
So let's say, you know,

964
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,240
we start the investigation using features.

965
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,776
And here's your AI buddy right there.

966
00:32:45,776 --> 00:32:48,000
So what what happens is that

967
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,100
once the investigation starts,

968
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,090
the agent will start

969
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,400
to first form the service topology.

970
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,630
So what do I mean by that,

971
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,690
is that whatever services are related

972
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,150
to this particular issue or investigation,

973
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,380
it'll try to build a map,

974
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,720
and see how they're interconnected.

975
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,420
Next, it'll then go and try to correlate

976
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,030
all the telemetry data
for all the services.

977
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,450
It can be your
applications, your services,

978
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,170
or your readable services.

979
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,030
So you see that all the input

980
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,856
gets scanned by the AI agent.

981
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:18,689
Like your metric logs, traces

982
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:20,250
and all the clouded events.

983
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,130
And then for all these telemetry data,

984
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,683
it tries to detect the anomalies.

985
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:26,516
Like is there a spy?

986
00:33:26,516 --> 00:33:29,490
Or is there a particular
trend that it is seeing?

987
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,860
And it also does the pattern analysis

988
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,730
automatically for you.

989
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,990
So let's say there are some error logs

990
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:36,794
that are being generated

991
00:33:36,794 --> 00:33:37,627
during the investigation,

992
00:33:37,627 --> 00:33:38,850
it'll try to understand the pattern

993
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,950
and show it to you.

994
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,293
Once the entire process is completed,

995
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,690
you'll start to get the observations

996
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,280
or key findings,

997
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,181
and then based on that

998
00:33:49,181 --> 00:33:51,000
the AI agent will create the hypothesis,

999
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,710
which is actually the root cause analysis

1000
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,720
of what happened and why.

1001
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,090
And then finally it also
gives you suggestions,

1002
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,967
about how to fix that issue.

1003
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:02,070
And then once the
investigation is completed,

1004
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,630
generally we go and write down

1005
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,490
the detailed incident report.

1006
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,620
Which is, you know, time consuming,

1007
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,482
and I mean it'll take a lot of time

1008
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,315
to generate that kind of report.

1009
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:13,650
So ,it also gives you an option

1010
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,420
to generate an incident report

1011
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,460
in standard format, right.

1012
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,200
So yeah, let's try

1013
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,900
to see that in action with a demo.

1014
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,280
So here is my demo scenario.

1015
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,390
It's a very, you can say

1016
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,520
simplified e-commerce application,

1017
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,030
that I'm running on a,
you know, EKS cluster.

1018
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,100
So users are actually, you know,

1019
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,990
trying to post the orders

1020
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,300
through this particular API endpoint,

1021
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,680
and then they're not able to, you know,

1022
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,513
place the order

1023
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:40,874
and are facing some errors, right.

1024
00:34:40,874 --> 00:34:43,410
So now as an on-call,
you started to get paged

1025
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:46,290
and you are going to investigate this

1026
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,670
using cloud investigation.

1027
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,143
So let us see how that works.

1028
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,650
So here's a demo for that.

1029
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:55,050
So I am currently at the SLO page,

1030
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,820
and you can see that
the SLO that I created

1031
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,800
to track the order processing,

1032
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,810
is currently unhealthy.

1033
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,063
And I'm almost going to exhaust my budget.

1034
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,060
So what I can do, I can click on actions,

1035
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,620
and click on investigate.

1036
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,050
So this will open an investigation pane,

1037
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,730
in the same window where you can provide

1038
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,410
a unique name to your investigation.

1039
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,970
It's kind of like you create a ticket,

1040
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,220
and ask the agent to work on it, right.

1041
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,780
And then when you scroll down

1042
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,890
you can just click on the

1043
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,540
start investigation button,

1044
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,100
that will trigger the AI agent

1045
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,680
to you know, start the investigation.

1046
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,940
So now, let's try to deep dive

1047
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,920
into what the agent is actually doing.

1048
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,270
So, you can open the investigation

1049
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,530
that you just created.

1050
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,873
So I can just open that investigation.

1051
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,480
Yeah.

1052
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,300
So, if you recall the workflow

1053
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,410
that I showed you, right,

1054
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,990
the agent will first go and you know,

1055
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,280
create a service topology,

1056
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,260
and try to identify what are all resources

1057
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,490
it needs to check.

1058
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,160
So on the top, you can
see that it is analyzing,

1059
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,040
let's say my Java order API service,

1060
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,610
or my Java delivery API service,

1061
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,144
which we saw in the architecture as well,

1062
00:35:56,144 --> 00:35:57,360
which are part of the demo.

1063
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,700
So what I can do, I can
click on the agent queue,

1064
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,710
and you can exactly understand

1065
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,140
how the agent is going to investigate,

1066
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,270
and thinking about how to proceed, right.

1067
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,670
So all the resources
that is going to check,

1068
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,520
you can see that.

1069
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,480
And now if you scroll down,

1070
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,640
you start to get the key findings right.

1071
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,780
So the agent has started

1072
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,850
to now investigate the telemetry data.

1073
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,560
It is trying to correlate it.

1074
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,850
And here for example,

1075
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,050
you can see that it has found

1076
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,310
that the DynamoDB table

1077
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,470
is actually getting throttle, right.

1078
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,090
So we saw that again, in our architecture

1079
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,400
that the orders are getting stored there.

1080
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,510
And now you can see that

1081
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,730
it is also trying to understand

1082
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,920
any anomalies, by using the pattern

1083
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,573
and the anomaly queries,

1084
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:38,831
to check if there are any anomalies

1085
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:39,664
within your logs.

1086
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,240
And it has found some of
the anomalies as well.

1087
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,000
And here is a metric,
that it used to confirm

1088
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,310
that there is some
throttling happening, right.

1089
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,460
So it's automatically checking

1090
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,890
all the kind of data that you have,

1091
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,240
you know, with this services.

1092
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,793
And then giving you the key findings.

1093
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,150
So while this is happening,

1094
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,740
what you can also do is that,

1095
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,640
you can go and add your own custom note.

1096
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,900
So let's say you are a team,

1097
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,340
and you are investigating together.

1098
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,470
So let's say if I find
something important,

1099
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,600
I can share that context with my team,

1100
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,340
by just adding a custom note,

1101
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,260
which will be part of your investigation.

1102
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,520
So I can click on add,

1103
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,310
and it'll add the investigation, right.

1104
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,500
So anyone in your team can look into it,

1105
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,050
if there is some important
information, right.

1106
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,700
So once this is completed,

1107
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,130
the AI agent will now
generate a hypothesis,

1108
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,600
once it has enough evidence

1109
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,820
of what caused the issue.

1110
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,950
So let us now take a
look at the hypothesis,

1111
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,263
that the agent generated for us.

1112
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,863
Yeah.

1113
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:38,730
So what I can do is, I can start,

1114
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,770
I mean I can click on this hypothesis,

1115
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,550
and it'll open a detailed
hypothesis information.

1116
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,080
So you can get all the information like,

1117
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,790
okay, what was the root cause summary.

1118
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,750
Like what happened?

1119
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,860
You can see that the problem

1120
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,590
actually was the DynamoDB
table throttling.

1121
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,750
And then exactly like the timeline

1122
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,030
of how the investigation went.

1123
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,440
And this is the service topology

1124
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,520
that I was talking about.

1125
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,010
That the agent creates a map view as well.

1126
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,620
And then finally you see
the suggested actions.

1127
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,090
That how you can basically

1128
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,530
fix this particular issue.

1129
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,370
In this case

1130
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,170
as our DynamoDB table was throttling.

1131
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,670
We can obviously go and increase

1132
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,350
the right capacity on the table

1133
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,110
and it'll basically mitigate the issue.

1134
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,220
And you can also see some

1135
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,170
of the troubleshooting documents,

1136
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,150
which it can suggest to you,

1137
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,313
which can help you to further investigate.

1138
00:38:24,648 --> 00:38:25,661
So what I can do is,

1139
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:26,667
I can maybe open the runbook,

1140
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:27,578
that it suggested,

1141
00:38:27,578 --> 00:38:29,400
and I can fill in the input parameters.

1142
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,230
And then I can, you know,

1143
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,580
try to increase the capacity

1144
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,083
right from the same console.

1145
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:38,340
So this was the demo that shows you

1146
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,840
exactly how the investigation was.

1147
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,310
You can see how drastically

1148
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,830
it reduces your time to investigate

1149
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,630
and get to a root cause much faster.

1150
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,210
So Matheus, as a solution architect

1151
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,290
you might be interacting

1152
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,190
with your customers, right.

1153
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:53,160
Like how they can generate
the incident report.

1154
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,510
Is this something that they are always...

1155
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,345
- [Matheus] Yeah, it's really important

1156
00:38:56,345 --> 00:38:57,178
for my customers to be able to generate

1157
00:38:57,178 --> 00:38:59,190
a report that they can
send to the management.

1158
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,930
So they can understand
in details, you know,

1159
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,520
what happened to that application.

1160
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,720
So what can we have?

1161
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,030
- [Jay] Yeah, we also
have that option now.

1162
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,820
So once the investigation is completed

1163
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,650
by the AI agent, you can just click

1164
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,210
on the incident report button,

1165
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,650
as you can see on the top.

1166
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,700
So once I click,

1167
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,533
click there,

1168
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:18,060
it'll open the incident report console.

1169
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,650
So now what the agent is doing,

1170
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,570
is actually collecting all the facts

1171
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,740
about the investigation.

1172
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,880
Like what are all the details

1173
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,880
that can be used for the
investigation purpose.

1174
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,920
And then you can also review those facts

1175
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,970
that the agent collected.

1176
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,995
So for example, here, what I can do,

1177
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,420
I can update this fact that how many

1178
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,740
total customers I have,

1179
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,240
how many of them got impacted?

1180
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,370
So you can tell your executive,

1181
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,530
that okay, this percentage of customers

1182
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,750
were impacted by this incident.

1183
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,757
And then once you fill all these facts,

1184
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,710
I mean you don't have to fill everything,

1185
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,721
but a few of them you can always edit.

1186
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:50,730
And then it'll take a few minutes

1187
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:53,130
to generate the incident report.

1188
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,120
So yeah, you can see here,

1189
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,520
the report is generated
for our investigation,

1190
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,460
which says DynamoDB, right capacity issue.

1191
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,440
And then it will fill it up

1192
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,460
with all the information

1193
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,140
that you generally would, you know,

1194
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,353
add to your incident report.

1195
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:07,500
Like what was the customer impact.

1196
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,172
You know, what went well

1197
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:10,260
during the investigation.

1198
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,490
You know, what are the next steps

1199
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,890
that you can use to
mitigate the problem, right?

1200
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,600
Or what are the lesson learned

1201
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,433
about this investigation, right?

1202
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:19,204
All this information,

1203
00:40:19,204 --> 00:40:20,850
it'll automatically fill it up

1204
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,440
in this particular report,

1205
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,270
which you can then export and share it

1206
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,103
with your, you know,

1207
00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:27,123
executives or stakeholders, right?

1208
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,793
So yeah.

1209
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,883
Yeah, this is the report

1210
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:34,650
which we just created, right.

1211
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,738
So, I'll hand it over to you now, Mathias.

1212
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:38,013
- Thank you Jay.

1213
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,143
Let's now talk about how
we resolve a problem.

1214
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,060
So, what I wanna do now,

1215
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,460
is jump straight into a demo.

1216
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,320
Which uses Kiro CLI.

1217
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,510
So you heard about Kero ID, right?

1218
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,400
Which is an agent ID.

1219
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,200
But now I want to talk about the Kiro CLI,

1220
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,033
which you can run in your terminal.

1221
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,660
So before we jump into the demo

1222
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,950
and show you the application,

1223
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,410
I want to explain how
the application works.

1224
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,420
So basically you have a microphone,

1225
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,383
and this microphone will
send a voice to a page,

1226
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,510
and that voice will be
processed by a backend,

1227
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,950
which is an ECS.

1228
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,150
And then we also have
a DynamoDB in a model.

1229
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:17,864
So once the voice comes in,

1230
00:41:17,864 --> 00:41:19,980
it will translate the voice,

1231
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,620
we get into a text and translate

1232
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,450
to the desired language
which will be broadcasted

1233
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,740
to multiple users.

1234
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,930
Right, so you have two applications here.

1235
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:28,920
And then if you see,

1236
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,750
this is how the application works.

1237
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,700
So I'm gonna create a session.

1238
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,130
So the first webpage,

1239
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,750
so it's a test for reinvent.

1240
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,270
I'm gonna add a description
for that session,

1241
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,190
and then I'm gonna select a language.

1242
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,476
In that case will be Portuguese.

1243
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:45,000
'Cause I'm a Brazilian,
so I speak Portuguese.

1244
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,280
And you see the next slide.

1245
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,190
So creating the session,

1246
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,340
you can see you can start recording.

1247
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,440
I'll jump into the other page,

1248
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,630
where I can join a session, right.

1249
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,810
So, I'm then selecting
English as the output

1250
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,640
in the text format.

1251
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,740
And then I'll open the page.

1252
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,090
So if you see now,

1253
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,100
once the hour just starts streaming,

1254
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:05,933
you're gonna see

1255
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:09,000
from the original language to English,

1256
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,710
as we select a language.

1257
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,170
And then here, in that page

1258
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,960
is where you can see the
two boxes in in yellow.

1259
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,090
That's where the outer will go in,

1260
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,850
and then broadcast the text out.

1261
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,253
So let's see that working.

1262
00:42:26,483 --> 00:42:30,566
(Matheus speaking in Portuguese)

1263
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,860
So, as you can see I was
speaking in Portuguese,

1264
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,840
and I got that translated near real time

1265
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,570
to the other side in English, right.

1266
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,640
So, I heard from a...

1267
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,590
To simulate here, just heard from a user

1268
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,040
complaining that the user

1269
00:42:46,028 --> 00:42:47,490
cannot create a session, right.

1270
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,050
So you just saw that we
recreated in the sample,

1271
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,550
but the user just said no,

1272
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,930
I cannot create a session.

1273
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,220
And then what we're gonna do,

1274
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,190
do an investigation using Kiro CLI.

1275
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,890
So what I have here, my terminal,

1276
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:01,410
inside of the folder called, platform,

1277
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:04,379
and then that folder contains the CDK.

1278
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:05,212
I've used the CDK to deploy

1279
00:43:05,212 --> 00:43:06,120
the whole infrastructure.

1280
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,190
And I'm gonna run Kiro CLI.

1281
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,943
So, once I run Kiro
CLI, it starts loading.

1282
00:43:10,943 --> 00:43:13,920
And then as you can see
I'm running multiple MCP.

1283
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,380
So extends the LLM by you know,

1284
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,080
loading ECS MCP, the CloudWatch,

1285
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,400
the documentation.

1286
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,198
Playwrights, which is an important MCP

1287
00:43:23,198 --> 00:43:24,240
in that troubleshooting, can you see?

1288
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,240
And also application
signals, as Jay mentioned.

1289
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,094
So that's also using Claud Sonnet 4.5.

1290
00:43:30,094 --> 00:43:32,463
And then I'll paste the prompts now.

1291
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:35,510
So ,I'll clear the session,

1292
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:39,000
and then I'll paste a prompt for the LLM.

1293
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,260
So as you can see,

1294
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,040
I'm asking the LLM to
go and open the page,

1295
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,630
and try to create a session.

1296
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,520
I'm not providing details where to click,

1297
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,626
how to click in the HML,

1298
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:51,780
just saying go and simulate a session.

1299
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,520
I'm also providing details below,

1300
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,980
saying, do not change anything in AWS

1301
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,173
without my permission, right.

1302
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,650
Also below I'm telling
about the infrastructure.

1303
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,240
So I'm saying there's a CDK

1304
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,000
in that folder where you were loaded.

1305
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,780
Also I'm telling there's an AWS profile

1306
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,040
called RIV,

1307
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,430
which gives access to
the AWS infrastructure.

1308
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:17,070
Like Route 53, CloudFormation.

1309
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,350
And I'm also telling the LLM,

1310
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:23,463
that where the backend source code is.

1311
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:27,123
So, if you press enter,

1312
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,374
the LLM or the Kiro CLI,

1313
00:44:32,374 --> 00:44:34,560
we now start thinking
and trying to simulate

1314
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,480
that create session, right.

1315
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,310
So despite being recorded,

1316
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,950
at this stage, I'm not touching anything.

1317
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,870
So the LLM of the Kiro CLI

1318
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,601
is actually going through

1319
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:45,828
and trying to figure out

1320
00:44:45,828 --> 00:44:46,680
how to create the session,

1321
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,303
and trying to simulate the user.

1322
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,880
So as you can see on your screen,

1323
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,070
it's saying can you see the page,

1324
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,040
and then checking for the console logs.

1325
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,620
Its also waiting for the
browser to finally load,

1326
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,090
and say, Oh actually I found

1327
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,560
how to create a session,

1328
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,300
and now start populating the session

1329
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,590
with the details.

1330
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:05,790
Like just fake details.

1331
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,130
You know, test session.

1332
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,480
I was gonna select a language,

1333
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,860
and trying to create a session.

1334
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,480
And at this stage you can see

1335
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,370
that this session cannot be created.

1336
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,750
Right so when you saw the first time

1337
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:16,620
it could create a session,

1338
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,700
it could translate,

1339
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,920
but at this stage it's failing.

1340
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,113
So if I continue processing,

1341
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,490
now what Kiro CLI is doing,

1342
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,150
is gonna dive deep into
the AWS infrastructure.

1343
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,654
So be querying the AWS,

1344
00:45:32,654 --> 00:45:35,160
CLI to you know, to understand

1345
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,330
about the route53.

1346
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,920
Where is that domain pointing?

1347
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,713
What are the records
used in that hosted zone?

1348
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,863
See's listing the resource there.

1349
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,060
And you can see I found
that the DNS records.

1350
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,972
And then now it's gonna go into

1351
00:45:49,972 --> 00:45:51,510
the load balancer.

1352
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,070
Is there any health target there?

1353
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,320
Is he pointing to anything
behind the scenes?

1354
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:58,980
So let's continue, it's
going to the listeners.

1355
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,660
We'll check for...

1356
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,540
See if there's any 443 connections.

1357
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,620
Going to the load balances.

1358
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,123
So it's scribing the rules.

1359
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,303
So just continue.

1360
00:46:14,046 --> 00:46:16,555
Yeah, checking if there's
any health targets

1361
00:46:16,555 --> 00:46:17,388
in the backend.

1362
00:46:17,388 --> 00:46:19,080
And now it's touching the ECS.

1363
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,960
As you remember I had
the ECS as my backend.

1364
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,280
And then what it's saying is,

1365
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,580
I found an issue with your ECS.

1366
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,083
So let's continue to debug.

1367
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,190
And then as you can see

1368
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,040
there is a red message there.

1369
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,370
And Jay, as you work in the support team,

1370
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,720
what does the Error mean?

1371
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,740
- [Jay] So basically what happened,

1372
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,390
like the LM tried to use

1373
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,310
a made up cluster name in the beginning,

1374
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,810
but this was not existing, right?

1375
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,280
We had something else

1376
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,170
using the name with the cluster.

1377
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,760
So, in the first place it failed.

1378
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,800
But then it automatically understood

1379
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,990
that I need to go and
grab the cluster names.

1380
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:57,381
So what it does, in the next call,

1381
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:58,214
you can see it makes use

1382
00:46:58,214 --> 00:46:59,610
of the list cluster repair call,

1383
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,110
and then automatically tries to list

1384
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,640
the actual cluster name.

1385
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,250
So, it is doing it on its own,

1386
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,960
and trying to list the
right set of cluster

1387
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,490
that we have basically.

1388
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,630
- [Matheus] Thank you Jay.

1389
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,803
So we'll continue.

1390
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,340
So now it's listing the the service,

1391
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,840
so we have a service,

1392
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,280
and then in the ECS service

1393
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,870
we have the tasks, right.

1394
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,563
So it's describing the service now.

1395
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:28,170
It actually, it found the root cause.

1396
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,150
And then as you can, it's highlighting

1397
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,850
that the desire counts in the ECS

1398
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,400
for that specific service, is zero.

1399
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,890
Which means we don't have a backend,

1400
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,026
so there's no container

1401
00:47:40,026 --> 00:47:41,280
running behind the scenes.

1402
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,723
And then what Kiro CLI is gonna do now,

1403
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:46,410
is gonna provide me a root cause,

1404
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:49,440
and how to go and fix the problem.

1405
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,941
So as you can see,

1406
00:47:50,941 --> 00:47:52,650
it gives me detailed information

1407
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,873
of what was the problem.

1408
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:59,910
So if you think about
what the problem was,

1409
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,130
that's the screenshots of the ECS,

1410
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,860
and then the container is stopped,

1411
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,970
so there's no backend.

1412
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,070
That's what Kiro CLI found

1413
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:12,300
through the curing the AWS backend.

1414
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,343
So now what I'm saying to Kiri CLI,

1415
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:16,680
go and then add another container, right?

1416
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,920
So change the desired account to 021,

1417
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,750
and then test it again.

1418
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,880
So, Kiro CLI is running a command,

1419
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,493
adding an extra container to that service.

1420
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,810
And then if you see it's
waiting for 60 seconds.

1421
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,220
I just sped up the video

1422
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,900
just to avoid us waiting.

1423
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,550
But it's just waiting

1424
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,383
for the container to warm up.

1425
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:39,900
And then checking if now

1426
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,430
the container is healthy,

1427
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:43,780
and then starting again the same test

1428
00:48:44,701 --> 00:48:46,350
you've done before, to see if you know,

1429
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:49,020
now you can create a session.

1430
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,640
Let's see if, if you can create a session,

1431
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,040
if it actually solved the problem.

1432
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,690
So we'll provide the details

1433
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:55,590
of the session name,

1434
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:57,690
similar to what I've done before.

1435
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:01,893
Select a language and
then create a session.

1436
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:04,980
Here we go.

1437
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,356
Here we go.

1438
00:49:06,356 --> 00:49:07,830
So now it's able to create a session.

1439
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:10,200
Right, so Kiro CLI was able to go,

1440
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,480
and then simulate a user.

1441
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,070
You know, do all the testing.

1442
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:16,650
Go into AWS, understand
the whole environment.

1443
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:19,050
'Cause I haven't provided,
like this is my ECS.

1444
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:20,070
This is where the task is.

1445
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,830
So it was able to figure
out all the details,

1446
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:23,910
find the root cause.

1447
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:26,130
And once I provide a command

1448
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,533
it just went there, and
then fixed the problem.

1449
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,750
So, if you see, now we
have a running container

1450
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,683
in the backend.

1451
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:40,500
Alright, and then we are about to finish.

1452
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,020
I just wanted you to think for a second,

1453
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,663
what matters more in our use case?

1454
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,430
Is it the light?

1455
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,920
So if you see for my use case,

1456
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,300
the server is down,

1457
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,440
but my wife could, you know,

1458
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,850
continue to use the lights.

1459
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,020
Is it better?

1460
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,750
Or maybe the server was working

1461
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:58,650
without any problem,

1462
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:01,380
but the lights were
not, you know, working.

1463
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,310
And here's where I wanted you

1464
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:04,110
to start to think about working backwards

1465
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,190
from your customer.

1466
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,479
And understanding how critical

1467
00:50:07,479 --> 00:50:08,460
is the application, and defining

1468
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,480
with the business you know,

1469
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,363
how to deal in case you
have those situations.

1470
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,206
And then, let's get the key takeaways

1471
00:50:17,206 --> 00:50:19,140
for the day.

1472
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,780
So, in the case we talked
about backup, right.

1473
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,090
So in my case I could
have provided a candle,

1474
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,550
so my wife would be able to do her,

1475
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:29,370
you know, organize her
breakfast, using a candle.

1476
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:30,660
I also could have, you know,

1477
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,490
organized a game day.

1478
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,230
And in the family we understand

1479
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:36,960
how to proceed in case we had a bad day.

1480
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,570
Or as Jay mentioned, we
could have dashboards

1481
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,360
to understand how the
environment's operating.

1482
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,760
Create alarms, so if there's an issue,

1483
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,693
I get alerted.

1484
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:48,660
Also, it's really, really important

1485
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,720
to define the SLAs, SLOs, SLIs.

1486
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,250
Get the business together.

1487
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,630
Right, I've seen a lot of customers

1488
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:57,390
where it defined all of those numbers

1489
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:58,620
but they don't have, you know,

1490
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,360
the connection with their customers

1491
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,323
with the business.

1492
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,190
And lastly, as we all talked about AIs,

1493
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,590
I could have for example Alexa,

1494
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:09,840
and say, Alexa, go and
fix the lights for me.

1495
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,830
So, I hope you all have
enjoyed the session.

1496
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,810
One thing that I would ask you to do is,

1497
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:18,750
in your app you should
have access to the survey.

1498
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,340
It's really, really important for us,

1499
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,780
'cause I do actually read

1500
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,490
all of the, you know, feedback.

1501
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,713
'Cause that way we
improve our next session.

1502
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,581
And then here's the Call to action,

1503
00:51:29,581 --> 00:51:30,414
so you can scan and learn more

1504
00:51:30,414 --> 00:51:31,590
about what we discussed.

1505
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,075
Thank you.

1506
00:51:33,075 --> 00:51:33,908
