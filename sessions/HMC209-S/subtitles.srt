1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,020
- Thank you.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,312
(audience cheering)

3
00:00:04,312 --> 00:00:05,700
Hey everybody, how's it going?

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,370
I'm Brandon Wright, I'm a
product manager at Equinix,

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,180
and I focus in our fabric
network as a service platform.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,013
- I'm Ranga Thittai.

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,390
I'm the network go-to-market head at AWS.

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,380
- And today we're gonna be talking about

9
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,330
building high-performance, secure networks

10
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,803
for hybrid and multi-cloud.

11
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,520
So super quick, just a
quick agenda overview.

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,790
Ranga's gonna start us off and talk about

13
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,320
some customer use cases
of what they're seeing

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,320
around Direct Connect,

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,950
as well as data movement considerations,

16
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,920
Direct Connect, VPN, internet,
and things like that,

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,820
and what we see, behaviors,
and looking at scale and time.

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,170
And then we'll look at the case

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,240
for private hybrid multi-cloud,

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,740
including some use cases and examples

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,170
that we have on our
side with case studies.

22
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,120
And we'll talk a little
bit more about Equinix,

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,190
as well as some of our products

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,780
and the history behind Equinix,

25
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,840
and where we came from,
and where we are today.

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,190
I'll hand it over to Ranga.

27
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,500
- Thank you, Brandon.

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,870
Let's start off by
looking at the importance

29
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,100
of large data movements,

30
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,220
as it relates to your
go-to-market initiatives.

31
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,100
We all know about gen AI,
whether it's model training,

32
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,540
foundational models, if you're an ISV

33
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,940
or an FM provider, you're
training your models.

34
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,050
If you're an industry enterprise,

35
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,603
you're probably looking
at RAG initiatives.

36
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,180
You're building your RAG vector stores,

37
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,070
and that requires a lot of data movements.

38
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,505
You're consolidating your data

39
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:33,990
into centralized environments in AWS.

40
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,330
Talking of industries,
it's probably a cliche

41
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,430
to state that industries run on data.

42
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,410
But just to quote a couple of examples,

43
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,043
our automated vehicles,
connected manufacturing,

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,180
media digitization, media
production in the cloud,

45
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,940
all of them require large amounts of data

46
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,440
to be moved to AWS, perhaps
even on a continual basis,

47
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,273
right?

48
00:01:56,273 --> 00:02:00,000
But across industries, perhaps
the most common use case

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,160
that we all come across is migrations.

50
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,040
When you're doing your complete
migration to the cloud,

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,323
you're moving all your
data estates to AWS.

52
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,200
It's not surprising to see
some of these requiring

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,170
hundreds of petabytes of
data to be moved to AWS

54
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,450
within a matter of six to nine months.

55
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,080
And to achieve that, you need reliable

56
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,320
and high-bandwidth connectivity

57
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,970
to achieve those objectives.

58
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,490
Today, we'll talk about AWS solutions

59
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,170
as well as partner constructs

60
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,360
that enable these kind of use cases,

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,920
as well as network constructs

62
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,130
that allow low-latency connectivity

63
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,660
for distributed workloads

64
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,060
as well as distributed data access.

65
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,482
We look at some of the
characteristics of these solutions

66
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:46,590
and as well give you a couple of ways

67
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,333
to try them out, perhaps, as well.

68
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,740
Let's look at gen AI.

69
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,643
It's a hot topic.

70
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,090
So if you're engaging in model training,

71
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,920
Swami talked about frontier
models this morning,

72
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,410
which make you develop
those models from scratch

73
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,780
specific to your industry domain.

74
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,990
If you're an ISV or a
SaaS provider for AI,

75
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,400
you're also training your models

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,440
or fine-tuning your models.

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,240
If you're just an industry player,

78
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,490
you're looking to leverage
some of the foundation models

79
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,280
but create your own drag vector stores,

80
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,680
that also requires a lot of data

81
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,380
to be moved from hybrid ecosystems,

82
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,220
hybrid environments, multi-cloud
environments into AWS.

83
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,780
When it comes to inferencing,

84
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,798
you could also be engaging

85
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:33,870
in distributed inferencing, right?

86
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,510
You could be looking at hybrid drag

87
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,610
if you are compliance-oriented

88
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,610
or you could be considering hybrid EKS

89
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,850
if you are looking to
leverage distributed workloads

90
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,190
across hybrid environments.

91
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,280
In these cases, you're looking
at real-time interactions

92
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,170
and in these kind of situations,

93
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,870
getting a performant and
deterministic networks

94
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,030
becomes important so
that you're delivering

95
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,763
a consistent user experience
through that network.

96
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,060
That brings us to Direct Connect.

97
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,800
AWS Direct Connect is a
dedicated network path into AWS.

98
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,480
It avoids the internet.

99
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,150
It's basically not subject
to internet weather

100
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,080
and therefore delivers consistent
performance all the time.

101
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,590
It offers an availability SLA,

102
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,920
so for critical projects
like we spoke about,

103
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,300
you're guaranteed almost

104
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,660
to have a continual available
connectivity all the time

105
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,070
to get your end-to-end project done

106
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,320
or if you are distributing
those workloads,

107
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,490
mission-critical workloads,

108
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,530
and you need that consistent performance,

109
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,820
you're getting that all the time, right?

110
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,210
There's an extensive
coverage of this offering

111
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,460
available in more than 30 countries

112
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,370
in the excess of 100 locations.

113
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,250
Finally, it's also encrypted in layer two

114
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,540
through MAC encryption.

115
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,880
We call it MACSEC,

116
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,760
so it's particularly useful
in the case of compliance

117
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,610
space-specific use cases

118
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,340
where despite that dedicated connectivity,

119
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,960
you want your customer's data

120
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,383
to be moved in a compliant
encrypted fashion as well.

121
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,850
Let's put AWS Direct
Connect in the context

122
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,030
of those use cases that we
discussed initially, right?

123
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,720
So let's start by looking at a simple

124
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,720
10-petabyte data move, one session, right?

125
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,120
So, later on, we'll talk
about hosted Direct Connect

126
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,260
as a very simple turnkey
construct that partners host

127
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,150
and they just carve out
for customers like you,

128
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,110
but a hosted Direct Connect
offers a bandwidth of 25 gigs

129
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,870
and with that, you'd be able
to achieve this transfer

130
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,080
in one hour, right?

131
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,190
But if you're using a VPN
connection over the internet,

132
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,200
you're looking to get the same thing,

133
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,540
you're probably about 5% progressed,

134
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,540
assuming that availability
stays 100%, right?

135
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,780
Now, imagine using this
benefit 1,000 times

136
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,890
for a 10-petabyte
migration project, right?

137
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,530
So that adds up, that reliability

138
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,370
and that ability to move that data fast

139
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,440
for each of your little data islands

140
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,360
as you prepare them and you curate them

141
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,160
and you move them into AWS,

142
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,280
that benefit adds up if you consider that.

143
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,340
When it comes to distributed
workloads and data access,

144
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,680
AWS offers the shortest path.

145
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,540
It's also a dedicated connection.

146
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,690
Therefore, it offers that
performant connectivity

147
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,530
that you're required to
give that consistent latency

148
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,950
or response time, especially
when it comes to workloads.

149
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,450
We heard Swami talk about response times

150
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,240
of these gen AI agents.

151
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,700
You don't want your network to be adding

152
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,613
to that response time and latency as well.

153
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,320
All right, so how do you get your data

154
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,260
and your distributed environments

155
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,770
connected to AWS through Direct Connect?

156
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,630
And that's where our partners come in.

157
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,210
Our partners offer that
turnkey connectivity

158
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,570
to get you connected quickly and easily.

159
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,283
Based on your use cases,

160
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,980
the connectivity models they offer

161
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,450
are also elastic.

162
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,860
They can also be customizable

163
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,200
based on your render choices as well.

164
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,180
With that, I pass this back to Equinix,

165
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,780
our sponsors for this
session, to take this forward.

166
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:16,883
- Thanks, Ranga.

167
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,400
All right, team.

168
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,537
Talk a little bit about why Equinix,

169
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:26,610
a little bit of history of Equinix.

170
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,710
Been around for about 26 years.

171
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,903
Started out as internet exchange.

172
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,750
Network service providers
came through and said,

173
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,560
hey, trying to interconnect.

174
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,703
Growth of the internet was exploding.

175
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,660
And Equinix was that neutral
interconnect provider.

176
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,760
That business continued to grow.

177
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,290
And soon after, we had customers

178
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,880
interested in connecting to public clouds,

179
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,470
public clouds as partners.

180
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,560
And again, Equinix being a
neutral interconnect partner,

181
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,690
we're able to provide connectivity to AWS

182
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,290
and many others, cloud
providers, service providers,

183
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,850
network service providers.

184
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,100
And then over time,

185
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,170
we've grown to 11,000 plus enterprises

186
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,920
using our platform.

187
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,740
And then beyond that,

188
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,050
it's allowed us to create
what we have today,

189
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,580
which we call Equinix Fabric.

190
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,890
This is a network as a service platform,

191
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,800
available across 270 plus data centers

192
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,600
in 36 countries,

193
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,230
spanning 75 different
metros and six continents.

194
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,880
This is a completely global
software-defined network.

195
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,130
And of those, we have 220
or more cloud on-ramps,

196
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,393
including AWS.

197
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,690
56 of those are AWS Direct Connect.

198
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,523
You can see them.

199
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:37,320
They're little off-color
there, squares on the map.

200
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,150
And those are areas where
we have direct on-ramps

201
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,623
from our data centers in
our Fabric network to AWS.

202
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,010
And across our global network,

203
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,660
we're using more than 2,000
fiber and telco networks.

204
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,260
All of that combined and providing

205
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,340
that level of connectivity

206
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,190
and reliability allows
us to offer a five nines

207
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,537
global uptime and reliability SLA.

208
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,300
As part of our fabric network,

209
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,010
one of the newer products
that we've launched

210
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,860
in January 2024 is our
fabric cloud router.

211
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,290
This is a completely
service-based solution.

212
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,240
Doesn't run on virtual appliances.

213
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,140
There's no licensing.

214
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,660
There's no other hardware
required from the customer.

215
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,220
It allows you to on-demand,

216
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,510
turn up instances in the
metro that you wanna deploy

217
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,250
and create your connections from.

218
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,780
It does this within minutes.

219
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,430
And it's fully distributed and supports

220
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,950
natively high-available connectivity.

221
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,560
So primary and secondary
data path connectivity

222
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,723
that is completely independent end-to-end.

223
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,520
We offer various different
packages and tiers

224
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,650
depending on the performance
and route scale requirements

225
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,050
that customers have.

226
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,570
But that allows us to
offer multiple different

227
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,670
very economical options for FCR.

228
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,020
And then from a scalability perspective

229
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,370
in terms of throughput,

230
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,920
we offer everything from 50
megabit individual connections

231
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,920
all the way up to 100 gigabit
individual connections

232
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,620
in an aggregate supporting
greater than a terabit

233
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,460
of aggregate throughput

234
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,563
across that single cloud router instance.

235
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,550
So as we look at different on-demand

236
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,500
hybrid multi-cloud connectivity,

237
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,770
we have customers that are
deployed in multiple metros.

238
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,240
They can deploy a cloud router,

239
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,760
they can interconnect with
their co-located infrastructure

240
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,200
via Fabric Port.

241
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,600
They can do that at up
to 100 gigabit today.

242
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,560
And then they can also connect

243
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,030
to different cloud providers as well.

244
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,820
One of the benefits here
is that customers that may

245
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,930
have traditionally interconnected

246
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,260
between AWS and maybe a
secondary cloud provider,

247
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,770
they were doing routing in BGP

248
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,945
back to a co-located infrastructure,

249
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:32,310
a co-located router that they had.

250
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,350
Maybe it was within an
Equinix data center,

251
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,450
maybe it was all the way back on-prem,

252
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,460
which meant any
connectivity that was routed

253
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,630
between the two cloud providers

254
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,670
had to effectively hairpin back

255
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,620
to wherever that router was.

256
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,060
And that's where Fabric
Cloud Router comes in

257
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,630
and provides extremely low latency

258
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,260
and interconnect as we have local on-ramps

259
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,753
with multiple cloud
providers across our metros.

260
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,450
And then looking a little bit
more into the performance,

261
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,030
on the right you'll see
some data that I pulled.

262
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,520
This is some testing that I
had done a few months ago,

263
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,653
but a couple key points to call out here.

264
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,770
On top of the fact that
the Fabric Cloud Router

265
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,640
is completely private

266
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,460
and operates across our
Equinix private network,

267
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,980
we do also have what we call IPWAN,

268
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,390
or it's the IP VPN network.

269
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,520
It's a true
multipoint-to-multipoint network.

270
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,890
And I can interconnect
my Fabric Cloud Routers

271
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,340
across different metros within,
let's say, North America.

272
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,080
I can also extend into
EMEA and APAC as well.

273
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,900
So I have both regional and
global network constructs.

274
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,010
I can set the speed or
throughput that I want on those.

275
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,630
And in this particular example,

276
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,580
I've got a cloud router
that's deployed in Seattle,

277
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,010
and I've got one deployed in Ashburn.

278
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,800
I'm connecting to AWS on the West Coast,

279
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,500
and I'm connecting, in this
case, to GCP on the East Coast.

280
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,410
I have 10-gigabit virtual connections,

281
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,050
so this is a AWS-hosted Direct Connect,

282
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,670
as well as Google's counterpart there

283
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,520
with regards to Cloud interconnectivity.

284
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,460
And then I've got two virtual
machines, one on each end.

285
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,740
And going from West Coast,

286
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,090
all the way to East Coast,

287
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:04,170
between 63 milliseconds
or around on average.

288
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,100
A couple things to call out here.

289
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,730
When we're doing interconnectivity
between these metros

290
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,410
and going across our private network,

291
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,390
rather than going across the internet,

292
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,450
we effectively have
four predetermined hops.

293
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,670
I have my Direct Connect gateway.

294
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,200
I've got my cloud router,

295
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,900
my second cloud router on the
other side of the country,

296
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,610
and then my Google cloud router

297
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,410
on the other end of the connection.

298
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,420
Beyond that, obviously,
there's the endpoints

299
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,940
or the IP addresses of the actual VMs,

300
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,560
but it's extremely predictable.

301
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,270
Whereas if I'm going over the internet,

302
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,070
I can run two different trace routes

303
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,560
and I may take completely different paths.

304
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,570
It may be somewhat unreliable

305
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,460
or essentially best effort, right?

306
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,630
So there's a lot of predictability

307
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,490
in terms of performance, jitter.

308
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,830
So for latency-sensitive applications,

309
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,540
even across longer distances,

310
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,950
we see a lot of success there as well

311
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,100
with Fabric Cloud Router
and our Fabric network.

312
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,900
Taking it a little bit further down,

313
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,360
customers should expect to see line rate

314
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,500
across this connectivity.

315
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,450
There's still layer
two connectivity there,

316
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,920
and with the Fabric Cloud
Router, we're just building

317
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
layer three connectivity on top of that.

318
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,540
So in this particular example, you'll see,

319
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,070
if you're familiar with iPerf,

320
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,660
these are two very, very small VMs

321
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,830
with my only criteria being
they could do 10 gigabit out.

322
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,560
So the VM size, number of vCPUs,

323
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,770
frequency and amount of
memory is extremely limited.

324
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,070
So you'll see, I ran 100
parallel threads with TCP

325
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,020
and changed the congestion algorithm

326
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,530
because I was going across
either end of the country,

327
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:35,820
and it was completely
saturating my virtual machines.

328
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,870
But we were able to achieve
9.5 gigabit per second

329
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,900
on one end and 9.26 on
the other end as well.

330
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,220
And then on the bottom
there, when I'm using UDP,

331
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,590
a lot less, no congestion there,

332
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,080
and you'll see that I effectively hit

333
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,580
very, very, very close
to what I would expect

334
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,550
to get line rate with 63
milliseconds of latency.

335
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,380
And you'll see on the very,
very bottom, actually,

336
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,180
I'm not running multiple
parallel threads there,

337
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,680
and you'll see 9.89 gigabit sent,

338
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,450
and I'm only getting 4.92 back,

339
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,160
and I'm simply running into
single flow limitations

340
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,780
with connectivity on the return path.

341
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,330
So that's not a limitation
on the cloud router.

342
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,180
It's just an AWS networking
single flow limitation.

343
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,100
If I was to run parallel threads there,

344
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,283
we could saturate the
whole thing, no problem.

345
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,940
The last thing we'll kinda talk about

346
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,950
is some customer case studies.

347
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,550
The first one here is gonna
focus on speed and agility,

348
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,000
and then the second one we're
talking about is raw scale.

349
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,033
Right, so we had a customer
approach us some time back.

350
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,460
This is completely new.

351
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,410
They had heard of Equinix.

352
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,090
They weren't currently using Equinix.

353
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,730
They came to us and said,
hey, we're deployed in AWS

354
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,260
on the East Coast.

355
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,670
We recently acquired a company.

356
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,100
We work in the financial
services industry,

357
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,900
particularly in automotive loans,

358
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,950
and one of the products
that we participate in,

359
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,220
the dealers will query
out when an individual

360
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,420
is looking to purchase a vehicle,

361
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,180
and they'll reach out to
multiple institutions,

362
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,710
and it's almost kind of a race

363
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,690
to see who responds back first,

364
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,090
and it kinda goes down in a list.

365
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,730
What they were aiming to do
is move higher up in the list

366
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,640
in terms of how quickly they can respond.

367
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,320
If that person was approved for the loan,

368
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
they could respond quickly,

369
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,200
get closer to the top of the list,

370
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,880
and therefore may have more success

371
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,333
with the dealership
selecting their institution.

372
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,000
This particular morning,

373
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,950
I jumped on a call with a salesperson.

374
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,200
They said, hey, I'm
talking to somebody new.

375
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,400
Can you help me out?

376
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,720
I said, yeah, sure.

377
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,210
And so I talked to
somebody for about an hour.

378
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,550
This was about 8:30 in the morning,

379
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,170
and then by 12:30 in the afternoon,

380
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,310
he had reached out and said,

381
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,430
Yeah, I got it deployed, it works.

382
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,620
So within four hours,

383
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,280
somebody who had never even
had an account jumped in,

384
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,120
went through our process,

385
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,920
and in this case, they went
through our marketplace,

386
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,980
which I'll share about
in just a moment as well,

387
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,360
some more about that,

388
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,570
but effectively met us for the first time,

389
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,980
kinda gave him some direction,

390
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,150
and then he went off and running,

391
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,510
and later that afternoon was
extremely, extremely happy

392
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,913
with his ability to
interconnect AWS with Azure.

393
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,320
And in the second case study here

394
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,270
is an autonomous vehicle company

395
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,400
with some huge requirements

396
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,620
in terms of data that
they're transferring,

397
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,680
so autonomous vehicles
collecting data periodically,

398
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,030
multiple fleets of
vehicles across the country

399
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,740
that effectively totaled
500 terabytes a day

400
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,140
that they needed to transfer

401
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,233
into a mixture of S3
and other public clouds.

402
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,780
And this customer,

403
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,740
one way that we helped
solve this for this customer

404
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,020
across the country

405
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,830
was having a physical
presence in the data centers

406
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,980
in the regions that they had
their autonomous vehicles,

407
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,350
and then utilizing AWS Direct Connect

408
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,960
with multiple 25 gigabit
circuits, virtual connections,

409
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,280
to move that data into AWS.

410
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,980
And we were able to successfully
do this for the country,

411
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,420
excuse me, for the customer,

412
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,710
and even with the ability for
that fleet to require moving

413
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,210
because of the number of data centers

414
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,280
that we have across the country,

415
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,433
it's worked extremely
well for that customer.

416
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,800
And then finally, as I
mentioned a moment ago,

417
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,990
we do have a seven-day trial
of our Fabric Cloud Router

418
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,660
that is available on AWS Marketplace.

419
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,580
If you're interested in
multi-cloud connectivity,

420
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:28,020
hybrid multi-cloud, and
wanna give it a try,

421
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,950
it's our full standard paid version,

422
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,060
but it's free for seven days,

423
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,720
and it comes with two 200
megabit virtual connections

424
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,560
that you can turn up.

425
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,910
If you'd like to use a smaller speed

426
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,820
or a lower speed as well,

427
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,123
down to 50 megabit, you
can do that as well.

428
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,110
Last thing I'll mention is
I'm happy to answer questions.

429
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,160
We have a booth that's actually

430
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,300
right behind the pavilion here, booth 335.

431
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,880
If you'd like to come by
and ask any questions.

432
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,560
Otherwise, I think we're good.

433
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,760
- Thank you, and please do take a moment

434
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,410
to give us survey feedback as well.

435
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,580
It should be in your apps.

436
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,570
Thank you very much.

437
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,523
- [Brandon] Thank you.
