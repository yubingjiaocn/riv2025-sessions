  "abstract": "19 of the top 20 pharma companies run their compute on AWS. Drug discovery research and development (R&D) involves various techniques, such as microscopy imaging, molecular dynamics simulation, and virtual screening. These techniques require the management and processing of petabytes of data and have heterogeneous compute requirements. Researchers are also incorporating generative AI to predict protein structures and drive scientific discovery with incorporation of scientific literature findings. Come learn from the AWS Solutions Architects working daily to solve these compute problems on cloud. Bring your questions - this interactive session will dive deep into real-world solutions through whiteboarding and discussion.",
