00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
- - [Dhawal Sharma]
Good afternoon everyone,

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,390
and thanks for joining us for

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,720
this session, which is about,

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,570
what are the things that
we see at Zscaler with AI,

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,390
and what we've been doing with Zero Trust.

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,070
I also am fortunate to have
Matt Matthew with me, who is one

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,680
of our champions, who has drove some

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,720
of our technology at Amazon Robotics.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,480
He'll talk about how they went about it.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,290
So there's a lot of things that
I want to touch upon, cover.

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,830
We'll be around, happy to
answer any questions afterwards.

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,753
I thought instead of trying
to hit on one topic, I want to

13
00:00:34,753 --> 00:00:38,940
focus on what's the bigger
picture that we are looking at,

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,410
key trends things.

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,810
So I'll try to hit on many of them,

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,580
but, if time permits,

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,280
we'll take some live
questions in the end as well.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,660
So we are seeing a big shift
in the intelligent systems.

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,086
A lot of focus on automation.

20
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,610
You know, everyone talks
about APIs and automation,

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,710
and with agents,

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,427
and AI coming into the
picture that is becoming,

23
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:05,220
the race is becoming actually even worse.

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,470
Now, there were some
things that are lacking

25
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,870
and the adoption of agent frameworks.

26
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,433
Now, some of the things that
we are seeing around identity

27
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:14,255
and authorization for
agents, we are seeing

28
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:17,190
how the infrastructure
is readily available.

29
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,020
Some of those barriers are going away.

30
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,417
But if I take a step back,
you know, I've been at Zscaler

31
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:24,410
for close to 14 years now.

32
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,470
When we started the company
at that time, there was a big

33
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,303
focus on,

34
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:32,040
from CISO, we used to
hear, we never gonna take

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,060
our security to the cloud.

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,295
Security is meant to be
built into the data centers.

37
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,030
There are some mega waves that
come that provide tailwinds

38
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,370
to adoption of newer technologies.

39
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,687
It was internet, cloud, zero trust.

40
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,380
You know, it create new opportunities.

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,270
It changes the paradigms on

42
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,435
how we have seen a world
evolve over a period of time.

43
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:54,060
And it also needs a little
bit of mindset change on

44
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,711
practitioners like yourself.

45
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:58,755
But when we think about these waves,

46
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:00,240
there are some giga waves

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,970
that happen which
subsumed these mega waves.

48
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,470
It was industrial revolution

49
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,860
and we believe the big giga
wave we are seeing right now

50
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,420
is the AI revolution.

51
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,270
It started three years ago
when Chat GPT came out,

52
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,475
but that was tip of the iceberg.

53
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:16,890
There's a lot more
happening in this space.

54
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,972
Companies like us are also, you know,

55
00:02:20,972 --> 00:02:23,100
we are evolving.

56
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,100
We are not just embedding,
we started with the focus

57
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,387
of embedding AI.

58
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:29,490
We, everything that we do as a company,

59
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,572
all of our products are becoming
more intelligent with AI.

60
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:34,440
But also how do we extend the platform

61
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,052
to secure AI for our customers?

62
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:40,726
So as we think about this
whole concept of trust, right?

63
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:44,970
We all built implicit trust
in networks to begin with.

64
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,083
I started my career building networks

65
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,510
and I know one of the thing

66
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,070
that we always did was,

67
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,770
we started by building trusted networks

68
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,030
and entrusted networks.

69
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,166
That's how firewalls
came into the picture.

70
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,990
But over a period of time, you know,

71
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,320
what we also realized is in
this world lateral movement,

72
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,110
you know, ransomware attacks, these happen

73
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,640
because the way we have built networks,

74
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,712
the attackers have
evolved to exploit that.

75
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:12,270
So the traditional security
models do not work anymore.

76
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,365
Like having, connecting
two sites with VPNs

77
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:17,790
and putting firewalls that
give you a false sense

78
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,899
of security doesn't work anymore.

79
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,950
Moreover, the new form
factors that are evolving,

80
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,150
whether it's AI agents

81
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,740
or IoT OT

82
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,200
traditionally we see
still people using a OT

83
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,550
IT separation firewall.

84
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,800
It doesn't really do anything
from a security perspective.

85
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,729
Just creates say demarcation point.

86
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:36,840
And then you think
about distributed system

87
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,010
that are always communicating

88
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,192
how do you secure that traffic?

89
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:43,350
So the goal is to make sure you
can adopt these technologies

90
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,966
to be more productive, but
with a secure framework.

91
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:50,027
We at Zscaler started with one
single vision 15 years ago.

92
00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:53,692
I remember when we sat in
a room, we said basically

93
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,875
we will be a policy engine

94
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,550
or a switchboard between
traffic going from any source

95
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,070
of traffic to any destination.

96
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,269
Source, at the beginning was a user,

97
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:05,970
traffic was going to internet.

98
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,260
So we basically said what is the best

99
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,880
way to secure that traffic?

100
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,643
We built this highly scalable

101
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,900
distributed proxy in the cloud.

102
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,489
Then VPNs became a problem.

103
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,310
We build the zero trust architecture,

104
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,950
zero trust network access back in 2016

105
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,450
and now everyone talks about it.

106
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,260
So the intent is we all
have until then tried

107
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,590
to secure this communication using network

108
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,769
as a control channel.

109
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,800
Network is a way to connect things.

110
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
Network should not be the one

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,160
that on which the
security should be built.

112
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,889
IP addressing is a way to
label how traffic flows, not

113
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,200
how you secure things.

114
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,689
So that is the genesis
of how we have evolved.

115
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:46,860
Now, we everyone talks about
digital transformation.

116
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,992
We play a role in that.

117
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:50,351
The digital transformation
start with, you know,

118
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:53,940
customers transforming
their application lift

119
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,216
and shift to the application of the cloud

120
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:58,676
or building cloud native apps.

121
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:02,220
We partner with AWS,

122
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,050
and all of the hyper scalers

123
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,360
to make sure we provide fast connectivity

124
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,820
to these applications
running in public cloud.

125
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,740
But where we play a role is on the network

126
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,030
in the security transformation.

127
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,130
It started with the
security transformation,

128
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,180
network was plumbing,

129
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,012
everyone was using a
router-fi or a SD-WAN.

130
00:05:19,012 --> 00:05:22,472
But now everyone is questioning
towards moving it towards a

131
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:25,374
zero trust based branch model.

132
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:28,652
Where the network is
just a way to connect.

133
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:33,030
It is easier to connect, you
can drop in a connection,

134
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,210
but it also has the concept
of zero trust built into it.

135
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,770
And I'll talk about that
in a minute as well.

136
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,190
But these are the two aspects
on which we play a role

137
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,614
and are able to extend our platform.

138
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:46,454
Now, when we think about zero trust,

139
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:48,619
we think about zero trust.

140
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:50,273
Everyone talked with ZTNA.

141
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:53,940
So ZTNA to us is not really
was a use case, right?

142
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,570
Zero trust network access is
users accessing applications.

143
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,313
Remote access without VPN,

144
00:05:59,313 --> 00:06:01,530
that problem we have solved for many area.

145
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,899
In fact, one of the thing that we did,

146
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,090
especially after pandemic, you know,

147
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,860
everyone went to A-Z-T-N-A model

148
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,230
as employees started coming back to work,

149
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,150
we built this inside out zero trust model

150
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,500
with our customers.

151
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,940
Basically saying since users

152
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,170
are sitting in a corporate network,

153
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,100
I don't want to connect them

154
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,440
to application just because
they're on the network.

155
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,140
So inside out, zero trust evolve.

156
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,150
Then the concept of zero
trust everywhere evolve,

157
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,150
where we basically said, zero
trust is not just about users,

158
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,330
it's also about your third
party contractor, B2B users

159
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,252
or B2B sites.

160
00:06:32,252 --> 00:06:35,210
We have like large
distribution companies who talk

161
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,528
to their supply chain
with site to site VPN.

162
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:40,440
Those companies don't have
a good security posture.

163
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,090
You can get your compromise through that.

164
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,160
So how do you make sure the zero trust get

165
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,510
extended for those use cases?

166
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,720
Then zero trust also gets extended

167
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,860
for workloads in the cloud.

168
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,010
One of the thing we have been
focusing very heavily in our

169
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,399
partnership with AWSs,

170
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,640
building a cloud native gateway service,

171
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,727
being able to secure all
the workloads ingressing

172
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:01,290
to the cloud without
deploying any firewalls.

173
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,810
So we have a very detailed
deep dive on this tomorrow.

174
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,360
If you're interested, you can
come back for that session

175
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,430
and then zero trust for physical sites.

176
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,970
And the new frontier that is
emerging is AI infrastructure.

177
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,710
Not just the Chat GPTs

178
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,990
or Gemini, the world that
you're using on your laptop,

179
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,260
but you think about agents
that you're gonna build

180
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,467
with agent core or foundational
model on Bedrock, right?

181
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:25,307
And they go across around the boundary

182
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:27,040
of a single hyper scaler to,

183
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,944
let's say, build with,

184
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:31,621
I was talking to someone at Agent Code,

185
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:34,920
they are also integrating with
the the models people can use

186
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,660
in Open AI for example.

187
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,550
So these boundaries will transient

188
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,335
and our goal is to secure
those communication as well.

189
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,470
But we are the switchboard policy engine

190
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,420
that sits in between.

191
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,450
So when we think about the transformation

192
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,880
that we typically see
in this architecture,

193
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,779
a lot of our customers come to us

194
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,668
from very traditional network

195
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:58,260
and firewall based architecture

196
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,820
where they back haul traffic,

197
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,214
they are connecting things,

198
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,096
bringing traffic to
certain traffic checkpoints

199
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:05,730
in their data centers

200
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,980
or in public cloud and then they're

201
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,530
establishing connectivity, right?

202
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,883
In this model there is network
complexity and cost involved.

203
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:15,792
There is a redundancy of security controls

204
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:17,718
and then there is also complexity

205
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:19,498
of managing that security stack.

206
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:23,280
Our goal is to shift customers
towards a simplified model

207
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,692
where we are the policy engine.

208
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:26,456
You bring traffic to us,

209
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:30,180
we give you form factors like
a client on the user desktop.

210
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,980
We have a physical appliance

211
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,405
that you can deploy at your site

212
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:36,900
or you could have a virtual
form factor in public cloud

213
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,310
where there's a lot of virtualization

214
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,930
to bring traffic to us.

215
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,320
Bring with the right user
context, workload context,

216
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,580
or with IoT device context
and build policies on it.

217
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,050
And do it in a way

218
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,090
that you are not doing
10 different policies

219
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,040
that don't understand each
other with a single context,

220
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,130
single policy that is tied into
your business requirements.

221
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,407
Now when we think about
zero trust for users,

222
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,000
there are a couple of things we do, right?

223
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,620
User could be coming from any device,

224
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,760
any location

225
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,020
or a guest wifi.

226
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,240
Could be a non-employee,

227
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,317
third party contractor,

228
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:14,640
when they're going to things
that are running on internet,

229
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,450
even SaaS applications like
Office 365, Google apps,

230
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,640
you don't run the namespace of that,

231
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,473
you don't manage them.

232
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:22,800
They are SaaS service, right?

233
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,380
So you wanna make sure that
you are securing all those

234
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,550
traffic flows,

235
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,800
and there are applications
that are managed by you,

236
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,210
whether they're running your data center

237
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,712
or they're running in AWS,

238
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:33,330
you own the namespace,

239
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,160
you own the DNS for them, right?

240
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,590
So your goal is to make
sure those applications are

241
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,790
not exposed on internet.

242
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,380
That is one of the foundational principle

243
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,180
where we say your IPs,

244
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,400
your namespace goes dark on the internet.

245
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,662
That is exactly what we're
private access service to,

246
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:48,977
but security should not come at expense

247
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:50,615
of the user experience.

248
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:54,540
So we, that's why we have
165 pops across the globe.

249
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,238
We can also extend our
footprint into a private

250
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:58,572
or hybrid deployment,

251
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:00,891
but things can go wrong not

252
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,570
because of where your
security is happening.

253
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,735
It can go wrong because
of end user device issues,

254
00:10:06,735 --> 00:10:11,190
network ISP issues or
application performance.

255
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,470
So we measure that digital experience

256
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,000
and tell you where the problems are

257
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,300
and can offer you root
cause remediation for it.

258
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,510
But there as you adopt
new technology, you have

259
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,910
to retire your older technology.

260
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,230
Everyone's looking for cost savings.

261
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,800
So what we think of Zscaler,
like DMZ in the cloud,

262
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,660
we are subsuming the
functionality of a lot

263
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,493
of inbound outboard DMZs
that you have built,

264
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:35,721
a lot of traditional
networking you have built,

265
00:10:35,721 --> 00:10:38,730
and replace that with the
zero trust architecture.

266
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,283
And as you think about,

267
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,390
how this,

268
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,070
stack is evolving,

269
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,717
one of the thing that I keep
hearing from customers is,

270
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:51,360
"I need to segment my network,

271
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,620
I need to segment my users,

272
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,116
I need to segment my applications".

273
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:57,314
We have built segmentation
as a foundational

274
00:10:57,314 --> 00:11:00,349
policy construct in all of the products.

275
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:03,063
So you don't need a separate VLAN

276
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:06,090
or a IP network segmentation
tool, IP segmentation,

277
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,670
micro segmentation,
they all become complex.

278
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,840
They all are different rule sets.

279
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,220
They don't talk to each other.

280
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,160
I have worked with very large
banks with 300,000 users

281
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,790
and like 2,000 user
security engineering teams

282
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,840
that have struggled to deploy

283
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,880
micro segmentation product at scale.

284
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,360
Our goal is to make sure we
basically learn the behavior.

285
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,910
This is one area where we
basically introduce the concept

286
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,797
of intelligent segmentation or
AI in policies few years ago.

287
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:33,024
We basically understand who's going where.

288
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:35,760
Especially in your namespace
you could have a window server

289
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,620
running on under a rack for 10 years.

290
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,777
You don't know who's
accessing that, right?

291
00:11:39,777 --> 00:11:42,270
You don't want to unplug it,
you don't want to block it

292
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,977
because you don't know what will break.

293
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:46,737
What we do is we basically
understand who goes where

294
00:11:46,737 --> 00:11:48,900
and come up with a baseline policy

295
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,437
that we recommend and
you can implement it.

296
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:53,370
You immediately go from 0% segmentation

297
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,952
to 40,50% segmentation.

298
00:11:54,952 --> 00:11:57,655
Now we are going deeper into it.

299
00:11:57,655 --> 00:11:59,730
We what what we introduced
recently is we actually go

300
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,228
inside a department and
say these specific users go

301
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:04,528
to this application on port 4, 4, 3,

302
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:07,470
there are five app users in IT who go

303
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,970
to this application on a high port.

304
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,160
They probably are
maintaining this application.

305
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,254
You create a segmentation
policy for them on

306
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:16,449
that high port specifically
giving you more granular

307
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:19,033
identity specific segmentation,

308
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:22,230
and then you can push that
user group through skim

309
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,320
to your directory to basically
have fine grain segmentation.

310
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,750
We have customers who are
moving towards close to 80,

311
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,910
90% segmentation with this architecture.

312
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,998
So segmentation becomes a
practical deployment architecture

313
00:12:32,998 --> 00:12:36,327
and not just a theoretical
concept with this.

314
00:12:36,327 --> 00:12:39,330
So this is what we have
been doing really well.

315
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,790
I want to talk about what
we are gonna do in the cloud

316
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,440
and the AI space.

317
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,393
But before that, I would
like to invite Matthew

318
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:47,970
to join me here

319
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,250
to talk about the security transformation

320
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,720
at Amazon Robotics.

321
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,553
Matthew.

322
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:56,490
(audience clapping)

323
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,660
- It's for you.

324
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,493
- Thank you.

325
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:01,860
- Thank you Dhawal.

326
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,850
Good afternoon all.

327
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,200
My name is Matthew Foreman,

328
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,501
I'm a senior technical program
manager at Amazon Robotics.

329
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:11,497
I have the distinct pleasure
of serving alongside 150

330
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:15,120
of some of the most
skilled IT professionals

331
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,492
in the industry.

332
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:21,190
Today, happens to be my
3,852nd day one at Amazon.

333
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:24,360
(cameraman chuckling)

334
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,430
For those of you working
on doing that math,

335
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,050
carrying the one with
your fingers and toes,

336
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,763
it's about 10 and a half years,

337
00:13:29,763 --> 00:13:32,730
that puts me in the top two
and a half percent globally

338
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,220
by tenure at Amazon.

339
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,420
Today, however,

340
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,983
is my first day one
presenting at AWS Reinvent.

341
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,750
So I'm not a betting man, which
makes me a pretty lame guy

342
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,570
that go out to Vegas after the conference.

343
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,852
But I promise you

344
00:13:49,852 --> 00:13:52,983
that we're all gonna learn
something today, myself included.

345
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,300
At Amazon, one of our core philosophies is

346
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,433
that every day, is day one.

347
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,100
So what does that mean?

348
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,100
Our day one culture is not only a culture,

349
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,010
but it's also an operating model.

350
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,060
When we put the customers at
the center of everything we do,

351
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,674
we solve their problems.

352
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:16,740
When you combine that customer's obsession

353
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,074
with long-term thinking

354
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:20,820
and innovation, you start to understand

355
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,103
how Amazon approaches problems.

356
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:28,620
So who are our customers,
at Amazon Robotics?

357
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,164
We have about 5,000 Amazon associates

358
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:36,330
that our group covers across
nine distinct research

359
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,609
and development sites.

360
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:41,910
And that population has
collectively deployed over a million

361
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:46,233
robotic systems across
300 facilities worldwide.

362
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,879
As a business unit, Amazon robotics

363
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,364
has a goal to create a safe, efficient,

364
00:14:54,364 --> 00:14:57,348
and sustainable workplace.

365
00:14:57,348 --> 00:15:00,510
In the context of today's conversation,

366
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,973
safe includes information security.

367
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,800
Robotics IT is chartered
with providing differentiated

368
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,885
services to our customers.

369
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:14,160
Hardware engineers, electrical engineers,

370
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,873
software engineers, industrial
engineers, EHS engineers,

371
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:21,510
compliance, designers, lab technicians,

372
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:26,070
manufacturing technicians,
supply chain professionals,

373
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,930
strategy leaders,

374
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,825
learning and development,
security, facilities.

375
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:33,053
I'm probably getting very close
to naming my favorite child,

376
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,100
which is a proud father of one.

377
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,900
I haven't yet mastered that skill yet.

378
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,220
(cameraman chuckling)

379
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,670
What we're not responsible
for at Amazon Robotics IT,

380
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,060
enterprise wide services,
things like exchange,

381
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,387
Microsoft 365, unified
communication, printing,

382
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:53,760
standard non-specialized
productivity networks,

383
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,873
and builder tools.

384
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,070
So Amazon as a company,

385
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,663
began their zero trust
journey many years ago.

386
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:04,620
And I'm very happy to share,

387
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,570
that at the end of 2023,

388
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,403
almost two years ago exactly,

389
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:10,979
we completed phase one of

390
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:14,531
what we call our unfabric
program internally.

391
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:18,611
We externalized 454 sites,

392
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,790
facilities, excuse me,

393
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,910
and 158,000 applications.

394
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,370
Now when I say we, that's
really enterprise engineering,

395
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,513
not Robotics IT.

396
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:31,500
Like most programs however,

397
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,713
it's subject to the 80/20 rule.

398
00:16:33,713 --> 00:16:36,341
You can have a world class
solution that solves 80%

399
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:40,080
of your problem, but
there's always a tail.

400
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,580
There's always something that doesn't fit

401
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,111
into your deployment model.

402
00:16:43,111 --> 00:16:47,280
In our context, that's
legacy applications.

403
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,224
What do we call a legacy application?

404
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:51,005
A legacy application is one

405
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:55,348
that requires private
network access between users

406
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,270
and applications.

407
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,990
That application might be a
service, it might be a server,

408
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,330
it might be a file store,
it might be a SQL server.

409
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,220
Whatever it is, it expects

410
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,320
to live on the same private network.

411
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,330
Many of these applications

412
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,280
that we support in our business unit

413
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,300
are COS, commercial off
the shelf applications.

414
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,726
We don't have the ability to
modernize those applications.

415
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:20,604
We can ask nicely,

416
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:23,700
but ultimately we're
beholden to our vendors.

417
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,763
Some of these applications also use

418
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:27,880
natively insecure protocols.

419
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,583
Telnet, anyone?

420
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,120
So what do we do?

421
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,760
Well, we look at the portfolio.

422
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,240
I have a a subsection of the applications

423
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,430
that we use up on the screen behind me.

424
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,870
I'm gonna pause for just a moment

425
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,610
and allow everyone to
sort of skim through that.

426
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,553
I know it's a little bit of an eye chart.

427
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,398
So these tools generally fall into,

428
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:58,863
let's say three categories.

429
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,030
You will use these tools
in your environment,

430
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,000
which is what we do at Amazon Robotics.

431
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,550
You'll use tools similar to these,

432
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,790
to support staff,

433
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,290
or your teams.

434
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,990
That laundry list of engineering
disciplines, hardware,

435
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,420
electrical software, industrial,
EHS, compliance, design,

436
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,820
manufacturing, supply chain,

437
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,350
almost all of them use a tool

438
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,353
that is either on this screen
or in these product families.

439
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,440
And if, if you're thinking
to yourself, well Matthew,

440
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,180
I don't support any of these people.

441
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,013
I'm,

442
00:18:31,013 --> 00:18:33,117
I really would rather
you just keep moving.

443
00:18:33,117 --> 00:18:35,830
Every IT professional's
favorite peripheral,

444
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,173
printers,

445
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,345
I guarantee you,

446
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:42,870
I don't guarantee, in all
likelihood in your environment

447
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,583
somewhere there is a printer.

448
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:49,653
So Amazon Robotics took
on four tenants in our

449
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:51,150
zero trust journey.

450
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,466
We're gonna eliminate
the corporate network,

451
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:58,898
remove all dependencies on
active directory, no VPN.

452
00:18:58,898 --> 00:19:03,212
Everything's gonna get moved
to the native AWS cloud.

453
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:05,940
Whether that's on-prem bare metal servers,

454
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,770
on-prem virtualized servers,

455
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,014
or existing EC2 resources
that are in the cloud,

456
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:13,563
but peered back to the corporate network.

457
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,950
We're gonna increase our security posture,

458
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,470
lease privilege access,

459
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,986
we're gonna automate user
provisioning and base lining

460
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:25,290
and we're gonna secure those applications

461
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,453
that use natively insecure protocols.

462
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,620
And finally, we're gonna
segment at every level.

463
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,020
So not only are we
segmenting our applications

464
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,820
like Dhawal was just speaking about,

465
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,761
but we're also segmenting
our infrastructure.

466
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,650
What does that mean?

467
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,058
Every single application
is its own AWS account.

468
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,868
There's no east west travel.

469
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:49,111
And we've implemented
least privilege from an

470
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:51,031
administration standpoint.

471
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:54,299
Someone who has access to the
console for one application,

472
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:58,080
doesn't have access to the
console for another application.

473
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,853
We reduce the blast radius.

474
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,630
So what is this shifting architecture

475
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,673
called within internally?

476
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,040
SAL, secure application link.

477
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,750
Anyone that works with me will tell ya

478
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,640
I'm a pretty plain English guy.

479
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,460
I like very simple naming conventions.

480
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,143
It started off as securely
link users to applications.

481
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,350
But SLUA doesn't quite roll off the tongue

482
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,563
as nicely as SAL does.

483
00:20:27,563 --> 00:20:29,203
So in the SAL world,

484
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:30,870
we leverage zero,

485
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,900
the zero trust exchange as a switchboard.

486
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,798
Users connect to
applications, not networks.

487
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:41,860
And we do policy enforcement
in the zero trust exchange

488
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,943
for every single transaction.

489
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,680
ZPA, Zscaler Private Access,

490
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,762
enables us to provide segmented,

491
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:54,008
encrypted,

492
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:55,440
time bound,

493
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,310
lease privilege,

494
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,600
posture verified,

495
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,450
MFA compliant connections from users

496
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,220
to their applications.

497
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,260
Now if you're playing Info Sec bingo,

498
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,823
hopefully you just won.

499
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,740
So when we get into some of the specifics,

500
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,100
Amazon Robotics is a ZPA first customer.

501
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,810
It's something I'm proud to share,

502
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,020
because it's not your typical
Zscaler deployment model.

503
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,000
A lot of customers start with ZIA

504
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,021
or we'll do ZI, ZPA combine.

505
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:25,620
But as I mentioned,
Amazon Robotics provides

506
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,075
differentiated services.

507
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:29,010
ZIA wasn't in our portfolio.

508
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,350
It's not, it's not a
service that we needed

509
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,886
to offer our customers,

510
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:36,150
and the Zscaler team was
able to give us an avenue

511
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,366
to license what we needed
to to service our customers.

512
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:41,565
We integrate natively to our IDP.

513
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:44,962
We packaged our Zscaler
client connector client

514
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:46,770
to make it a one click install

515
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,930
with pre-configured
environmental variables.

516
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,680
These are all things that
Zscaler offers outta the box.

517
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,130
When you start to look
at the stencil diagrams,

518
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,096
we deploy app connectors in the AWS cloud.

519
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:01,910
They come very nicely packaged in AMIs

520
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,170
available on the AWS marketplace,

521
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,180
which means that Zscaler
takes on the burden

522
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,730
of much of the updates in the maintenance.

523
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,460
They're deployed in a
highly available fashion in

524
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,641
auto scaling groups across
multiple availability zones,

525
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:18,709
and application dependent multi-region.

526
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:23,709
Users can no longer directly
access their applications.

527
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:28,800
Applications require zero
inbound connectivity.

528
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,983
All connections are
inside out from the VPC.

529
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,080
ZPA enabled us at Amazon Robotics

530
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,128
to deliver a scalable solution,

531
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:42,813
which we call SAL across to all of Amazon.

532
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,230
Our day one culture encouraged us

533
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:51,120
to build highly effective
solutions for our engineers

534
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,050
and build long-term value for Amazon.

535
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:59,940
So today I'm proud to share
that we offer SAL as a service.

536
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,470
And depending on

537
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,890
how much time I can
negotiate from the SDEs

538
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,760
at our weekly standup,

539
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,560
it's either a white glove deployment,

540
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,750
or where we'll take on your
application and run it for you,

541
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,430
at Amazon Robotics.

542
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,530
We have a managed self-service model

543
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,270
where you can run your own app connectors

544
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,400
and we'll manage the exchange.

545
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,580
And then using Zscaler's
micro tenant capability,

546
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,850
we offer a fully delegated
administrative option

547
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,870
where partner teams

548
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,450
that are high on the maternity
curve can manage their own

549
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,343
solution within the architecture.

550
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,740
So, but wait, there's more.

551
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,323
I have a cool little device here.

552
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,413
This is the zero trust branch.

553
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,470
It's called a ZT 400,

554
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,910
Dhawal gonna talk a little bit about

555
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,030
zero trust branch further
in his presentation.

556
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,150
But we were able to take
all of the same primitives

557
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,670
that I just shared with
you about least privilege

558
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,866
application access,

559
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,600
and apply it to our physical world

560
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,313
using the zero trust branch.

561
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,600
We have on premise prototype labs

562
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,170
and manufacturing facilities
that leverage 3D printers,

563
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:11,010
CNC machines, additive,
subtractive, you name it, we got it.

564
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,783
Lots of cool stuff.

565
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:15,930
But almost all these devices
nowadays wanna be connected

566
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,270
to the internet and each
provider has their own SaaS

567
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,000
solution and you need to
worry about data management

568
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,180
and who has access to
your prototype files.

569
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,420
So by deploying zero trust
branch, we can operate all

570
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,164
of these devices in a
local network only zone,

571
00:24:29,164 --> 00:24:32,040
but still gain all the benefits

572
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,800
of having them online available
through the switchboard,

573
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,483
that is the zero trust exchange.

574
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,390
This is another example of

575
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,728
how Zscaler helps us
obsess over our customers

576
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:45,701
and remove friction from their workflows.

577
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:47,880
I'm really proud to say that generally

578
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,593
when you add security, you add friction.

579
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:53,130
And I believe we've done the opposite.

580
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,043
We've increased security and
we've decreased friction.

581
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,490
So I've made a couple
claims today about how great

582
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,880
what we've done is and what
our customers think about us.

583
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,640
So I wanted to actually share
some voice of the customer

584
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,280
straight from our customers.

585
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,680
We solicit feedback from
our customers consistently

586
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,513
and more specifically quarterly.

587
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:17,262
One of my favorite bits of
feedback up on the top left here,

588
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:18,930
is that it works,

589
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,186
right away, 90% of the time.

590
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,580
Well, I'm not Pete DeSantis,

591
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,320
I don't run utility computing.

592
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,381
90%, probably is okay.

593
00:25:27,381 --> 00:25:29,587
But I reached out to this user and I said,

594
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:32,010
"Hey, why, where's the 1%?,

595
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,476
What can we do better?".

596
00:25:33,476 --> 00:25:34,309
He said,

597
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:37,050
"Well Matthew, if I don't
sign into Slack first

598
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,816
or access one of our
other corporate resources,

599
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,641
I need to do my MFA token every morning.".

600
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:42,486
(Matthew scoffs)

601
00:25:42,486 --> 00:25:43,319
I said,

602
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:46,065
"Well that's not really a SAL problem.

603
00:25:46,065 --> 00:25:48,780
We have some security
postures that require you

604
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,128
to authenticate every 18 hours

605
00:25:51,128 --> 00:25:53,310
and if SAL's the first
time that you authenticate,

606
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,940
I'm sorry, you need to do your your MFA.".

607
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,220
But the feedback is positive!

608
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,241
Users perceive SAL, which
is Zscaler private access

609
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:04,096
is more performance than VPN.

610
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,880
And what they don't realize,

611
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,244
is it's because we provide
access to applications,

612
00:26:08,244 --> 00:26:09,873
not networks.

613
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,526
When we get to the actual
numbers behind all of this,

614
00:26:15,526 --> 00:26:20,526
since March we've migrated
49 internal applications

615
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:23,130
to the native AWS cloud,

616
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,083
using Zscaler private access.

617
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,180
Zscaler is available to 5,000
Amazon associates across the

618
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,040
Amazon robotics business unit,

619
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,953
and has over 700 daily users.

620
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,754
We've implemented least
privileged access to 100%

621
00:26:38,754 --> 00:26:42,371
of those 49 applications.

622
00:26:42,371 --> 00:26:44,250
And finally we were able to move all

623
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,833
of our COTS applications to the cloud.

624
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,753
We did all that while
deferring 75,000 VPN sessions.

625
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,810
So with that, I'll hand it back to Dhawal.

626
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,600
I know he has some interesting
things to say about some

627
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,079
of the AI works Zscaler been doing.

628
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:00,912
- Thank you Matthew.

629
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:01,745
This was great insight.

630
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,745
(audience clapping)

631
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,670
And I equally hate all the acronyms

632
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,440
that analysts throw at us.

633
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,130
Not a big fan of them, but
let's talk about zero trust

634
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,510
for cloud workloads.

635
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,700
We talked about zero trust for users,

636
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,810
cloud workloads, right?

637
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,160
This is a very interesting area.

638
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,910
We started dabbling in this
area about five, six years ago.

639
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,410
Our goal, which we have been able

640
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,040
to achieve now is securing
all workloads in all clouds.

641
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,720
Whether AWS or Azure

642
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,270
or GCP, you know, there is comp,

643
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,420
they're similar constructs,
but they're not exactly same.

644
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,092
So you have regions, availability zones,

645
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:42,390
you have different form of
connectivity from VPC peering

646
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,910
to direct connect that
you need to look at.

647
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,750
Then you have more persistent
workloads with EC twos

648
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,000
and then you have, you
know, your lambda functions,

649
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,670
which are non infrastructure workloads.

650
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,350
You need to secure all of that, right?

651
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,110
So broad positioning, as I said,

652
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,169
like three things we do here.

653
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:02,430
I have thousands of
customers doing what's the,

654
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,830
in the first bucket,
which is securing workload

655
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,270
to internet access.

656
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,630
This is where typically you
would deploy a north south

657
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,311
firewall or a virtual firewall,

658
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:14,130
but as I said, firewalls
are looking at sessions.

659
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,270
They're not decrypting traffic,

660
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,430
they're not actually doing
any real security other

661
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,840
than maintaining sessions.

662
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,370
And as you deploy more virtual firewalls,

663
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,690
it get more and more complex.

664
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,226
So I have very large
customers like United Airlines

665
00:28:24,226 --> 00:28:26,590
who are doing petabyte scale egress,

666
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,909
without deploying any firewalls today.

667
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:33,332
Second use case is workload
to workload segmentation.

668
00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:36,690
This gets interesting
because at a broader level,

669
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,920
workloads are like users.

670
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,660
They either are going to internet,

671
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,100
they're talking to each other,

672
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,510
but unlike users,

673
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,890
they don't have persistent identity.

674
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,720
So identity becomes challenging.

675
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,040
So we have been doing a lot of work

676
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,230
that I'll talk about in the use cases,

677
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,140
but the use case I, I typically see a lot

678
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,390
of customers jump into
micro segmentation trying

679
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,664
to segment at a workflow
or network flow level.

680
00:28:56,664 --> 00:28:58,104
That becomes too complicated.

681
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:00,930
What some of our customers
who have gone on this journey

682
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,820
with us, what they did is
they basically zoomed out

683
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,075
and said we need to define
macro segmentation boundaries,

684
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:07,609
which is to say I have a VPC

685
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:10,002
that should is a pre-prod staging VPC

686
00:29:10,002 --> 00:29:12,300
that should not be exposed anywhere

687
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,620
but to my production VPC,

688
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,780
it goes dark on internet for everything.

689
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:19,212
Or I have a specific
subnet in my data center

690
00:29:19,212 --> 00:29:22,020
that is speaking to a
workload in the cloud

691
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,450
that subnet should not be
advertised anywhere else.

692
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,970
So those kind of macro
segmentation use cases.

693
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,620
And then you layer in micro segmentation,

694
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,480
epec-segmentation on top of it.

695
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,060
So our goal is to be able to do that

696
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,530
with a consistent policy framework,

697
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,910
as I mentioned earlier.

698
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,440
Let's look at how this looks like

699
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,288
from a multi-cloud security perspective.

700
00:29:39,288 --> 00:29:44,152
First use case is, you know,
customers are shifting, lifting

701
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:46,470
and shifting applications to the cloud,

702
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,540
or they're migrating
applications to the cloud.

703
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,180
The use case here is a hybrid cloud

704
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,874
where you have a physical side
data center from the where

705
00:29:53,874 --> 00:29:57,698
you are connecting to your applications.

706
00:29:57,698 --> 00:30:01,887
We are able to basically
give you a very specific

707
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:06,180
policy to say a specific IP
subnet in your data center goes

708
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,076
to this VPC,

709
00:30:07,076 --> 00:30:09,325
build the policy and build the access.

710
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:12,960
Then comes the second use
case, which is multi-cloud.

711
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,930
Some customers have multi-cloud
first versus their different

712
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,580
variance variations of it we see.

713
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,600
And the thing here is now we have been

714
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,450
integrated with AWS tags and
Macie tags for a long time.

715
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,540
Basically we con, we connect
via API to your tenant.

716
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,889
We consume those tags

717
00:30:28,889 --> 00:30:30,810
and they become criteria in the policy.

718
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,520
You can say anything which is tagged.

719
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,504
SAP cannot talk to certain
applications for example.

720
00:30:35,504 --> 00:30:39,430
So those tags in a way become
identity for your workloads.

721
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,209
We also read your VPC names.

722
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:44,520
They become, they become
locations in our console.

723
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,866
You can build policies around it.

724
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:49,820
There is also a lot of
in large scale customers,

725
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,200
we have seen complexity
around cross region,

726
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,650
multi-region deployments.

727
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,710
Multi-cloud is a reality.

728
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,200
We see customers, their
primary cloud is AWS,

729
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,490
but they acquire a small company

730
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,710
where they are running like a

731
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,820
Big Query in Google now,

732
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,350
they need to connect application to it.

733
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,830
So those scenarios come up
every single day in our world.

734
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,940
And then intra region, this
becomes really interesting.

735
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,460
Many of you who are from
a regulated industry like

736
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,614
healthcare or finance,
you need to have policies,

737
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:21,776
let's say PCI specific policies
at the workload level within

738
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:25,170
the workload that are
running inside your VPC.

739
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:29,460
So if even we have seen network flow base,

740
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,694
what is inbound versus outbound

741
00:31:30,694 --> 00:31:32,980
so we can support those use cases as well.

742
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,300
So from a broader perspective,

743
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,650
we can give you a segmentation framework.

744
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,780
Full decryption, we don't even do,

745
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,220
you don't need to worry about just

746
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,450
doing domain based filtering,

747
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,000
which is what most
customers do with firewalls.

748
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
We can give you full SSL
decryption data security DLP on

749
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,810
your workloads, full sandbox
in advanced threat protection

750
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,000
for your workloads egressing through us.

751
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,579
And if traffic is going to stay
within the boundary of AWS,

752
00:31:57,579 --> 00:31:59,790
we will not take your traffic outside AWS,

753
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,653
we actually extend our footprint in AWS.

754
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:05,200
Your policy enforcement
happens inside AWS as well.

755
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,460
When you think about now
specific rules such that you need

756
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,500
to build at a workload level.

757
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,810
So we introduced the micro
segmentation service,

758
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,650
but it is layered on top of
the ECL private access service

759
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,260
or the ZTNA service that
Matthew was talking about

760
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,950
because you guys are already
doing app segmentation with us.

761
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,140
Micro segmentation layers on top it

762
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,490
as a specialized use case,

763
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,800
you don't need to rebuild
that from scratch.

764
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,020
So you get full visibility
of network flows,

765
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,060
what is going in and
out of your workflows.

766
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,210
We can, we can support
containers and EVPF for example.

767
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,305
We can support network flows
and build policies on it.

768
00:32:38,305 --> 00:32:41,100
We can give you process level visibility

769
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,840
and then layer in the
intelligent segmentation

770
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,760
that I talked about, not
just for user to app,

771
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,470
we are extending it for app to app,

772
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,203
or workload, workload to workload as well.

773
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,873
On top of it,

774
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:53,340
one of the friction point,
the point of insertion

775
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,791
for Zscaler is,

776
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:57,960
we have a service called cloud connector,

777
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,193
which is a VM built as
with full, you know,

778
00:33:01,193 --> 00:33:03,240
Terraform cloud formation support,

779
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,875
auto scaling support could be deployed,

780
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,356
with full automation,

781
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:10,016
but you have to manage
a VM for that right?

782
00:33:10,016 --> 00:33:11,880
To egress traffic to us.

783
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,740
A lot of customer deploy
them in landing zones,

784
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,760
they deploy them in their security VPCs

785
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,770
with a gateway load balancer.

786
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,297
So there's a lot of reference
architectures we support

787
00:33:21,297 --> 00:33:24,623
for that and it can scale
for terabyte scale traffic.

788
00:33:24,623 --> 00:33:26,970
But some customers came to us saying,

789
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,950
while we need that, for some of our,

790
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,682
to remove the friction
for our developers to

791
00:33:31,682 --> 00:33:35,430
make this as part of their
shift left practices,

792
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,470
what if we don't need to deploy any VM?

793
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,780
So this is where we
introduce the cloud gateway.

794
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,360
It's, it is generally available in AWS,

795
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,259
we just launched it in GCP as well.

796
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:48,573
So here you don't need to
deploy the cloud connectors

797
00:33:48,573 --> 00:33:51,090
or any virtual infrastructure
using your managed

798
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:51,954
endpoints in AWS.

799
00:33:51,954 --> 00:33:54,023
You can point traffic to us.

800
00:33:54,023 --> 00:33:55,740
Think of Zscaler running a VPC,

801
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,710
like how we run a Zscaler
cloud in our data centers,

802
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,543
and in AWS.

803
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,904
We actually have a full
VPC in which we will set

804
00:34:02,904 --> 00:34:04,500
up these cloud connectors

805
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,030
with the auto scale function for you.

806
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,710
You don't need to deploy anything.

807
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:11,784
And the one big thing it does
is it basically removes your

808
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:13,519
friction from deployment.

809
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,244
I have customers who actually
are telling their developers,

810
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:21,000
you can set up your VPCs
without any firewalls

811
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,504
and no upfront audit,

812
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:24,420
just follow this reference

813
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,400
architecture and they get audited later.

814
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,680
But this deployment
takes 10 to 15 minutes.

815
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,930
I have customers like
Siemens who have deployed,

816
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:34,200
who our developers can deploy
their workloads without going

817
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,060
through weeks of approval cycles

818
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,340
with this reference architecture now.

819
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,104
So, when you, we talked about cloud

820
00:34:41,104 --> 00:34:44,431
and Matthew touched upon
the branch appliance.

821
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:46,470
He showed you the smallest box

822
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,000
that we introduced two three years ago.

823
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,795
ZT 400 that supports up to 200,

824
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:52,085
300 megs built for smaller sites.

825
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:55,676
We have been supporting
multiple hardware sizes.

826
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,510
There are one new rack appliances

827
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,920
that support one gig egress.

828
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,010
In fact, we just in September
introduced our campus

829
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,233
appliance, which is five gig egress

830
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:05,795
and 40 gig within the
branch for east-west.

831
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:10,170
The concept of zero trust branch
is not to build an SD-WAN.

832
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,820
You know, about six years ago,

833
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,610
seven years ago when every
security company was building

834
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,310
or buying an SD-WAN, a
lot of customers came

835
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,409
to us saying why is
Zscaler is not doing it.

836
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,660
I fundamentally think that the concept

837
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,610
of SD-WAN was required at that time

838
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,212
because it gave a smarter
router with more automation.

839
00:35:26,212 --> 00:35:29,070
We opened our connectivity APIs to connect

840
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,570
with every single SD-WAN vendor.

841
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,740
We support automation

842
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,270
with about two dozen SD-WAN vendors today.

843
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,880
I think now only six or
seven of them are left,

844
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,670
but we basically have
automation with them.

845
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,030
But SD-WAN has a big fundamental flaw

846
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,259
that it basically creates

847
00:35:43,259 --> 00:35:45,943
very permissive network connectivity

848
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,570
and it creates side to side connectivity.

849
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,923
It creates more mesh
networks which actually

850
00:35:50,923 --> 00:35:53,250
increases the attack vector.

851
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,800
So one of the thing that we
wanted to do was we took time

852
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,330
to build the right architecture of

853
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,370
what we are calling a zero trust branch.

854
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,840
Many of you probably follow Gartner.

855
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,180
So Gartner has started talking
about zero trust branch

856
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,710
architecture as a few months ago.

857
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,650
We've been talking to them
about this concept for a while.

858
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,390
But this cafe like branch

859
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,430
or Starbucks like branch model is simply

860
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,130
that you have a hardware
appliance that you can plug

861
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:14,963
and play,

862
00:36:14,963 --> 00:36:16,163
bring two ISP circuits,

863
00:36:16,163 --> 00:36:20,010
and it subsumes the functionality
of your SD-WAN north,

864
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,930
south, and east west firewall.

865
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,790
Your NAC layer three switch.

866
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,190
What do you need in your
branch? In this case you need

867
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,830
a gateway appliance that we provide.

868
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,630
You need wifi access point,
you need L two switches

869
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,410
to connect more things to the port.

870
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,820
You don't need anything else.

871
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,987
Now, you need routing.

872
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,995
We support full routing protocols on this,

873
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:42,750
but you don't need to do over permissive

874
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,490
routing or firewall rules.

875
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,402
For example, in this
case the inbound like,

876
00:36:47,402 --> 00:36:50,040
Matthew again talked of printing.

877
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,260
Printing is a something that
I see a lot of manufacturers,

878
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,800
there's remote printing use
case SAP printing for example.

879
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,110
Typically you will poke
holes in your firewalls

880
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,700
to allow inbound access.

881
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,460
The same firewall ports
rules are exploited

882
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,046
during ransomware attacks
and your network gets locked.

883
00:37:05,046 --> 00:37:08,445
We basically build the ZPA
logic, the app connector,

884
00:37:08,445 --> 00:37:10,555
the gateway that we have with ZPA,

885
00:37:10,555 --> 00:37:13,320
containerized on this hardware appliance.

886
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,780
Which means the inbound access is driven

887
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,168
with a identity based policy,
not with a routing protocol.

888
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:21,600
We support O-S-P-F-B-G-P everything.

889
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,580
But most of the complexity

890
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,350
that we created ourself over the years,

891
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,595
and again I have done a lot of networking,

892
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:29,273
a lot of that is not required.

893
00:37:29,273 --> 00:37:31,950
We can simplify that and
that's something that a lot

894
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,020
of customers, when you bring security

895
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,370
and networking teams to sit together,

896
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,870
they appreciate the value.

897
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,320
It also simplifies your M and A.

898
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,550
A lot of customers of us
grow with acquisitions.

899
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,134
You want to connect to networks.

900
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:44,940
That is a wrong thing to do

901
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,940
because you're gonna bring the
security posture of a company

902
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,950
with a poor security
posture to your network

903
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,102
and that can cause issues.

904
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,681
So one of the big value
proposition is not connecting

905
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:56,542
network, not worrying
about overlapping IPs,

906
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:59,820
and connecting application to
application or user to users.

907
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,040
And if you're in manufacturing,
one of the big use case,

908
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,640
we acquired a company called
Air Gap Networks last year,

909
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,584
which was very focused on OT security.

910
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:11,540
So we subsumed that as that
in the zero trust branch.

911
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,660
So it basically becomes a DCP
gateway gives the slash 32 IP

912
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,750
to every device on the network
and air gaps every device.

913
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,670
So it create micro fences every network.

914
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,280
So it is micro segmentation
without any agent.

915
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,740
So your cameras, your shop floor devices,

916
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,954
your IOTs are also fully secured.

917
00:38:29,954 --> 00:38:33,090
Like in Zscaler corporate
network, we are not huge,

918
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,109
but our corporate network in San Jose,

919
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:36,388
has close to a thousand employees.

920
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:38,636
We have multiple engineering labs.

921
00:38:38,636 --> 00:38:40,650
We don't have a corporate network anymore.

922
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,260
I connect to a guest network
when I go to our office.

923
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,840
When I connect to the
engineering labs on the set

924
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,234
on a different floor,

925
00:38:47,234 --> 00:38:49,230
I'm going through the policy engine,

926
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,270
and these appliances are protecting us.

927
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:54,060
We don't have SD-WAN or
firewalls anymore either.

928
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,893
So we have good reference

929
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:56,520
architecture we can share with you.

930
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,020
But the intent is this
progression going from users

931
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,198
to branch, to cloud.

932
00:39:01,198 --> 00:39:03,734
You are able to secure it everywhere.

933
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:05,434
And also the goal is that,

934
00:39:05,434 --> 00:39:09,390
a lot of of of platform
generates a lot of telemetry.

935
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,090
So one thing we have been
doing from day one is,

936
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,970
all our telemetry could
be fully integrated

937
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,340
with any SIMs you're using,
any security operation,

938
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,208
data lakes you're using, we
should support SSF framework.

939
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:25,005
We actually integrate with
the AWS data lakes as well.

940
00:39:25,005 --> 00:39:26,970
So our customers are able

941
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,040
to get very verbose logs
which are kind of goldmine

942
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,049
for security operations team

943
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:35,509
and they can actually build lot of

944
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:38,580
rich data pipelines from it.

945
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,570
And also our products are very, a lot

946
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,352
of you think about Zscaler
as a cloud security company,

947
00:39:45,352 --> 00:39:47,130
but we have deployments

948
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,780
that are a hundred percent on premise.

949
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:53,051
We have deployment in like,
like classified networks,

950
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:56,280
which are air gapped and not
even connected to networks.

951
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,480
So we can support pure SaaS
based cloud-based model,

952
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,808
hybrid model on-premise model.

953
00:40:01,808 --> 00:40:03,390
There's a lot of flexibility on that.

954
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:07,950
But core intent is to get
better security and simplify

955
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,453
and also reduce your costs.

956
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,210
The last thing that I want
to cover in my session

957
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,440
is about AI.

958
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,890
This is top of mind for
everyone I'm talking to

959
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:20,880
and even my partnership partners.

960
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,480
When I look at it with AWS in
the last few weeks I've been

961
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,110
spending a lot of team that are

962
00:40:26,995 --> 00:40:27,828
building the AI infrastructure.

963
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:28,661
We are getting deeply embedded

964
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:30,630
and having those conversations with them.

965
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:34,350
But as I said, like it, everything
started three years ago.

966
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:37,830
I remember we were at the
RSA conference in April,

967
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,899
Chat GPT came out with
GPT three, 2.5 model

968
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:44,713
and everything changed after that.

969
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:46,500
Now there are thousands

970
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,346
of gen AI applications in enterprise.

971
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,570
One thing that everyone
is trying to figure out is

972
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,920
what gen app people are using.

973
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,944
So this is where in last

974
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:57,853
two years we have classified about

975
00:40:57,853 --> 00:40:59,550
2,000 different applications.

976
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,870
We have prompt extraction

977
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,595
and classification for
dozens of application

978
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:07,800
and you can do your
traditional DLP on them.

979
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,140
You can get full visibility into

980
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,815
what is going on in this prompt.

981
00:41:11,815 --> 00:41:15,385
But where a lot of
interesting work is happening,

982
00:41:15,385 --> 00:41:19,260
as I mentioned, is around agents.

983
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,992
So AI started with predictive AI.

984
00:41:21,992 --> 00:41:24,750
We are in the generative AI cycle.

985
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,430
Everyone is talking agent,

986
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,080
but agent is more marketing so far,

987
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,913
it's,

988
00:41:28,913 --> 00:41:29,746
I haven't seen a customer

989
00:41:29,746 --> 00:41:31,530
who has deployed a lot of agents at scale.

990
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,160
Some of financial services I
talk to, they are experimenting

991
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,152
with embedded agents in their chat bots to

992
00:41:37,152 --> 00:41:41,190
basically converse with consumers.

993
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,030
But they're not settling

994
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,800
insurance claims through that agent.

995
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,240
I think that world is gonna go there

996
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,073
in the next 12 to 18 months.

997
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:48,540
But are we ready to secure that?

998
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,600
On top of it, agent themselves
have multiple types.

999
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,232
In my view in next, few,

1000
00:41:55,232 --> 00:41:56,850
quarters at least,

1001
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:00,000
most of the agent traffic
will come from agents embedded

1002
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,751
inside SaaS application.

1003
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:04,397
Your Salesforce will
have a Dreamforce agent

1004
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:07,018
that will be agent,
and when I say agentic,

1005
00:42:07,018 --> 00:42:08,773
it's not just web traffic,

1006
00:42:08,773 --> 00:42:11,130
it could be web socket,

1007
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,500
proto buff protocols.

1008
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,450
It could be a two A protocols

1009
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,440
and I recently,

1010
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,910
I follow a lot of ITF forums.

1011
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,710
I saw eight two A protocols,

1012
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,120
which were with Linux Foundation

1013
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,430
have actually gone to ITF forums now,

1014
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,870
which means they will get standardized

1015
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,580
and will get used more and more.

1016
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,380
There is a lot of focus on agent identity.

1017
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,213
A lot of startups,

1018
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,230
Microsoft introduced their Entra ID.

1019
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:34,410
I've been working with the AWS IM team,

1020
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:37,040
which is also building more
IM capabilities in this area.

1021
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,707
So we integrate and consume
identity from everywhere.

1022
00:42:39,707 --> 00:42:43,710
But the interactive agents is
something we are seeing more.

1023
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:46,791
Chat bots for employees
for, you know, consumers.

1024
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:49,551
Autonomous agents is
very, very early stage

1025
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:51,780
and they are digital
colleagues, digital twins,

1026
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,870
which are going to have same
permission model, r-back model

1027
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:55,770
that you have as user,

1028
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:57,504
but they're your digital twin.

1029
00:42:57,504 --> 00:43:00,870
When we think about securing
AI, we have two parts to it.

1030
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,270
One, something we have been
doing for two plus years.

1031
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:06,480
Again, thousands of customers
securing public gen AI

1032
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,123
applications and being able to secure

1033
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:12,333
that traffic extract prompts

1034
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:13,830
and then being able

1035
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:17,040
to run AI guardrails on
that traffic as well.

1036
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,140
AI guardrails are more sophisticated,

1037
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,945
small and large language
model based detectors,

1038
00:43:21,945 --> 00:43:26,760
that find things that typically
your DLP engines cannot.

1039
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,970
And specific tools also build like a lot

1040
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,740
of customers are using Microsoft copilot.

1041
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,530
So we can actually have
copilot readiness to tell you

1042
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,780
what data it is touching
in your environment.

1043
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,010
But what we are doing on the right side

1044
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,911
is very exciting area.

1045
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:42,600
Which is to secure AI infrastructure

1046
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,970
and AI application that you're building.

1047
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:47,523
So here we are,

1048
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,320
we introduced what we call

1049
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,805
as AI guard, which is runtime
guardrails for AI systems,

1050
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:57,000
which basically sit is
a LLM proxy that sits

1051
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,443
between your LLMs,

1052
00:43:58,443 --> 00:44:02,040
and your application that
are conversing with LLMs,

1053
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,410
or users who are conversing with LLMs.

1054
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,170
These are, again, small
language based detectors.

1055
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,670
We have built this on AWS here.

1056
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,190
You can basically say if you use Bedrock

1057
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,610
or Agent Core, you can
actually invoke them on day one

1058
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,781
and your application to LLM request

1059
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,814
and the response for your
LLM all is inspected here.

1060
00:44:21,814 --> 00:44:24,840
We have out of the box
support for Bedrock,

1061
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,819
Anthropic, Open AI,

1062
00:44:25,819 --> 00:44:29,819
and you can also do it with
any other system as well.

1063
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:34,299
But when I look at broad AI
security equation, right?

1064
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:36,699
There are four big pieces,
we are looking at it.

1065
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,533
We have, we introduced AI guard in June.

1066
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,481
About dozens of customers are in deploited

1067
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:46,040
in early access VR.

1068
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,893
We are doing gio-card in January, 2026.

1069
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,880
But it is something that a lot
of customers have interest.

1070
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,330
But we also realize AI
is such a new area that

1071
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,710
that traditional direct teaming

1072
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,270
tools don't work in this world.

1073
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,620
There was a huge gap in this market.

1074
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,036
So, this is where we acquired a company.

1075
00:45:04,036 --> 00:45:06,360
Two weeks ago we announced,
we acquired SPLX,

1076
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,993
which is AI soft bill of material,

1077
00:45:08,993 --> 00:45:12,810
AI asset management and
direct teaming company.

1078
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,310
And there's a lot

1079
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:16,470
of governance framework
we are able to build.

1080
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,920
So we already provide this
level of visibility for a couple

1081
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,866
of years where you have the
full visibility of shadow AI,

1082
00:45:22,866 --> 00:45:26,820
you have visibility of
what AI usage by department

1083
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,270
and you can build policies,
can do prompt extraction.

1084
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,870
Now with the acquisition of SPLX,

1085
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,858
we can actually give you
full visibility into your AI

1086
00:45:36,858 --> 00:45:38,760
infrastructure and apps.

1087
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,710
So we can see what models
are being deployed in your

1088
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:43,050
environment, what MCP servers are used.

1089
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,840
We can give you full
visibility of your agents

1090
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,120
and your models, talking
to your git repositories

1091
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,090
and what is going on in that workflow

1092
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,100
and full visibility of what
guardrails are deployed.

1093
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,740
In fact, one of the thing
that we just rolled out,

1094
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:00,420
we have ability to read
guardrails on Bedrock

1095
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,670
and we can say if you have enabled them,

1096
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,403
and find vulnerabilities

1097
00:46:04,403 --> 00:46:07,361
through rec teaming and fix them as well.

1098
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:11,130
Also getting the full
visibility of the infrastructure

1099
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,540
and tying that into data.

1100
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,730
Like say with our data protection we

1101
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,080
actually classify your data.

1102
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,240
We actually see where that data is sitting

1103
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,300
and then tying that AI
footprint to your data as well.

1104
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,414
So looking at infrastructure,
looking at data

1105
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:27,136
and tying it together as
well, which is very unique.

1106
00:46:27,136 --> 00:46:31,518
What SPLX brought specifically
to the table is being able

1107
00:46:31,518 --> 00:46:35,788
to scan your entire AI
infrastructure, your AI projects.

1108
00:46:35,788 --> 00:46:38,135
You can run scanners either

1109
00:46:38,135 --> 00:46:42,434
through a SaaS service we run
from AWS, you can deploy it is

1110
00:46:42,434 --> 00:46:44,344
as a multi-tenant, single tenant service.

1111
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:47,190
You can also deploy it in
your data center in a private

1112
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,840
deployment if you need that.

1113
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,180
But there are a lot of adversarial attacks

1114
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,130
that have been pre-populated.

1115
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,150
You can simulate them.

1116
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,820
Typically when you are
building AI projects

1117
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,080
you run these scans,

1118
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:58,913
you fix things

1119
00:46:58,913 --> 00:47:01,590
and you run a scan again before
you push it to production.

1120
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,029
But AI world is very dynamic.

1121
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:06,240
If a new GPT model
comes, you basically want

1122
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,800
to redo these scans.

1123
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,480
So that's something we
support out of the box.

1124
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,150
We have support for, for
example, Gemini four,

1125
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,920
when it came within two days, right?

1126
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,112
So you want to be ahead of that.

1127
00:47:16,112 --> 00:47:18,370
I talked about guardrails earlier.

1128
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,790
There are multiple guardrails we support.

1129
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,242
Every bullet item here
is basically a small

1130
00:47:23,242 --> 00:47:25,149
or a large language model

1131
00:47:25,149 --> 00:47:27,742
that is understanding your agentic traffic

1132
00:47:27,742 --> 00:47:31,712
or your LLM traffic and
learning the output.

1133
00:47:31,712 --> 00:47:33,674
If you're a car manufacturing company,

1134
00:47:33,674 --> 00:47:37,451
it basically says that
the consumer who's talking

1135
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:40,590
to your LLM is not talking
about another car competitor

1136
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,420
and trying to get a quote from you.

1137
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,160
If your insurance company, it'll do that.

1138
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,950
So there's a lot of that
readiness built into it.

1139
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,434
But also learning is in involved here.

1140
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:51,540
And governance is important,

1141
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,240
one thing that we have been
doing is there are new AI

1142
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,250
frameworks coming, EU AI, a lot

1143
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,900
of European customers
have been asking for it.

1144
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,552
So we have reporting on it.

1145
00:47:59,552 --> 00:48:03,574
NIST, AI risk management
framework and OS AI top 10.

1146
00:48:03,574 --> 00:48:08,190
We have a lot of analytics
that maps the vulnerabilities

1147
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,563
and risks that we find to these as well.

1148
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:12,993
So as I mentioned,

1149
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,750
our goal is that what we have been doing

1150
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,240
for many, many years in zero trust world,

1151
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,980
marrying that into the AI..

1152
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,250
We are one of the richest
source of security logs.

1153
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,320
We have introduced certain capabilities

1154
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,580
around asset management

1155
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:29,849
and you know, agent security operations

1156
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:31,230
that I won't spend too much time.

1157
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:34,110
But that's an area that we
are evolving ourself into.

1158
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:37,500
We have one of the, a very
exciting product deployed

1159
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,630
with about 5,000 plus customers,

1160
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,330
which we call a ZDX or
Zscaler digital experience,

1161
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,680
which is built from day one

1162
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,714
with AI to fix issues
that end users are facing.

1163
00:48:46,714 --> 00:48:49,590
We can find root cause
or bad user experience,

1164
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:53,220
remove that time spent
on solving user tickets

1165
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,570
through a deeper integration

1166
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:57,060
of tools like Service Now workflow tools

1167
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,980
and being able to automate remediation.

1168
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,020
So network operations,

1169
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,386
IT operations service desk
uses it very, very heavily.

1170
00:49:03,386 --> 00:49:07,170
But at the bottom is what
you see is AI data fabric.

1171
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:09,300
So we have a,

1172
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,610
we acquired a company called
Avalara two years ago,

1173
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:14,850
which basically is a general
purpose security data fabric

1174
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:18,420
that connects to 150 different
kinds of security products,

1175
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,150
networking products
and subsumes their logs

1176
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,180
and can correlate contextualize
those logs to say out of

1177
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:27,075
50 different or 10 different sources,

1178
00:49:27,075 --> 00:49:30,314
I'm seeing indication of log four J coming

1179
00:49:30,314 --> 00:49:31,980
from 10 different products,

1180
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,410
and this is what I can tell
you is the problem here.

1181
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:35,730
And then you can map it to assets

1182
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:38,160
and try to fix those problems.

1183
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,390
One last very important topic

1184
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,313
before I wrap up my presentation is,

1185
00:49:43,088 --> 00:49:44,310
people ask us,

1186
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:46,543
and this is a question everyone ask,

1187
00:49:46,543 --> 00:49:48,727
all of their vendors these days,

1188
00:49:48,727 --> 00:49:51,325
"Is Zscaler using my data
to train the AI models?",

1189
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:52,860
The answer is "no".

1190
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,330
There is a a QR code.

1191
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,700
We actually have a detailed document

1192
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,644
and a blog on this that you can read.

1193
00:49:58,644 --> 00:50:00,900
We do not use customer data for it.

1194
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,340
We have a lot of training data.

1195
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,770
If we are gonna use your
data to train in context

1196
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:05,790
of your training,

1197
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,250
we basically strip out all PII from it.

1198
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,698
So your data is safe.

1199
00:50:09,698 --> 00:50:11,373
We are not a end,

1200
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,469
point application like
Salesforce or Office 365.

1201
00:50:15,469 --> 00:50:18,000
We don't use to user data on it,

1202
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,470
but we do have metadata,

1203
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,420
like when we store a transaction log,

1204
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,830
we know which user it is for,

1205
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,690
what location they're coming from,

1206
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,640
but we can strip out all that information

1207
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,270
and we use that intelligence
then to power your tenants,

1208
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:32,730
your information on that.

1209
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:37,118
So as I wrap up my
presentation, three big things.

1210
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:38,921
We've been talking about it,

1211
00:50:38,921 --> 00:50:41,038
secure, simplify, transform.

1212
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,386
You can't do that one at a time.

1213
00:50:43,386 --> 00:50:47,280
You need to have a good digital
transformation strategy.

1214
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,280
And our goal is that we
come in with the intent

1215
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,010
of securing your data,
securing your applications,

1216
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:55,740
your workloads, simplifying
your architecture.

1217
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,710
We come, we see very convoluted
network architectures,

1218
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,090
whether it's in branch or cloud.

1219
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,359
How do we simplify, have
more consistent policies

1220
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,359
and give you more agility to
move faster as a business with

1221
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:12,120
by taking out a lot of
complexity from your networks.

1222
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,253
With that, we'll wrap up the presentation.
