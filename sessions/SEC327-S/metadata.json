  "abstract": "Security teams face an exponential growth in telemetry data across AWS services, third-party tools, and hybrid infrastructure. The challenge isn't just detecting threats—it's finding the real incidents among millions of daily events without overwhelming your SOC team. Join Riot games and Datadog subject matter experts as we explore battle-tested principles for building effective detection systems at scale. Drawing from real-world implementations at enterprises like Riot Games, we'll demonstrate how to leverage AWS native services alongside Datadog's security platform to create high-fidelity detection rules that actually work. This presentation is brought to you by Datadog, an AWS Partner.",
