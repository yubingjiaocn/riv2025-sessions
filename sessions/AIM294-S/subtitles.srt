1
00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:03,240
I take everything

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,379
you like. All right, good

3
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:06,578
morning everyone.

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,198
Everyone having a good time at Reinvent.

5
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:11,800
This is actually my first reinvent.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,819
I spent most of my career on the Microsoft

7
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:16,859
side of technology, so, uh, this has

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,440
been interesting to kind of compare

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,850
some of the big Microsoft conferences with,

10
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:23,370
uh, With AWS and Amazon,

11
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:24,769
so I'm excited to be here.

12
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:27,129
Uh, my name is Colin Dembovsky. I'm the

13
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:29,589
director of field services for GitHub co-pilots.

14
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,109
Uh, so I spend my entire, uh,

15
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:33,149
days

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,609
meeting with products and with

17
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:37,750
our field services teams, and

18
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,880
with customers, and with partners,

19
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:42,228
and discuss all of the things that

20
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:44,240
uh we're building and we're, uh,

21
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,250
helping customers with in this age

22
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,009
of AI.

23
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,770
Uh, so I'll go through a little bit of my journey. I

24
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,009
will say that I'm from South Africa and I wanna

25
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:54,329
clear up. Well, I'm from South Africa originally. I'm based

26
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,298
outside of Houston now.

27
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,700
But I wanna clear up that I don't have the accent.

28
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,848
All you all have the accent. All right. So I

29
00:00:59,848 --> 00:01:01,848
just wanna make sure that we've clear, we clear that up.

30
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:04,439
Uh, but I've been with GitHub for about 4 years, uh,

31
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,609
just over 4 years.

32
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,010
Uh, I was a solution engineer for most of that time

33
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,150
before taking on this role.

34
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,769
Uh, and as you can imagine, over the last 4 years, most

35
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:14,099
of our discussions have been very heavily.

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,519
Weighted towards co-pilot, we actually do

37
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,650
have a whole platform in GitHub. We've

38
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,760
got advanced security, which you'll see some of

39
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,760
today. We've got the

40
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,959
biggest CICD platform in the world

41
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,079
in the world with GitHub Action. So we actually do have

42
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:27,859
a whole platform,

43
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,480
but of course Co-Pilott is dominating that

44
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,719
and dominating the minds of our customers.

45
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:34,838
So what I'm going to do today is I want to

46
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:36,918
just take a kind of a journey. Through a

47
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:39,168
little bit of computer science history. This is not

48
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:40,989
meant to be comprehensive, but

49
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:43,528
I think it's useful to just frame where we are

50
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:44,349
in the industry.

51
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,969
I'll give you some insights into what I'm seeing

52
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:48,969
as trends in the industry, what I'm seeing with some

53
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:49,918
of my customers,

54
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,338
and show you what we're planning for,

55
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:54,819
what we're building towards in the future.

56
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,239
So that will help frame what we're doing with

57
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,239
GitHub co-pilot,

58
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,730
and then we'll end off with a couple of demos

59
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,329
and I'll take some questions. So

60
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:04,469
that's what we'll do this morning.

61
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,299
So I wanna start with this slide here and

62
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,429
uh maybe by show of hands,

63
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:11,508
if you don't mind dating yourself, does

64
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:13,189
anyone know what this is?

65
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,199
Yeah, OK, so I see a few hands. Thank you

66
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,319
for your service. Um, but these are punch

67
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:18,949
cards.

68
00:02:19,278 --> 00:02:21,558
And, uh, if you think about 40, 50

69
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,588
years ago, so not that long ago,

70
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,979
this is how developers,

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
or programmers programmed

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,860
computers.

73
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,319
And uh, the punch card on the left

74
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,580
there, you can kind of see there's holes punched out of it.

75
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,000
And uh those are zeros, and where there's

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,319
not a hole, it's a 1. So you were literally

77
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,659
programming in binary by punching holes

78
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:41,419
into a card.

79
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,308
And then you would put these cards in order, and

80
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:46,389
so on the right-hand side you can see a box, so that

81
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:48,389
is a program because it's a series of

82
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:50,469
cards, and you would feed those cards

83
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:52,838
into the computer to program that computer.

84
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:55,490
So I like to pause at this stage

85
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,990
and ask a rhetorical

86
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,689
question that you can think about a little bit.

87
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:02,229
And the question is, uh, how long

88
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:03,210
do you think it took

89
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,028
developers who use this method

90
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:08,229
to program computers to become

91
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,469
productive developers?

92
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,000
Or maybe another way of phrasing it was,

93
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:15,050
how long do you think it took to go

94
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,210
from idea to deployment when this was

95
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,770
how you programmed computers?

96
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,069
Alright, so we're probably talking months,

97
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,550
you know, assuming you didn't drop your stack of

98
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,189
cards

99
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:27,189
and forget which order they were in.

100
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,750
Alright, but uh you can see how this was

101
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,008
great for the beginning of computers, but

102
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,710
uh it would have taken a very long time

103
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,750
to get any idea into production.

104
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,909
So we had some very smart people in the

105
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:42,028
industry and they decided, well, you know, these punch card

106
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:43,649
things are not that great. What if we

107
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,990
took a typewriter essentially and put it in front

108
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,729
of the computer.

109
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:49,469
And then at least we didn't need punch cards. We could actually

110
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:51,569
use the keys on the typewriter

111
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,389
to type in, and we could use the printer

112
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,588
as a screen, right? You don't see any monitors

113
00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:58,758
there. The printer that printed the paper

114
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,270
was the monitor that you would use to see

115
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,429
what the computer was doing and to see the outputs.

116
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,088
And uh these two gentlemen here are

117
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:08,460
Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. Anyone know what these

118
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,979
folks are famous for?

119
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,909
C? Oh well,

120
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:14,229
what did, what did Ken Thompson invent before

121
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,428
C? B, yes, right.

122
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:17,470
And Dennis Ritchie

123
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,869
and Ken Thompson worked on Unix, right?

124
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,988
So, uh, this was slightly better. Again,

125
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,069
I'll, I'll pause and ask a question. When you had a

126
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:26,350
typewriter and a dot matrix printer, remember

127
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,548
the sound of those dot matrix printers, right?

128
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,149
Uh, when that was how you interfaced with

129
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:33,269
computers, how long did it take you to go from

130
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:35,269
idea to production? How long did it take you to

131
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:37,319
become a productive developer? It's

132
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,689
probably still in months or weeks,

133
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,088
right? So

134
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,738
now fast forward a little bit

135
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:46,160
to the early 1990s,

136
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:48,639
uh, when I was in high school. And this was

137
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,720
the first programming language that I ever

138
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,980
learned. Uh, this was Turbo-Pascal

139
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,040
7. Any Turbo-Pascal fans out

140
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,600
there? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Any,

141
00:04:56,869 --> 00:04:58,389
anyone a fan of of C?

142
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:01,358
Or, uh, TypeScripts.

143
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,009
Well, they're all written by Anders

144
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:06,088
Hallsbrand, who's invented Turbo Pascal,

145
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:06,738
right? So,

146
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:07,829
um, but

147
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:10,608
for you younguns in the audience here,

148
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,730
when you wanted to

149
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,048
program back in the 90s, you literally

150
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,540
bought a compiler. So that is Turbo

151
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,689
Pascal, and it came on a couple of

152
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,730
disks that you would have to feed into the computer to

153
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,928
load the compiler on.

154
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:25,528
And then when you wanted to figure out how do I do

155
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:27,809
a function call, how do I do a for loop,

156
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,009
how do I pass arguments, you had to

157
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:32,250
open up those things on the left-hand side there, they're

158
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,449
called books. They have pages, and you have to like

159
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:36,730
turn them, right? And that's how you would learn

160
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,769
programming, is you would open up these books and you would learn

161
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:40,069
the programming concepts. Now,

162
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,809
up until this stage, uh, you've got monitors

163
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,329
and you've got com uh, you know,

164
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:46,709
computers with 640K of memory,

165
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,970
and a 20 megabyte hard drive, and a

166
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,738
16.

167
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:52,869
Uh, color grayscale or 1616

168
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:54,988
grayscale monochrome monitor, right?

169
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:57,350
So we're like, these were still pretty advanced

170
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,149
times uh during the 90s.

171
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:01,910
But again, you're still talking weeks or months

172
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,829
to go from idea to deployment.

173
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,699
Anyway, then I studied computer science

174
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,220
at a small university college in uh.

175
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:12,189
In South Africa, in a town called Grahamstown,

176
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,500
called Rhodes University. It was a great time. I

177
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
did 6 years there, doing a master's degree

178
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,928
in Computer Science. I had, had an absolute blast.

179
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,500
And then I got into the real world where I had to

180
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,579
be a programmer, and I had to actually put some

181
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:25,420
of that learning into use.

182
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:27,939
And uh, the first company I ever joined, they were

183
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:30,338
Linux C++, and we wrote back-end systems

184
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:32,379
for internet service providers, right? So if you

185
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,459
think back to the early 2000s, when you signed

186
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:35,160
up for an internet,

187
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:38,040
Uh, for internet services, you've got things like

188
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,139
inboxes and um

189
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,699
anti-virus, and you've got all these other services

190
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:44,738
that came, and we, we wrote the systems

191
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,959
that these internet service providers would use

192
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:49,338
to provision services to their customers. It was

193
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:51,619
all Linux and C++ and Corba, if

194
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,660
anyone remembers Corba.

195
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,220
Uh, but I, I put this, I put this up

196
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,278
here because uh.

197
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,959
There were no such things as IDEs.

198
00:06:59,019 --> 00:06:59,920
You were essentially

199
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:02,379
typing code into a text file, and

200
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:04,540
this actually has syntax highlighting, cause I generated

201
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,660
in VS code, and we're the editors I had

202
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:09,220
back then, in the early 2000s, didn't even

203
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,488
have syntax highlighting, but you can see all the prints

204
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:12,699
all over the place. Anyone,

205
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,660
anyone ever do printF debugging?

206
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:17,459
Right, yeah, you had to put entering method,

207
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,928
the value of iterator is exiting

208
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:22,250
method, and you put little timers to see

209
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,548
which methods were going fast or slow, or

210
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,019
then you would run the application and all these logs

211
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:29,170
would scroll down the console, and then you would scratch

212
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,209
through all of those logs to figure out what was going on in

213
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:32,988
your program, right? So

214
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,528
we're definitely getting higher level um

215
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:36,548
programming here,

216
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:39,189
but again, it still takes a long time

217
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:41,689
to do anything productive, and there's a long

218
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:43,750
time from idea to production.

219
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,500
My second job

220
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,160
was at a company, it was a financial

221
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
services company.

222
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,838
We had about 25 developers

223
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:53,790
when I joined.

224
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,160
Uh, and they brought me on as a senior

225
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,519
developer, and they gave me Visual

226
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,678
Studio. Anyone a Visual Studio user

227
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:01,220
here?

228
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,838
OK, a couple of hands, thank you for admitting that.

229
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,199
Um, but Visual Studio was a fantastic

230
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,480
editor. It still is a great editor. I use VS code

231
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,678
now because it's a little bit more lightweight, but Visual

232
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:12,019
Studio is a great editor, but,

233
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,519
Being able to set a breakpoint, right, and

234
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,459
actually uh

235
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,798
stop the application while it was running. You

236
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,509
don't see any print Fs anywhere there,

237
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:22,399
but I was able to stop the program, see what the variables

238
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,480
were, and that made me a much

239
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,600
faster developer because I didn't

240
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,660
have to litter my program with print

241
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,920
des all over the place.

242
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,519
And uh and so now we're talking probably weeks,

243
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,678
right? Our, our deploy cycles were about in the,

244
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,830
in, measured in about weeks.

245
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,099
All right. And then uh I

246
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,330
put this XKCD cartoon up here,

247
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,538
because uh I got into DevOps consulting,

248
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:45,658
right, when I, that company I joined, they were

249
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,450
using Zip files for source control.

250
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:49,859
And I was like, well, I might not know much about the uh

251
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:51,899
Microsoft stack, but there's gotta be a better way of

252
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,219
doing source control. And so I opened

253
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:56,609
up a web crawler, and this was like pre-Gogle,

254
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,979
and, uh, and found this tool called

255
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:01,090
Team Foundation Server 2005

256
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,158
Beta 2, which is a precursor to

257
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:05,178
Azure DevOps, as it's known today.

258
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,548
Uh, and I got that installed and got our team onto

259
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,908
source control, and then eventually automated

260
00:09:09,908 --> 00:09:12,109
builds, and eventually unit testing and work

261
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:13,369
item tracking and all of the

262
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:16,149
software development things that we take for granted

263
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:18,340
today. Sort of in the early 2000s,

264
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:20,509
these were quite, quite novel concepts, right?

265
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,729
And so I remember Friday afternoons, we would

266
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,190
get together, we had a couple of scripts, but you would

267
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,548
still have to run them. So we called it auto-manual,

268
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:29,408
right, cause we were running scripts manually.

269
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,070
And we would have someone who was grilling meat,

270
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,399
and if your commit broke the build, you didn't

271
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,279
get to eat. So, that was our rule, all right.

272
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,288
Uh, so I put that up there because I love this XKCD

273
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,369
cartoon, because back in those days, you know, to

274
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:43,408
do a compile actually took a lot of

275
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:45,570
time and energy, and it took you away from

276
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,710
doing development work.

277
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,629
Uh, but at least it made you slightly faster

278
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:50,769
than if you had to

279
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:53,109
right click and publish, right? One of my friends used

280
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,250
to say, friends, don't let friends right click

281
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,349
publish out of Visual Studio. So we

282
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:59,469
were getting into automated builds, and

283
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:01,830
uh this was around the time that Agile

284
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,928
was really taking off in the industry.

285
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,168
Um, my blog is called Collins ALM Corner,

286
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:07,918
because, uh,

287
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,500
back then we spoke about application life cycle

288
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,840
management. So this was before

289
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:14,340
the term DevOps was coined, right?

290
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,899
So I kind of wish my blog was now Collins DevOps

291
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,899
Corner or something, but Collins ALM Corner is

292
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:19,840
nostalgic, so

293
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:21,389
I'll just keep it there. But,

294
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:23,859
uh, so I spent the next decade of my career

295
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:26,330
helping teams move from Waterfall

296
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,418
into agile, so that they could deploy

297
00:10:28,418 --> 00:10:30,418
quicker, that they could go from

298
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:30,960
idea

299
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:32,979
to production faster.

300
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,869
This blog post is actually from

301
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:40,969
the GitHub blog.

302
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:43,168
It's dated 2008.

303
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:46,349
And uh one of the early founders of GitHub

304
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,950
put this little blog post up

305
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:50,408
and uh said, oh yeah, there's

306
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:52,769
pull requests now. So if you did not know

307
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:54,849
who created the pull request, or

308
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:56,889
invented the pull request, it was actually GitHub. So

309
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,960
in 2008,

310
00:10:58,288 --> 00:10:59,908
we invented the pull request, and of course,

311
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,408
most of us nowadays, the pull request is

312
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,989
really the center of our entire development workflow.

313
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,109
Uh, but even back in those days, in 2008,

314
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:10,590
GitHub was on the forefront of innovation

315
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,190
for software delivery.

316
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,629
Um, this was also around the time when open

317
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:16,788
source really started taking off and taking

318
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:17,450
the industry

319
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:18,840
by storm.

320
00:11:20,308 --> 00:11:22,308
So again, I'm gonna do a little bit of a fast forward

321
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:24,830
to 2021.

322
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,428
Uh, so I put this blog post up, uh,

323
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,859
it's dated February 23rd, 2022,

324
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:33,460
uh, when we put out a blog post saying

325
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,918
that we're introducing the world to this technical

326
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:38,000
preview of this little product called GitHub

327
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,158
Co-Pilot. Anyone, anyone using Co-Pilott

328
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,239
today? All right, I see a lot of hands,

329
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:42,979
which is great.

330
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,619
All right, so I, I put this up here because,

331
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,000
uh, most people back in February

332
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,009
of 2022 did not know what an

333
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,000
LLM was.

334
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
They had no idea what transformers were, they had

335
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,349
no idea what generative AI was.

336
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,798
Uh, but we were already experimenting with this.

337
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:00,158
In fact, I joined, uh, GitHub in

338
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:01,899
September of 2021,

339
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:04,639
and remember using GitHub co-pilot in

340
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,340
December of 2021,

341
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,639
uh, during the advent of code, which I'll talk

342
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,408
about in a couple of seconds, but, uh,

343
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:13,139
It was only really nine months after this

344
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:15,139
blog post in November

345
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:17,178
of 22 that Chat GPT blew

346
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:19,259
up and and became kind of a household

347
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:20,678
name when OpenAI released it

348
00:12:21,178 --> 00:12:23,538
to the public, and suddenly everyone knew what models

349
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:25,700
and LLMs and generative AI

350
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,139
was. But we're, we're certainly about a year

351
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:30,009
ahead of that, right? And so I put this up here,

352
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:32,349
again, just to show that um we,

353
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,849
this came out of a group inside of GitHub

354
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:37,119
called GitHub Next. It's also sort of our R&D division.

355
00:12:37,678 --> 00:12:40,000
That are uh always doing pretty radical

356
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,279
things, but they, they, they're the, the

357
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,989
brains behind GitHub co-pilot,

358
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:46,359
and uh I wanted to show that we're

359
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:48,038
leading in those innovations.

360
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:50,558
Now, anyone here ever done the advent of

361
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:51,099
code?

362
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:53,710
Alright, a couple of hands. Alright, this is really

363
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,950
fun. Uh, I actually I haven't even looked at this year's

364
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,808
competition yet, but, uh, there's a

365
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,308
guy that creates these puzzles, and there's 2 puzzles

366
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:02,629
a day from the 1st to the 25th of December.

367
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,940
And you can solve them however you want with

368
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,308
whatever programming language you want, and they get progressively

369
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:08,048
more difficult.

370
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:10,619
Uh, so last year I made it up to day 19

371
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:11,129
before, uh,

372
00:13:11,418 --> 00:13:13,460
before I gave up. Uh, but that's how I

373
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,619
learned how to use, uh, GetUp Co-Pilott was

374
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:18,178
doing advent of Code in December of 2021.

375
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,759
Highly recommend you check it out if you're, uh,

376
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,019
on leave and bored.

377
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:24,379
Uh, you may wanna check out Advent of Code. It's a really

378
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,418
fun, uh, little exercises that you

379
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:28,580
can do. But I used a TypeScript repo,

380
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:30,678
and I was like, hey, what can co-pilot do to help

381
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:32,158
me solve these problems and.

382
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,558
This was back in the stone ages

383
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:36,599
of GitHub co-pilot, or it

384
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:38,639
feels like the Stone Ages. It was actually sort of 3 and a

385
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,538
bit years ago,

386
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:42,048
uh, where we had code completion.

387
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:44,580
All right, and that was how we started with GitHub Co-Pilott,

388
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:45,239
was

389
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,158
where a human was writing in a

390
00:13:48,158 --> 00:13:50,239
code file, right, in a TypeScript file

391
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:52,678
or a C file or a Java file, or whatever

392
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:53,538
file you were in.

393
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,918
And uh you wrote a comment or

394
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,099
you opened up a bracket to start a function.

395
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,899
And the co-pilot would inject

396
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:02,710
a suggestion for you,

397
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:05,019
and uh I remember the first time I ever

398
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:07,019
got a completion, it was mind-blowing.

399
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:09,099
I was like, how did it know that that was

400
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,379
what I was going to type, right, and so there was this magical

401
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,158
feeling about

402
00:14:12,538 --> 00:14:13,639
the power of

403
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:16,279
co-pilot and code completions.

404
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:20,058
So I wanted to come back to the XKCD

405
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:22,210
cartoon, where developers are slacking

406
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,460
off because there's a compiler, and I wanna give an

407
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,739
updated version of the XKCD

408
00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:27,928
cartoon, right.

409
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:30,418
And this is probably something that you've heard a lot of

410
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:31,639
at this conference, and.

411
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:34,099
If you look at Google or Microsoft,

412
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,889
or OpenAI or any of

413
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:37,639
these top companies,

414
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,349
everyone's talking about agents, agents, agents.

415
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:42,840
A year ago it was models, models, models. Now

416
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,658
models are more more or less a commodity.

417
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:47,158
Everyone's talking agent, agent, agent, and

418
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:48,519
now we have

419
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,259
this world where the agent is working

420
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,440
on your behalf. And what is the

421
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,340
point of this?

422
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,869
It's to make you a faster, more

423
00:14:56,869 --> 00:14:57,769
productive developer.

424
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,070
It's to shorten that time from

425
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,219
idea to deployment. That is

426
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:02,899
the goal,

427
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,389
that should be the goal of what the agents

428
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:05,918
are doing.

429
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:09,210
So uh we, we think about these waves,

430
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:11,469
I'll talk a little bit more about uh

431
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:13,590
these waves, but wave one was

432
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,668
that pair programmer paradigm with

433
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:16,529
code completion,

434
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:17,908
where a human is,

435
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,788
In the forefront in a

436
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:23,359
text file and you're having code completions,

437
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:26,029
and then we're moving into wave

438
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:28,109
2, a little bit into flavors

439
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,330
of wave 3,

440
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,099
where the wave wave 2 is

441
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,229
where the agents have become a lot more

442
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:34,969
capable

443
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,629
and they're able to work more autonomously.

444
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:40,428
And that opens up new opportunities where

445
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:42,548
they can work asynchronously. You can give them

446
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:44,629
whole tasks now and get them to complete

447
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:45,489
those tasks

448
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:48,000
on your behalf asynchronously,

449
00:15:48,308 --> 00:15:50,590
and that's giving birth to what we're referring

450
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,690
to as the agentic SDLC.

451
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:55,509
Alright, and so how do we think about how agents

452
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:58,119
are changing the software delivery life cycle?

453
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:00,668
How are they actually making us more

454
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,889
productive, or are they actually making

455
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:04,908
us more productive? It's something we spend a lot

456
00:16:04,908 --> 00:16:06,840
of our time and effort thinking about.

457
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,469
And we're moving towards wave 3, which is

458
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,558
these hybrid teams, where you'll have teams

459
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:13,690
of developers working with fleets of

460
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,489
agents

461
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,139
to deploy and again get from

462
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:19,219
idea to deploy as quickly as

463
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:19,840
possible.

464
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:24,658
All right, so I wanted to show some data. Uh,

465
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:25,340
this

466
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:28,259
is from our own internal analysis

467
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:30,259
of GitHub co-pilot across all of

468
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:31,298
our customers.

469
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:34,058
And, uh, those bars there are showing

470
00:16:34,058 --> 00:16:36,139
a couple of things. So they're, on the left-hand side

471
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:38,178
is uh non-copilot,

472
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,418
right? And so you, we've divided up each of

473
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:41,399
those bars

474
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,239
into,

475
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:44,619
uh, the median, the high, and the top

476
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:46,619
10% of developers, right? And so you can kind of

477
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:47,798
see on the left-hand side.

478
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:50,308
Um, there's some velocity there, and

479
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:52,389
of course the high-performing developers

480
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:54,668
have a larger velocity, a larger throughput

481
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:55,788
than other developers.

482
00:16:56,229 --> 00:16:58,590
And then you add CCA, which is co-pilot

483
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,629
coding agent, which is our asynchronous agent,

484
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:02,690
where you can give it a task and it will go away

485
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,689
and complete that task autonomously.

486
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:07,180
Uh, you can see that the throughput increases.

487
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:09,578
And if we then enable

488
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:10,689
uh CCR,

489
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,430
uh, we'll co-pilot with CCAs

490
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,500
on the right-hand side, right? So the, the middle one is just

491
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,769
using co-pilot and your editor.

492
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,189
The one on the right is using coding agent, and

493
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:21,660
you can see when developers start to use co-pilot

494
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,500
and the asynchronous coding agent,

495
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,529
their throughput and their productivity

496
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:27,269
starts to skyrocket.

497
00:17:27,618 --> 00:17:29,630
Uh, the contribution graph on the right-hand

498
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,670
side or the contribution numbers on the right-hand side

499
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,750
are from the repo GitHub GitHub, which

500
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,019
is the main mono repo for the GitHub

501
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:38,338
platform. And uh you can see

502
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:40,828
the number 2 there is 397

503
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:41,729
contributions.

504
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:44,390
Alright, that is in a one-month period. So

505
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,920
our highest human contributed about

506
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,239
400 contributions to GitHub, GitHub.

507
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,640
But co-pilot coding agent,

508
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:54,318
Did 5x of that.

509
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,719
All right, so 1500 contributions.

510
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,189
And coming in a strong third place is the

511
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:01,078
co-pilot code review agent. So,

512
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,630
internally, we're using coding agent

513
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,809
and code review agent very heavily to

514
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:07,949
augment our teams and

515
00:18:07,949 --> 00:18:09,630
to improve our velocity.

516
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,049
Um, so we're dog fooding that. We consider ourselves

517
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,269
to be customer zero for co-pilot

518
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:16,469
and the rest of our platform. We use GitHub to build

519
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:18,848
GitHub. Uh, we use GitHub very

520
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,049
heavily internally,

521
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,449
um, but we see,

522
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:24,140
Uh, from our stats and from looking at,

523
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,789
uh, the,

524
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:27,519
the data science behind the pull

525
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,799
requests, we see 20% faster

526
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,838
mergers with co-pilot code review, right? So

527
00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:33,019
if your lead time,

528
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:35,439
when you open a pull request to when you close a

529
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:37,598
pull request is 5 days without code

530
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:39,680
review, we're seeing that when you enable

531
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,699
code review agent, you're gonna shrink that from

532
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:43,959
5 days to 4 days, right, which is a 20%

533
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,150
improvement. Right, Imagine if you're taking

534
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,250
20 or 25 days to close your

535
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,250
PRs. If you can get a 20% improvement,

536
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,608
you're getting down to 10 or 15 days, right, and that's

537
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:54,930
just code review agent, nevermind coding agent

538
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,799
or co-pilot.

539
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,170
Uh, so we're seeing, uh, the, the proof is

540
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:58,910
in the pudding,

541
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,199
and uh we're seeing that across the board. Of

542
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:03,529
course you can get more if you're more intentional

543
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:05,529
about it. So hopefully I can give you some ideas today

544
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:06,989
about how to be more intentional,

545
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,759
so that you can really maximize the gains

546
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:10,309
and the

547
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:12,828
productivity improvements you'll get from our platform.

548
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:16,769
Right, but there's a challenge,

549
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,219
because uh if co-pilot is

550
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:21,539
helping you create more code faster,

551
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:23,640
that means you have more to plan,

552
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:25,410
you have more to review,

553
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,910
you have more to test and scan, you have

554
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,239
more to operate,

555
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,900
and you have more to integrate, especially if you've got disparate

556
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,598
tools across your SDLC.

557
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,259
Alright, and uh, the integration, as

558
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,299
one of my computer science professors used to

559
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,608
say, Interchangeable parts don't,

560
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,809
right, I have a lot of uh customers

561
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,209
throughout my years as a DevOps consultant that

562
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:47,489
had, uh, there were, some of them, there was a swing

563
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:49,529
where everyone wanted one system that did

564
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:50,890
everything, and then there was a swing to,

565
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:53,630
well, we want the best in breed tools, and we'll just integrate

566
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,713
them, right, and that. Never seemed to work

567
00:19:55,713 --> 00:19:57,884
out because you ended up spending a lot of time on

568
00:19:57,884 --> 00:19:59,963
the integration instead of solving your

569
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:02,005
business problems and your customers'

570
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:03,394
problems. So we don't want you to do that.

571
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:05,684
So our vision is to be the backbone of your

572
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:06,483
SDLC.

573
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,064
We always build with uh integration

574
00:20:09,064 --> 00:20:09,983
and uh

575
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:12,265
uh APIs for

576
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:14,144
other tools when you need them,

577
00:20:14,644 --> 00:20:16,644
uh, but we wanna be that backbone

578
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:18,875
for your entire SDLC, not just

579
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,045
in the code generation space. Alright, so

580
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:21,943
co-pilot started.

581
00:20:22,328 --> 00:20:24,348
To help code generation, but we're thinking

582
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,729
very deeply about how can we bring genetic

583
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:30,289
capabilities to planning, to reviewing,

584
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,529
to testing and securing and to operating.

585
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,930
And that's what I want to go over in this

586
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,759
next section.

587
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,759
So, again, I'll bring up these waves.

588
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:40,890
Um, these 4 waves are actually defined

589
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,890
by Microsoft, and we've kind of adopted some

590
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:43,910
of their language there.

591
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,729
Uh, so again, that wave 1 was assistance,

592
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:48,930
where you can think of, I'm in a code

593
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,150
file and I'm getting assistance from code completion.

594
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:53,769
Uh, then there's augmentation where I'm

595
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:54,390
able to give,

596
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,250
uh, I'm able to get the agent to edit

597
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,088
multiple files at the same time.

598
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,059
Uh, so there's augmentation.

599
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,489
And then there's orchestration, which is kind of where we are

600
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:05,209
now with autonomous agents.

601
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,608
And, uh, how can we, how can we

602
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:09,608
get these agents to run autonomously

603
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:11,809
and asynchronously and in a multi-threaded

604
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:12,400
fashion.

605
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,390
And then wave 4 would be

606
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:16,868
full autonomy, right, where we actually trust these

607
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:17,848
agents to go.

608
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,420
Uh, completely from end to end where agents are

609
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,118
talking to agents, and, uh,

610
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,489
that's where we're headed, that's where we see the

611
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:26,539
industry going. So we're somewhere in the wave

612
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:28,769
2 to wave 3, we've got pieces of wave

613
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:29,289
4.

614
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:32,019
So what I wanna do for the next couple of slides is show you

615
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:34,059
just a conceptual vision of

616
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,059
what it could look like when you're in wave 4.

617
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:38,000
And again, we have a lot of the pieces today,

618
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:40,618
but I wanted to give you sort of an aspirational vision

619
00:21:40,618 --> 00:21:42,739
of what we're trying to build for

620
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:44,779
you. Alright, so let's imagine that

621
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:46,858
you have a brainstorming agent and you're

622
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:49,170
gonna brainstorm some feature or some bug fix.

623
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,719
You're gonna create a plan with a work breakdown,

624
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,479
and all of this is being done with the agent's help.

625
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:57,229
Then you're gonna pass all of those tasks to coding agents,

626
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:59,338
which are going to actually do the coding, so they're going to take

627
00:21:59,338 --> 00:22:00,000
all of those

628
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,439
tasks from your plan and code them up,

629
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:05,074
and then they'll, Pass the coding changes to

630
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,174
security and quality agents that are going to check

631
00:22:07,174 --> 00:22:09,634
that there are no vulnerabilities, that there are no vulnerable

632
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:10,354
dependencies,

633
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,025
that the quality is good.

634
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:13,864
And then you're gonna have a human review,

635
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,434
right, cause we still believe very strongly in human in

636
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:18,814
the loop. So, the human will review.

637
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:21,394
And then once you're deployed, we envision

638
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:23,213
SRE agents, site reliability

639
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:25,993
engineer agents, right? Microsoft has an

640
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:27,654
SRE agent on the Azure platform.

641
00:22:28,338 --> 00:22:30,709
We saw this week in the keynotes

642
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:32,739
that Amazon released the DevOps

643
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:34,930
agent, which is the same idea. How can we use

644
00:22:35,108 --> 00:22:37,250
the agents to monitor production

645
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,348
environments and then feed that back into

646
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:41,549
the life cycle. So you can imagine that happening

647
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:43,769
across one work stream, across one sprint team,

648
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,150
and then you can have that in parallel

649
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,368
across multiple.

650
00:22:47,689 --> 00:22:49,709
Uh, work streams within that team.

651
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:52,088
While the team is going, the SRE agent

652
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:54,209
or whatever flavor it is, finds an

653
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:55,489
issue in production,

654
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:57,598
grabs the context from that issue,

655
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,890
logs it back as an issue to assign

656
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,250
decoding agent, which then has all the context

657
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,848
it needs to go and fix that issue,

658
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:06,289
goes and goes back through the scanning

659
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:07,209
and securing,

660
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:09,650
and there's human review and you deploy

661
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,650
out. And then you can imagine this

662
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,969
going across multiple teams and multiple

663
00:23:13,969 --> 00:23:14,949
business units

664
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:17,368
across your engineering teams.

665
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,469
So that's kind of the high level vision

666
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:22,029
of what we're trying to create and what we're trying

667
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:22,868
to get to.

668
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,650
And so we want to bring those agentic capabilities

669
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,880
not just to code generation to make developers

670
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,009
faster, but how can we help you plan faster?

671
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:32,328
How can we help you secure and build trust

672
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,989
in what the agents are producing

673
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,318
faster? How can we get you faster in

674
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:38,489
the meantime to remediate, and all of those

675
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:39,650
good DevOps

676
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,719
practices?

677
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:43,250
How can we make you faster with the power of

678
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,739
these agents? So that's what we're ultimately building.

679
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:49,368
Let's see here. Anyone, uh, go or

680
00:23:49,368 --> 00:23:51,568
watch Universe 2025?

681
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:55,449
Does anyone know what universe is? OK, there's

682
00:23:55,449 --> 00:23:57,549
a couple of hands. Alright, so Universe is our

683
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,049
equivalent of reinvent, um, it's our annual

684
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:00,608
conference.

685
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:03,049
It happens, uh, late October every

686
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,828
year in San Fran. So we had,

687
00:24:05,368 --> 00:24:07,410
uh, Universe 2025, about, oh what was

688
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,598
it, 4 weeks ago-ish, Somewhere around there. And,

689
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:11,640
uh, if I had to summarize all of the ships and

690
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,848
announcements we made,

691
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:15,729
it would be the simple sentence, the rise

692
00:24:15,729 --> 00:24:18,029
of agents. And that's really summarizing

693
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:18,750
what we.

694
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:21,358
have been working on for the last 6 to 8

695
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:23,430
months and all of the announcements that we made. So

696
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,670
I want to go through some of those.

697
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:27,189
Again, I'm trying to paint a picture here, so

698
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:29,390
that you understand what we're doing, because we're shipping

699
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,390
fast, we're shipping a lot, and so we

700
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:31,969
often hear

701
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:33,368
that customers get,

702
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,239
Overwhelmed with all of the changes that we're

703
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:38,279
throwing at them, and I'm trying to give you

704
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,279
a framework here to how you can think about what

705
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,618
we're doing and building. So,

706
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:43,640
again I've spoken about this a little bit.

707
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:46,489
That we're accelerating coding, which is kind of in the middle

708
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:47,410
of your

709
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,098
SDLC, your software delivery life cycle,

710
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,630
is, can I produce faster

711
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,699
code, or can I produce code faster? Can

712
00:24:54,699 --> 00:24:56,989
I get the agents or the uh

713
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:57,809
coding assistant

714
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:00,549
to take mundane tasks off my hands

715
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:01,900
so that I can be more creative,

716
00:25:02,189 --> 00:25:04,189
do more high value work. And so I

717
00:25:04,189 --> 00:25:06,108
would say we've been doing a really good job of that.

718
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,630
But what we wanted to do is also look at how can we

719
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,868
clarify intent, how can we shift left into

720
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:13,160
more planning work? How can we get agents

721
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,959
to help with that,

722
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,799
uh, and so we released a planning agent,

723
00:25:16,838 --> 00:25:17,759
which I'll demo.

724
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:20,039
Um, we've also got the brainstorming agent

725
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:20,699
coming soon.

726
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:23,368
Um, so we're thinking about how we can shift those agentic

727
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:25,400
capabilities into that plan phase,

728
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:27,189
even before you start coding, right?

729
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:29,479
And anyone who's used any of these

730
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:31,479
coding agents, you'll know that when you say build me

731
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,019
an app,

732
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,750
You get very mediocre results,

733
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:37,390
but when you say, I need an app that does,

734
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:39,479
and you specify what you want the app to do and

735
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:41,549
what you want the stack to look like, and how you want it to

736
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:43,880
work, and how you develop and what your standards are,

737
00:25:44,318 --> 00:25:46,640
you get much better results. So it's all about clarifying

738
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,709
the intent early on so that you get

739
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:49,699
better results.

740
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:52,368
And then if we look to the right, it doesn't help if we

741
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:53,709
help you

742
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:56,670
create code and code changes faster,

743
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,039
if you have to spend more

744
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,098
time securing and validating,

745
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,088
And checking quality and validating

746
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:06,459
the output of those agents and

747
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:07,789
of those agent workflows.

748
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:10,150
So what are we doing to help build

749
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,269
trust so that you know once it's got through

750
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:13,689
your gates

751
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:16,229
and your quality bars that you are

752
00:26:16,229 --> 00:26:18,309
confident you can deploy. So how, how are we

753
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:20,469
doing that? And that's really what we've been thinking about.

754
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,250
One more concept I wanna cover here, which

755
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,439
I think is really important, is we're seeing a shift from

756
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:26,289
synchronous,

757
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:28,680
single threaded, single player development.

758
00:26:28,818 --> 00:26:30,229
Right, think of a developer

759
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,848
sitting in VS code or sitting with

760
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:34,930
Quiro, whatever it is, and you're doing

761
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,709
a task.

762
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,250
Typically that task is one task at a

763
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,559
time, and that agent is taking over your IDE

764
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,769
so it's synchronous, and it's typically one developer,

765
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,769
it's single player.

766
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:46,509
But we're seeing a shift away into

767
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:48,410
multi-threaded, asynchronous

768
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:50,848
and multiplayer, right, so

769
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,670
maybe we've got a breakdown of 8 or 10 tasks,

770
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:56,009
we can farm those off to agents

771
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,338
simultaneously,

772
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,699
and the agents can do all of that work at the same

773
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:00,269
time.

774
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:03,068
And how does that change the dynamic

775
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:05,348
of what we do as software engineers

776
00:27:05,348 --> 00:27:06,170
from a day to day

777
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,170
perspective.

778
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:10,108
And so we made this announcement at

779
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:11,699
GitHub uh Universe.

780
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,969
We call this Agent HQ because

781
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:17,338
we want GitHub to be the headquarters

782
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:19,289
of every agentic workflow.

783
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,660
Now this isn't actually a product. You're not gonna

784
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,848
go into GitHub and click on the agent HQ

785
00:27:23,848 --> 00:27:24,390
tab,

786
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:27,019
because GitHub is the agent

787
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:29,098
HQ. And so, uh, what we

788
00:27:29,098 --> 00:27:31,219
announced is, we have today, if you

789
00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:33,380
go and give a task to coding agent,

790
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:35,660
you're using the co-pilot coding agent.

791
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,489
But what if you're a Clawed code fan? Anyone here

792
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:40,568
a fan of Clawed code? Alright, well what if

793
00:27:40,568 --> 00:27:43,009
we, what if you wanna run your asynchronous workflows

794
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:43,769
with clawed code?

795
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,660
Well, just like we think models

796
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,739
are a commodity, you wanna use Gemini,

797
00:27:48,838 --> 00:27:50,900
you wanna use clouded models, you wanna use

798
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,049
anthropic models,

799
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:53,568
we're gonna enable that.

800
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:56,489
We think agents are going to be commodity

801
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:58,578
as well. So if you wanna use co-pilot, you'll

802
00:27:58,578 --> 00:28:00,739
get some advantages, but if you prefer Cloud,

803
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:02,578
we want to enable that, and so,

804
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:05,259
In the next couple of weeks, you will have the

805
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:07,380
ability to assign

806
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,920
issues asynchronously to Claude code,

807
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:12,299
or to Joules, or to

808
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,078
XAI,

809
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:15,660
uh, whatever agent you want to, in

810
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,660
the GitHub platform. So it'll still be where your

811
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,578
source code is,

812
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:21,259
it'll still be in your workflow, and

813
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:23,049
we will enable that for you.

814
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,660
And, and so, I'll show you some of the advantages you

815
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,858
get with co-pilot coding agents, but

816
00:28:27,858 --> 00:28:29,969
if you want to use other agents, we were gonna

817
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:30,799
build the platform

818
00:28:31,219 --> 00:28:32,318
that will support that.

819
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:36,380
But what about governance? Anyone

820
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,739
here have like security or compliance

821
00:28:38,739 --> 00:28:40,779
teams that make sure that you do the

822
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:41,608
right thing?

823
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:44,039
OK, yeah, so as developers, we have to deal

824
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:45,199
with those folks.

825
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,900
And how do those folks actually

826
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
manage at scale? How can they

827
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,880
put into place policies

828
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:54,259
and procedures

829
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:56,400
and Uh, all of the vetting

830
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,489
that they need to do across different models and agents,

831
00:28:58,568 --> 00:29:00,689
how can they do all of that? Well, we've got something

832
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:02,130
called the agent control plane,

833
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:04,598
which is the kind of the administrator's view. And

834
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:06,910
so the administrator can go into a single place

835
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,250
to approve the set of models that

836
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,868
your company is comfortable using.

837
00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:13,410
They can define custom models, if you've got

838
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,719
your own models or you've got other model providers

839
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,828
that you want to use, you can put those in there.

840
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:20,279
Uh, you can define policies, you can define

841
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,390
custom agents,

842
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,880
that's all defined in a single place we

843
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,160
call the agent control plane. So this is kind of what the

844
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,338
administrators

845
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:29,640
and the compliance team would be

846
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
using to get comfortable

847
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,098
at scale with what we're building.

848
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:36,759
But for developers, you want a single

849
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,880
place where you can see all of the threads that

850
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,838
you've started, right?

851
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:42,588
If you're gonna really go into multi-threaded

852
00:29:42,588 --> 00:29:45,039
development, you might have 8 or 10 or 12

853
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,400
things going at the same time. How do you see

854
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,630
where those are, how far they are, what

855
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,868
files have been changed,

856
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,098
and that's what we call mission control.

857
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:55,439
And uh I'll show you what Mission Control looks like.

858
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,640
We have that in the web, and we have that in Visual

859
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,759
Studio code as well.

860
00:29:59,118 --> 00:30:01,160
Uh, it's early days for us, but we're trying to

861
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,239
build this place where you can start managing

862
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:05,959
and orchestrating all of this multi-threaded

863
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:08,848
work. All

864
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,250
right, so, uh, we'll put this slide up quickly.

865
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,449
Um, so this shows kind of all of the

866
00:30:13,449 --> 00:30:15,489
actual features. So if you go into GitHub,

867
00:30:15,568 --> 00:30:17,650
you will see things like autofix and code

868
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,390
quality,

869
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:21,000
and, uh, coding agent and agent mode.

870
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:23,118
So these are actually the, all of the features, and we've

871
00:30:23,118 --> 00:30:25,150
tried to put them more or less in the phases

872
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,509
of the life cycle.

873
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:27,989
Uh, and, um,

874
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:30,828
we, we really like, we really

875
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,640
would hope that everyone would use all of these tools,

876
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:36,049
because we think there's some economies of scale that

877
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:37,328
you get across all of them.

878
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,670
But again, if you prefer another coding

879
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,769
agent, we're gonna make sure that we build in

880
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:43,779
the correct integration points for

881
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:46,818
that. Alright,

882
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:47,959
let's see.

883
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:51,900
Um, I'll, I'll mention a bit of metrics. I'm

884
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,939
not gonna spend too much time on this. So we, we

885
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,229
do have metrics,

886
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,920
uh, that will show how many, um,

887
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,500
how many users are using premium

888
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,578
models, what are the most popular models that

889
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:03,890
your developers are using?

890
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,338
Are they using coding agent or code review

891
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:06,939
agent?

892
00:31:07,318 --> 00:31:09,439
Uh, so we've, we've got the beginnings

893
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:10,588
of metrics,

894
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:13,078
uh, and we're starting off on the left-hand

895
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:15,199
side with measuring usage and adoption. That's

896
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:16,180
really the focus

897
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:17,539
of our metrics.

898
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,000
And we're moving towards taking

899
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,519
the usage metrics and actually helping

900
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,029
you

901
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:25,519
change or helping you measure impacts.

902
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,799
Um, again, internally, we've started with

903
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,934
pull request lead time. How long does it take

904
00:31:30,114 --> 00:31:32,114
from when you open a pull request to when it's merged,

905
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:34,594
and can we see any trends when

906
00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:36,594
you're using co-pilot to create the pull

907
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,634
request or using co-pilot code review

908
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:40,634
to review the request? And the answer is yes,

909
00:31:40,755 --> 00:31:41,733
we see those

910
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:44,334
trends, um, but we want to start getting those

911
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:46,755
trends and those metrics into our, the hands

912
00:31:46,755 --> 00:31:49,005
of our users so that you can start measuring that

913
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:51,434
yourself in our dashboards and in our APIs.

914
00:31:53,949 --> 00:31:56,509
All right, a couple more slides just to um

915
00:31:56,509 --> 00:31:58,509
show some of the releases that we made, and then I'll

916
00:31:58,509 --> 00:31:59,630
jump into some demos.

917
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:02,338
Um, so we think of agents as accelerators.

918
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,818
Um, so I've mentioned third-party agents, uh,

919
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:07,068
which is coming soon, in the next couple of weeks. I've mentioned

920
00:32:07,068 --> 00:32:07,930
Mission Control.

921
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:10,479
Uh, we've got the co-pilot coding agent, which, uh,

922
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:11,229
which I'll show.

923
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:13,088
Uh, we've got custom agents,

924
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:15,449
anyone using our clouded skills, right,

925
00:32:15,568 --> 00:32:17,608
so that's kind of similar clawed skills. It's

926
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:18,969
just a markdown file

927
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,380
that you can use to tell the agent

928
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,559
how you wanted to do a very particular task,

929
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,838
right? And so again, I'll demo that.

930
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,868
Uh, we've got co-pilot code review.

931
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:29,549
Uh, co-pilot code review before Universe,

932
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,789
so, uh, up until about a month ago, we

933
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:32,799
would take the diff

934
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,299
inside of PR. We would pass that to the agent, we'd

935
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:37,469
say, please do a review, and we had a system prompt

936
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:39,068
about how to do that review.

937
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:41,469
What we've added now is we've added what we call

938
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:42,828
agentic capabilities.

939
00:32:43,108 --> 00:32:45,250
So now code review will run in an action.

940
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,578
Uh, so it'll actually start up a

941
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,959
runner, and so it actually has an environment where

942
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:52,229
it can execute tasks like linters

943
00:32:52,229 --> 00:32:53,430
and code scanners.

944
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:55,430
Um, so I'll talk a little bit about that, but,

945
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:57,799
uh, co-pilot code review will now

946
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:00,078
give you the best of non-deterministic, asking

947
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,318
a model to do the review, and deterministic

948
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:04,299
tools like linters and our

949
00:33:04,598 --> 00:33:05,880
code scanning tool.

950
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,420
Uh, and of course we've had agent mode for a while.

951
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:11,479
All right, so I wanted to put this slide up here because

952
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:13,578
um I like to use this as an example of

953
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,880
how we are trying to help our customers

954
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,920
actually think about development in new ways.

955
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,219
So I'll show you this demo.

956
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:22,150
Uh we have a, a website called Octocat

957
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,299
Supply. It's a React,

958
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:26,640
uh, no JS application, sort of e-commerce

959
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,680
application. And uh the demo that I've been doing for

960
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,358
ages with my customers is,

961
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:32,759
and I'll show, I'll show you some of that demo, not

962
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,880
the whole thing, but there's no cart page.

963
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,949
You can go to the product page and you can add products

964
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:39,108
in. And uh there's

965
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:41,309
just a placeholder, and I walk through

966
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:43,539
how we can use co-pilot coding agent

967
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:44,660
or agent mode,

968
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,150
or code completions to help build out

969
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,328
this cart page.

970
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,868
But one day I was thinking about, well, why am I only

971
00:33:50,868 --> 00:33:52,809
building one cart page?

972
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,650
What if I don't know what the best

973
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,318
carp page design is?

974
00:33:57,689 --> 00:33:59,890
What if I wanted to experiment with multiple carp

975
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:00,519
pages?

976
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:02,809
Well, before coding agents,

977
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:05,368
I'd probably get my team together and we'd discuss

978
00:34:05,368 --> 00:34:07,469
several variations and then we'd pick one.

979
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,329
Before we even start, right? Because we don't

980
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:11,668
have time to do all three.

981
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,090
We don't have 3 teams that can do

982
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:14,949
the same work.

983
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,610
But because we now have agents, we're at a

984
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,030
place where we can say, all right,

985
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,909
I got co-pilot coding agent plan mode

986
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:24,010
to plan 3 different variations of

987
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,039
the cart page,

988
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:27,610
and create an issue for each variant, and

989
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,648
then assigned it to co-pilot, and co-pilot went

990
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:31,898
to work. On 3 different variations

991
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:33,978
at the same time, and about 25 minutes later,

992
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:36,019
I had 3 different versions of

993
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:38,340
the cart page. Now those screenshots there are

994
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,079
actually taken

995
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,978
as co-pilot coding agent was working, it

996
00:34:41,978 --> 00:34:44,000
spins up the Playwright MCP server,

997
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,648
and it interacts with the website, and it actually takes a

998
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:49,079
screenshot and it puts it into the body of the PR.

999
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:51,860
And so you can actually see just in the body of the PR

1000
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,159
the 3 different variations.

1001
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,978
Of course, there's all the code there, they're on separate branches,

1002
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:58,139
so I could check them out if I wanted to. If I

1003
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,260
had a feature flag system, like

1004
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,260
a launch Daly or something like that, I could actually

1005
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,300
deploy all 3 and do load balancing and all of

1006
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,179
that thing. But the point is

1007
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:08,958
that this is a new muscle memory for developers.

1008
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,610
Because we should start thinking about why should I

1009
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,119
only do 1 variant.

1010
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:15,889
Let me do 3 or 4 or 5,

1011
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:18,659
because agents can take that offline

1012
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:21,438
for me. We

1013
00:35:21,438 --> 00:35:22,639
also have uh.

1014
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,188
Any,

1015
00:35:24,628 --> 00:35:26,769
anywhere you wanna access co-pilot coding

1016
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:28,769
agent from, we wanna enable that. So we

1017
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:29,429
announced

1018
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:32,128
uh the co-pilot CLI. Anyone using co-pilot

1019
00:35:32,128 --> 00:35:32,780
CLI?

1020
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,369
No one. All right, I'll have to show that to you.

1021
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:37,559
You co-pilot CLI,

1022
00:35:38,128 --> 00:35:40,128
uh, so if you're a terminal warrior and you

1023
00:35:40,128 --> 00:35:42,409
don't like IDEs, you can use co-pilot

1024
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:43,280
in your CLI.

1025
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:46,128
Uh, we have plan mode and BS

1026
00:35:46,128 --> 00:35:48,398
code. Uh, we've got the GetUp MCP

1027
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:51,019
registry. Anyone using MCP servers?

1028
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,050
Anyone having a trouble securing

1029
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,168
which MCP servers your teams can

1030
00:35:56,168 --> 00:35:58,208
use? OK, yeah, so we've got the MCP

1031
00:35:58,208 --> 00:35:58,918
registry.

1032
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,739
We're on the, uh,

1033
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,750
We're on the steering committee for

1034
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,989
the MCP protocol, uh, so some of our

1035
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:08,030
engineers work very closely with Anthropic to help

1036
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,329
evolve that spec,

1037
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,860
and uh we work, we think MCP

1038
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,909
is a really important part of this future, so we've got

1039
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:15,409
a lot of goodness around MCP

1040
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:17,869
and MCP registries and whitelisting

1041
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:19,949
servers and compliance and all of the good things

1042
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:20,929
that enterprises want.

1043
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:23,648
Uh, we also have co-pilot for Slack and Teams,

1044
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:25,750
and for Azure boards and Linear if you're

1045
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,530
using those tools for workout and tracking.

1046
00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:30,539
So this might be a little bit difficult to see, but I

1047
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:32,938
actually took the screenshot from a thread

1048
00:36:32,938 --> 00:36:34,039
internally where

1049
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,760
uh one of our Devrell advocates

1050
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,840
had asked a question about configuration

1051
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,929
for coding agent,

1052
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:42,458
and he was like, well, the docs say

1053
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,780
I can do this, but I'm struggling to do it. And

1054
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,820
Tim, who's the uh product manager

1055
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,789
for coding agent,

1056
00:36:48,378 --> 00:36:50,418
responded in the thread to say, oh, actually no, that's

1057
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:52,619
a typo or a mistake in our docs

1058
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,739
file. And then he said, at GitHub

1059
00:36:54,739 --> 00:36:57,320
co-pilot, go and fix this doc.

1060
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,119
And that invoked co-pilot coding agent,

1061
00:37:00,128 --> 00:37:02,438
which grabbed the thread, so it had all the context,

1062
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:04,969
created a pull request, and you can see

1063
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:07,030
the green button about three quarters of the way down

1064
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:09,789
that says go and view this PR. And so

1065
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:12,119
all Tim had to do was go and view PR, do

1066
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:12,760
the review,

1067
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,610
and it was fixed. So, we're enabling

1068
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,619
co-pilot coding agent from wherever you're working, be

1069
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:19,489
that Slack or Teams or Mobile.

1070
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,369
Uh, this morning, I had a workflow

1071
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:24,389
that I've been using for some internal automation,

1072
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:26,429
and I was getting spammed because that's on a

1073
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:28,530
schedule that every 15 minutes it runs.

1074
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,300
And I made an update

1075
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,898
and didn't test it thoroughly, bad me.

1076
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:35,199
Uh, but I was getting spammed because every 15

1077
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,320
minutes, the workflow was failing and I was getting an

1078
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,639
email. And so while I was walking

1079
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:42,099
over here this morning, I opened up my mobile

1080
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:44,438
and I copied the uh error from the

1081
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,918
workflow run, and I put it

1082
00:37:46,918 --> 00:37:48,958
into coding agent to say, coding agent, here's

1083
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:50,719
the error I'm getting, go and fix the workflow.

1084
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,139
By the time I got here, I went to Starbucks

1085
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:55,489
to have a cup of coffee, and as I was sipping

1086
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:57,619
my coffee at Starbucks, I opened up the

1087
00:37:57,619 --> 00:37:59,789
pull request, saw that it had fixed it, merged

1088
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:01,800
it in, and now I no longer have any spam

1089
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:04,099
from a failing workflow, because coding agent fixed

1090
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:04,719
it for me

1091
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,260
while I was going over to the Mandalay

1092
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,559
Bay. That's what we're trying to enable,

1093
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,519
is anywhere you wanna work,

1094
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:13,449
anywhere you wanna get results,

1095
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,659
we want to enable that with coding agent.

1096
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,090
Alright, so, but we also want to ship code that

1097
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,128
lasts. It doesn't help if we create code

1098
00:38:21,128 --> 00:38:23,208
and you don't trust that code. So what we're doing is

1099
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:25,320
we're integrating GitHub Advanced Security, which is

1100
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,969
our app sec.

1101
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:29,320
Tooling suite into coding agents. So

1102
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,369
every time coding agent is working on a PR

1103
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:32,269
it's going to run,

1104
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:35,050
uh, tests. It's gonna make sure that the tests pass,

1105
00:38:35,128 --> 00:38:37,168
it's going to run uh the

1106
00:38:37,168 --> 00:38:39,418
review cycle, so it'll actually review the code

1107
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:40,469
and get, get,

1108
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,289
uh, get input from the review and then

1109
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:43,949
fix that.

1110
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:46,699
Uh, we're gonna run our codeQL scanning

1111
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,148
tool, which is our SAST tool, our static analysis

1112
00:38:49,148 --> 00:38:49,958
scanning tool.

1113
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:52,010
Uh, we will do secret protection.

1114
00:38:52,378 --> 00:38:54,699
And we will also invoke co-pilot

1115
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,820
Autofix, which is the first agent we actually

1116
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,958
had on our plat on our platform

1117
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,878
that would help you to resolve

1118
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:04,340
security vulnerabilities. So we're building all of

1119
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,079
those security

1120
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:07,539
features into every run of

1121
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:08,648
co-pilot coding agent,

1122
00:39:08,938 --> 00:39:11,179
and also the code review agent.

1123
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,000
So I'll show you what that looks like.

1124
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,590
Uh, and I've mentioned most of these

1125
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,619
before, so I'm just going to skip

1126
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:18,639
this slide.

1127
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:21,280
All right, let's switch over

1128
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:22,579
to a quick demo.

1129
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:25,699
And then I'll see if I've got time for a couple

1130
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:26,510
of questions,

1131
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:27,309
alright.

1132
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:32,329
Let's see, all right.

1133
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,789
So this is that Optoat supply

1134
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:39,949
application. And if I

1135
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:41,289
open this up, this is it running.

1136
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:43,750
So if I click on products and add a product

1137
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,869
to the cart, you can see there's just this little pop-up that

1138
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:47,489
says I've added an item to the cart.

1139
00:39:48,148 --> 00:39:50,148
Uh, and so, let me show

1140
00:39:50,148 --> 00:39:51,849
you the repo where I

1141
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:54,909
created a couple of issues or pull

1142
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:55,530
requests.

1143
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:58,148
Uh, so again, I use planning mode, which I'll

1144
00:39:58,148 --> 00:40:00,228
show in a couple of seconds to go and plan 3 different

1145
00:40:00,228 --> 00:40:02,110
variations of that cart page.

1146
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:04,699
And then each one of those variations I assigned

1147
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:05,469
to co-pilot.

1148
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:07,969
So if we go and click on design C.

1149
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:11,159
This is the pull request from that, and

1150
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,369
you can see a nice summary here of everything that

1151
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,728
was changed and updated. There's the screenshot

1152
00:40:15,728 --> 00:40:17,208
in the body of the PR

1153
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,369
and I can also go all the way down here.

1154
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:23,079
To the full session,

1155
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:25,570
let me see if I can find the session.

1156
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:28,929
Alright, so if I click view session, this is going to take

1157
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:30,289
me to Mission Control.

1158
00:40:30,648 --> 00:40:32,728
Alright, so this is the panel where we'll see the full

1159
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:33,269
log,

1160
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,688
and this includes everything. At the bottom,

1161
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,889
you can see the full summary, but I can see the entire

1162
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:40,128
log, and so I can see exactly what the agent

1163
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:42,250
was thinking as it was running. This first couple of

1164
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,369
steps here are custom setup

1165
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:44,909
steps,

1166
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:47,570
because I have a particular version of Node JS

1167
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,280
and so I want coding agent to use that.

1168
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,688
And so we have a little workflow file that

1169
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:53,688
you can specify to set up the environment

1170
00:40:53,688 --> 00:40:54,429
for coding agent,

1171
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:55,510
and then,

1172
00:40:55,978 --> 00:40:56,800
We can see it

1173
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:59,699
viewing files, right? So it's doing an LS

1174
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:01,878
just to view all the files. When, when we

1175
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:03,679
uh view a

1176
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:06,159
an actual file. Let me see if I can find

1177
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,389
a file, right? When we

1178
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,340
Oh, OK, the path does not exist, alright, this is

1179
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,260
an older repo.

1180
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,289
Uh, but we can see every time it creates a file,

1181
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,760
you can see the diff there

1182
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:18,039
for the file it created. On the right-hand side,

1183
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:20,809
um, you can see all of the files that were changed,

1184
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,938
and you can add comments here. And then this box

1185
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,978
at the bottom here, yeah, this session

1186
00:41:24,978 --> 00:41:26,059
has completed already,

1187
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:27,760
but I could add another.

1188
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,409
Instruction here for agent to go and do additional

1189
00:41:30,409 --> 00:41:32,628
work. If the session was actually running,

1190
00:41:32,918 --> 00:41:34,918
I could add an instruction here mid-stream,

1191
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
all right, so if I see agent starts

1192
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,780
going a little bit

1193
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:40,280
into rabbit holes that I don't want it to

1194
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,989
do, then I can do mid-steering

1195
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:45,119
from this panel over here. And here

1196
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,219
I get to see all of the threads

1197
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,949
that I have queued off for coding agents. So that's mission

1198
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:52,148
control. Uh, let's

1199
00:41:52,148 --> 00:41:54,659
go back to the repo here.

1200
00:41:55,728 --> 00:41:57,530
And I want to click on security.

1201
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:01,639
Because I want to show

1202
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,860
code quality, right? So code quality

1203
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:06,219
is new and at the moment, we have sort of

1204
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:08,300
two pivots for quality. We've got

1205
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,579
um maintainability and

1206
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:11,699
reliability.

1207
00:42:11,978 --> 00:42:14,219
And uh so what we'll do is we, we

1208
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:16,539
do security scanning, but then this is actually

1209
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:19,159
quality scanning. So anyone here using sonarCube.

1210
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,969
Right, so this is kind of what SonoCube does,

1211
00:42:22,128 --> 00:42:24,510
except we're trying to do it a little bit better

1212
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,708
than SonoCbee does.

1213
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,429
All right, and so you can see the, the warnings below

1214
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:30,489
here, and we can create, um, we can

1215
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:32,550
create policies that will block this PR from

1216
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,780
being merged if there are any errors

1217
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,409
in the quality scans.

1218
00:42:36,869 --> 00:42:38,128
But if I open this up,

1219
00:42:38,668 --> 00:42:40,478
uh, let me open up one of these,

1220
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:42,128
one of these alerts.

1221
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:46,409
So let me see if I can click on that.

1222
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:50,840
Not only do we show you the alert, we

1223
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,519
actually invoke the autofix agent

1224
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,559
to go and show the suggested fix.

1225
00:42:55,898 --> 00:42:56,510
All right, so

1226
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,918
in this case it's fairly simple, but there may be

1227
00:42:58,918 --> 00:43:01,050
more complex scenarios where your

1228
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,159
developers don't know how to fix that particular

1229
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:05,280
issue. We use coding agent

1230
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,500
to do that, so I can open a pull request here.

1231
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:10,289
Uh, or I can just assign to co-pilot

1232
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:12,389
that's coming soon, so I can get a co-pilot to go and fix

1233
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,510
this. Um, but if I wanted to generate

1234
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,530
a fix for this particular suggestion, I just

1235
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,530
click that button and the co-pilot would go

1236
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,639
and. Work out what

1237
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,679
a fix would be for that

1238
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:23,378
particular

1239
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,918
uh warning. So that's our quality, that's

1240
00:43:25,918 --> 00:43:26,659
built in.

1241
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:29,280
Uh, let me go over the pull requests here. I'm

1242
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,458
gonna show another pull request here. We had a feature

1243
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:34,079
to add terms of service download, all

1244
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,199
right, so this was a human that implemented

1245
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:36,978
this code,

1246
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:39,458
uh, for this particular pull request.

1247
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:45,340
And uh on the reviewers here, you can

1248
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,340
see that I've assigned co-pilot as one of

1249
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,500
the reviewers, right? So again, you can set a policy

1250
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,539
here that every pull request gets a,

1251
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:52,860
a review automatically

1252
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:54,139
by code review.

1253
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:56,898
Um, but if we scroll down here in

1254
00:43:56,898 --> 00:43:57,840
this, um,

1255
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,519
in this pull request,

1256
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:02,628
You'll see that we get a number of

1257
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:05,039
warnings in line from GitHub Advanced

1258
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:07,280
Security, so that's our security scanning tool.

1259
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:09,728
Right, so it's gonna highlight code where it

1260
00:44:09,728 --> 00:44:12,090
finds a vulnerability, and then it's going to

1261
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,269
give a link to that vulnerability,

1262
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,289
and then the auto fix for how to fix that

1263
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:17,239
vulnerability, right?

1264
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,530
When I was a developer, the only thing I knew about

1265
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,530
security was those were the people that blocked you from

1266
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,329
going to Prague, right? So we don't want that.

1267
00:44:23,648 --> 00:44:25,728
We want developers to be able to fix and do

1268
00:44:25,728 --> 00:44:26,789
the right thing quickly.

1269
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:29,289
And so we have the, the auto-fix

1270
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:30,110
suggestion here.

1271
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,760
And so I could just commit the suggestion if I'm

1272
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,469
happy with that.

1273
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:35,889
All right, so there's some security vulnerabilities

1274
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:37,889
here, and I'll carry on going down. All right,

1275
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:39,188
so we're very thorough.

1276
00:44:39,688 --> 00:44:41,929
All right. And then you'll see that we have the code quality

1277
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,010
scan here. And this time instead of

1278
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,570
showing security vulnerabilities, we're showing quality

1279
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,570
issues again with the autofix

1280
00:44:48,949 --> 00:44:50,869
suggestions that you can just commit in.

1281
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:53,398
And then if I keep going down, you'll see

1282
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:56,039
this is the pull request summary.

1283
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:57,260
So uh when

1284
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:58,619
code review

1285
00:44:58,878 --> 00:45:01,079
agent does its work, it gives you a nice summary

1286
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:03,110
of what it sees the changes are.

1287
00:45:03,438 --> 00:45:05,659
Um, so as a human reviewer, this is great

1288
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:07,679
because it gives me a nice summary of what's going on. I

1289
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:08,800
can make sure that I

1290
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:11,239
am on the same page as code review agent or

1291
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:12,119
vice versa.

1292
00:45:12,438 --> 00:45:14,739
There's even a summary per file here.

1293
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:17,789
Uh, and then again there's autofi

1294
00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:19,849
suggestions for every time co-pilot

1295
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:20,458
code review has a suggestion,

1296
00:45:21,728 --> 00:45:24,090
it's going to make a suggestion as well. So

1297
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,349
you kind of get all of that

1298
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:28,050
enabled either per repo or

1299
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,119
at the org level for all your repos.

1300
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:32,889
So we wanna enable security and quality

1301
00:45:32,889 --> 00:45:34,228
at scale.

1302
00:45:35,289 --> 00:45:37,648
Um, let me see if there's any

1303
00:45:37,648 --> 00:45:39,889
other demos I wanna do. Alright, so

1304
00:45:39,889 --> 00:45:41,889
I'll show you here, if I go back to

1305
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:43,349
the code repo here.

1306
00:45:45,389 --> 00:45:47,478
Or to the code page on the repo,

1307
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:49,869
you'll see this little panel here where I can either

1308
00:45:49,869 --> 00:45:50,648
chat with

1309
00:45:50,909 --> 00:45:52,989
co-pilot across this repo. So say I'm a

1310
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:54,929
new developer and I'm trying to find out

1311
00:45:55,228 --> 00:45:56,449
how is this, uh,

1312
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:59,070
how is this repo laid out, right? I might wanna

1313
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,570
just open up a chat session, but then there's also

1314
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:04,050
this agents panel, and if I open up that,

1315
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:06,349
this is where I can enter in a task.

1316
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:08,750
I want a new feature, I want the download,

1317
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:11,090
the, the cart page or whatever it is.

1318
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:13,909
And you'll also see that there are custom agents

1319
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:16,030
here. If I click on this, you can see that

1320
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:18,179
there's a number of custom agents. These are just markdown

1321
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:20,188
files that live either at the repo or

1322
00:46:20,188 --> 00:46:21,250
at the, a special

1323
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:23,769
GitHub private repo at the org level.

1324
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,128
Uh, and you can see I've got TDD for example.

1325
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:29,309
Um, so I can do test-driven development

1326
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:31,590
here. Um, I've got a TDD planner to

1327
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,610
plan out the scenarios. I've got TDD

1328
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:36,070
red to go and write the failing test, and I've got TDD

1329
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:38,228
green. To go and implement the code until

1330
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,309
all the tests are passing, right, so those are the kinds of

1331
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:40,909
things that

1332
00:46:41,228 --> 00:46:43,389
we can do. I've got a research bot

1333
00:46:43,389 --> 00:46:45,389
there so I can use that to do research,

1334
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:46,550
etc. alright.

1335
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:49,530
I wanted to show a planning agent here.

1336
00:46:50,789 --> 00:46:52,760
So let me grab this.

1337
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:56,050
Alright, so I'm gonna again use the cart page

1338
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,250
and I've got the text there for how I want the cart

1339
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,409
page to look. I'm gonna drag an image

1340
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:02,809
in here because this model actually

1341
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:03,510
supports

1342
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:04,989
uh vision.

1343
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,938
Uh, so let me go through

1344
00:47:07,938 --> 00:47:09,199
docs, design.

1345
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,780
Here's the cart page, that's what I want it to look like.

1346
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,059
A designer might have given that to me, so I'm gonna just drag

1347
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:14,619
that in.

1348
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:17,128
I'm using Claude Opus 4.5, but

1349
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:19,289
in the model picker you'll see all of the models that

1350
00:47:19,289 --> 00:47:21,398
we give you access to,

1351
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:23,570
or that your admin has enabled, I should say.

1352
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:25,849
But I'm using Claude Opus 4.5, which is a

1353
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:26,829
really cool model.

1354
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,369
And uh here under agent, you can see

1355
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:31,438
there's different modes here. These are these custom

1356
00:47:31,438 --> 00:47:32,599
modes that I created.

1357
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:35,079
And then out of the box, we have agent, plan, ask,

1358
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:37,188
and edit. So I'll just put this into plan mode.

1359
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,769
And I'm gonna get co-pilot to help

1360
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:41,389
me plan out this feature.

1361
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:44,090
You notice that I didn't give it, uh, instructions

1362
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,250
about where I want the cart to be stored.

1363
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:48,869
Do I want an API for that? Do I want to use local storage?

1364
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:50,969
These are the kinds of things that I would expect a

1365
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:53,000
planning agent to come back with, to say,

1366
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:55,449
all right, I see what you're trying to do, but have you thought

1367
00:47:55,449 --> 00:47:56,469
about X and Y?

1368
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,849
And uh it will do that. It'll take a couple of

1369
00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:00,789
seconds for that to run while that's going.

1370
00:48:01,909 --> 00:48:04,228
I wanted to actually hit this configure custom agents

1371
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:06,269
button, and right at the bottom here, you

1372
00:48:06,269 --> 00:48:08,349
can actually see we have the plan mode there. If

1373
00:48:08,349 --> 00:48:09,099
I click on that,

1374
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,628
this will give you the markdown file. So this is

1375
00:48:11,628 --> 00:48:13,829
the markdown file that ships with Visual Studio

1376
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:15,829
code for plan mode. So plan mode is

1377
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:17,949
just a custom agent that's defined

1378
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:19,119
by a markdown file.

1379
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,469
So you can go and look at that. If you do

1380
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:23,668
something different for your planning, you can customize

1381
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:25,789
that so you have a custom planning

1382
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:26,340
mode

1383
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,849
for co-pilot.

1384
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,478
Uh, and so you see co-pilot is reading

1385
00:48:30,478 --> 00:48:32,478
a bunch of files and understanding what's going

1386
00:48:32,478 --> 00:48:34,300
on in the repository

1387
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:37,469
before it starts asking me clarifying

1388
00:48:37,469 --> 00:48:38,070
questions.

1389
00:48:38,478 --> 00:48:41,000
And then you'll see these handoffs here where

1390
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,159
the handoffs, it's gonna give me two

1391
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:44,860
buttons, either start implementation

1392
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:47,719
or open an editor, if I wanna actually

1393
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:49,800
capture the plan in a markdown

1394
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,000
file, it'll put two buttons at the bottom of that.

1395
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,398
Those are called handoffs. Again, you can use that to make

1396
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:56,438
your own custom modes. I did that for the,

1397
00:48:56,829 --> 00:48:58,949
TDD where after you've done TDD

1398
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:01,099
planning, there's a button to say TDD red, and

1399
00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:03,389
after you run TDD red, there's a button that says TDD

1400
00:49:03,389 --> 00:49:05,869
green, so you can kind of start guiding your developers

1401
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:08,269
along these agentic workflows.

1402
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:12,070
Well, at least Opus is thorough. It's reading

1403
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,010
every file in that repo.

1404
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:15,148
All right.

1405
00:49:15,668 --> 00:49:17,750
Let's see what else. OK, I wanted to actually show

1406
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:18,849
this panel here.

1407
00:49:20,188 --> 00:49:22,840
Uh, so if I click on this panel, you'll see that I have chat

1408
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,918
history here. So these are all the chat sessions that

1409
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:26,949
I had on the right-hand side. I've got all the

1410
00:49:26,949 --> 00:49:29,148
cloud sessions here, because I can actually

1411
00:49:29,148 --> 00:49:31,280
dispatch this to cloud using the little cloud

1412
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,280
icon here, that'll go to coding agent

1413
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,199
in the repo.

1414
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,840
Down here I've got CLI, right, so if I

1415
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,000
actually start a new agent session in the

1416
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:39,510
terminal,

1417
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:41,878
this will open the terminal with the really

1418
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:42,878
cool animation.

1419
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:45,219
For a co-pilot,

1420
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:48,559
right, let's see that again, it's just so cool.

1421
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:51,320
Uh, I'll do it one more time. So we're gonna open up

1422
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,889
multiple CLI sessions.

1423
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,300
Here it comes. Alright, there's co-pilot. All right.

1424
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:57,610
So once it's up there, this is co-pilot

1425
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:59,760
in the CLI. So for those of you that like

1426
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,809
using clawed code, this should feel very

1427
00:50:01,809 --> 00:50:04,199
familiar to you. It's a terminal interface

1428
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:05,188
onto co-pilot.

1429
00:50:05,489 --> 00:50:07,489
And then I could give it instructions to

1430
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:09,570
go and do tasks, and if I have multiple

1431
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,280
of those in flight at the same time,

1432
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,610
we can track all of my CLI sessions here.

1433
00:50:13,688 --> 00:50:15,728
So this is kind of mission control view

1434
00:50:15,728 --> 00:50:16,909
inside of Visual Studio code,

1435
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:18,688
kind of similar to what we had.

1436
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:21,208
In Mission Control in the web.

1437
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,909
All right, and so you see here, um

1438
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:26,489
we've got the plan here. I'm not gonna read all of this, but

1439
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:28,688
there might be some questions here. Further considerations.

1440
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,860
Do you want a coupon system? What authentication?

1441
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:32,889
Do you need to be authenticated to add items to the

1442
00:50:32,889 --> 00:50:35,000
cart? Right, so plan mode will help me

1443
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,610
do that. I can either just hit start implementation

1444
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,610
here, or I can start iterating, or if I hit

1445
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,668
open an editor, I think this will create,

1446
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:44,030
A markdown file for me, so if anyone's

1447
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,219
doing spec-driven development, you could actually

1448
00:50:46,219 --> 00:50:48,168
save that markdown file into the repo,

1449
00:50:48,469 --> 00:50:50,469
so you kind of have a history of your planning

1450
00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:51,909
and the decisions that you've made.

1451
00:50:52,668 --> 00:50:54,949
Alright, so I am gonna pause there for

1452
00:50:54,949 --> 00:50:56,989
questions. I, I hope I've given you a kind of a, a

1453
00:50:56,989 --> 00:50:59,159
good high-level idea of what we're trying to build with

1454
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:00,418
a couple of demos in there.

1455
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:03,079
Uh, there's so much goodness in co-pilot, so

1456
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:05,159
I encourage you to look at the change log. Uh, there

1457
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:06,510
is a filter for co-pilot,

1458
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,840
uh, cos there's a lot of stuff coming out. Uh,

1459
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:11,280
but thank you for your time. I'll take a couple of

1460
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,280
questions. Anyone, OK, someone's got a

1461
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,179
question there. You're gonna have to shout, and then I'll repeat it.

1462
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,519
horse. Uh,

1463
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:23,719
OK, so I kind of caught the first half of that. There's

1464
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:24,389
a microphone there,

1465
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:26,849
yeah. Yeah,

1466
00:51:26,929 --> 00:51:28,929
where do you see the future of co-pilot

1467
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:31,070
given that Kira is being so heavily pushed?

1468
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,869
Well, I, um

1469
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:34,969
Uh, that, so the.

1470
00:51:36,989 --> 00:51:39,320
We, we had coding agent, uh,

1471
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:40,530
6 months ago.

1472
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,188
Quiro's just come out with the autonomous

1473
00:51:43,188 --> 00:51:45,110
agent. Um,

1474
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,550
there's a DevOps agent for in

1475
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,780
Azure and AWS now.

1476
00:51:50,228 --> 00:51:52,510
Azure's had one on the, on the Microsoft

1477
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,590
side, uh, again, since May of this year.

1478
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:56,889
So, yeah, I, I think, um,

1479
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:59,429
I think it's gonna be interesting to see how they

1480
00:51:59,429 --> 00:52:01,429
develop and where their strengths are. Again, we

1481
00:52:01,429 --> 00:52:03,208
think agents are gonna be a commodity.

1482
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:04,219
So if

1483
00:52:04,699 --> 00:52:06,898
we don't have Quiro integration yet, but

1484
00:52:06,898 --> 00:52:09,000
I could see that on the roadmap at some point

1485
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,219
that if you wanted to use Quiro as the agent for

1486
00:52:11,219 --> 00:52:13,269
doing whatever work, we would just integrate

1487
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:14,539
that in. We really think that

1488
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:17,260
the agents are commodities. What we're trying to build

1489
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,458
is that end to end platform that

1490
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:21,510
supports agentic autonomous work.

1491
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:24,119
Again, we'll have to see how that exactly plays out,

1492
00:52:24,938 --> 00:52:26,978
but we're not particularly concerned

1493
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:29,199
about that. Again, we, we see the agents as

1494
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,239
commodity.

1495
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:34,000
Alright, any other questions? Yes, there's one here.

1496
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:36,168
What model

1497
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:40,978
Do Advice

1498
00:52:40,978 --> 00:52:43,599
on instructions

1499
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:45,648
for it. Because what the developers have noticed

1500
00:52:45,648 --> 00:52:47,719
is if you add a bunch of instructions to a repo,

1501
00:52:49,289 --> 00:52:51,329
Yep. All

1502
00:52:51,329 --> 00:52:53,570
right, so, the question is, what model

1503
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,648
does Co-Pilott code review use? Uh,

1504
00:52:55,728 --> 00:52:58,090
that depends on your policies. So we will

1505
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:00,929
try, um, Claude Sonnet 45.

1506
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:03,478
If you have not allowed 45,

1507
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:05,668
we will fall back to Sonnet 4.

1508
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:09,239
we are working on model choice for

1509
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:11,519
both code review and coding agents, because

1510
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:13,809
at the moment, those are fixed pretty much

1511
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:16,329
between uh Sonnet 45 and

1512
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,289
GPD 5

1513
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,769
are the models that we use for code review and coding

1514
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:21,820
agent. But again, we're, we're, you

1515
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,860
will see in the next couple of months that there will be a

1516
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,898
model picker, so that you can pick which model you

1517
00:53:25,898 --> 00:53:27,570
want for those experiences.

1518
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,539
Uh, the instructions files,

1519
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,938
um, you can put them.

1520
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:33,989
I, what I do for my instructions files is

1521
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:36,708
in the GitHub co-pilot instructions

1522
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:37,728
MD file.

1523
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:40,550
Uh, I typically put review guidance at

1524
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,668
the top of that file. So I have

1525
00:53:42,668 --> 00:53:45,148
general review guidance for the entire repo

1526
00:53:45,148 --> 00:53:47,309
here. And then you can also,

1527
00:53:47,389 --> 00:53:48,688
in the instructions

1528
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,228
file here, you, this, uh, particular repo

1529
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,579
has an API, a database, and a front-end.

1530
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,208
And so I've split out.

1531
00:53:55,719 --> 00:53:58,219
Particular instructions for those three portions

1532
00:53:58,219 --> 00:54:00,269
of that code base and so

1533
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:02,269
API here you can see the apply to has

1534
00:54:02,269 --> 00:54:03,039
a glob

1535
00:54:03,438 --> 00:54:05,760
where I'm saying if there are changes in

1536
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,969
this set of folders,

1537
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,398
then use these instructions and again

1538
00:54:10,398 --> 00:54:12,719
I've got specific review instructions

1539
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:14,840
for the API at

1540
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,043
the top there but again. I think this is something

1541
00:54:17,043 --> 00:54:19,224
that it doesn't matter what agent you're using.

1542
00:54:19,543 --> 00:54:21,635
This is a challenge is figuring out

1543
00:54:21,635 --> 00:54:23,985
how much or how little your instructions

1544
00:54:23,985 --> 00:54:26,144
need to be in order to get good results.

1545
00:54:26,204 --> 00:54:27,574
If you give it too much,

1546
00:54:28,054 --> 00:54:30,063
that can confuse the model. If you give it too little,

1547
00:54:30,144 --> 00:54:32,583
it does its own thing. So I think

1548
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:34,583
this is just going to be something that's a challenge

1549
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:36,635
no matter what agent or model you're using.

1550
00:54:37,184 --> 00:54:39,253
But we're hoping that we at least are giving you some of the

1551
00:54:39,253 --> 00:54:41,264
mechanisms that you need to start separating

1552
00:54:41,264 --> 00:54:43,344
out instructions for different portions

1553
00:54:43,344 --> 00:54:44,844
of your repo to get better.

1554
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:47,389
Uh, instructions there. The other thing

1555
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:49,039
which you'll see in the plan mode.

1556
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,570
If I can find that is.

1557
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:55,659
Something called, uh,

1558
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:56,619
did I close it?

1559
00:54:57,019 --> 00:54:58,659
Called run sub agent.

1560
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,159
So configure custom agents, let's go to plan.

1561
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:04,438
Uh, down here, you can see

1562
00:55:04,438 --> 00:55:06,510
that we actually do, uh, what's

1563
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:07,760
called a sub-agent,

1564
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,599
right, where sometimes you want the agent to do some

1565
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:13,019
research, but you don't wanna clutter the entire

1566
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:15,369
conversation with all of that research. You want it to go and do its

1567
00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:17,599
research, iterate, and then just come back with the final

1568
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,679
result. That's what the sub-agent does, it kind of

1569
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:20,789
starts a new thread,

1570
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:23,199
keeps all the context in that thread,

1571
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:24,918
and just comes back with the final result.

1572
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:27,300
So I think over time you'll see things like

1573
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,139
code review.

1574
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:31,139
Um, become better as we enable

1575
00:55:31,139 --> 00:55:33,539
sub-agents, because you're not gonna have the context

1576
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:35,619
being blown out by the first couple of lines

1577
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:36,280
of code.

1578
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:38,699
Uh, we'll get better at managing that context

1579
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:40,329
through things like the sub-agent tool.

1580
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:41,260
Great question.

1581
00:55:42,188 --> 00:55:44,438
Alright, I think I've got time for maybe 1

1582
00:55:44,438 --> 00:55:46,438
or 2 more. Yep, there's 1 over there.

1583
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:47,500
There's a microphone just behind you.

1584
00:55:49,978 --> 00:55:52,079
Um, yeah, is there a way to get it to work

1585
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,570
across multiple repos,

1586
00:55:54,739 --> 00:55:56,820
not just one repo at a time? Yeah,

1587
00:55:56,929 --> 00:55:58,978
I wish you hadn't asked that question. That's a great

1588
00:55:58,978 --> 00:55:59,719
question. Uh,

1589
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,500
again, like this is something I keep bugging our, our

1590
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,500
team about. Um,

1591
00:56:04,378 --> 00:56:06,500
the GitHub GitHub repo is a mono repo,

1592
00:56:06,579 --> 00:56:08,780
so our engineering team is used to working on a giant

1593
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:09,559
mono repo.

1594
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:12,208
I keep telling them that there are other companies that work

1595
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:12,909
differently,

1596
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,449
um, but that's something that again I think will,

1597
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:16,429
will certainly come

1598
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:19,289
as we iterate mission control. I think that will be

1599
00:56:19,289 --> 00:56:21,289
the surface where you'll see it. So you'll see something

1600
00:56:21,289 --> 00:56:23,340
like what Quiro does where you can

1601
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,610
put in 5 or 10 repos and have

1602
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,030
it do work across those.

1603
00:56:27,809 --> 00:56:29,909
Um, so we'll, we'll, we'll get there. We're trying to figure

1604
00:56:29,909 --> 00:56:31,949
out what exactly the right interface

1605
00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:34,208
and user experience is for that.

1606
00:56:34,878 --> 00:56:36,958
Great question. Thanks for making

1607
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:37,579
it hard.

1608
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:39,878
Alright,

1609
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:42,000
one more question, yes,

1610
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,500
there you go, there's a microphone,

1611
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,119
thank you E-Rod.

1612
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:48,550
So I find myself enjoying the

1613
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,628
uh inline suggestions. I kind of get

1614
00:56:50,628 --> 00:56:52,708
to review and scrutinize as

1615
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:55,070
I go. How do you as a developer choose

1616
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:57,309
between. Doing prompt engineering

1617
00:56:57,309 --> 00:56:58,250
versus

1618
00:56:58,628 --> 00:56:59,628
taking those in lines.

1619
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:02,309
That is a great question. All right. So I've, I've

1620
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:04,309
found, uh, the more, the more I meet

1621
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:06,179
with customers over this, uh,

1622
00:57:06,469 --> 00:57:08,550
the more I realized this is less about the models and

1623
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,019
the technology and more about the change management,

1624
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:13,469
uh, and the training and the enablement, uh,

1625
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,628
just like any tool or technology, you can't

1626
00:57:15,628 --> 00:57:17,789
just give it to a developer and get good results.

1627
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:19,969
You need to actually spend time investing in

1628
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,648
Uh, new muscle memory, new ways of thinking,

1629
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,250
um, I, I think we, we

1630
00:57:25,389 --> 00:57:27,500
wanna enable whatever experience the

1631
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,708
developer wants. There's some developers that really want

1632
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:31,708
that. I wanna be in a code file

1633
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:34,309
and I wanna be writing code and I wanna get the suggestions

1634
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:35,300
just for that code.

1635
00:57:35,628 --> 00:57:37,688
There are other developers that are like, I don't really care.

1636
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,070
I'm gonna describe what I want and I want co-pilot

1637
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:40,938
to give me results.

1638
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:42,530
Um, we're trying to enable

1639
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:45,148
whichever design or the

1640
00:57:45,148 --> 00:57:46,688
coding experience you prefer,

1641
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:49,438
um. I think we're, we're

1642
00:57:49,438 --> 00:57:51,599
probably investing more in the autonomous

1643
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,679
agent side of things because we just

1644
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,418
see that scaling a lot more,

1645
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,878
um, because of the shift from synchronous

1646
00:57:57,878 --> 00:57:59,918
single player, which is the code completion

1647
00:57:59,918 --> 00:58:01,500
experience, into that

1648
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,000
I've got a set of tasks and I want co-pilot

1649
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
to work on all of them at the same time. So I think

1650
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,628
we're leaning a little bit more to that,

1651
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,478
but we're not gonna leave the uh the code completion

1652
00:58:10,478 --> 00:58:11,179
experience behind.

1653
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:12,668
Again, we think that's

1654
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,000
more or less preference. I use a bit of

1655
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,489
both. I'm probably like 90% agent mode

1656
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:19,519
and coding agent and about 10%

1657
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,369
code completion.

1658
00:58:20,728 --> 00:58:22,668
Again, that's gonna vary depending on your style.

1659
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:24,590
Yep, good question.

1660
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:28,360
Alright, well, I'll, I'll stick around for another

1661
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,360
minute or two, but thank you very much. Enjoy

1662
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,639
the rest of the conference and safe travels. Alright,

1663
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:33,219
thank you.
