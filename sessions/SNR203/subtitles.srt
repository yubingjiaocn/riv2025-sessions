1
00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:04,162
(air susurrating)

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:09,756
(airplane engine whirring)

3
00:00:11,473 --> 00:00:12,690
(airplane dings)

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,613
- [Board Member] What's our AI strategy?

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,380
(airplane dings)

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,220
- I want efficient

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,143
customer service.
- I want faster

8
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:28,530
accounts payable.
- I want automated

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,773
customer onboarding.
- I want agentic coding.

10
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:34,200
(airplane dings)

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,030
- [Board Member] The board
wants an update on our view

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,910
and plans for impact of
quantum on our business

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,473
for the board meeting tomorrow.

14
00:00:44,437 --> 00:00:47,437
(lightning rumbles)

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,150
- Show of hands, how many of you felt like

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,283
that pilot in that scene we just saw?

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,170
Right.

18
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,940
So as a former CIO,

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,760
it's been more than a few
times that my CEO has walked

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,320
into the room asking, "Hey, Arvind,

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,840
what's going on with this new technology?"

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,250
And in that instant,

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,530
I shift from being a trusted advisor

24
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,780
to a scrambling researcher.

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,950
And now at AWS,

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,980
as we talk to more and
more customers and CIOs,

27
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,620
this pattern is repeating
more and more often.

28
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,870
The reasons are very clear.

29
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,360
Over the last 25 years,

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,270
a range of technologies
have completely transformed

31
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,270
how industries in every
sector of the industry

32
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,710
and every function have
been transformed more

33
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,570
and more by technology.

34
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,330
And this is only accelerating.

35
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,420
Powered by a combination of technologies

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,530
that are accelerating and
creating more and more impact,

37
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,390
whether it's AI or
robotics or biotechnology,

38
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,060
the cool thing really
is that it's not just

39
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,390
that these technologies are
accelerating independently

40
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,930
in isolation, but they're
actually feeding into each other,

41
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,760
creating a exponential impact
that's accelerating impact

42
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,533
for businesses as well.

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,150
And the interesting
thing is that, of course,

44
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,300
this is not just something
which is hidden somewhere.

45
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,790
The media's talking about it,
vendors are talking about it.

46
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,740
There are industry events,

47
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,100
and your business leaders
are going into those events

48
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,680
and learning about it
there and they're wondering

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,870
why they're not hearing this internally

50
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,210
in your own organizations.

51
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,323
And this is a major challenge
that we've got to overcome.

52
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,620
Now the real challenge is that
it's not that our core work

53
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,680
of technology delivery is
getting any easier, right?

54
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,870
Our work is getting
more and more critical,

55
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,790
more and more central to the business,

56
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,680
and delivering excellence is
absolutely non-negotiable.

57
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,210
But at the same time,

58
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,300
the technology leaders
are also being expected

59
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,140
to be the innovation
champions, the scouts,

60
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,430
the people who bring in and
reshape existing organizations

61
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,530
to be more modern and digital.

62
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,730
This dual mandate is making
things more and more complex

63
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,413
for our roles.

64
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,890
Now I was a CIO about,

65
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,840
I joined AWS a year and a half ago.

66
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,200
Before that, I was a CIO for
Kellogg's based in Singapore,

67
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,450
and before that, with Prudential Insurance

68
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,920
and Procter & Gamble.

69
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,720
And over the last 10, 15 years,

70
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,150
I've seen this pattern
repeat again and again

71
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,260
where business leaders are getting more

72
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,880
and more interested in technology.

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,180
And the way I've responded to
that is I've leaned into it

74
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,450
and created a network of people around me

75
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,630
in the technology
organization and in business

76
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,413
that I used to call the digital kampung.

77
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:53,460
Kampung is a Malay word.

78
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,390
I live in Singapore,

79
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,883
so Malay is a language that's used there.

80
00:03:57,774 --> 00:04:00,000
Kampung is a Malay word for village.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,720
And this is a situation
where you want people

82
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,153
to come together to
address this challenge.

83
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,400
What I did is worked with
enthusiasts who are keen

84
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,370
to learn new technology, had
that learning culture in them,

85
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,440
and worked with them to
do a lot of experiments

86
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,927
to test out new and emerging technologies.

87
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:22,980
10, 15 years ago, a lot of
this stuff was very new.

88
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,240
So one of the first things you see

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,000
on the top left is we built Alexa skills.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,860
Amazon had just launched
Alexa then to figure out

91
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,133
how consumers would
engage with voice systems.

92
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,130
We built IoT sensors

93
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,590
that help manufacturing teams figure out

94
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,020
how automation can be accelerated,

95
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,520
and a number of other such things

96
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,646
over time did more and more of this,

97
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:48,646
eventually including the
families of some of our employees

98
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,360
because nothing gets people excited more

99
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,330
than having their kids learn
new technology as well.

100
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,210
So there were a number of
learnings I personally had

101
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,470
that we will share about this now,

102
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,550
and now I'll invite Tom

103
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,700
to share his background on this space.

104
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,540
- Thank you, Arvind.

105
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,010
My name is Tom Soderstrom,

106
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,890
and I was NASA's first CTO

107
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,050
at NASA Jet Proportion Laboratory.

108
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,810
And the slide

109
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,690
that you see here was the attempt

110
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,730
at how can we spend less money on IT

111
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,680
and more on science and engineering.

112
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,710
And we looked at cloud
computing as one of the answers,

113
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,180
and yes, it worked.

114
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,170
And you can see the journey
here from 2008 and beyond,

115
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,610
and the idea was that
if we could use cloud

116
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,030
and AWS saw a business for it,

117
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,160
then they would build it
and we would help launch it.

118
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,720
That's how we came up with so many

119
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,000
of the services that you today use.

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,510
So the secret here for you
all is if you are interested

121
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,790
in something that AWS is interested in,

122
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,430
you have an extremely strong voice,

123
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,950
not just for what is
built but how it's built.

124
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,070
So, and of course, we're gonna
talk about some trends here.

125
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,990
I was the futurist at Jet
Proportion Laboratory as the CTO.

126
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,040
And who in here considers
themself their responsibility

127
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,570
to keep understanding

128
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,490
what the technology landscape looks like?

129
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,800
Show of hands. Oh, good, good.

130
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,330
Then we have a gift for you

131
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,703
'cause it's a damn hard job, honestly.

132
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,870
So what we did is it
was fun to hear you talk

133
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,570
about (stammers) or Alexa.

134
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,270
She's not listening, is she? (laughs)

135
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,850
Because one of the first things we saw is

136
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,640
when we came up with
GovCloud, and AWS built it,

137
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,770
it created psychological safety

138
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,890
for people to innovate
in all kinds of ways.

139
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,350
Have you ever heard of
a two-way door decision?

140
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,470
That is the way of using the cloud.

141
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,350
So we created the first NASA Alexa app,

142
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,880
and it's called NASA Mars.

143
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,560
So it still runs.

144
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,250
But this is about technologies,

145
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,960
and what we're gonna talk about is,

146
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,600
so you have this dual
mandate of figuring out

147
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,460
what are the technologies that are coming,

148
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,180
and at the same time,
keep the plane flying.

149
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,370
So we're gonna have this in two pieces.

150
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,530
We looked at the trends that are coming,

151
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,090
we looked at it manually,

152
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,950
and we're gonna share what they are.

153
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,480
And at the end of this,

154
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,400
I'm gonna ask you to
bring your cell phones up

155
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,600
and see what you care about,

156
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,640
which ones you think are interested.

157
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,070
But then we're going to then show you

158
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,840
how you can do this automatically.

159
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,943
So this will be our gift to you all.

160
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,290
So what are the major technology trends?

161
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,760
You are already looking at it.

162
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,580
And the point is not to predict
what's coming in the world.

163
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,800
The point is to predict for your company,

164
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,940
how will it make you more
productive, more profitable?

165
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,450
How will it save money using
these new technologies?

166
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,860
In fact, if you build it, they
will come if you guess right.

167
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,440
Or if you don't wanna build it,

168
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,790
then somebody else will build it,

169
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,130
and that's what we how we worked at NASA.

170
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,630
So when you are looking at
the future and you are wrong,

171
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,430
it's easy to be ridiculed,

172
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,100
and you can see some
of these fun ones here.

173
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,130
I'm very happy that he was
wrong about the airplane,

174
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,430
otherwise we'd be speaking
to a very empty room.

175
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,580
So if you predict right,

176
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,740
you can get a first mover advantage,

177
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,270
you can excite your people to participate,

178
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,080
you can impact the creators
of what's being built

179
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,320
and you can also get a
first mover advantage,

180
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,590
or you can detect very
early that you're way off

181
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,333
and this trend doesn't matter.

182
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,200
So now we'll go a little
deeper into each of these,

183
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,053
but these are the eight that
we saw were interesting,

184
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,700
and two of them are more
questionable than the others.

185
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,650
And I think you can guess
which ones they are,

186
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,360
but we'll find out.

187
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,020
So cloud and generative
AI belong together.

188
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,690
You really cannot be
successful in generative

189
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,850
or agentic AI without using the cloud.

190
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,370
It just needs that much horsepower.

191
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,470
In 2020, we were experimenting.

192
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,420
We were trying to see what we could do

193
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,180
with generative AI and beyond.

194
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,860
In 2025, we're generating
ROI, return on investment,

195
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,693
or are we?

196
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,770
With a show of hands,

197
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:12,390
how many people here have in
production a generative AI

198
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,340
that is generating an ROI?

199
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,160
Raise your hands very proudly if you do.

200
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,513
Okay, it looks to be about 5%.

201
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,360
All right, what about agentic AI?

202
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,563
Do you have something in production?

203
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,160
One person, two, three, four.

204
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,350
I feel like a salesman here.
(audience laughing)

205
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,853
Is it generating ROI?

206
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,120
Next year when we ask the same question,

207
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,440
a lot of hands will go up.

208
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,270
That's the nature of these technologies,

209
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,383
and $15.7 trillion estimate,
that's a big number.

210
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,220
And new jobs that'll be created.

211
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,460
We think about AI stealing
our jobs, et cetera.

212
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,310
It's actually going to create new jobs,

213
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,100
and your opportunity
is to create those jobs

214
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,400
and staff them with your own
people to see if they pay out.

215
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,740
If they do, you are way ahead of the game.

216
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,820
And if you're right,

217
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,120
then you couldn't afford to
hire those people later anyway.

218
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,550
So it's a good way to just brainstorm

219
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,100
what are the new roles that will come.

220
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,933
Now when we think about it,

221
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:17,550
Arvind and I thought
about this long and hard,

222
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,460
what is AI in real?

223
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,530
So remember hailing a taxi.

224
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,330
Actually, is there anybody from New York?

225
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,680
You probably do that today.

226
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,080
You trusted that they would stop for you.

227
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,010
Then later on,

228
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,620
you trusted that if you
clicked your smartphone,

229
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,020
they would come and get you.

230
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,810
What we're seeing is this judgment is now

231
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,950
that the self-driving car,

232
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,010
you will trust that the car
will get you there safely.

233
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,520
So it's all about judgment.
This happens to be Zoox.

234
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,933
Has anybody been in a Zoox?

235
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,140
They're here in Las
Vegas. It's fun. (laughs)

236
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,760
I highly recommend you do it.

237
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,800
But it's this trust.

238
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,963
And when we look at AI at scale,

239
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,340
anybody use Rufus to help you shop?

240
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,110
It's awesome, ask for a coffee maker

241
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,470
that is easiest to clean, and
it'll give you an example.

242
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,790
The other thing that we don't see

243
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,880
is regular machine
learning is not going away.

244
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,860
For instance, Rufus on the back end,

245
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,000
filters out 275 million fake reviews

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,890
so you don't have to look at them.

247
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,710
It turns out the reviews is
one of the most popular things.

248
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,897
So generative AI, the benefit of this is

249
00:11:22,897 --> 00:11:25,320
that this is working at scale.

250
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,790
So it's AI, it's moving
forward, we're already there.

251
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,770
But what's coming?

252
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,770
It's where AI is becoming
a personal assistant.

253
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,783
It's where the future of education.

254
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,910
Anybody have young
children who ask, "Why,"

255
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,560
over and over and over?

256
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,690
Well, AI doesn't get tired.

257
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,460
AI will engage the student

258
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,430
and it will help them learn
the way they want to do.

259
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,527
Amazon CTO Werner Vogels
said, and I'll quote this,

260
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:58,744
"When you use tool to
engage curiosity instead

261
00:11:58,744 --> 00:12:03,360
of enforcing compliance,
schools bring to life

262
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,190
and that changes everything."

263
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,450
I think that's really key.

264
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,340
And for the teachers,

265
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,430
they can now use generative
AI and agentic AI

266
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,300
for the drudgery, grading
the reports, et cetera.

267
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,140
So it's really about how we use AI.

268
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,330
So you'll hear a lot about
generative AI and agentic AI

269
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,750
at this conference
because it is the future.

270
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,410
If you were through the
cloud evolution like I was,

271
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,500
this is at least as big, if not bigger,

272
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,970
and it's really exciting.

273
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,100
If you went through the cloud evolution,

274
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,050
take those lessons
learned and you can now go

275
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,600
through the agentic revolution.

276
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,430
So productive at the edge.
Anybody heard the word IoT?

277
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,420
You're tired of it. It didn't
pay out, didn't have any ROI.

278
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,010
Well, that's changing

279
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,070
because we have 20 billion devices today.

280
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,680
By 2030, we would have 40 billion devices,

281
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,300
and they will be connected

282
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,790
and they cannot send data all the time.

283
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,740
So what we're gonna see is we're gonna see

284
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,410
that the return on investment

285
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,310
between business outcome
and being productive

286
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,290
at the edge is gonna be key.

287
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,260
Today, we talk about
large language models.

288
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,200
Tomorrow, we're gonna talk
about nano language models

289
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,970
where the AI will run on
the device, better silicon,

290
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,970
smaller models, and it
will create a digital twin.

291
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,780
I'll talk about that in a second.

292
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,510
But what are some people
who are doing this well?

293
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,733
Kone, anybody know who that is?

294
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,450
Anybody ever run an
elevator or an escalator?

295
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,130
They keep the cities running.

296
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,950
They have 30,000 maintenance technicians.

297
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,510
It's a Finnish company.

298
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,560
They go in 80,000 customer calls per day,

299
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,850
and 30,000 customer calls
per month is filtered out

300
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,860
because of agentic AI.

301
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,330
They have everything at their fingertips.

302
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,340
When they go to fix an elevator,

303
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,650
they know the version,
they know the history,

304
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,710
what usually goes wrong, and
they're much more productive.

305
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,010
So IoT at the edge is really powerful.

306
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,710
We also have AI in the jungle.

307
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,420
I just like saying that.

308
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,420
AI in the jungle is Hexagon,
a Swedish Swiss company,

309
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,210
has a subsidiary called R-evolution,

310
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,880
and it's about measuring biodiversity.

311
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,130
So they have a device
that sits in the jungle

312
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,470
and measures biodiversity over time.

313
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,540
It's sitting at the
edge and it reports back

314
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,700
when it has connectivity,

315
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,850
and that's nice because we do
wanna save the environment.

316
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,250
But if you are a mining company
and you want to do a mine,

317
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,360
you have to prove

318
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,210
that you are actually not
disturbing biodiversity.

319
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,540
So there's business reasons for AI

320
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,140
and IoT at the edge.

321
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,420
So we're gonna see these massive digital

322
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,360
scale twins, digital twins.

323
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,910
And what it means is that
they're collecting the data

324
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,930
at the edge, they're reporting
it back into the cloud,

325
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,630
and now you have a copy in the cloud

326
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,530
of what is in the physical space.

327
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,930
So now you can start
doing what-if analysis.

328
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,940
You can inject faulty data

329
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,790
and you can have a conversation

330
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,360
with all of that data in
the digital twin using what?

331
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,293
Generative AI.

332
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,640
Anybody who've been affected by a wildfire

333
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,800
or knows somebody affected by a wildfire?

334
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,190
Yeah, I live in LA, so very affected.

335
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,020
But it's coming faster and faster,

336
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,660
and natural disasters
are coming more and more.

337
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,130
How do you deal with it?

338
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,790
This is where we see the rise
of augmented reality again,

339
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,940
where you can insert people
into a difficult or dangerous

340
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,667
or far remote place without
them having to be there,

341
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:41,010
and they can interact with a digital twin

342
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,430
to see how fast the fire is spreading,

343
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,770
what it detected early.

344
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,550
There's a company here called voxelis.ai,

345
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,220
they're on the third floor
of the Venetian here,

346
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,210
and they have a device that
they put on helicopters,

347
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,360
and now the helicopters can just measure

348
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,310
how is there a fire spot coming up

349
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,580
or in the middle of fighting the fire.

350
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,000
And it's a startup of about 20 people.

351
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,730
And what we're seeing is
we're seeing the benefit

352
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,070
of having startups,
working with governments,

353
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,170
working with universities,

354
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,140
especially on things at the edge and AI.

355
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,610
So if you're in that space,

356
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,563
you are in luck, it's growing fast.

357
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,680
Now they will need access,

358
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,860
and if you've heard of
Kuiper, forget that,

359
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,130
it's called Leo, low Earth orbit,

360
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,790
and that is to be able to
provide internet access

361
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,920
to underserved places in the world.

362
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,780
They're also here at re:Invent,

363
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,060
and I highly recommend
a conversation with them

364
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,600
because it's much cheaper and much faster

365
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,170
and lower latency than anything
we've ever seen before.

366
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,290
Countries can now get back
up too if a fiber was cut

367
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,713
and the devices at the edge
can get internet access.

368
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,260
Three, number three here is
robots and cobots at scale.

369
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,510
What on earth is a cobot?

370
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,740
Collaborative robots.

371
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,830
We're seeing people and
robots working together,

372
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:11,520
and it's $165 billion
market in just a few years.

373
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,660
That's a big number.

374
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,000
All of these have a cumulative,

375
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,390
we picked them because they're
very large dollar amount

376
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,480
and they have a very large
cumulative growth rate,

377
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,250
annual growth rate.

378
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,233
So these robots,

379
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,590
they are amazing.

380
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,480
So they're everywhere,
they're on the moon.

381
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,060
Of course, I care about
that, being from NASA.

382
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,860
But if you think about
something unpleasant

383
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,710
for a second, wars, they're
being fought with drones.

384
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,260
But what we're seeing is we're
seeing much faster adoption

385
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,180
in the civilian space from things

386
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,950
that grew up in the defense space.

387
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,060
We're seeing people who fight
fires use the same technology

388
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,683
that people who fight wars.

389
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,490
Also, we're seeing people actually

390
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,460
form relationship with robots.

391
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,733
If you have a Roomba, raise
your hand if you have a Roomba.

392
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,750
Keep your hand up if you named it.

393
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,600
Half people named their Roomba.

394
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,040
In Sweden where I grew up,
they have automatic lawnmowers.

395
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,800
100% named them, it becomes a pet.

396
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,500
And we find that these robots in hospital,

397
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,530
kids will interact with
them and be much calmer.

398
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,870
Aging people will have a companion

399
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,870
and they need less medicine and less care.

400
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,690
So it really becomes key.

401
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,960
Now for us in Amazon,

402
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,390
if you've been in a fulfillment center,

403
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,250
if you haven't, I highly recommend it.

404
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,070
It's a toy box for robotics.

405
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,610
So if you look at the
person on the top left,

406
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,730
she's stuffing things that you bought,

407
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,610
and the red boxes say don't put it here

408
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,553
because it's close to
something that looks similar.

409
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,430
And so she doesn't have the cognitive load

410
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,170
of having to decide where to pick it.

411
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,760
It saves a lot of time.

412
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,600
On the right is a robot doing
the same thing, augmenting it,

413
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,410
but going high and going
low, so to save her back.

414
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,640
In the lower left-hand corner,

415
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,360
the picker is giving a right
a white angle where to pick,

416
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,510
picks it from there,
picks it, scans it, done.

417
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,880
Fewer errors, much faster.

418
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,750
And then we have the slam process
where in those few seconds

419
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,970
that you see there, this
is actually in real time,

420
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,760
it is taking all the big data

421
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,310
and it's putting it on the label,

422
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,350
who is it and where are they going to.

423
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,293
The box is already sealed,
so there's complete privacy.

424
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,180
Now how big is this? It's huge.

425
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,200
The fulfillment centers

426
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,820
for instance delivered 600
million packages the same day,

427
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,810
and that is going up.

428
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,330
So the speed is about three
hours from start to finish

429
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,560
in the fulfillment center.

430
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,030
The average delivery is 1.9
days from that you bought it,

431
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,720
and the average time to
buy is about three minutes.

432
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,580
So this is speeding up and going faster,

433
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,320
and robotics is helping.

434
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,790
But how do they deliver?

435
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,780
In the last mile,

436
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,030
you have the driver now being able

437
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,080
to use the same technology.

438
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,500
You can see there, it's
gonna shine a red light,

439
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,150
don't pick that one,
and then a green light,

440
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,650
that's the one to deliver.

441
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,430
That saves a minute per
delivery, which is a lot.

442
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,380
Now you add augmented reality glasses

443
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,260
and they can now do the
same thing with hands free.

444
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,873
So everything builds on
everything else here.

445
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:30,870
What we're seeing is medical impacts

446
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,940
at scale is another one.

447
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,480
In 2020, we never went
to a remote doctor visit.

448
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,040
Well, then came COVID.

449
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,040
In one month, it increased
157% or 157 times.

450
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,300
And now we're looking at it,

451
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,850
yeah, you can actually
have a doctor's visit.

452
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:52,530
We're wearing wearables.
We're counting ourselves.

453
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,780
Can we sleep better? Et cetera.

454
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,833
And that is going towards
its personal AI guardian.

455
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,140
Genomics is an area that use
a lot of data, a lot of AI,

456
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,460
and you can even in the future
be able to get a prescription

457
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,920
before you even know
that you have the disease

458
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,780
because it looks at the genomic data

459
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,520
and it tells you what you need to do.

460
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,600
So it becomes your guardian.
And it's a big business.

461
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,840
And this genomics is not
just good for people,

462
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,430
it's good for koalas.

463
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,000
I wanna tell this story
about a researcher in Sydney,

464
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,760
Australia who had a lot of genomics data,

465
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,670
but she didn't have the
people and the skills

466
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,080
to analyze it enough.

467
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,730
So she put it in Amazon's
Open Data Exchange,

468
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,060
and a researcher in Sweden
was able to solve it

469
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,530
in just a few days.

470
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,480
And do you know how you save the koala?

471
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,483
You vaccinate them from chlamydia.

472
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,790
Who would have known?

473
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,470
Well, I'm happy to say
that two months ago,

474
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,260
that was actually approved,
that vaccine in Australia.

475
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,330
So there is big hopes for the koala.

476
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,520
The point of that is if you share the data

477
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,420
and you share how you can work faster,

478
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,430
you can do miracles.

479
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,740
And digital twins, it's
not just for things,

480
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,000
it's for humans.

481
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,650
So if I have a disease,

482
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,000
they can have a digital twin of me

483
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,560
'cause everything is being measured,

484
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,600
and they can see where they should operate

485
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,890
before they do it.

486
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,510
And now they can bring in robotics

487
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:22,800
and have somebody from outside
actually do the surgery.

488
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,590
So the medical impacts are fantastic,

489
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,850
and we're gonna need them.

490
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,150
We lived till

491
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,890
about 47 years old in 1900,

492
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,940
78 in 2000,

493
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,940
and in 2100, it'll be,
I don't have a clue,

494
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,970
but we're gonna live longer
and we will have implants,

495
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,000
and AI is going to be
what keeps us healthy.

496
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,970
So it's just not a new thing.

497
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,253
It's very personal and very important.

498
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,590
The fifth here is data.

499
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,590
There's no surprise to any of
you that data is going faster.

500
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,283
Anybody know what the
biggest number we measure is?

501
00:23:00,388 --> 00:23:04,890
Yottabyte, and yottabyte
was impossibly big.

502
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,750
Well, we're gonna get there in 2030.

503
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,227
So now you need to learn
a new word, quettabytes.

504
00:23:10,227 --> 00:23:14,340
So a quettabyte is 10
with 30 zeros behind it.

505
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,250
So if you learn, what did you call that?

506
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,090
- Kampung.
- Kampung, and now quettabyte.

507
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,160
So you learn so much here. (laughs)

508
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,800
But how you gonna analyze all this data?

509
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,340
We're seeing agentic AI
as being an ability here

510
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,380
to analyze the data that's coming

511
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,450
and to deal with it differently.

512
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,900
And the data is not just structured,

513
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,600
it's unstructured, 90% of it.

514
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,250
And how do you get your arms

515
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,130
around all of this data in your company?

516
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:48,570
The answer, as uncomfortable
as it is, is you won't.

517
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,570
You won't get your arm around
all the data, but it's okay.

518
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,370
Just think, work backwards on the problem,

519
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,470
and think about the problem
you're trying to solve,

520
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,763
and then use generative AI
to tie into partner's data.

521
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,180
What we're thinking here
is flipping the script.

522
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,860
That's the easiest thing we have seen

523
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,630
successful companies do.

524
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,740
Instead of you having to fill
out a form to use my data,

525
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,590
I have to fill out a
form to protect the data,

526
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,670
and it changes everything

527
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,520
'cause now you can experiment using AI

528
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,700
and internet of things
creates a lot of data

529
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,130
and now you can start analyzing it.

530
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,410
You can also use synthetic data.

531
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,213
Is anybody using synthetic data yet?

532
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,690
Okay, very few.

533
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,903
So this is the hand
scanner called Amazon One.

534
00:24:34,921 --> 00:24:37,710
When I'm out on a run, I
go into an Amazon Fresh,

535
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,730
pick up a bottle of water,

536
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,310
just hold my hand over and run out.

537
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,730
That is because they trained
it with synthetic data,

538
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:48,810
and it's 99.9999% is very accurate.

539
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,690
It's more accurate than
an iris or a fingerprint,

540
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,150
but it was the synthetic
data that made it happen.

541
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,510
So that's the opportunity here with data.

542
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,413
Six out of eight is crypto,
and crypto revolution,

543
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,780
we may or may not be right,

544
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,380
but if you have invested
in bitcoin 10 years ago,

545
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,850
it would be the single biggest investment

546
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,230
you could have made.

547
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,120
But it's up and down, so it's worrisome.

548
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,240
But now we have regulations
coming and there is growth,

549
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,360
and blockchain keeps going.

550
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,980
So the token economy means
that you will have tokens on,

551
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,020
digital tokens for physical things.

552
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,120
So, and that changes everything.

553
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,960
Have you ever thought about

554
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,580
how an agent will pay another
agent, software agents?

555
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,590
They'll probably use stablecoin,

556
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,480
and they'll probably use micropayments,

557
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,000
a fraction of a fraction
of a fraction of a penny.

558
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,900
So all of a sudden, it
creates a new economy,

559
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,150
and decentralized finance
may be one of them.

560
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,990
Then quantum computing.

561
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:53,250
So quantum is, we worried
about building the hardware,

562
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:58,250
and in the left corner
is Amazon's quantum lab

563
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,590
at Caltech, kept in Los Angeles.

564
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,740
Now we've actually made
error-correcting qubits.

565
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,240
So a qubit is not a qubit.

566
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,260
If it's error correcting,

567
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,430
it's 90% faster and better
than a non-error correcting.

568
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,280
And it's a large market.

569
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,623
Where will it go? You can
see it's a big impact.

570
00:26:16,623 --> 00:26:18,960
It's gonna have a lot of jobs.

571
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,170
Where will it go as far
as business applications?

572
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,300
That's gonna be the question and when.

573
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,640
So we think this is one of the key trends

574
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,860
because of the growth
rate and amount of money.

575
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,610
But what applications will we see

576
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,900
and which quantum computer?

577
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,230
So these are four completely
different quantum computers.

578
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,427
We don't know which one will win the ring

579
00:26:39,427 --> 00:26:42,450
that rules them all, but
Amazon provides choice.

580
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,550
So you can Braket to try

581
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,070
and to see which one
makes the biggest impact.

582
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,280
The important part here
is to get your programmers

583
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,043
to try to use quantum computing
to see what you can do.

584
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,170
Then we have Airbus and BMW looking

585
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,290
at being able to do logistics,

586
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,003
being able to soundproof it.

587
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,880
Lot of near-term opportunities.

588
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,120
The biggest one of all,
quantum-safe encryption.

589
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,320
That's where you worry

590
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,650
about the future quantum
computing decrypting your data,

591
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,210
and so that's being worked on.

592
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,520
That's the single biggest
opportunity right now,

593
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,960
and you don't have to wait.

594
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,930
Use AWS as quantum-safe
encryption algorithms.

595
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,723
Others do too. The key here is to use it.

596
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,420
The last one is, do we have
enough energy for this?

597
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,140
We use fossil fuels,
then we use renewables.

598
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,250
And Amazon is the biggest
producer of renewables

599
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,650
and also purchaser of renewables.

600
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,290
And now we're looking at nuclear power.

601
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,900
It's doesn't produce fossil fuel,

602
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,390
but we're gonna need all of this energy.

603
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,000
And it isn't just about energy

604
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,730
to power things like windmills,

605
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,810
it's about your energy
to be able to handle this

606
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,670
and having this dual mandate.

607
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,470
So if you pull out your smartphones,

608
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,830
which of these emerging technologies

609
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,230
will matter the most to you?

610
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,003
If you...

611
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,983
Sorry, there's the QR code.

612
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,390
If you do that, you'll be able to see,

613
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,280
which ones of these do you care about?

614
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,560
Click on all of them,
click on none of them,

615
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,743
and we're gonna see the
results in just a few minutes.

616
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,750
So it looks like agentic AI

617
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,260
and data and energy.

618
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,260
That's a surprise. I didn't expect that.

619
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,370
Crypto, not so much.

620
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,080
Quantum, somewhat.

621
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,510
And otherwise, it's an
even split, I think.

622
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,120
Surprising, not more
people on edge computing,

623
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,870
but this is why what
matters to your company,

624
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,980
and having to do this on
your own is hard work.

625
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,953
So isn't there a better way? Arvind.

626
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,830
- Absolutely.

627
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,240
So in the last 20 minutes,

628
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,040
we've done a kind of whirlwind tour

629
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,070
of eight technology trends
that we felt were important,

630
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,500
but they may or may not
be important for you.

631
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,510
And this thing is moving so fast

632
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,730
that you've got to build
your own capability

633
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,240
to stay in touch with technology trends.

634
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,130
What you need is to upgrade
your cockpit with a radar system

635
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,683
that can do this reconnaissance for you.

636
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,700
What you need is a radar

637
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,290
that can sweep the landscape
on a periodic basis

638
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:37,770
and identify what
technologies are starting

639
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,020
to appear on the landscape.

640
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,170
And more importantly,
you need a systemic way

641
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,410
that can then identify those technologies,

642
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,950
understand how far are
they from impact with you,

643
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,180
how fast are they moving,

644
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,490
what's the business impact potential,

645
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,670
and how mature are they to make
an impact for your business.

646
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,310
So that's something you
need to continuously do

647
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,250
and be able to share that
with your business leadership

648
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,990
to stay ahead in this
dual mandate situation.

649
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,820
And very importantly, based on this data,

650
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,370
you also need to then be able to tell

651
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,280
if this is a technology
that I should be deploying

652
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,620
in my business right now
because it's making an impact

653
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,560
in my industry, in my
peers and competitors.

654
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,150
Or is this something which is close

655
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,400
to making a business impact,

656
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,590
and therefore we should be starting pilots

657
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,390
or maybe experiments?

658
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,040
Or if it's something which is less mature

659
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,500
but moving fast and
potentially big impact,

660
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,590
this may be something
that requires monitoring.

661
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,510
This is a lot of work,

662
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:40,350
and Tom and I in our past
have done this manually using

663
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,310
that compound to help us in this journey.

664
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,743
But things are much easier now.

665
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:49,920
This is 2025, this is the year

666
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,710
where agents can help
you solve this problem.

667
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,330
And we are not just suggesting

668
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,160
that agents can solve
this problem for you,

669
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,200
we actually have a solution for you.

670
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,380
So we, quick story, back story here,

671
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,130
is when we were doing the
research for this talk,

672
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,490
Tom and I, as often
gets happens in Amazon,

673
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,680
we wrote a paper on this topic saying

674
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,980
what CIOs need today is a systemic,

675
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,650
automated way to scan
for technology landscape

676
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,410
and do these assessments and
understand what's important.

677
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,540
And as again, as happens in Amazon,

678
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,310
this paper gets distributed,

679
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,010
and people add to that, provide inputs,

680
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,440
and some of them say, "Hey,
I'll build this for you."

681
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,620
So I want to introduce Jiyun Park,

682
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,620
who's part of our Korea
solution architects team,

683
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,520
and she raised up her
hands and volunteered

684
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,230
and said, "I'll build this for you."

685
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,580
So what we are gonna show you today

686
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,150
and give you today in
fact is an agentic system

687
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,791
that can automate this
entire reconnaissance work.

688
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:49,624
Jiyun.

689
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:53,584
(audience clapping)

690
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,090
- Thanks, Arvind.

691
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,980
Hi, everyone, I'm Jiyun.

692
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,420
Today, I'm gonna walk you through

693
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,360
what is the TechRecon
powered by agentic AI.

694
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,160
So before I show you the result,

695
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,280
I'm gonna highly briefly
explain the architecture

696
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,390
of the TechRecon behind the agentic AI.

697
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:17,390
So the TechRecon is a multi-agent system

698
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:22,350
that researches public
sources like newspapers,

699
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,050
consulting companies and IT vendors,

700
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:28,530
and generates a series of
documents to IT leaders

701
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,110
so they can understand the fast-changing,

702
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:34,803
emerging technologies and
deep dives where they need.

703
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,550
So we have supervisor agent here,

704
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,950
which orchestrates the entire workflow

705
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,543
across the sub agents.

706
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,060
And we define the TechRecon by a prompt.

707
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:52,440
So it's gonna support the
CIO of the XYZ company

708
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,260
and researching the emerging technologies.

709
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,740
We iterated with this with
many different prompts

710
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,103
and finalize this with the best one.

711
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,500
Inside the system, each
agent has a specialized role

712
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:13,740
which going on on their respective tasks.

713
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,690
So the planner agents create
tasks for the other agents,

714
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:22,170
researcher agents gathers the information

715
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:27,170
and like they actually
research on behalf of human,

716
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,880
coder agents read,
saves, and creates files,

717
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,390
and reporter agents synthesizes everything

718
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,163
and make it as a final output.

719
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,833
And these agents are
work in a sequential way.

720
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,430
So based on the user request,

721
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,590
there's gonna major two outputs,

722
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:53,490
which is the part one, emerging
tech landscape analysis,

723
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,680
which is gonna cover the broad landscapes

724
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,120
of the technologies,

725
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,230
and part two, position papers
on the specific technology,

726
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,560
which is dive deep on
one specific technology

727
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,853
and creates the report of your
company's position papers.

728
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,130
This is the strength of agentic AI system.

729
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:18,420
With multiple agents, which
has their specialized role,

730
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:22,500
they're working together
using their tools they need

731
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,403
and making the final outputs autonomously.

732
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,720
- And as we are working together on this,

733
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,570
what we realize is not only
can it do research for you,

734
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,310
which is gather all of these insights

735
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,850
and convert that into kind
of summarized documents,

736
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:42,240
but could even do the analysis
we talked about earlier.

737
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,370
So if you build a slide,

738
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:48,570
what the agents were able to
do using coding capabilities,

739
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:51,060
et cetera, just click this, yeah,

740
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,850
is we created three measures,

741
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:57,000
three scores for every
technology that it found.

742
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,060
We calculated an impact score,

743
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,500
and this was based on the work

744
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,060
that actually was done at NASA

745
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,360
on technology-readiness scoring.

746
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,600
And the way this happens is
very specific to your company.

747
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,250
So Jiyun mentioned earlier

748
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,440
that it's designed for your company.

749
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,340
So let's say you are the CIO
of a pharmaceutical company,

750
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,410
it'll do the analysis and impact analysis

751
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,110
for your industry, right?

752
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,000
And similarly, maturity scoring,

753
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,850
which is how ready is this
technology for use today?

754
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:29,760
And finally, momentum, which
is how fast is this moving?

755
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,950
Is this accelerating or slowing down?

756
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,480
So for every technology,

757
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,910
we were able to create these three scores

758
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,700
and then build, next slide.

759
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,670
And also, what we were able to do,

760
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,360
once you have those scores
and build, one more.

761
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,690
What we were able to do
is based on those scores,

762
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,960
you could actually reach
some sort of judgment

763
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,300
on if this is a technology
which is high impact

764
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,210
and highly mature, and as being right now,

765
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,010
there are examples of use cases

766
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,740
of this making an impact in your industry,

767
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,110
then that's something you
should deploy right now.

768
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,180
But if it's earlier in maturity,

769
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,510
then that may be something you
want to pilot or experiment.

770
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,100
Whereas if there's something else,

771
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,770
which is very early stages, very mature,

772
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,350
but moving fast and
potentially big impact,

773
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,970
that's something you wanna monitor.

774
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,640
Now these were some parameters we chose

775
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,900
as we were experimenting with this,

776
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,730
but you can pick your own parameters

777
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,700
and create how you want to assess

778
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,730
and decide what to do with
each of these technologies.

779
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,440
And now Jiyun will show an actual demo

780
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,063
of how the system works.

781
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,900
- Okay, now I show you the demo,

782
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,360
but before I show you the, play the demo,

783
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,860
I'm gonna briefly explain the
front end of the TechRecon.

784
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,870
So as you can see in the middle,

785
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,690
you can see the real-time logs
as they're being streamed.

786
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,730
So they're gonna be the
outputs of each agents

787
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,080
and display on the middle of the screen.

788
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,040
On the right-hand side,

789
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,750
you can see the control panel

790
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,650
and you can see the status of each agent.

791
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,090
And the below down there,

792
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,690
there's the button so that
you can execute the run,

793
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,750
create the reports, which is the part one,

794
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,370
landscape analysis report,

795
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:14,640
and part two, technology position papers.

796
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,370
And if all those tests are completed,

797
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,553
you can download all the files
in the bottom-right corner.

798
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:29,723
Oh.

799
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,773
- [Arvind] That's all right,

800
00:37:36,773 --> 00:37:37,950
I think we can just move forward.

801
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,783
Yeah.

802
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,740
- Okay, so after the demo is completed,

803
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,820
you can see the result,

804
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,160
which is the emerging technologies

805
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,933
reconnaissance report,
which is the part one.

806
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,990
This is the real result you can utilize

807
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,703
in your real world.

808
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,310
So this is the example part one report

809
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:11,400
for CIO of the Pfizer company.

810
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,030
So if there's anyone here from the Pfizer

811
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,940
or pharmaceutical industry
company and Congress,

812
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,100
you can get this report today.

813
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,480
But otherwise, you can run
this code in your local system

814
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,710
and then just replace the
variables with your industry

815
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,063
and your company name.

816
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,830
So this part one is
gonna cover the overview

817
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,870
of the technology landscape,

818
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:40,530
strategy recommendations
based on the score assessment,

819
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,900
which is Arvind explained before,

820
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,100
and the industry-specific context as well.

821
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,810
Because the TechRecon follows

822
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,920
the strict fixed template,

823
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,100
so you can run it monthly, quarterly,

824
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,380
or whenever you want

825
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,193
to catch up the new
emerging technology trends.

826
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,920
After creating the
landscape analysis report,

827
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,410
you can create the technology paper,

828
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,830
which dives deeper into
such one technology.

829
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,323
Here, as you can see, the generative AI.

830
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,120
Like as you can see, it
includes the key findings,

831
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,990
strategy recommendations,
technology deep dives,

832
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,860
and also the real-world
use cases you can utilize.

833
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,620
And the TechRecon is not only just covered

834
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,220
this technical thing, it
covers the business as well.

835
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,190
So you can see why this matter for Pfizer

836
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,753
in this report as well.

837
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:50,280
So the TechRecon is not a new service,

838
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,610
it's a blueprint so that
your teams can deploy

839
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,440
within a few weeks.

840
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,310
On the average,

841
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:00,240
maybe it's gonna cost them
less than $2,000 per year,

842
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,850
but it depends on how
much you're gonna run.

843
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,880
So it can take less, it can take more.

844
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,240
Many companies don't know where to start.

845
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,700
They actually want to
build the agentic AI,

846
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,800
but they don't know where to start.

847
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,380
This is why the TechRecon is so powerful,

848
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,150
and you can start it today.

849
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,550
We're gonna give you the code architecture

850
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,530
and the implementation guide today.

851
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,170
So you can run this

852
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:30,060
and build your own strategy
advisor with the TechRecon.

853
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,340
So this is the technical thing.

854
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,890
Then what about the human side?

855
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,190
Tom is gonna introduce it.

856
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,780
- So I'm not sure it was clear.

857
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,110
The system actually write, it
scans the technology for you,

858
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,180
and it writes those reports.

859
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,530
That's what you're gonna be asked for.

860
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,260
That's what the dual mandate is.

861
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,480
So you get a lot of help
from what Jiyun built.

862
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,810
But it's not about technology
alone, it's about people.

863
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:59,810
So I want you, on three,
to yell out what COE means.

864
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,653
One, two, three.

865
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:02,970
- [Audience] Center of excellence.

866
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,293
- But it shouldn't.

867
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,790
So I created a center of
excellence for cloud at NASA,

868
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,680
and we've seen many companies do that.

869
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,513
What do you do?

870
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:14,463
You create a center of people
who think they're excellent,

871
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,815
and everybody else hates them,

872
00:41:16,815 --> 00:41:18,853
(audience laughing)

873
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:20,970
and then they create their
own center of excellence.

874
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,120
So you now don't have just
shadow IT, you have shadow COEs.

875
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,820
So isn't there a better way? There is.

876
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,070
With all of these new
technologies that are coming,

877
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,600
what you really want is you want

878
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,640
to work backwards on the business problem

879
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,890
and you want the center of engagement.

880
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,770
You want people to try
it, experiment with it,

881
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,860
and be able to very scrappy test it.

882
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,220
And if it pays out business
dividends, you double down.

883
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,700
So you think big, start
small with these experiments,

884
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,290
then scale fast.

885
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,940
But they're business experiments,

886
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,160
not technology experiments.

887
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,370
And trust me, the companies
we talk to, this works,

888
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,740
and the people who do it get promoted.

889
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,000
So this is the way to
actually test, try this out.

890
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,360
Now the other thing that
it does is it engages teams

891
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,580
and people beyond your organization.

892
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,050
I mean, you're all sitting here,

893
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,360
and hopefully you're talking to each other

894
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,550
because that's the future collaborators

895
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,900
that you're gonna have.

896
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,500
So the TechRecon center

897
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,770
of excellence can now reach
out to business units,

898
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,070
as many as you can, and
then to external partners,

899
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,140
and the entire ecosystem intelligence.

900
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,990
And you will start feeding
each other information

901
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,250
that you're looking for,

902
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,610
and perhaps even create new
partnerships with these agents.

903
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,583
And it all starts with the tech COE,

904
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,880
or I'm sorry, the
technology reconnaissance

905
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,653
that Jiyun built.

906
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,920
But how do you fund it?

907
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,610
How do you prove that this is worthwhile?

908
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,070
Arvind, how did you fund it?

909
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,440
- Yeah, so I would say that the human side

910
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,900
of this is probably the most
important investment needed,

911
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,720
but you do need some dollars as well.

912
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,110
And in my experience as
we got this thing going,

913
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,660
one of the most important things was for

914
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,930
to create the fuel for
innovation that we all,

915
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,247
you know, hope we'll go to
our CFO and CEO and say,

916
00:43:12,247 --> 00:43:15,990
"Hey, we need to stay in touch
with emerging technologies,

917
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,160
and please fund it."

918
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,080
It's very hard to get funding for that.

919
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,330
The way I've always done that is

920
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,610
to start the innovation process,

921
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:26,790
the new technology
application process in areas

922
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:29,820
that generate some savings first,

923
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,880
and then I have the agreement
with the CEO and the CFO

924
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,610
that instead of taking that
saving to the bottom line,

925
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,920
we'll reinvest this into more innovation.

926
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,470
And that's the reason I
call it fuel for innovation.

927
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:43,650
And once you have the
technical capability,

928
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:47,280
the human side of it, and
this little bit of funding,

929
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,020
then the way you want
to think about this is

930
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,310
to get your flywheel
of emerging technology

931
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:54,990
and innovation going.

932
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,120
The way Amazon likes to look

933
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,090
at flywheels is you think
of this as a flywheel,

934
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,890
you need to give it a start

935
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,383
by getting some business
leadership engagement,

936
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,160
attracting talent into it,
you get the right talent,

937
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,490
the right ideas for innovation come up,

938
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,930
and you make them successful,

939
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,030
you invest in making the
early ones successful,

940
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,220
and that gets your flywheel going.

941
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,620
And as you gather momentum,

942
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,180
more and more ideas are generated

943
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,090
and more impact of business happens.

944
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,980
And as someone who's trying

945
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,980
to get this TechRecon capability going,

946
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,900
unless you want to do
this all by yourself,

947
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,170
you've got to think about
how the flywheel is running

948
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,120
and how you can accelerate it further.

949
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,300
So that was one of the
areas that we focused on.

950
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,200
And a common learning

951
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,320
that both Tom and I had was oftentimes,

952
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,260
a question that gets asked is ROI,

953
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,080
and what I have done
sometimes successfully,

954
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,760
sometimes not very successfully,

955
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,420
is kind of shift that conversation to ROA,

956
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,120
which is a return on attention.

957
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,830
What truly matters when you're looking

958
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,013
at emerging technologies
and early stages is,

959
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,210
are there ideas that actually
business cares about?

960
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,650
Are they paying attention to this?

961
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,430
Are they putting effort into
exploring this and figuring out

962
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:13,560
how this can create value for them?

963
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,470
And the way we measure that is through

964
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,330
how much engagement are we getting?

965
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,440
Are people showing up?

966
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,990
Are they volunteering to
be part of this ecosystem?

967
00:45:23,034 --> 00:45:25,410
Is the velocity of the
ideas that are moving

968
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:27,810
and the ideas that are
moving from early stage

969
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:30,330
to actual experimentation growing?

970
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,250
And finally most importantly,

971
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,160
is this leading to strategic conversations

972
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,577
in the executive room saying,

973
00:45:36,577 --> 00:45:39,810
"Look, here are the 10
technologies which are coming up.

974
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,090
These have potential, we
want to do experiments

975
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:45,720
with these three, watch
these five, et cetera."

976
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,070
That is the sign that this COE is working

977
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,750
for us or not.

978
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,390
Now there are many challenges
to making it work, of course.

979
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:55,803
This is not straightforward.

980
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,050
The common issue

981
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,020
in the earlier stages is
you launch this thing,

982
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,340
and nobody shows up.

983
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,650
No one has time, everyone's very busy.

984
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,150
This is a classic issue.

985
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,270
And again, investing in
the early few projects

986
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,310
in a way that saves dollars as well

987
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,900
as capacity is very useful.

988
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,790
I found that always very helpful.

989
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,860
But more importantly, it's
about creating that culture.

990
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,470
Leadership has to convey the message

991
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,360
that learning is important,

992
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,960
not just for this job
and this company today,

993
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,150
but for your careers in the future.

994
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:30,120
The second thing that often
comes in the way is everyone,

995
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,110
once you get people excited,

996
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,510
everyone wants to work on
the same hot technology.

997
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:36,120
And if you truly want
to look at a portfolio

998
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,430
of emerging technologies,
you want more people

999
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,050
to be interested in different things.

1000
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:41,760
And there are many ways to do that

1001
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,790
by making sure that the
portfolio is very clear

1002
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:47,370
and you move people from
one idea to the other

1003
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:51,780
and not gonna let everyone
get focused on the same thing.

1004
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,250
And finally, very importantly,

1005
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,670
your business has to feel like
it's their problem to solve.

1006
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:57,990
If that's not happening,

1007
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:59,400
so you have to work backwards

1008
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,670
from where the business
opportunities are, right?

1009
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,520
So with that, hopefully we've
given you a lot of ideas

1010
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,230
on how to do this.

1011
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:10,440
We have seen, and you know,

1012
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,990
that it's possible in a 90-day period

1013
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,960
to get this whole engine
and this flywheel going.

1014
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,350
In the first month or so
using now what's possible

1015
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,660
with TechRecon, the agentic tool,

1016
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,940
you can actually set
the foundation in place

1017
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,680
and have the conversation with your CEO

1018
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,540
and CFO that this is something

1019
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,750
as an organization you
wanna put more attention on.

1020
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,160
In the second month,

1021
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,360
you can start looking at some
of these position papers,

1022
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,030
get people to own it,
build more detail into it.

1023
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,350
And by month three,

1024
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:43,200
you should be going into
your executive boardrooms

1025
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,220
and having a conversation

1026
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,340
about what are the technologies
you want to keep an eye on

1027
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,560
and potentially do experiments with.

1028
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,900
Now I make it sound very simple.

1029
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:56,730
This is not like a silver bullet,

1030
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:57,660
of course.

1031
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,560
There are challenges, but
this is becoming so important

1032
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,340
for us in our roles as CIOs
that this is not something

1033
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,540
that can be ignored.

1034
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,790
We have to figure out a way

1035
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,790
to manage our operational
delivery responsibilities

1036
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,680
while also building the muscle

1037
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,990
to do technology reconnaissance.

1038
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,620
And so hopefully with that,

1039
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,863
what you should be able
to do is this future.

1040
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:27,657
(radar beeping)

1041
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,730
(airplane dings)

1042
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:35,433
- [CEO] What's our position
on the new AI regulations?

1043
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,700
- [Pilot] Already briefed
the board last week.

1044
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,450
Position paper sent to your tablet.

1045
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,740
(airplane dings)

1046
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,910
- [Board Member] How
will quantum computing

1047
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,023
affect our encryption?

1048
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:50,040
- [Pilot] We've been monitoring
quantum developments.

1049
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,320
Recommend moving to
quantum-resistant encryption

1050
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,760
in quarter two.

1051
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,360
Full analysis, ready for review.

1052
00:48:58,563 --> 00:49:02,146
(airplane engine whirring)

1053
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,200
- All right, so with that,

1054
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,983
we want you to go out and
conquer the dual mandate.

1055
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,160
You have a lot of resources here.

1056
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,340
You will have access to
actually the source code

1057
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,870
for TechRecon is posted.

1058
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,520
You can access that.

1059
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,020
We'll be hanging around for a few minutes.

1060
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,700
We'll actually redo the demo as well

1061
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,250
since that didn't work earlier.

1062
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,480
But very importantly,

1063
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,480
this week is an amazing set
of folks who are around here.

1064
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,960
There are people,

1065
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,180
everyone who's in this
gathering hopefully are folks

1066
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,650
who want to build this capability.

1067
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,780
So talk to each other, connect with them.

1068
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,940
Go to the expo floor, go to the replay.

1069
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,523
There's a lot of new technology on demo.

1070
00:49:48,624 --> 00:49:52,470
Get to see that and learn how that works.

1071
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:55,530
So with that, we'd love to-
- Just one more point.

1072
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:59,310
When I asked you how many had
agentic-something running,

1073
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:01,080
like two people raised their hands.

1074
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:01,993
Here's your opportunity to have

1075
00:50:01,993 --> 00:50:04,170
an agentic-something running
- Yes. (laughs)

1076
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:08,730
- that is very low risk,
it's very low cost,

1077
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,440
but it gets you started.

1078
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,840
While she's setting up the
demo, it's two minutes,

1079
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,390
what you can actually
see, what you would get,

1080
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:17,610
it's worth it because
people will get interested.

1081
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:18,750
As we started doing this,

1082
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,900
we realized it was not
at all what we thought.

1083
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,920
Like in the beginning,

1084
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,590
you may think an agent is an intern

1085
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,230
where you can just tell an
intern, "Go do something."

1086
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,820
You can't do that with an agent.

1087
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,420
So that prompt that she
showed is very, very telling.

1088
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,100
It came from a lot of iteration.

1089
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,260
So it gives you a chance to get hands on.

1090
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,999
So two minutes, and you'll see this now.

1091
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:41,460
- We'll just do the demo again. Thank you.

1092
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,330
- Yeah, sorry.

1093
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:47,330
So as soon as you click the Run button,

1094
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,830
the supervisor agent
takes all the controls

1095
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,450
of the entire workflow,

1096
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:54,480
and the planner agents begins the planning

1097
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,520
of the researcher, coder,

1098
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:01,320
and reporter agent is gonna run.

1099
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,170
So actually, you can
see the real-time logs

1100
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:06,810
as they're being streamed from each agent,

1101
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:10,530
which is the specifically
the planner agent right now.

1102
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:15,270
And basically, the planner
identifies what needs to be done.

1103
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:18,960
So once the planner finishes
generating the task list

1104
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,020
that the researcher, coder,

1105
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:27,020
and reporter agents begin
executing their respective tasks

1106
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,630
and start filling in their information.

1107
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,120
So when all the tasks are completed,

1108
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,630
you can see on the right-hand
side, the control plane,

1109
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:41,400
all the agents' status is
gonna change to Completed,

1110
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,123
and the generated files
become available for,

1111
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,080
down the bottom-right corner,

1112
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,330
you can download it, all the files.

1113
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:53,400
So after you create the part one,

1114
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,230
you can proceed to part two.

1115
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:57,420
So it's gonna generate this specific

1116
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,390
technology position
papers, which is gonna,

1117
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:03,360
based on the part one assessment scores,

1118
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,733
the higher ranked assessment scores.

1119
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:07,894
- So if you go to the last slide,

1120
00:52:07,894 --> 00:52:09,630
just so they can see where to download it,

1121
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,580
but it's an open source, it's a blueprint.

1122
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,950
It gives you a chance to
have this dual mandate.

1123
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,170
It's hard, but once you've set it up,

1124
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:17,640
let's say you have a
board meeting tomorrow

1125
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,690
and they ask you to come in

1126
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,520
and talk to the board of directors,

1127
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,560
which will happen with agentic AI,

1128
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,710
you can just run this and
have the latest report.

1129
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,050
It creates it for you.
That's kind of the key.

1130
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,523
It saves you time.

1131
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,790
So...
- So thank you.

1132
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:33,623
We'll hang around here.

1133
00:52:33,623 --> 00:52:38,220
If anyone wants to actually
implement this, Jiyun is here.

1134
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,520
And through that GitHub
link, you can of course,

1135
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,040
get access to the code,
the instructions there,

1136
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,960
and you can also reach
out to us for any support

1137
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,880
or help needed to make it work.

1138
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,713
Thank you.

1139
00:52:48,713 --> 00:52:51,843
- Thank you.
