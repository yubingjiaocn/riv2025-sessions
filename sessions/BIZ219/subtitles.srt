1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,670
- [Ayesha] Okay, I'm gonna kickstart.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,620
- [Jack] Yep. I think we're good to go.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,124
- A very good evening, everyone.

4
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:10,890
(audience chattering faintly)

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,220
A very good evening and a warm
welcome to each one of you

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,490
who has taken the time to
attend our session today.

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,710
I know you had a lot of
sessions to choose from,

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,710
so I'm really grateful you've
taken the time to come here

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,570
and attend our session, and we
promise you a very fun-filled

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,203
and a very learning experience
in the next one hour.

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,503
Before I begin,

12
00:00:33,503 --> 00:00:36,240
I wanna make sure all of
you have your headsets on,

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,250
and also you can hear me.

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,050
If you can hear me, can you
please raise your hands?

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,450
Okay, perfect. Awesome, awesome.

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,710
So with that being said,

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,260
I do wanna share that
whether you are a CX leader

18
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,670
or a business owner

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,030
who's looking for your next
big strategic transformation,

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,900
or an IT architect who's working
on the next school solution

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,670
and is trying to build that,

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,310
or whether you are an
innovator who's just curious

23
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,510
to learn about AI

24
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,450
and how we can apply that
in customer experience,

25
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,697
I believe you all have the
same question on your mind,

26
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:09,150
"How do we truly apply personalization

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,740
in customer experience,

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,730
and we scale that to tens
and thousands of customers?"

29
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,760
Today, in this session, I
am gonna walk you through,

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,420
along with Jack, how
AI-powered Amazon Connect

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,433
can help you achieve exactly that.

32
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,240
Quick introduction. My
name is Ayesha Borker.

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,740
I'm a principal solution architect

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,540
specializing in Amazon Connect.

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,243
And with me, I have Jack.

36
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:33,076
- I'm Jack Hutton.

37
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:35,220
I'm a principal product
manager of Amazon Connect,

38
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,693
specializing at agent AI.

39
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,290
- And in the next one hour,

40
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,140
we will be walking you
through these main five themes

41
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,150
across personalization.

42
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,480
The first is why is
personalization even important?

43
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,650
We will also touch upon

44
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,500
how Amazon Connect helps
you achieve personalization

45
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,600
for your end customer use cases.

46
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,560
And then, we will also touch
upon real customer results,

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,647
customers who have delivered

48
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:02,460
personalized experiences in production

49
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,760
and the business outcomes
that they've achieved today.

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,650
I promise you, and I'm very confident,

51
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,030
that at the end of this session,

52
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,530
you will have learned a lot,

53
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,600
and you will see a lot of the cool tools

54
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,000
that Amazon Connect has launched recently,

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,070
that you can use and go back and implement

56
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,520
into your contact center too.

57
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,210
With that being said, I actually
wanna start with a story,

58
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,590
A story of personalization
gone horribly wrong.

59
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,390
So there's a very famous movie quote

60
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,130
that life is like a box of chocolates

61
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,410
and you never know what you're gonna get.

62
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,740
So this is from a time,
during my last birthday,

63
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,870
when I would received a box of chocolates

64
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,500
as my birthday gift, and I
wasn't expecting that at all.

65
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,010
The reason being, last
year was also the year

66
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,100
I jumped on the bandwagon of being fit

67
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,963
and joining a gym as well.

68
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,400
More importantly, I was also
extremely vocal about it.

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,098
I made sure everyone around me knew

70
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:01,860
that I'm trying to be fit,
I'm lifting kettlebells,

71
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm eating my salads.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,800
Every social gathering that I went to

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,960
was all about my fitness journey.

74
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,300
And yet when my birthday arrived,

75
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,240
a very dear close friend
of mine decided to give me

76
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,383
a box of chocolates.

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,770
I guess by now, you know what went wrong.

78
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,060
I kept giving my friend

79
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,300
all the information she
needed to know about my life,

80
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,840
and yet the decision she made
to gift me had nothing to do

81
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,790
with any of the information or
data that I provided to her.

82
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:29,970
A quick show of hands,

83
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,890
any one of you have
been in a similar space,

84
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,960
received a gift you are not?

85
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,560
Well, how does that make
you feel? Invisible, right?

86
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,980
Ironically, a lot of organizations

87
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,980
and businesses today are
making the same mistake.

88
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,200
Your customers are constantly giving you

89
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,150
a lot of information about themselves.

90
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,320
They're going to your website,

91
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,120
they're clicking on certain items,

92
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,710
they're accessing your web app,

93
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,390
they're calling you in
your contact center,

94
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,490
they're telling you what their problem is,

95
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,840
and yet organizations

96
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,120
and businesses are not
trying to use that data

97
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,020
and deliver a personalized experience.

98
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,720
I wanna share some
interesting statistics here.

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,370
So, McKinsey did a survey,

100
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,600
and they said that 76% of
consumers are more likely

101
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,140
to consider purchasing from
brands that personalize.

102
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,220
Again, how many of you agree?

103
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,630
How many of you would go and shop

104
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,160
if a business actually near you

105
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,890
and would have a higher
propensity to check out?

106
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,440
Perfect. I agree with you as well.

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,990
The other data that I
have is that organizations

108
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,610
that implement personalization

109
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,523
are realizing 10 to 15% lift in revenue.

110
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,303
The good news is that personalization
lives in Amazon's DNA.

111
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,020
Amazon has 25 years of learning

112
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,660
and innovating just on personalization.

113
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,380
So in 1998, we launched our
first recommendation engine

114
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,500
that simply said, customers
who bought X item in your cart

115
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,570
also tend to buy by Y.

116
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,540
That was a simple AIML
model, but over the years,

117
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,870
we've learned, we've churned,
and we've improved this model

118
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,500
to deliver even more sophisticated
and unique experiences,

119
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,030
not only across channels,

120
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,880
but also across devices
and machine learning.

121
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,430
And the good news is we are now bringing

122
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,870
similar learning models
and infrastructure to you

123
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,210
so that you can deliver the
same kind of experiences

124
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,283
for your users using Amazon Connect.

125
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,880
I just wanna give you one
example of personalization.

126
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,373
Anyone here who has
explored Help Me Decide?

127
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,280
Okay, we have one person,

128
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,460
but Help Me Decide is a
product recommendation feature

129
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,070
that Amazon has run recently in the app.

130
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,360
So if you're trying to buy something

131
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,430
and you don't know which
one should you buy,

132
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,230
I'm always in that position,

133
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,720
I'm always someone who
can never make a decision,

134
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,420
but Help Me Decide will
basically tell you,

135
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,743
let me load, how it works.

136
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,760
Let's say you're
searching for tea kettles,

137
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,950
and then it starts finding
the best option for you,

138
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,200
personalized based on your usage,

139
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,660
your product history,
and your recommendations.

140
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,460
And it gives you three options, right?

141
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,210
The upgrade pick, the
best of recently viewed,

142
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,220
and also the budget pick.

143
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,650
So Help Me Decide actually
makes it really easy.

144
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,930
It removes the mental load
of your end consumers,

145
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,340
and what's the right decision for them,

146
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,420
and what they should shop,

147
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,170
and what they should end up buying.

148
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,460
So I know all of this
sounds amazing, right?

149
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,740
Personalization is
critical, it's important,

150
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,660
but why is there still a gap?

151
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,810
Why are most organizations
still struggling

152
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,193
to deliver personalization?

153
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,050
I think the problem is
broadly in two categories.

154
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,630
The first is data. I spoke
to you about that, right?

155
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,400
Your consumers are
giving you a lot of data.

156
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,300
How do you unify that data?
That's the fundamental problem.

157
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,570
However, the emerging problem
that we are seeing is,

158
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,610
I have the data, what do I do with it?

159
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,800
How do I know what's the
right recommendation?

160
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,190
How do I know I, how do
I pair the right product

161
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,027
with this recommendation?

162
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:54,300
And how do I deliver that
experience to my customer?

163
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,220
So these are the twofold problems

164
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,433
that we are looking to
solve with Amazon Connect.

165
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,023
How many of you here have
heard of Amazon Connect?

166
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,460
Okay, most of you have,
but for anyone who hasn't,

167
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,970
Amazon Connect is basically
our cloud-based contact center,

168
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,260
which is one application

169
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,780
that provides you one seamless experience

170
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,260
across all channels
with routing, analytics,

171
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,310
inbound, outbound agent,
and supervisor experience.

172
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,630
Within Amazon Connect, we
are now launching agentic AI

173
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,750
that enables personalized
customer experiences.

174
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,260
So tying back to the two problems
that I called out earlier,

175
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,870
the first is unification of customer data.

176
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,670
How do you make sure your customer data

177
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,770
that comes from different channels,

178
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,750
including your contact
center, your websites,

179
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,123
is unified in a singular customer profile?

180
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,510
Okay, now what do I do with that data?

181
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,490
So this is the gen AI insights,

182
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,400
which we will be focusing
a lot more on today.

183
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,150
The first thing is having a
specialized AI sales agent.

184
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,260
This is something you can build,

185
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,800
and I'll also be showing
you a demo of later today.

186
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,090
The second is segmentation.

187
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,640
How can I provide gen
AI insights on the data

188
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,190
and the unified profiles I already have?

189
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,410
And then, obviously, you
wanna measure the outcomes

190
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,380
and you want to analyze
the kind of information

191
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,670
and the insights you are delivering

192
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,930
in your customer experiences

193
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,600
so that you can come
back and improve upon it.

194
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,630
And then lastly, it's the
customer engagement layer.

195
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,870
Once you have the profile,
the gen AI insights,

196
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,040
how do you deliver that,

197
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,610
either in customer service,
proactive outbound engagement,

198
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,503
your web app, or your mobile apps?

199
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,640
So I just wanna go back to the AIML models

200
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,080
that I was talking about,

201
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,450
which Amazon.com has been using for years.

202
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,010
And now we are launching five
similar algorithms for you,

203
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,720
out of the box in Connect,

204
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,660
that you can build you within an AI agent

205
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,330
and deliver in a customer experience.

206
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,510
So the first is Recommended for You.

207
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,390
Recommended for You is a
one-on-one personalization.

208
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,310
This model tends to know your customer

209
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,290
on a one-on-one basis.

210
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,050
What does Jack like? What do
I really recommend to Jack?

211
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,870
So that's the crux of that model.

212
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,910
The second is Similar Items.

213
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,760
This model will help you
deliver the perfect alternative.

214
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,920
What if your customer's
here to buy a new T-shirt

215
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,270
and you're out of the T-shirt?

216
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,460
How do I provide them
a perfect alternative,

217
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,927
a similar item so that they feel like,

218
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:24,441
"Yeah, this seems like
something I would buy too,"

219
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:26,613
and then go ahead and make that purchase.

220
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,390
The other is Frequently Paired,

221
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,870
which is your classic upsell
and cross-sell algorithm.

222
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,890
So if a customer has a high
propensity for shopping,

223
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,870
let's say, pet food items,

224
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,490
they probably are also shopping
for pet dirt bags, right?

225
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,920
So something of that sort, you
can frequently pair the items

226
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,810
and you can provide it to your customers.

227
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,120
And then Trending Now is
your classic algorithm

228
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,740
for what's trending, what's hot now,

229
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,180
what is every customer buying,

230
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,700
and how do you deliver
that to your end user?

231
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,920
And the last one is Popular Items,

232
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,900
which is, what are your
popular items in general,

233
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,730
what are your consumers buying from you,

234
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,860
and how do you provide that

235
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,830
to your end users using this algorithm,

236
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,660
either through the medium of the AI agent

237
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,313
or directly in your websites?

238
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,610
And then finally, what's
the real outcome, right?

239
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,930
I have these algorithms.

240
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,120
What are the outcomes
that I'm going to achieve?

241
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,020
Increase in revenue? Increase
in customer lifetime value?

242
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,820
And then decrease in abandonment, right?

243
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,590
Where your customers are coming in,

244
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,716
they don't see what they like,

245
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:28,140
it's a hard time to figure out

246
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,970
what they even want to purchase from you,

247
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,350
and then they just abandon your cart,

248
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,550
and then they leave you.

249
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,580
That was a lot of talk. Let's
see some of this in action.

250
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,190
So I'm gonna show you a quick demo

251
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,860
of an agentic powered
personalized interaction

252
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,773
using all of these AI
features that I just spoke of.

253
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,570
So we are gonna start with
our first persona, Priya.

254
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,350
She's a revenue growth
manager at AnyCompany Retail.

255
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,373
And her challenge is

256
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:58,860
that they're now entering
the summer season.

257
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,900
They've launched a summer collection,

258
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,210
and she needs to do an outbound campaign

259
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,540
that's personalized and reaching
to the right people, right?

260
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,300
So she's saying, "Hey, I
wanna identify the customers

261
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,330
who are likely to attend
special events this summer

262
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,330
and are more likely to buy
our summer collection."

263
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,640
And she wants to do a
more personalized campaign

264
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,130
and not a generic mass campaign.

265
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,330
So how does she do this
with Amazon Connect?

266
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,150
Within Amazon Connect,

267
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:31,080
we have customer segmentation
and customer trends.

268
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,330
So using your customer profile data,

269
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,880
you automatically get the customer trends

270
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,740
available on your screen.

271
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,860
Priya likes the summer events
collection launch trend,

272
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,540
and she starts seeing a segmentation,

273
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,890
which is a list of customers

274
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,470
who have a high propensity of buying

275
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,390
if she launches this campaign.

276
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,120
She also has the capability
of entering a prompt

277
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,340
that show me customers who've purchased,

278
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,420
occasion where more than three
times in the last 18 months,

279
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,403
and who are high-valued customers.

280
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,010
Once she likes what she sees,

281
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,013
she can go ahead and create an
automated outbound campaign.

282
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,130
It's a simple step to create a campaign.

283
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,070
She just has to click on
a few options on the UI.

284
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,650
She chooses to launch an email campaign.

285
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,483
And once she likes what she sees,

286
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,770
she puts in the time zone,
the communication time,

287
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,380
and then she just clicks on Publish.

288
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,640
So very simple.

289
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,290
Just in a few steps,

290
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,900
Priya has used AI to find the right target

291
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,450
and segment of customers
she needs to reach out to,

292
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,610
and she's gone ahead
and created a campaign

293
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,830
in the communication
channel of her choice,

294
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,230
when in this case was email.

295
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,570
Now let's see what happens next, right?

296
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,310
Now the moment has arrived,

297
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,770
we have our next persona, which is Maya.

298
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,960
So she's a frequent high-value customer

299
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,980
of AnyCompany Retail, and
she's having a Saturday coffee,

300
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,950
and she just received a
personalized notification that,

301
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,530
you know, there's a
summer collection launch

302
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,090
and she thinks it's perfect timing,

303
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,640
so let's see what happens next.

304
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,830
So she receives an email

305
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,240
that "Your Summer Collection Awaits,

306
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,550
we are giving you a 15% off."

307
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,920
And she can also chat with Stella,

308
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,620
which is an AI agent or an AI stylist

309
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,670
that AnyCompany retail has
built on Amazon Connect

310
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,440
along with the FY algorithm models

311
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,210
that I was talking about earlier.

312
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,400
And I'm gonna show you what happens

313
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,450
when Maya starts interacting with Stella.

314
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,680
So Maya logs into the app,
she browses on the app,

315
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,970
she's looking at some items, right?

316
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,330
She's looking at a champagne
silk dress, a navy midi dress.

317
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,960
So before I play out the
demo, I just wanted to share

318
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,790
that she's browsing
through a lot of items,

319
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,860
so we are capturing these clicks,

320
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,270
which is a part of the profile,

321
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,890
and now we are going to use those clicks

322
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,240
to give her a more
personalized recommendation.

323
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,170
So Maya is just browsing,
she's gonna scroll down,

324
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,380
and then she's also gonna start
an interaction with Stella,

325
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,740
who's the AI stylist that's
built on Amazon Connect.

326
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,427
So Stella recognizes her and says,

327
00:14:00,427 --> 00:14:03,060
"I noticed you were looking
at the champagne silk dress.

328
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,010
Are you shopping for a special occasion?"

329
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,950
And Maya says, "Yes, for
a wedding next month."

330
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,140
So Stella wants to know, "Tell
me more about the wedding.

331
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,370
Where is service of wedding?"

332
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,760
So, apparently, it's an
outdoor wedding in Napa Valley

333
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,010
and she wants a cocktail attire.

334
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,900
So this is where the
product recommendation

335
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,340
algorithm kicks in

336
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,647
and provides personalized
options to Maya, like,

337
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,110
"Hey, if you're looking for a wedding,

338
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,160
which is an outdoor wedding,

339
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,197
maybe these three are the best options."

340
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,710
So Maya does like the
champagne silk dress,

341
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,630
so she's gonna say, "Yes, I love that one,

342
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,030
but do you recommend some
shoes to go with that?"

343
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,460
So this is where the
frequently paired algorithm

344
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,950
comes into picture, and
says, "That's a great choice.

345
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,190
And guess what? Customers are
buying block heel sandals,

346
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,360
maybe a necklace.

347
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,660
Do you wanna go for that?"

348
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,730
Maya says, "Yes, I love that idea,

349
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,470
but there's also a rehearsal dinner.

350
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,530
So do you recommend something
more casual for that?"

351
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,950
So the AI stylist now is just
providing the top trending

352
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,120
or popular items,

353
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,063
which is the other algorithm
I was talking about,

354
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:05,940
and makes a recommendation to Maya.

355
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,590
So Maya says, "Okay, I
think I've had enough.

356
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,730
I've blown out my budget now,

357
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,950
so that's the only thing I'm gonna shop,

358
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,190
but can I get some discount?"

359
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,670
So once again, the AI stylist,
based on AI recommendations,

360
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,690
is proposing the Insider
applied program to Maya,

361
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,250
which she chooses to enroll in

362
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,990
and get some more, 38,

363
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,543
I think a 15% discount
on her retail order.

364
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,517
Finally, Maya says,

365
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:32,310
"I've had enough, I've
shopped these items,

366
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,370
but I do wanna get an alteration
on my previous order."

367
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,627
So to do that, the AI stylist says,

368
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:39,840
"Okay, I'm gonna transfer
you to the right agent,

369
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,360
and I'm also going to
transfer all of this context

370
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,497
to the agent as well."

371
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,210
So let's look at the agent experience.

372
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,050
How are we, how is Agent
AI helping the human agents

373
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,080
deliver a personalized
experience to customers too?

374
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,970
So for anyone who's not seen this before,

375
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,900
this is the Amazon Connect
agent workspace out of the box.

376
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,080
We have Agent Jordan
who's just received a chat

377
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,280
coming in from Maya, with
all the context and history,

378
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,433
her customer details showing
up using customer profiles.

379
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,440
And then Jordan is also looking
at Maya's profile explorer,

380
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,970
once again, an out of the box feature

381
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,560
within customer profiles.

382
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,800
It uses AI to analyze Maya's profile,

383
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,690
give her overall customer value,

384
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,723
and also give her overall
customer satisfaction scores.

385
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,530
Some of the next steps,

386
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:35,430
recommendations that the
AI assistant is providing,

387
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,990
that "Hey, probably Maya is asking

388
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,940
about the previous order history.

389
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,340
Let's go and review her order history."

390
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:45,907
And also, probably ask
her a few questions,

391
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:48,900
"Hey, which is the dress that
you wanted alteration on?"

392
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,330
And once Maya suggests that,

393
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,570
Jordan seeks the help of
an AI agent on the right,

394
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,650
that "Hey, is this customer
eligible for a free alteration?"

395
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,920
So the AI agent accesses
knowledge articles

396
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,210
which are available in the backend

397
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,180
and integrated with Connect,
and says, "Yes they are.

398
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,400
And why don't you use
this step-by-step guide

399
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,780
and just follow the steps

400
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,840
and provide Maya the free alteration

401
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,047
and also book her appointment
for the alteration as well?"

402
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,760
So as you see, in just a few clicks,

403
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,670
the human agent was
also empowered to use AI

404
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,160
to provide the right
personalization to Maya

405
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,893
and address her query
within just a few seconds.

406
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,720
So that's more going from segmentation

407
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,760
to seeing the AI agent in action.

408
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,800
But let's also talk about
observability, right?

409
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,570
We have our AI agent, it's out there,

410
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,070
it's helping customers,

411
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,840
but how do I know as a supervisor

412
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,670
that it's doing the right job for me?

413
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,370
So this is where we wanna
close the performance loop.

414
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,550
So, Priya, back to Priya,
she's launched this campaign,

415
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,320
it's run for a few weeks.

416
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,200
Now she wants to know how
effective her campaign was,

417
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,333
and was the AI agent effective at all?

418
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,570
Once again, we have recently
launched automated evaluations

419
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,580
for your AI agents as well.

420
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,010
So Amazon Connect always had evaluations

421
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,270
for your human agents,

422
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,360
but now you can also
evaluate your AI agents.

423
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,140
So in this screen, you can see
you have a unified dashboard

424
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,330
of your self-service AI performance,

425
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,730
how many contacts are going
through the self-service AI,

426
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,532
how many active AI agents,

427
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:25,470
also the AI coverage by
contact categories, right?

428
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,350
How many were using the shopping stylist,

429
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,830
how many were contacting
for returns and refunds?

430
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,970
And then you also get a trend

431
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,923
of the AI agent performance tools.

432
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,770
You can also see invocation by latency,

433
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,690
and there's just a lot more rich data

434
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,290
that's available out of the box.

435
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,110
You also get detailed contact records.

436
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,390
So in this case, you can
see an evaluation score,

437
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,680
not just for the human agent

438
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,630
but also for the self-serve agent.

439
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,210
And on the on your right and my left,

440
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,210
you can see the overall
evaluation score of the AI agent

441
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,540
and the self-service success
and the customer experience.

442
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,740
And in this case,

443
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,750
apparently the AI agent
did a very great job.

444
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,153
It did an upsell and it had a 90% score.

445
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,615
So that's more on the
out-of-the-box features

446
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:15,510
on how you can evaluate your AI agents.

447
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,260
But as always, all of
this data is available

448
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,700
in the raw format as well.

449
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,370
So if you wanted to build
your own custom dashboards

450
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,080
using Amazon QuickSight,

451
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,090
you could also create a campaign metric,

452
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,620
which Priya is using right now,

453
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,780
where can she can see how
many emails were sent,

454
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,490
how many emails were opened,

455
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,040
what was the revenue that she's achieved,

456
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,840
either through the email, opening the app,

457
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,120
browsing, the whole journey
of the customer, right?

458
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,020
And eventually, leading to membership.

459
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,340
And you could also create dashboards

460
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,260
for multi-channel performance,

461
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,790
how you're performing in your apps,

462
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,260
how you're performing in your emails,

463
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,670
and what's the relevant revenue

464
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,623
associated with each of those channels?

465
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,580
And also, your top AI agent actions.

466
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,950
How are your product
recommendation algorithms working?

467
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,780
How are your upsell algorithms working?

468
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,060
So those are the kind of
insights that you can provide

469
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,313
to tie back to real business outcomes.

470
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,150
With that being said,

471
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,669
let's talk about some
real business outcomes.

472
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:12,579
So for that, we have Jack,

473
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,336
who will take it forward from here.

474
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:15,169
- Thank you.

475
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:16,800
Yeah, so those demos you just saw

476
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,390
weren't art of the possible.

477
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,850
These all demonstrated what's
available in Connect today,

478
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,000
mostly out of the box with
some minor customizations.

479
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,260
And so to help illustrate that,

480
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,810
we have four customer examples

481
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,450
of production workloads
taking Connect's capabilities

482
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,310
and providing personalized outcomes.

483
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,040
Now these examples range from
four different industries

484
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,470
and a bit of some overlaps
in some of the features,

485
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,390
but mostly different parts of Connect,

486
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,650
all for the common goal

487
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,220
of delivering great personalized
outcomes for the customers.

488
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,190
So we're gonna start with
Saks Global and GoStudent

489
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,080
to sort of compare and
contrast the similarities

490
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,460
of how they use Connect.

491
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,660
So, Saks Global is a
international luxury retailer

492
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,360
with both a historic and
iconic physical presence

493
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,800
with Saks Fifth Avenue

494
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,830
as well as an e-commerce
division launch in 2021.

495
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,320
They've been a Connect customer since 2022

496
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,920
and have found great results
in providing their live agents

497
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,590
with good interaction
details for their customers

498
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,870
in these live call-handling situations.

499
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,040
They're able to use,

500
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,380
both the data that flows
through their systems

501
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,570
to make sure all their agents
have the right information

502
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,830
at the right time,

503
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,838
and they're also able to use

504
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:23,070
Connect's conversational analytics

505
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,690
to analyze the customer sentiment

506
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,090
so that they're able to have
their human agents understand

507
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,770
the intent of the caller

508
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,080
and make sure they deliver
the most empathetic

509
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,750
and accurate responses with accuracy.

510
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,140
Now my wife, she's actually
a very loyal Sak's customer.

511
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,580
So often she'll buy 10 dresses
online, try 'em all out,

512
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,570
pick two to keep,

513
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,940
I take the eighth to return
to the physical location.

514
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,890
I come back home, there's 10 more boxes,

515
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,030
rinse, cycle, repeat.

516
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,700
And ultimately, this is kind
of a problem for myself,

517
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,810
but great for her.

518
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,010
She has no problem.

519
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,130
And the few times that she's
ever had to call in for help,

520
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,010
they've been resolved so
smoothly and seamlessly,

521
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,560
it just maintained her loyalty throughout.

522
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,890
And this type of smooth,
seamless, personalized engagement

523
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,533
is also what GoStudent's can
provide for their customers.

524
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:09,690
Now, GoStudent is a little bit further

525
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,050
than East Fifth Avenue to
the east, based in Europe.

526
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,500
They are a continental provider

527
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,230
of tutoring via online resources,

528
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,230
and they use customer
profiles from Connect today

529
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,660
in order to help engage their customers

530
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,070
with the right accurate responses.

531
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,940
And the way they do this

532
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,760
is they're able to use
customer profiles to understand

533
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,310
where the customer came from,
their past interactions,

534
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,440
and make sure they make
the right routing decision

535
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,540
of how to hook them up
with the right specialist

536
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,550
to help engage 'em for their topic.

537
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,650
Ultimately, this has helped
them with their conversions

538
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,910
of getting new clients,

539
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,850
and they're now looking to
combine customer profiles

540
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,070
with their outbound
engagement capabilities

541
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,730
in order to go through their
leads list of potential clients

542
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,190
and using AI to filter

543
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,680
through many common questions and topics

544
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,070
before a contact ever
reached a human agent,

545
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,750
in order to speed up the process

546
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,240
of converting them to a sale.

547
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,790
And so ultimately, GoStudent believes

548
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,000
they can increase their
agent productivity by 20%,

549
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,680
handling that many more conversions

550
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,990
through this combination
of an outbound engagement

551
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,550
with our customer profiles

552
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,740
for more personalized experiences.

553
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,740
Now, they're a pretty good
example of, just like Saks,

554
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,310
they started off with a inbound
contact center use case,

555
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,380
but they're transitioning
now to also expand

556
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,720
and enhance with outbound engagement.

557
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,920
And this is sort of very synonymous,

558
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,540
the journey of Connect overall.

559
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,130
Probably many of you
have started with Connect

560
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,960
as a contact center,

561
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,960
but ultimately, it is just a
customer engagement platform

562
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,060
that helps you deliver
personalized experiences

563
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,360
wherever your customer is.

564
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,980
Now moving even further east then Europe,

565
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,450
we're gonna talk about Snoonu.

566
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,570
They are a leading
e-commerce platform in Qatar,

567
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,060
and they focus on delivery services.

568
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,120
They help with grocery
deliveries, food deliveries,

569
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,380
as well as pharmaceutical products

570
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,510
among many other business services.

571
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:01,470
And they've used AWS overall
for their personalization AI,

572
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,953
and which help boost
their ROI by 47%, 47x.

573
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:06,739
But additionally,

574
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:10,620
they're now looking to use
those personalized recipes,

575
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,020
those personalized AI models
we talked about before,

576
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,390
in order to even go a step further

577
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,720
in improving their
conversion rates for sales.

578
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,890
And so this is what it looks like for them

579
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,620
for two possible use cases exploring now,

580
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,620
is one will be proactive
suggestions of reorders,

581
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,340
looking at the customer's
purchase history,

582
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,830
the timing of it, and
making proactive suggestions

583
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,090
of "Hey, you should order this again"

584
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,610
or potentially making
this a recurrent purchase.

585
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,650
And additionally, the cross-sell use case,

586
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,240
given their platform nature

587
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,670
and their why types of
products they can sell

588
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,410
and deliver to their customers,

589
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,080
they're gonna have AI
models from our product,

590
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,540
they'll span and look
across different merchants,

591
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,890
different business services,

592
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,450
define the right cross-sell opportunities

593
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,460
at the right time for their customers

594
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,070
in order to maximize that customer value,

595
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,140
and honestly, meet the
customer in a better situation

596
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,813
with more seamless
transactions and deliveries.

597
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,420
And so this is a combination

598
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,040
of what's already in structure today

599
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,803
and what is coming out
just now as of this week.

600
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,600
Now the last example we
provide is United Airlines.

601
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,147
They've been a long time AWS customer,

602
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:17,220
and in 2024, they went under a project

603
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,380
to upgrade their media service.

604
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,213
And in the process,

605
00:25:20,213 --> 00:25:25,200
they noticed that their existing
custom entity resolution

606
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,320
for customer profiles,
that was an on-prem system,

607
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,010
was having some issues with
quality and durability,

608
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,250
and ultimately had led to a duplication

609
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,990
of 15% of their loyal customers' accounts.

610
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,670
So ultimately, they had
to go through a process

611
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,470
of figuring out how to clean that up.

612
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,990
And initially, after they
scanned this for just loyal,

613
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,540
they found out there was
problems across the whole base,

614
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,210
and they ultimately
settled on Amazon Connect

615
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,550
and Amazon Connect Entity Resolution.

616
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,860
With this entity resolution capability,

617
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,680
which is an AI feature that
scans different accounts,

618
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,490
resolves duplicates, and makes
a complete centralized set,

619
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,440
they're able to reduce
their duplicate entries

620
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,020
for all users by 35%.

621
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,760
And additionally, in
the process of migrating

622
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,770
from on-prem to the cloud,

623
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,230
reduce infrastructure costs by 30%.

624
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,560
And this is all from the
features that predate re:Invent,

625
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,840
but I will mention a
quote later on from United

626
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,400
of one of our new upcoming features

627
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,850
that just launched this week.

628
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,950
So speaking of launches this week,

629
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,320
normally when we talk about,
in these presentations,

630
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,820
the new features that come out,

631
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,330
there's maybe three or four,
and we dive deep into them.

632
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,860
But this year's a little bit trickier

633
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,570
because we actually accelerated

634
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,460
our feature delivery velocity

635
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,530
and now have 30 features
that came out this week

636
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,520
as part of Connect.

637
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,820
And each of them, whether
directly or indirectly,

638
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,400
touch on personalized experiences.

639
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,070
So to maximize the time we have,

640
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,230
we've only cherry-picked
about nine of them,

641
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,470
and we'll walk through
different categories of them.

642
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,970
Now the main common theme between them

643
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,120
is they do ultimately tie to agentic AI.

644
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,740
Ultimately, this is the trend

645
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,422
that's going through the world,

646
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:06,660
and very much so in the
industry of customer service.

647
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,650
And likewise, for Connect,

648
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,810
it's a very powerful
step function improvement

649
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,190
in what you can do.

650
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,480
Now in many ways, some of these features

651
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,350
are new AI technologies for automation,

652
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,124
a step function improvement
in what you can achieve

653
00:27:19,124 --> 00:27:20,790
and what you can simulate.

654
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,900
But additionally, as part of Connect,

655
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,000
we really just view it as software,

656
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,050
another step in a journey

657
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,510
of creating better outcomes for customers.

658
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:30,720
As such, all these
features around agentic AI

659
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,120
span across all of Connect,

660
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,740
all the different features we talk about,

661
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,840
outbound, inbound, different personas,

662
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,161
they just weave throughout.

663
00:27:39,161 --> 00:27:40,620
So the four buckets we'll focus on

664
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,020
have to do with AI actions,

665
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,350
the real-time engagement
with customers and employees

666
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,670
and how AI helps there.

667
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,280
Additionally, how beyond automation

668
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,820
AI can help your workforce
improve their skill sets

669
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,090
and solve harder problems
and uplevel faster.

670
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,670
The third category is really
about taking all the data

671
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,540
that flows through your
business and your contact center

672
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,040
and using it to transform that data

673
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,500
into meaningful customer relationships.

674
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,160
And lastly, a pillar for how
to accelerate your outcomes

675
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,450
using all the analytics

676
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,700
and insights that we can provide you.

677
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,020
So this is gonna be a lot of material,

678
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,390
and I'll go slow, not rush through it,

679
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,860
but not take too long.

680
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,140
I just have three
takeaways before I dive in.

681
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,960
There's only three things
to remember from this deck.

682
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,030
For this part of the deck,
I'd recommend just one,

683
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,680
we have AI agents in Connect.

684
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,850
They're out-of-the-box agents,

685
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,360
but also customizable to
meet your business needs.

686
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,940
As such, you can, two, personalize them

687
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,110
to your customer experience

688
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,000
so that you can make every interaction

689
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,680
have a nice tailored touch.

690
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,690
And three, we do have
out-of-the-box features

691
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,920
around personalization

692
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,053
to make it easier and lower that lift.

693
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,850
So starting from the top,
AI agents in Connect.

694
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,050
This is something we've been working on

695
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,100
over the past year,

696
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,990
and now we have a rounded-out solution

697
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,000
where our previous agents

698
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,130
that provided the its
assistance in self-service,

699
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,410
and human assistance,
more informational-based,

700
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,090
can now take actions.

701
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,680
They're able to take an input

702
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,900
and provide that output
by acting on environment

703
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,210
on behalf of the end user.

704
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,410
Now as part of this,

705
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,447
they're also able to retrieve
the right information,

706
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:13,770
and as such,

707
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,200
make it a very personalized
tailored experience.

708
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,480
But it also gives you the flexibility

709
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,850
to just make sure these
agents can automate the steps

710
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,810
you need to.

711
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,300
Now as part of this,
it's generative AI-based,

712
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,330
all empowered, but we have
taken a stance with Connect

713
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,670
to really allow you to
have deterministic flows

714
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,720
where you need them.

715
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,310
I'll touch about this a little bit more,

716
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,520
but there is this notion of
using flows in our flow modules

717
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,580
in order to interweave
deterministic workflows

718
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,510
where you need it,

719
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,760
or just when you're
choosing to go full agentic,

720
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,663
it's up to you.

721
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,430
One last call-out,

722
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,350
'cause it won't be the rest of the section

723
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,880
in terms of collaborating with agents

724
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,220
that might live elsewhere
in your enterprise,

725
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,410
this type of multi-agent collaboration,

726
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,350
as of today, we support
the collaboration of agents

727
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,903
via third-party MCP tools.

728
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,340
So, out-of-the-box agents,
I alluded to before,

729
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,050
we have some existing agents

730
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,620
for self-service and
human agent assistance,

731
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,630
and we've extended those, as of this week,

732
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,000
can now provide action automation.

733
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
These actions can be completing,

734
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,490
updating transaction, systems of record,

735
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,440
but also retrieving
information autonomously

736
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,420
from disparate sources.

737
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,400
But additionally, as part of
these out-of-the-box agents,

738
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,480
we also have a slew of new ones,
such as case summarization,

739
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,540
cast recommendation, and
a preview announcement

740
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,510
of a agent-scheduling, forecasting agent.

741
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,880
And ultimately, this is
just a showcase that,

742
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,020
as part of Connect,

743
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,570
we really view AI agents
as just another feature,

744
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,940
and one that for any of these
different types of workloads,

745
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,610
we're gonna provide ways to
enhance those experiences

746
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,620
in as turnkey a manner as possible

747
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,800
since Connect is first
an AI match solution

748
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,530
that does still allow
for interoperability.

749
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,150
So I wanna preface with this slide first

750
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,680
just 'cause these are
the agents we have now.

751
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,940
And there'll be many more

752
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,220
in just part of our overall strategy,

753
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,650
but now I'm gonna turn
to some customizations.

754
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,920
These will be the most
technical slides in the deck.

755
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,660
But since these have
been the most common asks

756
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,940
we've had from a lot of
customers, some of the audience,

757
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,190
I wanna make sure we call them out.

758
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,320
The first one, the most technical slide,

759
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,380
is about Model Context Protocol support.

760
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,380
As of this week, we
officially support MCP,

761
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,910
the framework for Anthropic,

762
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,650
that really provides a standardized way

763
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,640
for AI agents to take actions
and retrieve information.

764
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,130
As part of this launch,
we have some tools,

765
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,830
LM tools that use MCP protocol,

766
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,930
and they're provided out of the box.

767
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:37,860
These include the ability to
have an agent create a case,

768
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,230
update a case, start a task,

769
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:44,010
retrieve customer profile
information and insights,

770
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,240
and many more.

771
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,340
But additionally, we also,

772
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,320
maybe most importantly
for model customers,

773
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,010
apply the ability to have
third-party tool integrations.

774
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:53,880
Now this is all powered

775
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,820
from Amazon Bedrock Agentcore Gateway.

776
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,050
This way you have the ability

777
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,390
to set up servers
throughout your enterprise,

778
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,090
whether your own division
or sister divisions.

779
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,580
And you'll have the confidence
that you can take these tools

780
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,110
and integrate into your contact center

781
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,520
when and where you need them,

782
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,410
whether it's for the constant AI agent use

783
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,470
or even just for occasional
lookups where it might be.

784
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,820
Now, in the middle between
first party and third party,

785
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,820
I do wanna call out for those
existing kind of customers

786
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,310
that we have taking flow modules,

787
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,650
and we have turned them
into tools as well.

788
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,660
So you have the option to
go through your flow modules

789
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,400
and just hit a button and add them

790
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,190
to your own MCP server,
post it by Connect.

791
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,810
And the reason why we did this is, one,

792
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:37,260
we noticed that the schema
is pretty much the same.

793
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,590
There's inputs, there's
outputs through subscriptions,

794
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,910
so why not make them tools?

795
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,800
And two, it gives you the ability

796
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,900
to build business logic once,

797
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,390
and whether used in a static workflow,

798
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,070
human-led step by step guide,

799
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,040
or an agentic workload, reuse it.

800
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,130
Ability to build once and
reuse wherever, whenever.

801
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,440
Additionally, in order to
do third-party integrations,

802
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,550
this also gives you the affordance

803
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,470
to keep using your Lambda blocks

804
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,180
for data dips and transactions

805
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,120
as part of an agentic workflow in Connect.

806
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,270
Now, this is the main
customization that is new.

807
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,580
You can take your out-of-the-box agents,

808
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,660
tailor them how you like,

809
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,180
add different tools that
meet your business needs,

810
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,740
make your own tools.

811
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,360
But this is all part of the bigger picture

812
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,220
about how we let you customize

813
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,470
the agents that live in Connect.

814
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,400
And so these customizations
start at the prompt level.

815
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,800
For those who don't know, for
all the out-of-the-box agents,

816
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,710
for self-service and
human-led interactions,

817
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,950
we expose our prompts so that,
A, you see where they are,

818
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,500
but B, you can actually go
in and tweak a little bit,

819
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,660
or C, delete and rewrite your own.

820
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,390
This really lets you
tailor these AI agents

821
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,010
to your use cases and your unique needs.

822
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,220
And ultimately, adding
your knowledge bases,

823
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,060
multiple to each agent now, as
well as uppercase guardrails,

824
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,120
such as PI redaction, content filtering.

825
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,820
As well as the tools we just mentioned,

826
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,250
this ultimately is just
the different capabilities

827
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,130
you might need to
personalize the experience.

828
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,470
This way the AI agents that you deploy

829
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,030
ultimately know any information

830
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,650
you need to know about the customer,

831
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,570
know at the right time, dig deep.

832
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,180
And wherever the data lives,
these agents can extract it,

833
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,550
pull it in, and provide
the right reasoning

834
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,340
for action execution,
action recommendation,

835
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,203
and just providing personalized help.

836
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,680
So this is a sort of key part of Connect,

837
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,420
just the ability to
customize these agents.

838
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,570
And before I move on and to
the last technical slides,

839
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,090
I just have to call out
that although we have built

840
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,090
on top of AWS AI services
for these features,

841
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,913
it helps us move faster and
move at the rate of AWS,

842
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:40,200
we also have though provided
our open model selection,

843
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,190
we're relatively agnostic.

844
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,330
So as of today,

845
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,850
you can choose between
the Amazon Nova family

846
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,130
as well as the Anthropic Claude family,

847
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,803
up to Sonnet 4.5 later this week.

848
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,780
So a lot of these, for
instance, we've talked about,

849
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,000
really do lend itself really well,

850
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,580
and customer self-service,
not featured in the stack,

851
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,780
but as part of the Connect launches.

852
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,560
We have a Amazon Connect
Nova Sonic integration

853
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,220
that really allows for these
human sounding engagements,

854
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,830
that while not personalized
strictly in the data

855
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,450
that comes from the reasoning part,

856
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,550
it really provides this
human-centered interaction

857
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:18,000
that makes the customer feel
really sort of cared for.

858
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,440
Now, this is a huge step function,

859
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,550
what you can do for self-service,

860
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,700
but this is not the only place
that AI agents extend to.

861
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,620
And very important to us
that you have this ability

862
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,120
to take these AI agents

863
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,583
and use it to augment
your human workforce.

864
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,950
And so as a key pillar

865
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,100
of just how we've approached
AI agents in Connect

866
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,190
is this ability to not just interoperate

867
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,200
between your APIs, what agents can do,

868
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,550
but interoperate between

869
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,790
what workloads your humans
do and what your agents do.

870
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,010
So already before today
you had the ability

871
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,470
to pick when and where
to deploy an AI agent,

872
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,300
whether it's at the start of a contact,

873
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,730
maybe just an offshoot for some Q & A.

874
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,980
And also, likewise, it can be the choice

875
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,860
of when does that AI
agent maybe loop a human

876
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,270
into the conversation.

877
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,370
This could be via asynchronous tasks

878
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,460
that it needs for back office
approval before proceeding,

879
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,110
or it could be just escalate to a human

880
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:10,350
with our escalate to
human out-of-the-box tool.

881
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,420
And so this gives you the ability
to sort of pick and choose

882
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,410
and design your experiences

883
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,780
of how to blend AI with human workloads,

884
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,110
but ultimately, it allows you
to help them work in concert.

885
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,220
But having them work in concert

886
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,710
doesn't end once a contact is transferred.

887
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,560
Once a human actually,
employee has the contact,

888
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,960
we have the ability to
provide an AI agent assistant

889
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,270
that helps them guide them all
the way through the contact

890
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,940
or just recommendations for key pieces

891
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,293
of conversational turns.

892
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,800
And so what's new from
what we didn't have before

893
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,960
is this ability of task automation.

894
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,160
Now the AI assistant is able
to do back office backend work,

895
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,310
just execute transactions, look
up information dynamically,

896
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,890
all in the vein of autonomous reasoning,

897
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,780
as AI agents are likely prone to do.

898
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,760
But additionally, we've
enhanced the ability

899
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,500
to provide step-by-step guidance.

900
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,810
So whether it's a start of the
contact providing an overview

901
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,610
of what the human agent should do,

902
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,120
or dynamically in the interaction,
providing suggestions.

903
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,770
So maybe your IVR

904
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:07,350
is providing really good
information gathering

905
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,350
of what the contact's about,
routing to the right agent,

906
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,450
give 'em a nice summary and a static view.

907
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,750
But it turns out that this
customer has a second intent,

908
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,860
a second topic,

909
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,380
or just in order to solve
the primary problem,

910
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,700
just a little bit extra information

911
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,310
about a purchase order
history needs to be retrieved,

912
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,053
maybe for warranty considerations.

913
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,530
Before today, using Connect in particular,

914
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,150
you would have to program it

915
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,270
so that a human agent
clicks through many screens,

916
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,910
maybe 10, just to find
the right information,

917
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,520
tell the customer to wait
on hold as they gather it.

918
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,010
But now the AI agent can autonomously

919
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,740
just gather information,
populate to the agent.

920
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,930
And this way the human
agent can really focus

921
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,810
on talking to the
customer, being empathetic,

922
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,860
and doing things that humans are best at.

923
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,570
So these are, what I just presented,

924
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,673
are really, in many ways, foundational.

925
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,620
But there is a question now again,

926
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,060
well, what about personalization?

927
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,740
Yes, these agents can automate actions,

928
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,570
and it's very transactional,

929
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,730
but what about going back to the ability

930
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,080
of personalizing things?

931
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,000
And for this and our new capabilities,

932
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,910
a lot of centers on these
predictive insights,

933
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,310
not just having Connect as a ability

934
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,100
to sort of populate
just static information,

935
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,810
but really help generate ways

936
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,090
to find improvements in your workloads.

937
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,150
So, what I showed before is
really how you can customize

938
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,010
what we provide to bring in your data,

939
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,110
which is still very true and apt,

940
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,210
but now I'm gonna focus
on things you can now do

941
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,230
out of the box.

942
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,990
And that goes back to one
of the earlier slides we had

943
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,820
about our predictive insights

944
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,120
based on our own Amazon
personalization models.

945
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,800
These models work from out of the box,

946
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,700
and for each of them,

947
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,880
we have tools to let you
gather those insights

948
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,310
at any time in an interaction.

949
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:51,540
And so as part of this, there
are five models in particular,

950
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,650
and they really lend themselves well

951
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,780
to that cross-sell use
case or upsell use case,

952
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,200
wherever it's a chance to find
a better OI in a customer,

953
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,520
delivering to them what they need,

954
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,560
and maybe things they
didn't know they needed.

955
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,720
But additionally, one
thing I sort of hinted at

956
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,520
is while we have these as tools

957
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,590
and they could use at
any point of interaction,

958
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,410
what I mean is, whether
it's a static workflow

959
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,890
or generative, you're able
to leverage these insights.

960
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,700
So the AI agent can do it just
tool calling at any moment.

961
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,920
It's autonomous actor,
they can get the insight,

962
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,170
then make a suggestion
directly to the end customer

963
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,340
or to a human colleague.

964
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,060
But even in your workflows
and Connect contact flows,

965
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,650
you're able to query for these insights

966
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,157
and decide with conditional rules,

967
00:39:30,157 --> 00:39:32,460
"Okay, we have insight, let's populate it.

968
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,170
Or no insight, let's move on."

969
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,750
And really add rules to that flavor.

970
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,620
You can really get a chance

971
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,290
to both get these automatic insights

972
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,630
but still tailor to your user journey

973
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,580
that makes sense for your business.

974
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,070
And by journey, this really blends well

975
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,430
with our latest re:Invent
launch for app bank campaigns,

976
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,750
customer journeys.

977
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,790
Traditionally, with Connect,
our app bank campaigns,

978
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,240
were focused on one customer
touchpoint, one channel.

979
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,520
But as of now, as of two days ago,

980
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,580
you can now design an
entire customer journey,

981
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,820
whatever interaction might
be for proactive engagement.

982
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,560
Now these can be cross channel,

983
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,240
our newest channel of support is WhatsApp,

984
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,910
and you're able to filter in
different conditional rules,

985
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,680
weight, logic, follow ups,

986
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,570
whatever makes sense for your journey,

987
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,297
you can now build in Connect, both API,

988
00:40:18,297 --> 00:40:21,300
but maybe more importantly
from our visual designer

989
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,530
that is very much akin

990
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,930
to our our existing visual
designer in Connect.

991
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,160
So you have just one workflow experience

992
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,560
no matter what type of engagement
you're trying to build,

993
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,240
inbound or outbound.

994
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,150
So ultimately, this really
gives you the control you need

995
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,580
to reach out to customers proactively.

996
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,380
Since again, Amazon Connect

997
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,850
is really just about customer engagement,

998
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,710
whether inbound or outbound,

999
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,770
but also gives you the hooks
to just use REI models.

1000
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:46,710
Whether you're gonna lean
into agentic AI or not,

1001
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,373
these AI is there for you for
a non-agentic world still.

1002
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,970
So now I wanna come back to

1003
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,730
the United quote I mentioned before.

1004
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,770
And so besides using existing technology

1005
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,480
for the results I showed before,

1006
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,120
they do plan to use these
personalizing capabilities

1007
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,520
with customer profiles,
deliver better outcomes.

1008
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,350
Ultimately, they use
customer profiles today

1009
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,840
to get that complete
customer understanding.

1010
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,760
And then, now I wanna
take that understanding,

1011
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,200
user out-of-the-box AI,

1012
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,930
to deliver better proactive engagement

1013
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,630
every step of the way
of a customer journey.

1014
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,610
And so the example that
they're looking at right now,

1015
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,540
they're trying to implement,

1016
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,060
has to do with pre-ordering meals.

1017
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,400
That way before a customer
is opening up their app,

1018
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,960
maybe busy running to the airport,

1019
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,070
there's already a proactive suggestion

1020
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,570
of what meal they might wanna order

1021
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,570
based on their previous
history inclination to buy,

1022
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,720
and maybe some other
insights about that customer.

1023
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,830
So this is an exciting opportunity

1024
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,710
for one of the world's largest
airlines to take advantage

1025
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,900
of one of the world's largest
customer engagement platforms.

1026
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,400
But personally, I'm very excited

1027
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,230
since I'm based in New York,

1028
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,600
I fly out New York all
the time, a hub of United,

1029
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,950
so I personally plan to take advantage

1030
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,330
of whatever proactive recommendations

1031
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,223
they come out with, very selfishly.

1032
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,310
Now the last section of our new features

1033
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,300
that we're gonna cover

1034
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,440
has to do about how do you
manage all these AI capabilities,

1035
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,880
and in particular, these new
autonomous AI agent actors,

1036
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,560
these AI agent workers.

1037
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,480
And so when it comes to this,

1038
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,760
maybe a dilemma for some
or opportunity for others,

1039
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,980
we really view these AI agents

1040
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,160
as just another worker, a virtual worker.

1041
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,560
And whether you're managing a workload

1042
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,650
that's gonna be human-led
or AI-led or mixed,

1043
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,480
what matters most are the outcomes.

1044
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,100
You're building a customer journey

1045
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,020
and you're measuring it
against customer outcomes,

1046
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,540
customer KPIs, and everything else

1047
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,240
is ultimately just an
implementation detail.

1048
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,250
So as such, when we view this in Connect,

1049
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,840
we've, throughout the system,

1050
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,040
whenever we had an opportunity,

1051
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,640
we're taking existing Connect
features and reusing them

1052
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,030
to apply to managing AI agent workloads.

1053
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,053
And now the most notable one has to do

1054
00:42:46,053 --> 00:42:49,410
with what we showed before,
and that's agent evaluations.

1055
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,960
Traditionally, this is
human agent evaluations,

1056
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,960
and now it applies to
AI agent evaluations,

1057
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,460
but in particular, it actually applies

1058
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,680
to any self-service interaction.

1059
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,920
So whether it's a human-led
interaction, self-service,

1060
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,190
structured self-service,
like our traditional XPOS

1061
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,950
or a fully generative AI
agent that does everything,

1062
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,380
you ultimately can use
the same survey forms

1063
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,280
with the same customer
outcomes of CSAT scores,

1064
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,203
resolution rates, reopen rates.

1065
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,790
Was the worker empathetic
enough? Were they accurate?

1066
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:24,870
Just take those same scoring
to a contact and reapplied.

1067
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:27,630
This gives a, one, easy way to use Connect

1068
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,800
to do any workload,

1069
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,880
but two, it also does give a way to tease

1070
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,400
and phase out your agentic onboardings

1071
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,610
since you can easily compare
how well AI agents work

1072
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,590
compared to a human worker.

1073
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,960
Now for this, we will provide, in general,

1074
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,347
some proactive insights into like,

1075
00:43:44,347 --> 00:43:47,400
"Hey, we think this workload
could be automated."

1076
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,480
A lot of this will come

1077
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,700
through our new supervisor
Connect assistant

1078
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,300
that has been preview announced,

1079
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,320
but ultimately, we just
wanna give into your control,

1080
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,487
the customer's control,
that ability to govern,

1081
00:43:57,487 --> 00:44:00,210
"Okay, when is the time to
move a workload to agentic?"

1082
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:03,060
Maybe it's just routing
some contact percentage

1083
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,470
to an AI agent.

1084
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,000
Maybe it's the full contact.

1085
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,130
Either way helps you decide
where humans are best,

1086
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:10,740
and also, if you have any potential issues

1087
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,530
with retention and attrition,
it makes you a decision

1088
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,570
of when do you start
hiring more virtual workers

1089
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,693
versus human workers to
handle repetitive workloads.

1090
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,120
Additionally though,

1091
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:25,080
there are times where some
things are unique to AI agents,

1092
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,700
and we still have that end,

1093
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,300
the traditional, canonical
AI agent observability.

1094
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,598
And so these were shown
in those dashboards

1095
00:44:32,598 --> 00:44:34,260
in the last part of the demo.

1096
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,603
And for this, we'll provide insights

1097
00:44:35,603 --> 00:44:38,670
in what your agents are
doing, how accurate they were,

1098
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:39,630
if they're using knowledge bases,

1099
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:42,360
what articles are recurring, how often,

1100
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,010
and really providing you the insights

1101
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,140
on what are the virtual workers doing.

1102
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,590
Now this gives you the same
audibility as human agents.

1103
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,401
In fact, for every contact record now,

1104
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:55,440
you don't just see what AI
human agent was on the contact.

1105
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,870
You'll now see what AI
agent was on the contact,

1106
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:00,600
and even the tracing of
"What do the agents say?

1107
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,860
What do they do?"

1108
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,460
This way, again, regardless
of the the workload

1109
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,840
and how you deployed it,

1110
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,280
the contact records are source of truth

1111
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,100
of what happened no
matter who the worker is.

1112
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,563
Now, one of the benefits of AI agents

1113
00:45:13,563 --> 00:45:15,750
is that it's still a machine,

1114
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,550
and to the best of anyone's abilities,

1115
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,787
we'll be able to peel apart,

1116
00:45:18,787 --> 00:45:20,157
"Okay, well, why'd you say that AI agent?

1117
00:45:20,157 --> 00:45:22,110
What was your reasoning? What
was your thought process?

1118
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,610
Give us your train of thought."

1119
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,650
Something that's a little
bit harder with humans.

1120
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,760
We're not always gonna explain ourselves,

1121
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,140
and definitely not at scale.

1122
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:28,973
So those are things

1123
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:31,620
that will probably be unique to AI agents,

1124
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,120
and we're always gonna
invest in that ability

1125
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,220
to make sure you get
the same observability

1126
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,750
you expect outside of Connect.

1127
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,843
It'll to be part of Connect, since again,

1128
00:45:38,843 --> 00:45:41,340
AI agents is just another
feature in Connect.

1129
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:44,670
But to that point though, we
do find a lot of commonalities,

1130
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,540
again, in how you measure
agent performance,

1131
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,770
whether human or AI.

1132
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,170
So on that note, even something
like hallucination rates,

1133
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,080
while we will have it for AI agents,

1134
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,760
it's probably something we're
gonna look at for humans,

1135
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,680
'cause I could have made
up a lot of things today,

1136
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,513
who would know?

1137
00:45:59,513 --> 00:46:01,920
But we would have the same
scoring criteria to govern that.

1138
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,290
'Cause ultimately, it's just
like about the final outcome,

1139
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:05,373
the final results.

1140
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,930
So with that, that's all we
had to share from today's deck.

1141
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,370
And so any call to action,

1142
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,620
I would say that with all
these new capabilities

1143
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,520
we have launched this week,

1144
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,200
as well as the ones we had before,

1145
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,780
just recommend, give
them a shot, try it out.

1146
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,720
These new agent workloads
really opens up a lot of doors,

1147
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,880
and there's no better way
to see what works for you

1148
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,280
than trying out our new
personalization models

1149
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,100
and seeing what you think,
and providing us feedback.

1150
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,590
So thank you for your
time, and if you have time,

1151
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:32,880
it'd be great if you open up your app

1152
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,860
and provide us feedback via the survey.

1153
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,190
And for those who have any
questions or follow ups,

1154
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:40,860
we'll be outta the hallway
taking any questions whatsoever,

1155
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,830
whether it's about this
presentation to cover today

1156
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:45,497
or anything else about Connect.

1157
00:46:45,497 --> 00:46:46,950
Thank you for your time.

1158
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,190
- Yeah, thank you. Thanks a lot.

1159
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:51,357
(audience applauding)
