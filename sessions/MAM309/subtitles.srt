1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,643
- Okay.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,960
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,880
Thanks for joining our session.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,740
I actually wanted to double thank you guys

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,230
because let's face it, it's the third day

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,000
of the summit already.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,210
It's Las Vegas, it's late evening.

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,640
The happy hours are already started.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,470
We are already aware of that.

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,540
I mean, as Lady Gaga says,

11
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,950
You had millions of reasons

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,860
to ditch us, but I guess
you had your one good reason

13
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,893
to be here," and that's migration I guess.

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,560
By the show of hand, how many

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,300
of you are from overseas?

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,013
Do we have anybody from overseas?

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,845
Welcome, I assume the rest

18
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:43,020
of you are from the United States.

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,693
Do we have any locals from Las Vegas?

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,260
I mean this light doesn't let me, anyways.

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,093
Welcome.

22
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:51,270
I mean, how many of you have

23
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,310
planned your trips in person?

24
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,663
You did it yourself.

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,920
Really only you, so I guess the rest

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,150
of you just had the luxury

27
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,260
of an executive assistant
doing the traveling for you.

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,190
Good for you.

29
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,960
I'm really impressed.

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,140
I mean, regardless of
who did this for you,

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,580
there are a few things that you needed

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,650
to clear out before being here.

33
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,580
First off, you needed to
know where you're going,

34
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,480
why you're going, when are you going,

35
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,773
how are you going?

36
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,310
How much money are you allowed to spend?

37
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,780
What's your budget?

38
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,853
Do you need any accommodations?

39
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,220
All of those answers,

40
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,290
regardless of whether you're planning

41
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,090
for a fairly short trip like this

42
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,570
or a rather longer journey,
need some decent answer

43
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,520
before we can actually have a meaningful

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,083
and successful meeting.

45
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,508
And today I, Sassan
Hajrasooliha, a senior,

46
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,880
AWS solutions architect,

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,480
specialized in I mean
infrastructure, modernization

48
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,000
and migration along with my peers,

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,440
Mangesh Budkule

50
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,560
and Adi Simon are going to show you

51
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,770
how you can get data-driven answers

52
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,060
to the same questions

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,910
when it comes to your digital journey

54
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,750
of migrating your workloads
to AWS with the focus

55
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,553
of Microsoft based workloads.

56
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,253
Okay, first we're going

57
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:19,380
to talk a little bit
about a generic portfolio

58
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,680
of what a typical
migration would look like.

59
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,750
We going to talk about discovery.

60
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,960
Then we are going to go
deeper into each categories

61
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,670
of portfolio of workloads

62
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,980
that you might be running
on your environment.

63
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,450
The demos are all blended.

64
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,370
We're going to have an engaging session,

65
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,413
so let's hit it.

66
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,000
You guys here because most probably

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,530
your organization is one

68
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,920
of these organizations
that still have workloads

69
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,990
that includes this 70% of workloads

70
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,660
that are still running on premises.

71
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,880
Why you wanna move to the clouds?

72
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,250
Again, you could have a million

73
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,420
reasons to move out there.

74
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,040
The latest addition to
this mix is embracing a AI

75
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,923
ML in general and
generative AI in particular.

76
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,150
But we know that you need
answers to the question

77
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,983
that I brought up again,

78
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:11,190
and we know that those answers,

79
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,960
they're not easily got.

80
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,140
The main thing is resource scarcity.

81
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,020
That resource could be human resources,

82
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,130
it could be budget,

83
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,210
it could be timing, it
could be the skillset.

84
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,530
We know that you need

85
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,390
to be able to figure those out

86
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,973
before you can have a
successful migration.

87
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,900
I mean, when you look back at the journey

88
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,890
that people have already
been gone through,

89
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,810
you see some milestones out there.

90
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,280
First, I mean, in the late nineties

91
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,450
and early 2000s,

92
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,680
everybody was just running

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,710
their workloads in their
server room in their office.

94
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,510
Then they decided to embrace

95
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,100
the commercial data centers

96
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,770
and the concept of co-location.

97
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,650
Moving forward to 2005,
it was the early days

98
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,180
of cloud, people started

99
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,190
to embrace more of what cloud had

100
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,070
to offer and we had different

101
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,900
milestones moving forward

102
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,010
and right now our milestone is GenAI,

103
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,350
moving to the cloud for AI

104
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,350
and by AI, maybe in 2023
when you were thinking

105
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,000
about GenAI with your projects,

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,520
you were just thinking of
having your prompt somewhere,

107
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,600
getting some feedback,

108
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,580
getting some recommendations
from your model,

109
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,383
and then implementing it manually.

110
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,530
Then came 2024.

111
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,630
Now you could get better,

112
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,490
more contextual prompts

113
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,400
to the AI model using systems

114
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,770
like RAG and augmented retrievals

115
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,860
and more streamline experience,

116
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,840
but still everything was manual

117
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,320
and now head to 2025.

118
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,160
It just we want the AI

119
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,710
to not just tell us what to do,

120
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,900
we want it to do things for us

121
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,970
of course under our supervision

122
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,830
and under our security guidelines,

123
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,383
and that's what agentic AI mean,

124
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,180
and we are going to show

125
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,440
you how we can leverage

126
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,633
that for our migration project.

127
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,393
I mean for a typical journey,

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,270
one of the trivial questions

129
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,103
that you already know,

130
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:12,510
the answer is where am I coming from?

131
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,070
You already know where you are,

132
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,350
but in a digital journey like migration,

133
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,083
that is actually a question
that needs to be answered.

134
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,010
What are we migrating and why do I have,

135
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,383
and that would be the
concept of discovery.

136
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,460
Our primary go-to mechanism to answer

137
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,440
that question has always been

138
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,720
and still is, this mechanism

139
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,010
that we call optimization

140
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,420
and licensing assessment

141
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,120
or OLA as the acronym goes.

142
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,350
Through this process,

143
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,250
us as AWS along with our
partners, we would come

144
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,270
to your environment,

145
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,520
we'll scan your
environment with our tools.

146
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,720
We see the relationships

147
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,250
that you had with different vendors

148
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,390
and we would come up

149
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,710
with recommendations,

150
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,530
including licensing recommendations

151
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,180
from different vendors,

152
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,370
whether it's a good choice for you

153
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,170
to do to use the bring

154
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,510
your own license scenario versus

155
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,700
going and purchasing license included.

156
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,240
These are the answers
that we will have for you

157
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,430
if you go through the OLA.

158
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,320
If you're interested in this topic,

159
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,520
we have some resources

160
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,570
that we are going to share with you

161
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,120
towards the end of the session.

162
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,080
The question is, is there an
alternative way of doing it?

163
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,673
And the answer is yes.

164
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,700
I mean, you probably have already

165
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,050
heard about this service

166
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,360
that we put a lot of emphasis on

167
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,550
and it's called AWS Transform.

168
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,230
It's an umbrella of services

169
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,860
and modules that will
help you at each step

170
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,710
of your way towards your migration.

171
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,520
It can actually help you
with assessments as well.

172
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,830
You would feed it your inventory data.

173
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,860
Many of the common and
popular formats are supported,

174
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,270
but it's a generative AI.

175
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,840
Most probably if there's the format

176
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,680
that you understand

177
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,805
most probably our GenAI

178
00:06:57,805 --> 00:06:59,730
will understand it as well,

179
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,620
so it gets your inventory data

180
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,450
and based on the other supporting data

181
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,700
that you possibly can fit into it,

182
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,820
you will get some insight into it.

183
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,600
Let's actually see what
it works in action,

184
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,280
how it works in action,

185
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,320
so starting with the familiar face,

186
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,530
your vCenter, I have a cluster

187
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,610
of two SESXI hosts with a bunch

188
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,710
of virtual machines running on them.

189
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,050
They're hosting a plethora of applications

190
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,160
with different environments

191
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,450
like for example, this one

192
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,600
is a travel expense application

193
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,600
with three tiers of
architectural element into it.

194
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,420
I'm going to use AWS discovery tool.

195
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,730
This is our own tool for discovery.

196
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,140
The first time I'm going to run it,

197
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,900
it requires a new password.

198
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,703
I'm going to put my password here.

199
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,460
This is the interface for it.

200
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,250
The first thing I'm going to do is to,

201
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,980
give it access to my
vCenter environment so

202
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,760
that they can inventory
my virtual environment.

203
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,140
The moment I type it in,

204
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,180
as you see at the bottom,

205
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,570
the agent starts scanning the environment,

206
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,920
but that I want more.

207
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,170
I want dependency mapping data

208
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,580
as well as SQL versions

209
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,350
that I can later on optimize

210
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,080
and this is why I'm
going to give credentials

211
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,910
to the guest via virtual machines

212
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,590
so that they can go deeper

213
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,873
and talk to the virtual
machines themselves.

214
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,810
Again, the moment that I do that,

215
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,430
the database discovery

216
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,110
and network discovery agents,

217
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,250
they'll kick in too,

218
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,780
and as you see each one

219
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,930
of them has different refresh
cycle every hour for VMs,

220
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,940
every 24 hour for databases

221
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,730
and every 15 seconds to be able to grab

222
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,833
that network dependency mapping data.

223
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,300
Already, we got some information here.

224
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,780
Let's see what we have for our inventory.

225
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,950
This is the same environment

226
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,560
that you saw through the vCenter.

227
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,000
Some of them, as you see, they have errors

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,620
because the credentials were different,

229
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,660
but for whatever reason,

230
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,010
we can actually download

231
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,350
the inventory in the zip file.

232
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,440
If you look at the name, it says 28 days.

233
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,020
That's the how long we recommend that you

234
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,170
keep running this tool.

235
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,860
Logging into AWS Transform,

236
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,490
this is identity center
plethora of identities

237
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,350
providers are supported.

238
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,800
This is the front page
for our AWS Transform.

239
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,790
As you see at the bottom,

240
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,350
we have some customer testimonies

241
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,413
and some found what's new on those topics.

242
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,680
First thing we need to do
is to create a workspace,

243
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,200
so workspace is just a space

244
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,720
that holds onto all the
activities you need to do

245
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,063
for a specific migration project.

246
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,743
Okay?

247
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:44,370
We created our workspace.

248
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,540
Now we go in, as you see,

249
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,030
we have some suggested
prompts on the right

250
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,910
with the categories of migration tasks

251
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,280
that you can select.

252
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,790
I can directly type in the category,

253
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,780
the action that I want

254
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,680
to do to the model

255
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,963
and it will open up a proper job for me.

256
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,540
There it is, suggesting, I accept this,

257
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,730
suggesting for the job names and all that,

258
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,253
and here's where the
actual action happens.

259
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,530
Humans in the loop.

260
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,230
Now it's asking me for the inventory data

261
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,860
that I got from the previous step.

262
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,150
I'm going to upload my zip file

263
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,240
and I'm going to choose
my destination region

264
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,570
as the possible target for my migration

265
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,033
and hit analysis.

266
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,210
While it's processing my data,

267
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,260
I can see that.

268
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,790
I can see what the model

269
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,353
is doing through the workload.

270
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:48,540
It's showing me what the model is doing.

271
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,680
We have the artifacts,

272
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,113
everything that we fed into the model

273
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:53,160
as well as whatever the model generated

274
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,783
for us will be in the artifacts.

275
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,090
There are some collaboration

276
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,820
features within AWS Transform,

277
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,750
and of course the main
panel will be the job panel.

278
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,180
Each step that is done,
there's a checkbox.

279
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,130
The yellow means human in the loop

280
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,710
and this one is still
working, while it's working.

281
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,710
I can ask for anything for status updates,

282
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,323
for example, in this example.

283
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,390
It's giving me some example that these

284
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,070
are the actions that have been done.

285
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,060
These are the left ones

286
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,920
and of course in the middle this is done.

287
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,150
Let's see what this assessment
has provided for us.

288
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,940
The first thing is a PDF report

289
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,580
of an executive summary pretty much

290
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,060
of what is our prediction of the savings,

291
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,200
do we get on the cloud.

292
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,750
What are an overview
of our recommendations,

293
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,933
all that you need, nice
human readable format.

294
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,560
You'll get the same information as part

295
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,030
of a PowerPoint presentation

296
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,470
as well that you can use

297
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,230
as a basis for your presentations.

298
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,090
If you're a partner to your customers

299
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,103
or to somebody in your hierarchy,

300
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,190
all those data is already populated there.

301
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,543
You can use that.

302
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,340
And the meat of our

303
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,490
assessment is the casella spreadsheet.

304
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,130
Here you would see

305
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,520
that all those inventory
data that we fed into,

306
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,100
now we have a line by
line analysis of them,

307
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,840
the server name, the storage

308
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,300
attached to them, the specs,

309
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,890
the recommendation that we have

310
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,440
for you on which instance like to move it

311
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,530
and of course estimate
of each one line-by-line

312
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,233
with a separation of
licensing versus compute.

313
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,900
All those will remain

314
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,060
in your workspace even when your job

315
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,390
is done and you can come back to it

316
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:53,130
and use these artifacts again when

317
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,560
you're creating other
jobs for the next steps

318
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,910
of your migration.

319
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,610
As you see here, the dependency mapping

320
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,900
and all that, we can use them later on for

321
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,403
other steps of our migration.

322
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,813
Great.

323
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:12,360
Now we know that we have
discovered our environment

324
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,680
and we know that our workloads

325
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,110
most probably fall under one

326
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,550
of these categories with regards

327
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,220
to specifically Microsoft based workloads.

328
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,310
Servers and Vms, anything generic,

329
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,920
you think about your
infrastructure servers as well

330
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,110
as generic application servers.

331
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,470
If you are a Microsoft shop, 95% of chance

332
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,490
that you are using active

333
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,840
directory as your identity

334
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,193
and access management.

335
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,690
SQL databases has always
been the database of choice

336
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,940
for Microsoft based development.

337
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,680
Same thing with .NET,

338
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,820
but when it comes to windows

339
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,440
and web applications,

340
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,480
you might already be on your pathway

341
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,370
for modernization,

342
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,120
maybe through some
containerization features

343
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,443
that you see out there
and the file storage.

344
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,390
For those of you who are
familiar with our terminology,

345
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,213
we have this concept of 7Rs of migration,

346
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,410
of course, rehost, just lifting

347
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,420
and shifting again to another host,

348
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,330
re-platform, using the same technology

349
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,910
but maybe offloading
some management elements

350
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,360
to a third party provider in our case AWS

351
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,100
and refactoring means

352
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,080
just decomposing the application

353
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,310
and creating, again,

354
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,990
new to be able to grab as much

355
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,393
of the cloud native features as possible.

356
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,380
Now let's dive deep into each category.

357
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,750
First one, servers and VMs.

358
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,710
By the show of hands,

359
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,383
how many of you are not using VMware?

360
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,010
That's what I, oh, actually we have two.

361
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:44,940
That's great.

362
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,520
Okay, so for the rest of you who do,

363
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,160
we have plenty of sessions covering

364
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,620
this new service we have called

365
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,563
Amazon Elastic VMware service or EVS.

366
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,460
For this session, it's just enough to say

367
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,450
that we will give you

368
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,300
the ESXi host in your

369
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,914
account and then you can use

370
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,600
the technologies you're already

371
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,100
familiar with to migrate

372
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,610
your VM virtual machines to AWS.

373
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,060
We're not going to go
deeper than this into this.

374
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,680
The generic service that
we have for migration

375
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,180
and for the lift shift.

376
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,470
It has been around for a while

377
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,690
and it has been called application

378
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,270
migration service or MGN.

379
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,980
This is a service that installs

380
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,010
a little agent on your source servers.

381
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,130
Then it transfers blocks of zeros

382
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,630
and wants to your staging

383
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,460
environment in your own account.

384
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,710
When you're ready for the cutover,

385
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,610
either test cutover

386
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,610
or final production cutover,

387
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,740
we will hydrate EC2 instances

388
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,000
based on the launch templates

389
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,250
you define for each server

390
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,080
and then you'll have a replica

391
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,950
of your on-premises
servers running on AWS.

392
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,680
There is a minor revision to that as well.

393
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,290
In that case for the on-prem environment,

394
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,085
if you're using VMware, you don't need

395
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:06,480
to install agents
individually on each server,

396
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
but rather you rely on a central appliance

397
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,470
to do the replication for you

398
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,500
and we rely on VMware's
snapshot technologies

399
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,383
to get those deltas of
zeros and ones to us.

400
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,750
Regardless of which one you would use,

401
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,240
MGN is just the engine.

402
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,970
When you are doing the migration at scale,

403
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,960
you need to be able to
orchestrate to do wave planning

404
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,500
and make sure that the
dependencies are met.

405
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,530
So far, these were the services
that you would be using

406
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,460
to track your scaled migration project,

407
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,760
but now we've taken all those experiences

408
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,760
and has put them in the AWS Transform

409
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,410
for VMware migration category

410
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,803
and our Mighty Mangesh here,
will go deeper into that.

411
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,590
- Thank you Sassan.

412
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,040
Hello everyone, Mangesh here.

413
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,170
So let's continue the
server migration journey.

414
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,860
So we are living in a
artificial intelligence era,

415
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,413
so speed matters and how we work.

416
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,250
Large migrations are complex,

417
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,512
takes time, it's error prone

418
00:17:16,512 --> 00:17:20,163
and require a lot of
efforts and coordination.

419
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,760
So raise your hand if you believe

420
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,140
the agentic AI has a
potential to transform your

421
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,423
traditional migration processes.

422
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,623
Wait, you're right.

423
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,650
With that, I'm excited

424
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,243
to talk about our first agentic AI service

425
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,350
AWS Transform for VMware,

426
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,740
which seems simplify moving your servers

427
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,250
from your environment to Amazon EC2.

428
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,900
With minimum human

429
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,430
oversight using our
goal-driven specialized agents,

430
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,380
which we have built with the 70 plus years

431
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,560
of our experience, this
new UI provides you

432
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,250
more flexibility

433
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,720
and AI first shared driven

434
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,890
experience throughout your

435
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,153
migration process.

436
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,860
So let's see how it works.

437
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,990
So flexibility starts with

438
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,250
you are onboarding the transform

439
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,870
using all your own choice

440
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,180
of identity, whether it's Okta, Intra

441
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,073
or maybe AWS Identity center.

442
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,500
It has a key four phases,

443
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,180
starts with the discovery

444
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,860
where you can provide

445
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,440
your VMware information using your

446
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,420
choice of tools, whether it's RV tools

447
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,723
or maybe if you are using
a partner like a Cloudamize

448
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:39,090
or modelizeIT or the
Sassan already explain

449
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,740
our tool called AWS Transform

450
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,120
from discovery tool,

451
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,620
that is what we recommend you.

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,400
Once Transform agent has this all analysis

453
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,170
of your environment,

454
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,520
then that agent will group

455
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,910
your servers into different waves

456
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,560
and applications.

457
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,370
Now you can work with
the agent to guide them

458
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,770
to group them based off your business

459
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,380
or technical constraint like example,

460
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,090
application owner base functions

461
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,823
department or maybe OS or IP subnets.

462
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,170
Transform agent also
understand your source network

463
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:17,070
and it translate that into
AWS specific networking

464
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,260
components like VPC subnet and more

465
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,820
and provide you the cloud formation

466
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,280
and CDK template which you can download,

467
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,500
make the appropriate changes as you want

468
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,363
and you can do your deployment.

469
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,240
If you are using third party tools

470
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,080
for the firewall like Cisco
ACI or maybe a FortiGate

471
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,930
or Palo Alto, which is
normally customer use

472
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,440
or maybe NSH driven your
networks, you can input

473
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,757
that information in Transform

474
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:43,593
and for the more context.

475
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,910
Transform agent also
give you the different

476
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,470
design options when you deploy,

477
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,180
whether it's a hub and spoke model

478
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,310
or it's a isolated VPC

479
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,270
and now it supports

480
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,240
the multiple flexible IP address mapping

481
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,450
along with the different
multiple accounts deployment

482
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,620
and that is very much required

483
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,140
for large migrations.

484
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,280
Once Transform agent

485
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,960
has these all networking information

486
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,820
and waves and planning and everything,

487
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,930
it goes to the next phase,

488
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,460
which is a migration phase

489
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,600
where it will orchestrate

490
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,021
end-to-end your migration using

491
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:18,513
behind the scene AWS MGN
service which Sassan explain.

492
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,780
Now Transform can migrate

493
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,180
your servers not only from VMware

494
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,910
but if you have a hyperV, KVM

495
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,770
or maybe your physical servers,

496
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,943
it can do that for you.

497
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,320
Important thing is about human-in-loop.

498
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,500
It's very important where
it creates that balance

499
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,060
between end-to-end automation

500
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,860
and human oversight so

501
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,900
that you can provide the user

502
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,640
input on every critical task

503
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,010
throughout this migration process

504
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,190
and it creates that unified

505
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,930
web collaborative experience so

506
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,400
that your teams enable

507
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,560
to do the streamlined communication,

508
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,540
resolve the blockers quickly

509
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,340
and award this coordination delays,

510
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,313
which are normally comes
across all large migrations.

511
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,410
Now with that, do we have
any alternative method

512
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,123
to do the large migrations?

513
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,030
So as I told, large migrations

514
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,220
are complex time taken

515
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,220
but also large migrations communicate

516
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,960
with different data sources,

517
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,730
different services, tools.

518
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,670
They have a number of pre-migration tasks,

519
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,870
post migration tasks.

520
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,360
These are the normal scenarios actually.

521
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,610
So how you work on that,

522
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,020
we have already one proven

523
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,540
service call cloud migration factory,

524
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,270
which customers are using
to migrate thousands

525
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:43,170
of servers at scale at a time, right?

526
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,450
But question here is can we take this

527
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,770
to the next level considering

528
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,200
we are now living in a AI era,

529
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,933
so how we work is matters most.

530
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,560
Example I'm saying

531
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,393
can I,

532
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,650
ask AI agent to analyze

533
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,110
my flow chart, migration flow chart,

534
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,810
which I have in my mind, right?

535
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,810
And ask agent to analyze this work

536
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,460
with the cloud migration factory

537
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,260
and create these all pipelines

538
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,380
and automation jobs to do
the end-to-end migration

539
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,550
and I will be as a human

540
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,480
and expert will make sure

541
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,400
that agent is doing right.

542
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,550
Yes, it is possible

543
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,820
with KIRO CLI as a agent,

544
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,500
now in this case my migration

545
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,330
agent assistant can work

546
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,460
with cloud migration factory

547
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,500
to create all these pipelines

548
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,390
and everything which I draw in my picture

549
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,100
as a migration, right?

550
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,890
Which I want to do, with
the help of MCP server,

551
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,630
which is a model context protocol

552
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,060
server which has all the
required tools to communicate

553
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,860
with the cloud migration factory

554
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,090
and cloud migration factory

555
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,410
between if you see the automation

556
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,910
engine that is nothing

557
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,310
but what, that is already prebuilt

558
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,960
automation using MGN.

559
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,130
So you can understand engine

560
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,510
services now so critical,

561
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,910
which Sassan explain it's used

562
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,343
in all our services,
it's a behind the scene.

563
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,460
Can you take this enhance more?

564
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,080
Yes, you can take the advantage

565
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,460
of AWS Transform now,

566
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,410
which I think Sassan
explain as our assessment

567
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,080
to do the assessment for
the large data centers

568
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,269
or you can use the wave planning

569
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,950
and everything out of that

570
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,550
and then import that into

571
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,440
a cloud migration factory to consider.

572
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,760
Now you may have a question,

573
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,780
what about the pre-task

574
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,003
and pro-task, right?

575
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,980
So you can take the advantage

576
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,020
of our Amazon bedrock agent core

577
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,990
where you can build
your own migration agent

578
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,670
to handle the task for you.

579
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,910
Example, ticket creation,
Jira stories or maybe

580
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,710
after migration DNS updates

581
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,560
or many more things which
are email communication.

582
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,670
All these things you can handle

583
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,373
through our secure platform agent core.

584
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,440
So now let's see this in action.

585
00:23:51,341 --> 00:23:52,174
Okay.

586
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,160
So this is the WordPress application

587
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,653
which we want to migrate, okay?

588
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,740
This is just a servers, multiple servers.

589
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,680
One of them is obviously
WordPress servers.

590
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,160
This is just on premises to AWS.

591
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,720
This is the cloud foundation factory,

592
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,580
which I already deployed to save the time,

593
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,310
but this is a blank factory
if you see it's a zero

594
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,680
zero server, zero
applications, everything.

595
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,260
I launched my Kiro as my AI agent

596
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,050
and now this is the MCPs tool

597
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,130
which is having all the tools

598
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,300
for the cloud migration factory,
right, which it will use.

599
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,570
This is the agent core where I built

600
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,430
migration agents like for one

601
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,570
for ticket creation,

602
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,340
one for email communication,

603
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,210
and this is the flowchart

604
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,830
I was talking about like there are

605
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,600
some manual tasks, automated tasks

606
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,170
and simple flow chart
starting with the ticket

607
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,860
and ending with the notification

608
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,020
in between migration steps.

609
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,990
Now this is the prompt I gave to AI agent.

610
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,903
Go and analyze this JPG file,

611
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:53,100
which I have shown you before,

612
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,470
and do the job for me,
create the pipelines, work

613
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,570
with the cloud migration
factory and work with that.

614
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:01,230
So that is what exactly
now it is trying to do now.

615
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,840
It is creating that all
pipeline behind the scene

616
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,470
with the cloud migration
factory using MCP protocol.

617
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,110
As you can see now it is doing that

618
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,360
and then it will also
ask you for the inventory

619
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,670
of your servers, which you
can take from Transform

620
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,620
or your own inventory in the CVS format.

621
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,940
You can give it to that.

622
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,940
In our case, we have three applications,

623
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,830
five servers and two waves created.

624
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,990
So if you go now cloud
migration factory UI,

625
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,790
you see that two waves,

626
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,680
five migration and five servers

627
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,600
and three applications.

628
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,560
This is the UI,

629
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,290
but you can ask the status from Kiro also,

630
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,900
like agent, what is my
status of the migration

631
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,733
and now you can see

632
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:44,910
that it will also try to create a wave one

633
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,710
because that is the one
I'm showing in the demo

634
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,740
to migrate the WordPress servers, right?

635
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,350
This is the UI of the
cloud migration factory

636
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,690
where you can control the teams also,

637
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,520
but we want to control through AI.

638
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,320
So if you go back now, yes, you can ask

639
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,070
what is the status of my migration?

640
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,520
It will go, but if you see

641
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,980
that migration is not started, why?

642
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,500
Because there was one
manual process previously

643
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,580
that ticket creation,

644
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,010
it's asking provide the ticket,

645
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,190
so it's understand
manual versus automated.

646
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,360
Now we are providing that, yeah,

647
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,860
I have a ticket, now it's going

648
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,050
to go all follow my flow chart

649
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,010
and do the migration

650
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,720
for me behind the scene using MGN.

651
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,010
So if you see now in the UI

652
00:26:25,803 --> 00:26:27,570
that this is installed,

653
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,680
the replication agents

654
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,770
behind the scenes started
the block level migration

655
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,270
and step by step it will follow

656
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,280
all the process test instant creation,

657
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,297
test and then cut over

658
00:26:36,297 --> 00:26:39,150
and then deploy the production instances.

659
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,280
All it will do for me example,

660
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,750
if you see there were

661
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,140
two new migrator servers are there

662
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,450
and now I can just ask
what is the status there?

663
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,940
Everything looks good, it's demo,

664
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,160
but there may be failures also,

665
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,840
you can ask a possible,

666
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,000
now you can see all the pipeline here.

667
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,800
Again, the main motive
is what we don't want

668
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,103
to go multiple UIs,
cloud migration factory,

669
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,990
then MGN, I just want to check everything.

670
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,130
You can see notification

671
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,810
and I got the notification.

672
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,537
This is the application
from new migrated server

673
00:27:12,537 --> 00:27:14,463
and this is overall status.

674
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,790
So this is how fast you can work now,

675
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,340
with the AI, right, you
can ask these questions

676
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,790
and in this it's a everything works fine,

677
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,590
but in case reality maybe it fail,

678
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,880
it will not able

679
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,110
to install the agents.

680
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,030
You can work back and forth with AI agent

681
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,730
and ask why it's failed

682
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,270
and it can fix it using
natural language communication.

683
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,133
That is the main intention of data.

684
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,680
So again, we have covered

685
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,270
how you can do the server migration.

686
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,950
We have multiple ways to do that.

687
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,660
I will suggest work backwards

688
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,460
from your own requirements,

689
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,020
whether it's a technical and business

690
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,530
and see what solution best work for you.

691
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,320
Example AWS Transform, maybe
Cloud Foundation Factory

692
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,316
or maybe our partners and services tools.

693
00:27:58,316 --> 00:27:59,700
Okay.

694
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,410
So let's see now change the topic

695
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,490
to core service active directory.

696
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,250
How many of you are
using active directory?

697
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,380
Almost maybe all right, this is the most

698
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,438
used application across industry

699
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:14,730
and very critical application,

700
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,770
we are thinking about the migration.

701
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,893
So let's see what are the
design options we have.

702
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,513
We have our native three options on AWS.

703
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,000
The first is a self-managed
EC2 domain controllers.

704
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,010
When I say self-managed
means in this model,

705
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,450
you are responsible for managing

706
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,283
this domain controller,

707
00:28:34,283 --> 00:28:36,540
whether it's a managing, monitoring

708
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,173
or maintaining throughout
the lifecycle of the DCs.

709
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,900
The key point on DCs,

710
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,160
if you can extend your
own domain to my EC2.

711
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,630
If you have 50,000

712
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,100
or maybe 100,000 of users,

713
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,640
you can extend that easily
with the AD replication

714
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,960
and start giving authentication

715
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,310
to your migrated application.

716
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,710
This is the fastest
way you can start doing

717
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,543
and most of the customers do this.

718
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,270
Second option we have is a
AWS managed AD has managed,

719
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,740
this is managed by us.

720
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,990
We deploy active directory for you

721
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,823
and behind the scene domain

722
00:29:10,823 --> 00:29:12,450
controllers so you don't require

723
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,070
to worry about the undifferentiated heavy

724
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,390
lifting of the domain controller.

725
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,800
We manage that for you

726
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,110
and this is an enterprise ready service.

727
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,970
So it comes with the seamless integration

728
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,440
with AWS applications,

729
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,400
maybe announced features
like directory sharing

730
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,263
or replication and everything.

731
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,110
But the key point on these services,

732
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,640
when you deploy the active directory,

733
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,820
you deploy as a single

734
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,860
for a single domain new, new
single forest single domain.

735
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,940
That means what?

736
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,560
You cannot extend your existing

737
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,030
domain to managed AD.

738
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,140
So if you want to provide

739
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,310
the authentication you need

740
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,100
to create a trust
relationships like one way

741
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,480
or two way trust relationship

742
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,830
depends upon your use case.

743
00:29:51,143 --> 00:29:52,290
Third is active AD connector.

744
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,480
AD connector is not active directory.

745
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,460
This is like a gateway

746
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,990
or maybe I will say simple term

747
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,823
it's like a bridge

748
00:29:58,823 --> 00:30:00,510
between your on-premises active directly

749
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,240
and AWS specific application

750
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,073
which support the AD

751
00:30:04,073 --> 00:30:05,550
connector to provide

752
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,140
the authentication and lookups.

753
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,690
This is one-to-one relationship.

754
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:12,000
So you may end up deploying
multiple AD connector,

755
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,320
just make sure that you use

756
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,550
the unit service account

757
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,503
to avoid the blast radius issues.

758
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,720
Now these options are used

759
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,660
by our customers all the time.

760
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,650
I across the segment,

761
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,690
whether it's a government, education,

762
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,870
finance, life science, healthcare,

763
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,490
I'm supporting these customers

764
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,650
to deploy the active
directory from long time

765
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,853
and we get the feedback.

766
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,660
They're looking for a
solution, managed solution

767
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,835
and AWS which is a flexible

768
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:40,890
and easy to maintain

769
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,540
and also get the managed

770
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,860
experience like the managed AD,

771
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,530
but they can able to
extend their own domain

772
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,363
to managed AD,

773
00:30:47,363 --> 00:30:49,980
which is not possible right now, right?

774
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,820
So that they don't require

775
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,410
to do the trust relationships

776
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:55,710
or maybe actual migration
from their own domain

777
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,360
to manage AD, which is a big project

778
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,710
as you guys know already,

779
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,543
it's so difficult

780
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:01,170
to do the AD migration.

781
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,930
With that as you guys
know, most of our services

782
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,000
and features comes from your feedback.

783
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,230
So I'm excited to talk about

784
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:12,150
our new service AWS-Managed
AD Hybrid Edition.

785
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,250
Now in this service,

786
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,070
you can extend your existing domain

787
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,710
to manage AD hybrid edition so

788
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,110
that you can take the
advantage of managed experience

789
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,250
because we manage the domain

790
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,680
controllers this for you, right?

791
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,220
And same thing like EC2,

792
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,773
you can quickly start
giving the authentication

793
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:33,330
to your migrated applications.

794
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,430
How you design this, though,

795
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,540
if you have a domain controllers

796
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,670
on premises, you can just

797
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,140
extend that as a additional domain

798
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,340
controllers on Managed AD.

799
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,170
Just make sure it is onboarded

800
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,100
with the system manager

801
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,450
is one of the prerequisite.

802
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,750
If you have a EC2 domain controllers,

803
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,590
you just extend

804
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,210
that now to hybrid AD.

805
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,500
So, but in this case,

806
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,730
hybrid AD domain controllers,

807
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,690
which is your domain

808
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,137
only is managed by us, but EC2

809
00:31:57,137 --> 00:31:59,130
and on premises is managed by you.

810
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,863
So it's a co-management now between us.

811
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,440
So let's see this in action,

812
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,483
how this works actually new service.

813
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,060
So if you see now

814
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,380
these are the two domain controls I

815
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,230
already migrated from my on-premises.

816
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,060
This is onboarded with the system manager.

817
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,020
This is important thing

818
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,030
to notice the OU structure.

819
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,850
You can see this is your
OU structure, right?

820
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,050
And these are self-managed

821
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,433
domain controllers by you.

822
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,160
This is the secret we need to create

823
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,740
because we need some access to your domain

824
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,240
to add the additional domain controller.

825
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,040
So we created the secret

826
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,140
and these are very specific names secret.

827
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,820
This is documented in our website.

828
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,640
These are needs to be the same names

829
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,193
and once your secrets are there,

830
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,465
your domain controllers are

831
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:43,890
onboarded with the system manager.

832
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,390
Now you see the new option here

833
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,270
in the managed AD hybrid edition

834
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,030
along with the normal our managed AD.

835
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,660
Provide all the domain information in DNS

836
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,670
networking is very
important behind the scene.

837
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,960
Provide all that.

838
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,700
Now you can see the two domain controllers

839
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,630
which we have provided,

840
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,860
which is minimum requirement,

841
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,050
minimum two, you need to
provide us to use that

842
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,140
for the additional domain
controller deployment.

843
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,640
And everything looks good but,

844
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,570
we are not installing hybrid AD directly.

845
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,950
We are creating the assessment.

846
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,783
Why?

847
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:15,616
Because we need to make sure

848
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:16,650
that whatever domain controllers you have

849
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,280
provided to us is healthy, working fine.

850
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,090
So behind the scene we are
going to check 38 tests.

851
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:24,923
We are going to run,

852
00:33:24,923 --> 00:33:26,490
which is very simple AD specific test

853
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,960
like resolution replication

854
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,460
to make sure they are healthy.

855
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,540
And this assessment

856
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,800
we are going to use successful

857
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,330
as is another prerequisite

858
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:36,180
to create the hybrid domain controllers.

859
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,420
And now you have to provide
the service account.

860
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,410
You can see the service

861
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,030
account which we have created

862
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:46,710
and then once everything looks good,

863
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,790
all the information is good.

864
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:51,330
Now you can say that create
the hybrid directory.

865
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,190
So behind the scene

866
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,700
what we are going to do is now

867
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,640
we are going to deploy

868
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,280
the domain controllers for you

869
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,870
in our account obviously

870
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,480
and just going to manage by us.

871
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,040
And you can see now IP hyphen.

872
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,470
So the IP hyphen is
domain controller deployed

873
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,450
by us for your domain.

874
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,190
But managing and the OU structure

875
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,750
you can see now, new two
OUs are added, AWS reserve.

876
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,670
So that is what exactly managed

877
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,620
by us all other is your domain anyway

878
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,500
and two domain controllers by yourself

879
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,090
and total if you see now

880
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,790
there are four domain controllers.

881
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,960
So you can see the two are managed by you

882
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,460
and two are managed by us

883
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,640
under the co-management with this.

884
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,550
And if you go to the actual directory

885
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,590
and see that, you know,

886
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,570
all looks like successful everything

887
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,760
and assessment is also successful.

888
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,280
If you click now the domain you will see

889
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,320
this is a managed AD kind of experience

890
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,390
where you can see the application
management and all that.

891
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,633
So we did that managed experience now.

892
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,680
With that I will hand over to Adi

893
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,980
for the next journey over.

894
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:04,770
- Thank you Mangesh.

895
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,720
It's through active directory.

896
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,810
Now as part of customer's
migration journey,

897
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:10,800
the next workload

898
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,290
that is most commonly talked about are

899
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,300
database and application.

900
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,640
Can I get a raise of
hand if you run Microsoft

901
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,230
SQL Server today?

902
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,063
Okay, great.

903
00:35:20,063 --> 00:35:20,896
Most of you.

904
00:35:20,896 --> 00:35:22,740
Alright so my name is Adi, I'm gonna talk

905
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,210
to you about your database

906
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,340
layer and application layer.

907
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,170
Let's get started with SQL Server.

908
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,840
Okay, now let's try to understand

909
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,010
what are your options

910
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,960
to run SQL Server on AWS.

911
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,160
The first option is Re-host
onto SQL server on EC2.

912
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,550
Now this gives you the
most flexibility in terms

913
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,975
of SQL server additions,

914
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,880
SQL server versions,

915
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,920
and you have a very
familiar admin experience

916
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,090
and full control of your SQL server.

917
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,620
Now you can choose license included

918
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,010
or BYOL if you meet the
eligibility requirements.

919
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,370
But full control comes
with full responsibility.

920
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,455
That means you are responsible

921
00:36:01,455 --> 00:36:04,710
for managing everything on EC2 except

922
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,600
for the physical infrastructure.

923
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,430
So what if you're thinking,

924
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,570
is there a way to offload
this operational overhead?

925
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,403
The answer is yes.

926
00:36:13,403 --> 00:36:14,370
You can re-platform

927
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,410
to our managed database solution,

928
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,990
which is Amazon RDS

929
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,340
for SQL Server.

930
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,440
With this you get the managed experience.

931
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,150
We optimize the architecture

932
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,510
for you, AWS automates patching backup.

933
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,370
You also get the high availability

934
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,200
if you opt for multi-AZ

935
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,020
and license is also
included in this option.

936
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,090
We also have a third option called RDS

937
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,770
Custom for SQL server.

938
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,510
This is where if you have

939
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,560
a use case where you need

940
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,780
to access the operating system

941
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,630
to install things like
third party agents such

942
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,850
as your security agents,

943
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,500
your monitoring lock folder,

944
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,783
this can be done with RDS custom.

945
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,660
Now that you know what

946
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,070
is your destination when it comes

947
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,690
to SQL Server on AWS,

948
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,310
let's talk about the approaches

949
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,420
for you to get there.

950
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,160
What are the migration approaches?

951
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,993
I'm gonna present

952
00:37:02,993 --> 00:37:04,830
to you four very common approaches

953
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,240
and the first one is

954
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,832
to use MGN application
migration service, which Sassan

955
00:37:09,832 --> 00:37:11,940
and Mangesh have already talked about.

956
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,020
To do a full lift

957
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,930
and shift from your SQL
server, be it on-prem

958
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,440
or on RD clouds onto SQL server on EC2.

959
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,150
This does block level application,

960
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,850
so that means everything

961
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,000
including your database, operating system,

962
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,040
data, configurations,

963
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,260
they all come along onto EC2.

964
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,450
Very simple, good for lift and shift,

965
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,400
good for individual database.

966
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,190
The next approach is gonna
be very familiar for all

967
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,350
of your database administrators out there.

968
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,030
Native backup and restore.

969
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,080
So with this approach

970
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,910
what you do is you back up your SQL

971
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,220
server as usual, then you upload

972
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,760
the backup file onto our storage services

973
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,340
such as Amazon S3 or FSX.

974
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,450
Then you restore them onto either EC2 RDS

975
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,860
or RDS custom.

976
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,720
But one caveat of this is

977
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,390
that you gotta take into account downtime

978
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,490
because backup then restore

979
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,830
undoubtedly involves some downtime.

980
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,730
So what if you want an approach

981
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,350
that minimizes the downtime?

982
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,410
Well, if you run a
clustered environment today

983
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,790
and you are taking advantage

984
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,409
of built-in high
availability features such

985
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:23,040
as you are always on availability group,

986
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,750
failover cluster instance,

987
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,770
log shipping,

988
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,603
what you can do

989
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:28,710
is you can spin up an EC2 instance

990
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,078
with SQL server on it

991
00:38:30,078 --> 00:38:31,710
and then add that

992
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,710
as additional node in
your existing cluster.

993
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,030
Let the node synchronize

994
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,740
all of your data comes along

995
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,300
and once you're ready you perform

996
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,930
a control failover on
your source database.

997
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,550
Finally, when you're ready you can

998
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,380
decommission your source database.

999
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,740
So this is great if you
run clustered environment,

1000
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,918
but this only works

1001
00:38:50,918 --> 00:38:54,300
if you coming onto SQL Server on EC2.

1002
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,820
But the upside is this can also double up

1003
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,570
as your disaster recovery
approach or solution.

1004
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,790
Now finally, the one

1005
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,260
that gives you most flexibility

1006
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,390
is DMS, Database Migration

1007
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,830
Service allows you to achieve

1008
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,780
continuous data replication.

1009
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,820
CDC, change data capture

1010
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,070
from your source database to any

1011
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,870
of the options that
I've just talked about.

1012
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:20,100
So you can come onto EC2 RDS, RDS custom

1013
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,390
with minimal downtime.

1014
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:24,720
So this is great for highly
available applications,

1015
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,970
but when it comes to database migration,

1016
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,820
it goes hand in hand with modernization.

1017
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:34,200
If you run SQL Server today, I would guess

1018
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,070
that you would run it

1019
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,620
on Microsoft's Windows server.

1020
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,810
Is there a way to save on licensing costs,

1021
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,170
at least on the Microsoft
Windows server side?

1022
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,340
Yes there is.

1023
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,840
With reperforming a system,

1024
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,490
this is a scripting tool,

1025
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,190
it allows you to export

1026
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,960
your SQL server on Windows server

1027
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,940
and restore it onto EC2 Linux.

1028
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,220
So you save on Windows licensing cost,

1029
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,410
but SQL Server itself is still quite

1030
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,880
expensive in terms of license.

1031
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,400
So what if you're thinking
about moving the database,

1032
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,600
modernize it to open source

1033
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,730
alternative such as MySQL.

1034
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:09,390
or more commonly PostgreSQL
such as on Aurora.

1035
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,680
You can use database migration

1036
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,060
service to migrate the data,

1037
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,930
but before you do

1038
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,150
that you need to convert the schema

1039
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,780
and we have a tool for that
as well, as part of DMS,

1040
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,910
we have SCT schema conversion
tool that allows you

1041
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,170
to convert your SQL server

1042
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,150
schema onto the PostgreSQL

1043
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,210
equivalent of or any
database of your choice.

1044
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,560
But up until now you have

1045
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,920
to convert this manually using SCT then

1046
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,600
orchestrate DMS manually.

1047
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,700
And what about your application code?

1048
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,870
Now, modernizing database

1049
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,220
without touching the application

1050
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,170
is considered a breaking change

1051
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,430
for your application, right?

1052
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,263
So you're gonna make sure

1053
00:40:42,263 --> 00:40:44,460
that you tweak your application

1054
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,650
to make it work with PostgreSQL.

1055
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,700
Up until now you have

1056
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,410
to orchestrate all this manually.

1057
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,370
But with that I'd like

1058
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,620
to introduce to you AWS Transform

1059
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,930
for SQL server modernization
that allows you

1060
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:58,350
to use the generative AI to orchestrate

1061
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,930
and streamline all of
these proven migration

1062
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:04,410
and modernization tools
to modernize your database

1063
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,710
and application layer
from Microsoft SQL Server

1064
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,000
to our open square SQL.

1065
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,520
Okay, let's see this in action.

1066
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,170
So as you saw from Sassan's demo,

1067
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,040
the entry point

1068
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,520
to AWS Transform is to
create a workspace, right?

1069
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,370
And you can create jobs
within the workspace.

1070
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,352
The job that we are interested

1071
00:41:21,352 --> 00:41:23,430
in is under this category

1072
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,140
called Windows Modernization

1073
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,973
and we are gonna need

1074
00:41:25,973 --> 00:41:27,390
to select the secret server

1075
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,630
modernization option to create this job.

1076
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,190
Once the job is created, you can see

1077
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,390
that on the left hand side

1078
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,590
you really got a guided

1079
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,320
experience all the way from prerequisites

1080
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,455
to the actual wave run.

1081
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,670
This is an interactive experience.

1082
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,860
You can converse with the agent

1083
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,450
and if you look at the prerequisites,

1084
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,100
it gives you clear guidelines.

1085
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,280
Now for AWS Transform to
work with your database,

1086
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,960
it's gonna need to access your database,

1087
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,570
it's gonna need a user
for it to use to log in.

1088
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,860
So this is our source database.

1089
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,470
We have a few tables
and we have a user here.

1090
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:01,200
This user is going to be
stored in Secrets Manager

1091
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,690
and we are gonna tag it
in a very specific way

1092
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,880
so AWS Transform can work with it.

1093
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,810
Within our database,

1094
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,550
we have a few tables as I mentioned

1095
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,350
and if I do a select statement here,

1096
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,750
you can see that we have
some data in our table.

1097
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,070
On the application side,

1098
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:17,190
this is an an entity
framework SQL server provider,

1099
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,020
and this is a web application

1100
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,390
that resembles a bookstore.

1101
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,970
Okay, now back in AWS Transform

1102
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,110
in the prerequisites, it tells you

1103
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,910
how you should tag your secrets

1104
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,440
that contains your database credentials.

1105
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,050
So make sure that you tag it exactly.

1106
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,210
This is documented on our website.

1107
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,770
And as for the code, make sure

1108
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:40,250
that you have got code
connections ready set up

1109
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,790
onto your repository.

1110
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,130
This can be GitHub, GitLab,

1111
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,120
Bitbucket, Azure, DevOps.

1112
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,440
Now establish the connection

1113
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,880
to your database secret

1114
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,610
and the code connection
from AWS Transform.

1115
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,350
Once you approve that,

1116
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,240
it will make sure to validate

1117
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,830
that all of the access is okay,

1118
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:56,663
IM rules are okay,

1119
00:42:56,663 --> 00:42:57,720
and then it will move

1120
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,550
on to discover your resource.

1121
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,710
As you can see, it has
successfully identified

1122
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:04,470
that there is one database
through this secret

1123
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,230
that it can access and it has also access

1124
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:10,020
and found success with the repositories

1125
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,360
that is associated with this database.

1126
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,880
Okay, now after it's done,

1127
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,713
then it's gonna move on

1128
00:43:15,713 --> 00:43:16,830
to the assessment phase

1129
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,810
where it's gonna look at the complexity

1130
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,490
of your database and application.

1131
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,740
So it's gonna look at all
of your database objects,

1132
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,510
determine its complexity, look at

1133
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,970
how your application access the database,

1134
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:29,550
making sure that it's able

1135
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:32,310
to do the wave planning which comes next.

1136
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,290
Now after the assessment is finished,

1137
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:36,120
you get a downloadable report.

1138
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,020
One of the aspect

1139
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,150
that you can download is the CSV file

1140
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,200
that contains a summary

1141
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,510
of what you have in your database.

1142
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:44,220
A well formatted PDF report

1143
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,170
is presented to you as well.

1144
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,400
On the application side,

1145
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,870
you see your repositories,

1146
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:49,860
complexity rating,

1147
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,680
and high level lines of code count.

1148
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,370
Once that is okay, you will move

1149
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,370
on to the wave planning phase.

1150
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,340
Now I've only got one
application and repository here,

1151
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,750
but if you have got multiple,

1152
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,920
the wave planning means

1153
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,753
that it will actually

1154
00:44:05,753 --> 00:44:07,980
do application and database grouping.

1155
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,600
So make sure human-in-the-loop,

1156
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,910
make sure that you review
this before you hit okay,

1157
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,710
because once you do so it will move on

1158
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:15,060
to the actual wavefront.

1159
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,880
The first task in the
wavefront is schema conversion.

1160
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,550
And you can get a Transform

1161
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,450
to create a new database for you

1162
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,910
or you can select an
existing database as target

1163
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,040
as we do so here.

1164
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,600
Once you confirm that this

1165
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,710
is the database that you want

1166
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,300
to write to hit okay

1167
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,170
and under the hood,

1168
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,270
this will orchestrate schema conversion

1169
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,270
tool to convert your
schema from SQL Server

1170
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:40,587
to our Aurora PostgreSQL.

1171
00:44:40,587 --> 00:44:44,100
Now if you head over to
PGSQL on the Postgres side,

1172
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,530
we now have our bookstore schema

1173
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,720
and if we expand that, all of the tables

1174
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,920
that you saw on the SQL server

1175
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,050
side are now present here.

1176
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,394
But if I do a select statement,

1177
00:44:53,394 --> 00:44:57,660
there's no data in these
tables yet, which is natural

1178
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,070
because that comes next.

1179
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,720
Data migration, second step,

1180
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,210
and you can also ask AWS Transform

1181
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,400
to orchestrate data migration for you.

1182
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,840
What they will do is under the hood,

1183
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,260
instead of you manually
having to create tasks in DMS,

1184
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,170
it will create and configure
the DMS task for you

1185
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,453
to do the data migration.

1186
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,600
Once the data migration is ready.

1187
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,665
And if I select this table again,

1188
00:45:20,665 --> 00:45:21,740
I will now see all

1189
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,700
of the data that looks
exactly the same as the data

1190
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,960
that we have in the SQL Server side.

1191
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,793
What's next?

1192
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:29,790
The code, right?

1193
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:31,710
So it's gonna need to look into your code,

1194
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,510
it's gonna scan your code,

1195
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,070
do actual changes to your code.

1196
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:39,810
It's gonna write it into this new branch

1197
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,220
that you can specify instead

1198
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,560
of overriding your existing code, right?

1199
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,670
So it's gonna change

1200
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,113
the entity framework classes to make sure

1201
00:45:46,113 --> 00:45:48,570
that it works with the new database.

1202
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:51,870
If you have embedded SQL
code in your application,

1203
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:53,190
it will change that as well.

1204
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,170
It will swap out the connection stream

1205
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,840
to make it PostgreSQL connection stream.

1206
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,670
It will also validate the application.

1207
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,680
It will also resolve any bill errors.

1208
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,820
If you have unit tests,

1209
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,830
it will run the unit test for you.

1210
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,840
Once that is done, as I mentioned earlier,

1211
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,070
it will write the results

1212
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,660
into this new target branch

1213
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,650
and you get a nicely downloadable report.

1214
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:16,200
This is quite frankly a detailed report.

1215
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,420
You can go project by project.

1216
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,980
You can even drill down

1217
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,620
to individual file changes

1218
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:27,620
within each project as
part of this report.

1219
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,810
Now let us switch over
to our code repository.

1220
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:31,860
You can see that we now have

1221
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,060
this new branch created

1222
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,080
by AWS Transform.

1223
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,913
If we take a peek

1224
00:46:34,913 --> 00:46:37,830
at the code changes that it has done,

1225
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,857
we can see that it has made all

1226
00:46:40,857 --> 00:46:43,020
of the necessary class mapping

1227
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,210
from the entity framework side.

1228
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,503
If you scroll down, you can see

1229
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:49,920
that it has actually swapped
out the SQL server provider

1230
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,290
with PostgreSQL provider

1231
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,650
and it has also swapped
out the connection string

1232
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,120
and links the connection string.

1233
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,980
So if you externalize
your connection string,

1234
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,440
which is best practice, it will find those

1235
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,110
and it will swap out the
secret for you as well.

1236
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,190
On the application side,

1237
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,420
before I show the application,

1238
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,860
I'm gonna make a tiny change

1239
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,440
to the data on the PostgreSQL side to say

1240
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,700
that this book title now
says 1002 instead of 1001

1241
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,680
that you will see on
SQL server side to prove

1242
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,520
that the application

1243
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,850
is indeed talking to PostgreSQL, right?

1244
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:24,030
So if I start this application now

1245
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:25,050
and browse to the book,

1246
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,680
it should now say 1002

1247
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:28,770
instead of 1001.

1248
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:31,950
So application is definitely
talking to PostgreSQL.

1249
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:35,820
Now database, they don't
exist in isolation.

1250
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,500
They go along with your application.

1251
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,990
So let's talk a little bit
about your application.

1252
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,030
If you're a Microsoft shop,

1253
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,770
you might be running some Legacy .NET

1254
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:44,820
framework application

1255
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,570
with a mix of more modern cross
platform .NET application.

1256
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,700
Most likely you run
this in Windows server,

1257
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,620
maybe some Linux server

1258
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,420
and you might have already
started your journey

1259
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,560
towards containerization.

1260
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,030
You might have already started using these

1261
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,590
container technologies.

1262
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:01,440
So what are your options
to run this on AWS?

1263
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,420
If you need full OS level access,

1264
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,740
you can run them on EC2

1265
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,820
or Elastic Beanstalk.

1266
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,250
If you need automated
patching, automated scaling,

1267
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,180
if you're on VMware,

1268
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,770
you can relocate your entire estate

1269
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:13,860
to EVS, like what Sassan
have already touched on.

1270
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,480
Now if you wanna run containers,

1271
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,070
we have a lot of options.

1272
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,690
ECS, which is quite simple,

1273
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:21,630
but powerful orchestration platform, EKS,

1274
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,370
if you wanna run Kubernetes,

1275
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,960
if you run your containers

1276
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,010
on Red Hat OpenShift,

1277
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,570
you can continue to run it

1278
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,339
on AWS on Rosa Red Hat OpenShift

1279
00:48:30,339 --> 00:48:33,172
on AWS, if you are on VMware Tanzu

1280
00:48:33,172 --> 00:48:36,090
you can run VMware Tanzu on Amazon EVS

1281
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:36,923
or you can also refactor

1282
00:48:36,923 --> 00:48:40,650
to serverless event driven
functions such as Lambda.

1283
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:43,170
So how do you get from
the left to the right?

1284
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,820
Of course MGN,

1285
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,460
but it's less common when
it comes to application.

1286
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,070
If you have access to your source code,

1287
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:53,430
you are most probably gonna
use your CICD pipeline

1288
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,410
to deploy to these environments.

1289
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,150
And Code Pipeline and Code Deploy can

1290
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,920
facilitate this for you.

1291
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,960
Now what if you want
to use this opportunity

1292
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,880
to modernize as you migrate?

1293
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,713
Let's say that you wanna

1294
00:49:03,713 --> 00:49:05,340
containerize re-platform running

1295
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,490
on containers or you want
to refactor, re-architect

1296
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,460
to embrace the more cloud
native architecture.

1297
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,190
This is what traditionally
gets quite complex

1298
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:17,130
because you have to manually
orchestrate each one

1299
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,960
of these tool that solve one piece

1300
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,750
of the puzzle, porting
a system for porting

1301
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,400
after container, containerization.

1302
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,822
If you wanna break down microservices,

1303
00:49:24,822 --> 00:49:27,630
you want to use another tool.

1304
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,140
So now we have AWS Transform for .NET

1305
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,640
that is really designed

1306
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,070
for transforming .NET
framework application

1307
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:37,110
and make it .NET Linux ready.

1308
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:40,860
So this in combination with AWS Transform

1309
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,660
for SQL modernization gives

1310
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,300
you a full stack modernization

1311
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:49,020
capability that is
assisted by generative AI.

1312
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,640
We also have Q developer

1313
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,190
and Kiro, which is our coding assistant

1314
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,020
with Gentech AI capability.

1315
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,960
Q developer is as available
as extension in most

1316
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,800
of the popular ID and Kiro
is a full featured IDE

1317
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,500
with advanced agentic capabilities such

1318
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,810
as spectrum development and Agent Hooks.

1319
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:07,920
So with that I will hand it

1320
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,270
over back to Sassan to talk

1321
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:10,953
to you about the next workload.

1322
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,530
- Thank you Adi.

1323
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,180
Well, the last

1324
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,700
but not the least important one,

1325
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,960
the file servers,

1326
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,120
what are we going to do with them?

1327
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,400
I mean this section will
be more really a review

1328
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,710
of the options you already have.

1329
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,290
First off, self-manage,

1330
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:30,300
bring up your EC2, make sure

1331
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,700
that you have proper tiers of EBS

1332
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,723
and the size of the EC2

1333
00:50:33,723 --> 00:50:37,410
that will support your throughput

1334
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:41,340
and transfer rates and the IOPS.

1335
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,303
And you'll be good.

1336
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,160
You want to offload some

1337
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,960
of its management tests to us.

1338
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,240
You would go to the FSX system,

1339
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,040
if all you need is SMB

1340
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,723
with Windows under the hood, then SMB,

1341
00:50:52,723 --> 00:50:57,720
I mean FSX four file servers
is the service to go.

1342
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,970
And if you need to go beyond that,

1343
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:03,750
meaning NFS protocol,
iSCSI, tiered storage

1344
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,610
and controls as such,

1345
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:07,320
then it would be Amazon FSX

1346
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,540
for NetApp ontap, the service

1347
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,890
that you'll be looking for.

1348
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,500
How you can migrate to them,

1349
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,100
you already have quite a few options.

1350
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,283
We talk deeply about MGN
for the lift and shift.

1351
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,640
Depending on the target
that you want to use,

1352
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,530
you might actually be
able to leverage some

1353
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:28,290
of the native services
in Windows environment

1354
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:30,840
for example, the FSR

1355
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,970
it has some integration capabilities

1356
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:35,880
with our FSX for Windows system.

1357
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,320
Or if you wanna go to EC2,

1358
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,490
your other option could be

1359
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:40,050
the storage replica component

1360
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,283
of Windows servers.

1361
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,250
I mean, and if it's
actually a very small one,

1362
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:46,260
you can simply use Robocopy

1363
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,480
or use a third party system

1364
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,433
and just do a manual copy.

1365
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:55,320
If it's too big to do it
over the network, ship it

1366
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,610
to us from Snowcone all
the way to Snowmobile,

1367
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,520
we ship you the device, a secure device,

1368
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,970
you loaded the data, ship
it back securely to us

1369
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,520
and then we will put it on
Amazon it's free for you.

1370
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,320
And from there you can decide what

1371
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,793
to do next with your data.

1372
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,093
And of course,

1373
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:15,780
the most straightforward
service that we have

1374
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:19,623
for grabbing all this
data is AWS data sync.

1375
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:23,790
Depending on what your
source environment is when,

1376
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:27,468
what access protocol is supports SMB, NFS

1377
00:52:27,468 --> 00:52:30,090
or S3 compatible APIs,

1378
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,860
we would get those objects

1379
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,900
and we will sync it to our backend.

1380
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,050
And then depending on
the target storage type

1381
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,210
that you want your data to be,

1382
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:40,910
we will just put it there for you.

1383
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:44,940
Real quickly, before we go

1384
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,350
to this summary, we just wanted

1385
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,150
to make sure that you know,

1386
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:49,260
there are some programs

1387
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,090
and incentives available to you,

1388
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:53,250
discuss these with your account managers

1389
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,390
to see if there are ones

1390
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:56,940
that you're eligible
for, but they are there

1391
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,710
and we want you to be
able to leverage them

1392
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,693
for your migration projects.

1393
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:04,890
Overall our whole purpose

1394
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,660
for this session was to make sure

1395
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,160
that your takeaway is

1396
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,280
that your questions might remain the same.

1397
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,140
But now given the new tools

1398
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,630
and generative AI based
tools that we have,

1399
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,550
we have answers for you.

1400
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:18,690
And we are by your side

1401
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:20,970
as team of solutions architect,

1402
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:22,396
account managers, CSMs,

1403
00:53:22,396 --> 00:53:25,650
and the wide network of
partners that we have,

1404
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,620
we are here to help you make

1405
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,423
your migration journey easier.

1406
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,150
Specifically, you saw that how you

1407
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,140
can now offload some

1408
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,720
of your management to us

1409
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,300
with the hybrid active directory service

1410
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,070
that we have out there.

1411
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:42,010
You already saw

1412
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:45,840
a demo of wide capabilities

1413
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,713
that AWS Transform provides
for you all the way along.

1414
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:51,600
And of course we just talked

1415
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,943
about the programs and incentive.

1416
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,450
If there's only one slide that we want you

1417
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,430
to take away from our session,

1418
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,200
it would be this one.

1419
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,360
Here is an exhaustive

1420
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,560
and extensive list of resources

1421
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,410
that will go deeper into every individual

1422
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,780
subsection that we talk today.

1423
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,710
We didn't dive deep

1424
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:17,820
into VMware or MGN, those topics,

1425
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,200
we have some resources,

1426
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,540
some of them are from this reinvent

1427
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,500
and right now they point you

1428
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,230
to the catalog for you to attend.

1429
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,520
And later on when we have

1430
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,140
the sessions recorded on YouTube,

1431
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,340
we will update this page

1432
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,900
to have the YouTube recording

1433
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,350
of all these footages along
with this one of course.

1434
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:37,140
And you'll see some blogs,

1435
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,580
some technical notes,

1436
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,760
some training materials
through our skill builder.

1437
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,770
So all of those we've combined here

1438
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:45,390
and we want you to bookmark

1439
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:49,530
and go deeper into them
if you're interested.

1440
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:52,203
And with that, I wanted
to thank you again.
