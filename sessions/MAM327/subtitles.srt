00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:02,939
Thank you all for being here today.

2
00:00:05,488 --> 00:00:07,599
Building net new applications

3
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:09,948
or modernizing legacy

4
00:00:09,948 --> 00:00:10,669
applications using

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,448
event-based architecture is an effective

6
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:15,989
way to modernize your applications

7
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:17,829
using events

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,809
and asynchronous behavior to achieve scalability.

9
00:00:21,818 --> 00:00:23,978
What happens though when the business

10
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:26,579
events and characteristics dictate

11
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:27,920
that that's not enough?

12
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:31,138
That's Martin and I'm Jeff, and

13
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:33,179
over the next hour, we're gonna

14
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,840
introduce where and how.

15
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:37,118
To include

16
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:40,098
AI and agents into your event-based

17
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:42,539
architecture to meet those needs of your business.

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,118
First

19
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:47,728
we're gonna set up the scenario that we have here at our

20
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:49,649
at our company, the Unicorn Gaming Shop.

21
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:51,598
We're gonna play a couple roles here.

22
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:53,959
Apologize that the cartoons don't look exactly

23
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,158
like us, but this is what licensing provided us.

24
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,179
Thank you, thank you, Jeff.

25
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:01,618
So my name is Marin. Welcome in

26
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:02,500
my name also.

27
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,980
So I am an application product owner. I'm

28
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,430
new to this company.

29
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:09,159
I have 20 plus years of experience

30
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,599
in doing these things.

31
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,159
Basically this company, I am tasked

32
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,448
to define new features to to drive

33
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:19,459
the greater customer satisfaction. The main

34
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:21,198
thing is we want to expand

35
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:23,620
and we want to try to automate as much as

36
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,299
possible.

37
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,959
Our customer interaction on one side,

38
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,469
but we also want to help our engineers

39
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:31,638
in the back end when we have an issue with the

40
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:33,760
application. Any type of issue

41
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,939
to help them out and to speed up the

42
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,969
process when they need to resolve some issues. Also,

43
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:39,239
we want to automate

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,599
part of the resolution process

45
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,900
so the only most important and most hard

46
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,900
things come to our backend

47
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,969
engineers which will then step in

48
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:50,198
and resolve the issue. We want to lower that

49
00:01:50,198 --> 00:01:50,959
response time

50
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,120
for our

51
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:53,739
troubleshooting process.

52
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:56,209
And I'm Jeff.

53
00:01:56,528 --> 00:01:58,790
I'm an experienced software developer and I've been working

54
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,969
at Unicorn Game Shop for quite some

55
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:03,198
time. I've been modernizing that

56
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:04,430
application over the years using

57
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,189
event-driven architecture and Event bridge,

58
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:09,449
and I'm tasked with maintaining and building the

59
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,528
new features that Martin's coming up

60
00:02:11,528 --> 00:02:13,569
with for the Game Shop application that we

61
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,639
have. And of

62
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:18,000
course, I do have lots of new features.

63
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,960
I'm new here. I need to prove myself,

64
00:02:20,278 --> 00:02:22,479
and I definitely have some big, big

65
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,788
ideas for this company. We need to expand.

66
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:27,409
We need to expand to increase our customer base.

67
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:29,429
Really

68
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,838
great ideas, Martin.

69
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,580
I'd like to hear some of these things.

70
00:02:33,038 --> 00:02:34,538
You may not like some of them

71
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:37,360
because they are really big ideas. So basically

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,469
I signed 10 new deals for

73
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,879
our company and that will drive actually

74
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,588
50 times user growth than what we have now.

75
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:45,500
So I think

76
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,000
you have your plate full for this one, Jeff.

77
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:49,169
Did you say

78
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,199
10?

79
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,939
And 50 times more growth exactly.

80
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,409
Thank you.

81
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,550
Please. That's

82
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,389
quite a task that he set me up for.

83
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:04,868
Some of the things that I'm immediately thinking about when I have

84
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:05,788
to deal with that

85
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:06,689
is

86
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:09,189
the scale that that's gonna cause

87
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,649
in terms of the overload

88
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,449
to the team that I have.

89
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,349
How about having the operational visibility

90
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:17,649
about everything that's happening across this

91
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,990
dynamically scaling and growing system.

92
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,929
I'd like to use AI but I got limited experience

93
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:24,629
with that both myself and my team,

94
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:26,069
and I got limited,

95
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,830
limited team, limited time,

96
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:28,909
limited budget.

97
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,679
Now, I mentioned before that I've

98
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,719
been modernizing this application that we have here

99
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,580
usingvent driven architecture and EventBridge,

100
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:39,199
and EventBridge is the core of what our architecture

101
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,659
is right now that I have in the system.

102
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,058
And EventBridge really is providing

103
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,500
me 3 things 1,

104
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:49,169
It takes in the events that are

105
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:51,330
coming from any one of the producers that we have here.

106
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,389
In this case, it's my application.

107
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,479
And then I have a bus, and I can have 3

108
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,679
different kinds of kinds of buses. I can have the default bus,

109
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:00,849
which integrates with the APIs

110
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,849
of AWS services, the

111
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:05,038
custom event bus which I'm using to handle the

112
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:06,758
particular events that we have in our system,

113
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:08,469
or the SASS event bus,

114
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,000
and then the rules is the third part of this, and

115
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,038
the rules dictate what happens with the event

116
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:15,050
that comes in and where does it, where does it go to.

117
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,399
Now I've been coupling that with

118
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,639
using the leave-in layer architecture

119
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,160
pattern.

120
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,838
The leave-in layer architecture pattern is

121
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:26,920
where I have a legacy system up

122
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,699
here and I'm building net new capability

123
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:30,730
in that system

124
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,600
off to the side of it.

125
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:34,670
I'm building that

126
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:35,709
using

127
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:38,389
event bridge here to handle particular

128
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:40,509
transactions that I have here that were business features

129
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,059
that Martin came up with before,

130
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:43,160
which is

131
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:44,250
introducing

132
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,910
an event-based chat capability to our

133
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,988
customer assistants who could answer

134
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,009
questions asynchronously with

135
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,528
customers that we have

136
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:54,949
who are purchasers of games through our unicorn

137
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:55,509
game shop.

138
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,519
And it works well,

139
00:04:57,838 --> 00:05:00,100
but I'm concerned about how that's gonna scale

140
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,738
with the amount of growth that we're gonna be having here

141
00:05:03,238 --> 00:05:05,238
based upon what Martin's telling me with 50

142
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,439
times more users,

143
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,920
that's gonna be overwhelming to our customer

144
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
service assistant.

145
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,420
And how am I going to maintain the operational

146
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,759
observability and everything that's going on

147
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,838
with all those logs are getting produced by all these

148
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:17,858
new things that are happening.

149
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,028
I could use my system as it

150
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:24,910
is right now,

151
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,579
technically it'll work,

152
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:29,079
it's serverless, it's event based,

153
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:31,798
all the messages flowing through there are asynchronous,

154
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,619
however,

155
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:35,399
it only scales to the customer

156
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:35,939
assistant.

157
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:39,149
The customer assistant has to do

158
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:41,269
the research to answer the questions

159
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:42,088
that come in

160
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,470
from the customer.

161
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:46,428
And it's slow. It's slow

162
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:48,428
because the customer assistant is doing a lot

163
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:48,970
of work here

164
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:50,949
and they're going to get overwhelmed.

165
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:55,338
I've been doing a lot of research,

166
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,939
and I've learned

167
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,199
that I can introduce AI to help me out

168
00:05:59,199 --> 00:05:59,759
here

169
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,220
and in the AWS world, AI really,

170
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:03,778
really comes in what we call

171
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:05,500
uh Amazon bedrock.

172
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:08,129
And Bedrock is our service that

173
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:10,149
provides API access

174
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:12,588
to both AWS

175
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:14,928
first party models as well as third

176
00:06:14,928 --> 00:06:16,569
party models from the leading providers.

177
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,928
What I like about this is with this API layer

178
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:21,069
is I can integrate that into my system

179
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:23,488
without binding myself to any particular

180
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:24,970
model, and then I can.

181
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,269
Learn how my system is providing

182
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:31,269
the answers that I that I want to

183
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:33,389
my customer on the far end, and

184
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,488
I can change the models as I want over

185
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:37,790
time. I can also

186
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,290
fine tune my models to even get better

187
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,709
um quality in terms of the results

188
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:43,670
that I'm getting out there

189
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:46,059
so I'm really interested in how I'm gonna put this

190
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:47,108
into my system

191
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,649
to really start to drive the

192
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:50,970
results that I want

193
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:52,709
with the customer that I have.

194
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:54,579
So

195
00:06:55,988 --> 00:06:57,209
I'm, I built.

196
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,809
A little chat that I can use, a

197
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:03,170
research assistant chat for my customer assistants.

198
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,399
My architecture is still serverless. It's

199
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,639
still event based. It's still asynchronous.

200
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,079
Now I have research augmentation

201
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,238
here through the integration of Bedrock in there for that

202
00:07:13,238 --> 00:07:15,678
customer service, the customer assistance person,

203
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,778
and it is faster

204
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,290
than it was before.

205
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:22,009
However, it's still not fast,

206
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,199
and it still only scales to the

207
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,500
customer assistant.

208
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:31,569
In doing more research, I got

209
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:33,838
even more information about this

210
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:35,230
idea of agents.

211
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:36,838
And

212
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,439
what really intrigues me about the agents is

213
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,959
they are autonomous systems that can

214
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,040
understand requests,

215
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,199
make decisions, and act autonomously

216
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,338
to do tasks.

217
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:49,678
This sounds like a great way to

218
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,079
augment that customer assistant and scale

219
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,379
to the business that I have.

220
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,899
And when I think about the agents, they come in

221
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:57,209
a couple of different styles.

222
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,980
First, I can be thinking about agents that do

223
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,088
department level tasks, which are things that are

224
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:03,790
going to require data that's very near,

225
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:06,449
typically things that aren't going to be terribly complicated, and

226
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:07,720
maybe the security is not

227
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:09,720
that strong in that area.

228
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,358
Organization agent agents will work

229
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:14,819
across the boundaries of my systems, maybe

230
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,220
across the boundaries of my lines of business inside my company.

231
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:19,899
Usually greater access to data security is

232
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,689
going to start to become

233
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:23,149
a little bit more important here

234
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:24,809
in terms of who can access what

235
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:26,649
and then external agents,

236
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,028
which are going to be working outside the boundaries of

237
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:30,588
my application,

238
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,178
outside the boundaries of my company, interacting

239
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:35,529
with third party APIs and third party data.

240
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:38,229
I absolutely need a lot of control

241
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:39,808
in what's happening in there.

242
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:42,298
And as I think about this, I think about how am

243
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:44,389
I going to manage all of this

244
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:46,428
in this world and how am I going to run it.

245
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:49,750
And that's where Amazon

246
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,389
Bedrock Agent Corp comes in,

247
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:54,808
and it provides 3 things for me.

248
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:55,889
First,

249
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,710
it provides the tools and the memory

250
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,889
that my agent needs, and the memory

251
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:01,879
is really important

252
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,308
because a lot of times when you're doing prototyping with

253
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,178
with agents,

254
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,570
they're very short term memory, meaning you

255
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,599
give them a task, they do it, they forget about

256
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,928
it when they're done, you ask them a subsequent

257
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:14,048
question and they gotta go redo everything they did the first

258
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:16,259
time. With this, there's memory

259
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,259
built into this through agent course of that

260
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,298
agent, so when you ask subsequent

261
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:22,340
questions, they remember what was theirs

262
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,239
before and you can chain everything together.

263
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,058
Second, it provides the runtime

264
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:29,340
environment and the identity management

265
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,340
of the agent so that I can then

266
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,678
control who can

267
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:35,440
access that agent and what that agent is allowed

268
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,558
to do. This is important

269
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:39,479
to me because that agent that I have

270
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,798
is going to be producing recommendations,

271
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:44,139
is going to be interacting with a large

272
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:46,200
set of data, and is gonna be responding

273
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,820
back, uh, externally.

274
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,158
And third, the observability.

275
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:52,859
There's gonna be a lot going on in the system

276
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,298
as it scales, and it's gonna producing

277
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,619
a lot of decisions. I need to

278
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,619
have the observability not only

279
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:01,879
into the logs that it's getting that are getting

280
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,979
produced from the transactions that are happening here,

281
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,629
but I need to also be able to kind of audit and observe

282
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:08,859
how that agent made the decisions that it

283
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,019
did so that I can train the model

284
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:13,000
even further to make the decisions even

285
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,460
more in line with what I want going

286
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,149
forward. Now

287
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:23,609
as I think about bringing this all together

288
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:25,969
in my application, there's two

289
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:28,950
real patterns that I'm focusing on here

290
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,428
with my existing application

291
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,009
and how I would be integrating and incorporating

292
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:36,619
agents for the decision making that I wanna

293
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:37,369
have in here,

294
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,109
and this is where everything kind

295
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:42,149
of comes together with event bridge and the agent.

296
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:43,590
So first, the first pattern.

297
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,859
Event bridge triggering agents.

298
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,879
In this case,

299
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,369
events are coming in from any number of sources.

300
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,479
It could be S3. It could be a schedule. It could

301
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,599
be lambda. In my case, it's going to be

302
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:57,000
this web application that I have that has a chat

303
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,239
built into it.

304
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,639
The messages come through as event into

305
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,918
Event bridge, and Event bridge is going to.

306
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,359
Invoke

307
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:06,979
Bedrock to go do something in

308
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:09,139
the case that I have here it's going to be

309
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,519
go do some research

310
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,259
based upon what the customer is asking for and

311
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,058
provide back a recommendation

312
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,500
on what could serve the need of that

313
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,629
particular customer.

314
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:21,038
The second one

315
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,639
is agent triggered event based

316
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,119
agent triggered

317
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,538
event bridge events. This is kind of the opposite

318
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:30,038
of it. This starts by the agent

319
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:31,139
doing something,

320
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:33,859
doing some research, making a decision, looking

321
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,678
at something,

322
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:37,279
and then it producing an event

323
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:39,500
that gets put out onto event bridge that

324
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,038
can then work in a fan out kind of pattern

325
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:44,340
to say anyone who wants to do

326
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,418
something based upon this event can now go do

327
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:47,739
something based upon this event.

328
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,099
Together

329
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:53,710
These two patterns are going to help me greatly

330
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:56,168
in how I need to both handle the concerns

331
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:57,399
that I have around.

332
00:11:58,288 --> 00:11:59,359
Producing this

333
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,119
game recommended

334
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:04,058
game recommendation feature that I wanna have from my customer

335
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,090
assistant. Which is really gonna be the

336
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,210
first pattern and then how am I gonna handle all

337
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,250
this operational observability that I

338
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:10,769
have

339
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,070
and maintaining kind of the the site reliability

340
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,369
with everything that's going to be going on in

341
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,019
my system.

342
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,629
So first,

343
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:23,808
agent powered game recommendation.

344
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,178
I have my system as it was

345
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:29,678
before and what I'm doing here

346
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,239
is I'm introducing

347
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:33,599
the agent that I built

348
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:35,979
which is going to act on the information

349
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:37,000
that it receives

350
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,379
from the event which is the chat that

351
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:41,609
the customer is having to say I'm

352
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:43,739
interested in new types of games I like these

353
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:46,080
kinds of things what would you recommend for me?

354
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:48,940
The agent is gonna get that and the agent

355
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,239
is gonna can do a couple things

356
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:52,408
first

357
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,519
before it even does the research.

358
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,379
You can ask the agent. You can have the agent work to

359
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,479
say determine the sentiment of this person

360
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:02,308
if they're positive or maybe they're neutral,

361
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:04,859
you probably don't need to have a lot of touch with them.

362
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:07,298
You can have the agent kind of offline handle

363
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:09,500
that themselves, but maybe the person's calling

364
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,609
to say your games stink.

365
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,779
I want my money back. I don't like what's going

366
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:14,479
on here.

367
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,899
Here you can have the agent make a decision and say, I

368
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,899
understand the sentiment. This person probably needs

369
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,099
to go talk to another person. I'm gonna route that

370
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:22,239
to my customer service

371
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:23,178
agent,

372
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:26,190
however. We build good games

373
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,779
and we think that's going to be a small amount of the transactions,

374
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:31,239
so. When the event comes

375
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:32,940
in, the agent can first determine

376
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:35,849
what's the sentiment, who should I be routing this to?

377
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,038
When it decides that it should be handling it,

378
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,019
it can go do that research,

379
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:42,820
gather the information, provide the recommendations

380
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:44,940
back out to my customer.

381
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Now remember, because this is also

382
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,558
built using Agent Core, which has the first thing which I

383
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:50,399
said was the memory.

384
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:53,619
There can be a chain set of

385
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:55,048
conversation going back and forth here.

386
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:58,129
And the agent's gonna be consistently remembering

387
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,460
what was before and building all the responses

388
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,428
based upon what it knows

389
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,739
and not having to redo all that work that it

390
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:05,700
did the first time.

391
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:08,320
1, that saves time.

392
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:10,940
2, it saves money because

393
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,979
the agent's not incurring more

394
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:13,678
cycles

395
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,820
to go reproduce stuff that it already did analysis

396
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,798
on. So

397
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,729
This becomes a way that I can introduce that

398
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,288
first pattern, that event bridge,

399
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:27,229
event bridge triggering agents pattern

400
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:29,808
to solve for this problem that I have about building

401
00:14:29,808 --> 00:14:30,710
and scaling

402
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,129
game recommendations for my customer.

403
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:35,779
That solves one of my problems.

404
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:39,798
My second problem is

405
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:42,038
site reliable engineering, so.

406
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,408
I have my system and it's all instrument

407
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:46,889
instrumented with cloud watch

408
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:49,859
and now that my scale's growing 50 times

409
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,090
I'm producing a lot, a lot, a

410
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,229
lot of logs

411
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:54,908
and my engineer

412
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:57,599
that I have, remember I got a limited team limited

413
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:00,330
budget, he's gonna become overwhelmed

414
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,229
with having to

415
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:04,129
understand what's happening in there and look for

416
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:06,190
things that need to be dug into

417
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:08,460
and where maybe something is trending bad,

418
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:10,969
something needs to be fixed, something needs to be

419
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:13,139
done. So

420
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,219
the cloud Watcher cloud Watch blogs are growing

421
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:16,158
exponentially.

422
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,899
As good as I build this system, guess what,

423
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,149
errors occur.

424
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
And sometimes they're minor, and sometimes

425
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,099
they're major.

426
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:25,320
Either way, they need to be looked at.

427
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:30,139
Here Using

428
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,340
cloud watch, I can set up cloud

429
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,558
watch alarms

430
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,239
based upon particular things that could be happening

431
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,440
erroneously in my system.

432
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:41,210
Based upon those cloud watch alarms,

433
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,139
when something goes into an alarm.

434
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,700
I can invoke

435
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,519
my agent. I can invoke my SRE agent.

436
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,029
That agent can do a couple

437
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:51,580
things.

438
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,479
First,

439
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:55,298
it's gonna be able to understand what's

440
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:57,668
happening with that particular alarm,

441
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,779
and it also understands the architecture of my

442
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:02,019
system and the implementation of that system

443
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:04,340
to say what could that possibly

444
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,558
be the root cause of.

445
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,529
It can then determine the severity

446
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:09,369
of that.

447
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,330
Hopefully, most of my issues are low severity

448
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,369
type, type of things, and it can be a quick fix kind

449
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:16,808
of thing, but some might be high severity.

450
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,538
And similar to what we had in the first pattern,

451
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:21,700
it can make the decision that I want

452
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,080
high severity ones

453
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:25,619
to get. Dropped as

454
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:27,619
an SNS message that my engineer

455
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,889
is gonna pick up, and hopefully there should be a

456
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:30,940
small amount of those things,

457
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33,619
but for the ones that are low severity or medium medium

458
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:34,298
severity,

459
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,599
I want the agent to go fix it themselves,

460
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:39,460
and maybe I can build a little something there that when

461
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,080
I have that, the agent can go.

462
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:42,548
You know,

463
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,038
maybe redeploy some code for me somewhere

464
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,359
else. Maybe shut down a failing server.

465
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:49,719
It can do the things in my system that

466
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:51,788
my engineer used to have to do, but now they

467
00:16:51,788 --> 00:16:53,229
can do it fully autonomously.

468
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:55,359
Now this thing can scale out

469
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,960
very large to that 50 times volume

470
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,639
I want

471
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:00,879
without overwhelming that engineer,

472
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:03,158
and it'll do it tirelessly and it'll

473
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:04,219
do it repetitively.

474
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:06,680
So here's how I can introduce that agent

475
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,920
triggered event bridge pattern

476
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,660
to solve for that problem.

477
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,577
That combination of the agents in the system

478
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,837
running on agent court that memory and the

479
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:19,159
run time have allowed me to both scale

480
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:21,519
to meet the need of the business that I have as

481
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,778
well as scale to that operational support

482
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:24,898
that I need to have,

483
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:27,837
and it's providing wonderful results. Now

484
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:30,057
it's great to hear about all this stuff,

485
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:32,479
but it's even better to see a demo on how this all gets

486
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,378
built. And with that,

487
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:36,118
I will hand it over to Martin

488
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,499
for the demo.

489
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,979
OK, I got it from the first time.

490
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,660
So

491
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:42,979
as Jeff explained,

492
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,838
And you can see this is a recording. There is a reason

493
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:47,880
why this is recording. We did not trust the

494
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,160
demo gods that it will everything work

495
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,170
on the stage, so

496
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,239
just to make it safe and

497
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:56,799
secure that it's actually going to run and show

498
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,680
everything we want to show,

499
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,118
we recorded the demo session. So I will go

500
00:18:00,118 --> 00:18:02,279
through it. It's about 22 minutes

501
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,439
long, so please bear with me while

502
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:05,318
we go through this.

503
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:07,900
We will show two cases.

504
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:09,519
So as Jeff explained,

505
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,568
the first case will be helping our

506
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:13,630
customer agents

507
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:16,769
to help our customers

508
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:18,108
look for

509
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:19,868
similar games

510
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,328
that they want to play, to offer them some

511
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:24,650
similar games that they already played, and to enable

512
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,229
customers to interact with the

513
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:27,328
agents.

514
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:29,900
In this case, AI agent

515
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,299
that will give them some proposals, but

516
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:34,000
an additional layer on top of that

517
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:36,338
will be that they will be able to

518
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:38,239
provide a sentiment

519
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:40,939
or some kind of feeling.

520
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:43,140
Do they like something or don't they like

521
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,140
something, so the agent can then

522
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,180
based on that,

523
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:48,729
rephrase the proposal and give them maybe

524
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:49,759
a different list of

525
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,259
games to play with.

526
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:53,799
The 2nd 1, the 2nd demo,

527
00:18:54,078 --> 00:18:56,578
which is a bit longer one because it has more components,

528
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:59,160
will be the one including our

529
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,439
engineer in the back end

530
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,199
where we will see mostly stuff

531
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,140
in the console and in the code

532
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,598
that supports our engineer to

533
00:19:07,598 --> 00:19:09,519
resolve cases much more faster.

534
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:12,098
So the logic is again, as explained,

535
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:14,880
that we will have an alert triggered by a

536
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,078
fake lambda.

537
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:18,880
Trigger which will go then to EventBridge

538
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,900
and then that alert will follow

539
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,959
through Agent Corp which will

540
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:23,578
then go through

541
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:26,799
seek additional information about the problem

542
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,299
and then decide is that problem

543
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:31,559
low, medium, or high severity.

544
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:34,000
And based again on the sentiment

545
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,180
of the problem,

546
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,338
we'll send it either

547
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,029
to some outer mediation,

548
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,039
which can be restart the service,

549
00:19:41,469 --> 00:19:43,559
start something, stop something, run a code or

550
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,140
whatever,

551
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,650
or if it decides it's a high

552
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,979
level

553
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,380
problem or issue,

554
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,578
send an email to the engineer to escalate

555
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:55,380
further into the case. So

556
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,739
we'll go through this

557
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:00,318
together, hopefully let's see.

558
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,578
Can I hide this? Yes,

559
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,299
so this is our folder with the project

560
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,769
and you can see multiple different

561
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:10,039
files that we will be using like

562
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:12,078
instructions and so on and

563
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,118
so forth. We'll go through those files later

564
00:20:14,118 --> 00:20:15,469
on to show what they contain.

565
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,818
Here we are activating Python environment because

566
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:20,160
we are using Python to communicate

567
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,390
back with an agent.

568
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,779
And also here we need to install

569
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:27,039
requirements as you can see, most of these

570
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,150
requirements are already satisfied because we

571
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,078
run this environment.

572
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:31,779
Previously,

573
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:34,559
here I will run the application itself.

574
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,000
I will stop briefly here. The

575
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,559
application itself is basically running Amplify

576
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,219
front end

577
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:43,000
to to be used as a UI for the cust

578
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,660
for the customer to interact with.

579
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:47,219
I forgot to mention that the agent core

580
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,269
and the amplifier is running locally.

581
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,750
So it's running locally, it can run anywhere,

582
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,799
of course, but in this case it's running. It

583
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,858
is running locally and as you can see,

584
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,318
basically it is loading the instructions

585
00:20:58,318 --> 00:21:00,699
file. The instruction file contains

586
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,279
prompt engineering for the agent

587
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,868
to understand how to behave

588
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:07,078
and also, interestingly enough,

589
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
we'll see later on,

590
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:11,160
it contains some additional data about

591
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,989
the sentiment,

592
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,979
basically how to determine

593
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,439
what type of sentiment is customer

594
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:17,019
producing

595
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,410
the system

596
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,358
itself. I

597
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:26,430
hate when it doesn't doesn't show

598
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,630
everything, OK.

599
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,059
Let's deploy the front end. Amplify

600
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:34,739
should jump

601
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,660
into the front end itself.

602
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,660
The front end itself is based on

603
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,299
react,

604
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:43,098
so that's how it's based. You can of course use

605
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:45,890
whatever you want in this case,

606
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:48,358
and this is our front end. It doesn't look super

607
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:49,979
pretty. It's just

608
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,199
for this purpose that we use it. Our

609
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:55,140
assistant is called Gus. Of course we

610
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,170
can ask Gus, Hi Gus, how are you?

611
00:21:57,459 --> 00:21:58,519
He will respond

612
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:01,539
with the information. What can he do for us?

613
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:04,459
So this is me again as a customer interacting

614
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:06,500
towards the agent. I'm now giving

615
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
him information.

616
00:22:08,598 --> 00:22:10,759
On what I like or what I used to

617
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,660
play, what type of games I used to play.

618
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,068
Uh,

619
00:22:15,828 --> 00:22:16,900
I'm typing slowly.

620
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:19,858
There is also an on purpose

621
00:22:19,858 --> 00:22:21,170
mistake in spelling,

622
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:22,769
so it just looks natural,

623
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:25,180
but Gus is very smart and he will

624
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,239
very easily recognize

625
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:29,199
what I actually need or what I'm actually

626
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,588
asking. So this is going towards

627
00:22:31,588 --> 00:22:33,750
the database of course in the back end which

628
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,868
we will see different tools that have been

629
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:38,189
used in the code to help Gus

630
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:40,348
understand what I'm actually asking because

631
00:22:40,348 --> 00:22:41,250
you will see

632
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:44,449
in the first in the first run of

633
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,049
this of this iteration,

634
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,809
Gus didn't find anything.

635
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,250
He didn't understand anything, but then.

636
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,750
He reiterated based on some keywords,

637
00:22:53,828 --> 00:22:55,910
based on the tables in the database,

638
00:22:55,989 --> 00:22:56,689
based on

639
00:22:56,949 --> 00:22:58,779
what I was saying in my question,

640
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:00,009
and he went back,

641
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:01,930
reran the code,

642
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:05,108
recreated the query

643
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:07,390
needed to get that information from the database,

644
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,618
and then gave me some information.

645
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:11,729
As you can see, there are multiple

646
00:23:12,828 --> 00:23:14,150
different.

647
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,250
Information that he gave me, what I don't

648
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,489
like, I'll just give him some sentiment

649
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:21,430
that I don't like

650
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:23,920
Resident Evil because I'm scare easily,

651
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:26,529
so that's not something that I like. I want

652
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:29,068
to tell him don't propose anything

653
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,630
that is similar to

654
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:33,368
Resident Evil. Of course there is another spelling error.

655
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,029
It's not an event, it's Resident Evil.

656
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:37,430
But again, Gus is very smart in this case

657
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,630
and we very easily understand that error.

658
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:42,769
So here basically we see what is happening.

659
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,969
My interaction with the

660
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,130
with the with the agent itself.

661
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:49,709
What I'm asking, he's preparing the

662
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,430
memory of this, you will see at the end,

663
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,588
sentiment analysis enabled.

664
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,969
Interesting thing, this, my first,

665
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:58,189
my first question doesn't have any sentiments.

666
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:00,818
I'm just saying, what am I into? I'm in adventure

667
00:24:00,818 --> 00:24:01,439
games.

668
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:03,739
I like to play this type of game and that's it, so

669
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:05,489
there is no sentiment related to it.

670
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,199
Sentiment comes when I say

671
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:08,799
I do not like games or

672
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,328
type of

673
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:13,059
evil ones or ones which I'm

674
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:13,640
scared

675
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,500
easily.

676
00:24:16,328 --> 00:24:17,229
So you can see

677
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:19,068
sentiment neutral,

678
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,539
no sentiment here.

679
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:23,368
Because there is no, that's my first question.

680
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:25,568
He will start to run it

681
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:28,430
interestingly again here by using the

682
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,009
tools

683
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:31,868
the agent is generating the query

684
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:32,769
needed to

685
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:35,219
ask the backend database what I want to show. There

686
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:37,269
is, there is, you will not see SQL query in the

687
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:38,049
code. There is no

688
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,549
hard coded SQL query that goes tell us

689
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:43,150
go do this. There are just instructions

690
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,449
of what I want to

691
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,130
Gus Gus to do.

692
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,930
There is, there is no, there is no

693
00:24:48,189 --> 00:24:49,828
embedded code into the query.

694
00:24:51,368 --> 00:24:52,969
Records found 0,

695
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:55,328
so you can see created a query select

696
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:57,670
console journal from the table

697
00:24:58,049 --> 00:24:58,670
and so on.

698
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,029
Records found 0, didn't find anything.

699
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:03,680
Now he, I'm just calling him

700
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,729
he. I don't know why is it it or he. So

701
00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:07,769
the agent will reiterate,

702
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,269
rerun the code.

703
00:25:10,818 --> 00:25:12,900
Add additional stuff like action

704
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,479
or general like adventure,

705
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:16,838
and then we'll rerun it and we'll find

706
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,578
150 records this time.

707
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,588
He will rerun it again considering this is maybe

708
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:22,459
not enough to to

709
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,500
to show.

710
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,140
And he will find some

711
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:27,469
additional,

712
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,430
additional credits also at the end.

713
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:33,729
Not there, but the next one.

714
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,410
So you see additional records returned 5.

715
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:40,289
By not additional but basically

716
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,439
rerun again and

717
00:25:41,868 --> 00:25:42,930
shortening the list.

718
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,049
Now we have

719
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,130
sentiment,

720
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,250
me saying

721
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,890
I'm scared of Resident Evil games,

722
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:51,269
which is basically now giving sentiment

723
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:51,838
to the

724
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:54,410
agent, telling him that this sentiment now

725
00:25:54,868 --> 00:25:57,318
is. Negative or not.

726
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,338
Or bad, I will put it that way. So

727
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:01,439
he needs next time

728
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:02,598
to avoid

729
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,618
giving me any results containing

730
00:26:05,618 --> 00:26:07,199
similar, similar games.

731
00:26:07,618 --> 00:26:08,880
If you go into the

732
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:11,279
code itself, so you can see here, those are

733
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,358
instructions that I mentioned. Within

734
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:15,380
those instructions are instructions

735
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,568
on how the agent needs to behave,

736
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:19,289
what the agent needs to do,

737
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:21,739
how to communicate with me, and

738
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:22,318
give me back

739
00:26:23,219 --> 00:26:24,078
information that I need

740
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,900
from from the agent

741
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,400
on the bottom itself.

742
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,539
You will see also.

743
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,699
Sentiment when it comes to it, so

744
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,150
Instructions prompt engineering,

745
00:26:36,489 --> 00:26:37,630
classic and on the bottom

746
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,809
sentiment monitoring.

747
00:26:40,328 --> 00:26:42,328
So as you can see, the agent continuously

748
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:43,789
monitors conversations

749
00:26:44,088 --> 00:26:44,670
and then

750
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,170
decides what type of sentiment is it. Is

751
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,368
it a good sentiment? Is it a bad sentiment?

752
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,410
So I could have thought I could have said

753
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,170
no, this is,

754
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:54,680
I, I like resent. Give me more of that,

755
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:56,729
or I don't like as I did, don't give me more

756
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:58,920
of that in the application file itself,

757
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:00,348
which is a Python code.

758
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:03,539
We have lots of tools defined, so we have tools

759
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,539
like tools that will go to the

760
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:07,338
database and extract information,

761
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:09,900
tools that help agents generate that

762
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,799
SQL query that will then

763
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,900
bring me back the results.

764
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:15,358
Also we have.

765
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,130
Other tools that will

766
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,880
Help with the sentiment generation.

767
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,848
So I cannot go through the whole, whole code

768
00:27:25,848 --> 00:27:27,868
itself, unfortunately, it's also very,

769
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:29,699
very, very small here.

770
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:31,838
We have different again instructions,

771
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,189
we just saw that.

772
00:27:34,578 --> 00:27:36,779
Let's go to some definitions that

773
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:37,920
basically define

774
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,380
how the agent responds back to me, and

775
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,459
again, in all of this code, you will

776
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:44,680
not see any query. There is no SQL query

777
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:47,059
saying what needs to be done because then it wouldn't

778
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:49,519
be agent based. It would be just a sequel query

779
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:51,939
based on some keywords which I provided

780
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:52,459
in the

781
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:53,380
in the tour.

782
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,539
Entry point for the agent.

783
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,199
So basically it is based on invocation

784
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:59,880
totally asynchronous as mentioned,

785
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,189
which is the idea. I don't need to be

786
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:04,439
waiting for something to happen. I need to

787
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:06,259
happen immediately back and forth.

788
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,078
OK, session

789
00:28:11,078 --> 00:28:13,118
ID, user ID, and so on and

790
00:28:13,118 --> 00:28:14,000
so forth, everything,

791
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,059
of course,

792
00:28:15,449 --> 00:28:17,479
for this to work, LLM is running in

793
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,608
AWS, so you cannot run your LLM

794
00:28:19,608 --> 00:28:21,880
locally as you are currently running this agent

795
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,900
core and

796
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:23,939
amplify.

797
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:26,348
So you need to have your credentials. You

798
00:28:26,348 --> 00:28:26,959
need to have

799
00:28:27,358 --> 00:28:29,439
access to your to your back end where your database

800
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:31,680
will be and the agent agent logic

801
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,358
or LLM

802
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:33,539
that you're actually

803
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,799
questioning sentiment.

804
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,209
So you can see it it can analyze sentiment, it

805
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:41,250
always analyzes sentiment as you

806
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,410
enter something and interact with the, with

807
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,549
the agent itself.

808
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,630
We can go to definitions,

809
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:48,368
how to analyze.

810
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:53,568
So how to analyze sentiment and how to output

811
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:55,368
back to, to event,

812
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,900
Event bridge. Once you have this in EventBridge,

813
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,049
you can then do whatever you want, basically, but in this

814
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:02,049
case, we are just providing feedback back

815
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:03,029
to the customer,

816
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,049
how, how to, how to create it.

817
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,838
I'm so sorry this is like silent session and

818
00:29:10,838 --> 00:29:13,400
this is my first time doing it. I used, I used to have interaction,

819
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,049
people asking questions, so

820
00:29:15,368 --> 00:29:17,529
it's weird having you like aliens

821
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:18,549
with those

822
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:19,880
red ones.

823
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,689
Yeah, cool, so.

824
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:25,180
Yeah, so

825
00:29:25,838 --> 00:29:27,959
code basically pattern code that that helps

826
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,959
out in this interaction and defining

827
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:32,170
how, how all this in the back end works.

828
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:34,598
Again, the most important, the most important

829
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:36,640
thing is to understand this is the

830
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,539
event bridge part

831
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,029
where we basically send all that information,

832
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,019
sentiment, confidence, summary

833
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,118
back to the user to, to

834
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:45,818
understand that part.

835
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:58,250
I OK,

836
00:29:58,368 --> 00:30:00,430
so I will stop here, here for a second,

837
00:30:01,088 --> 00:30:01,729
uh.

838
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,979
The second, the second part basically

839
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:06,118
as explained

840
00:30:06,578 --> 00:30:07,219
is

841
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,779
So this is the first part. What can you do with this? So

842
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:12,939
there are so many agents that of course are

843
00:30:12,939 --> 00:30:14,979
pre-built, or you can just reuse them and

844
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,098
so on. This one is interesting because it's very

845
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:17,969
easy to deploy.

846
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,459
You can run it, test it locally, and then push it

847
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:22,489
to AWS and run it in in

848
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:24,660
in in there if you, if you wish. So this

849
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,459
is just a

850
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:27,880
concept that proves the concept of.

851
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:29,430
Basically,

852
00:30:29,848 --> 00:30:32,108
asynchronous communication between the customer

853
00:30:32,449 --> 00:30:34,848
and the agent in the back end and reusing

854
00:30:34,848 --> 00:30:36,390
existing LLMs to provide

855
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:38,930
additional, additional data. This is like super

856
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,309
easy code is super short, it's not, it's not long,

857
00:30:41,489 --> 00:30:42,920
and it can be very easily tested.

858
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,848
And this is like with user interaction.

859
00:30:45,848 --> 00:30:47,309
When I'm prompting

860
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:49,910
questions and asking give me this, give me that, and

861
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,078
so on and so forth, and this is all based of course on

862
00:30:52,078 --> 00:30:54,328
your existing knowledge that you possess

863
00:30:54,328 --> 00:30:56,059
in the back end of the database of

864
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:58,049
all the games that you that you have.

865
00:30:58,769 --> 00:30:59,588
Second part

866
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:02,368
includes a bit more components, and second

867
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:03,509
part is, I would say,

868
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:05,269
not as interactive,

869
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:08,529
because the idea is that we have a

870
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:09,910
permanent watcher

871
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,729
or alert-based system.

872
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,618
This time it is through cloud Watch

873
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:18,130
where we are basically generating an alert

874
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:19,368
and then

875
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:21,789
sending that alert through Wet Bridge to

876
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:22,500
Asian Corp

877
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:25,529
which then decides the sentiment of that alert

878
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:27,949
and then does some action and this is

879
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:28,769
something that is

880
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,549
totally autonomous versus the first one where I

881
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:32,650
need to input something,

882
00:31:32,949 --> 00:31:35,150
ask back and forth, and interact. Here

883
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,009
we do have

884
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,750
the alert itself, as

885
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,818
you can see, the alert was set up in

886
00:31:40,818 --> 00:31:42,750
this case, maybe not for production, but like.

887
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:45,750
Every one event with one data point

888
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,170
then raise the alert,

889
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:49,559
and then I have a rule in the event

890
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,949
bridge basically that is

891
00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:54,269
watching for those alerts, any change of state

892
00:31:54,588 --> 00:31:56,568
and it has a target of

893
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,199
uh, Agent agent

894
00:31:59,199 --> 00:31:59,750
Corps

895
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:02,380
to do something with that alert. So

896
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:04,719
we'll see later on what that agent

897
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:06,799
Corps actually actually does.

898
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,449
So the important thing is

899
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:11,279
that I'm not just sending him him

900
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,449
again or it. I'm not just sending

901
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:15,029
it, oh, there is an alert.

902
00:32:15,318 --> 00:32:17,789
I'm sending him, OK, there is an alert.

903
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,660
You need to go back

904
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:20,779
to the

905
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,439
cloud watch logs. You need to

906
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:24,318
pick up some.

907
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,660
Information. Additional information

908
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,699
about that alert and you will see later in the code

909
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:31,009
we have again additional tools

910
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:33,180
that do that and then do something with the coup.

911
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,358
So this is

912
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,059
Agent Bedrock. I will stop quickly just here

913
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:39,140
because Jeff also mentioned some of

914
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,699
these. We are using Agent runtime

915
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:42,439
in this case,

916
00:32:42,818 --> 00:32:44,890
but there are additional options that you do like

917
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,324
built-in tools. Gateways.

918
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,384
We did some upgrades recently on gateways

919
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,144
in this tool.

920
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:52,785
Memory also mentioned identity is super

921
00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:54,795
important and we will see later on observability

922
00:32:54,795 --> 00:32:55,723
also super important

923
00:32:56,614 --> 00:32:58,723
for this because you don't want this running wild,

924
00:32:59,305 --> 00:33:01,424
not knowing what is actually happening, how many

925
00:33:01,424 --> 00:33:02,174
locations do you have,

926
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:04,625
how many times your lambda fired because something

927
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,545
happened. You want to fine tune it

928
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:09,545
either because of the resource usage, cost usage.

929
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:12,519
Or just optimization of the of the code.

930
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,219
So we are currently using here

931
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,219
uh agent run time for this for this particular

932
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,098
uh agent core.

933
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:21,029
So again, alert.

934
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:23,400
I have a fake lambda you will see later that will

935
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,789
trigger a couple of alerts

936
00:33:25,578 --> 00:33:27,598
uh again, nothing to use in production just for demo

937
00:33:27,598 --> 00:33:28,299
purposes.

938
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:30,799
That will go to EventBridge. EventBridge will send

939
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,400
that to Agent Core.

940
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,979
Agent Core has instructions.

941
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,539
You will see again instructions files, a bit different

942
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:39,699
one, and this one is not called Gs, it

943
00:33:39,699 --> 00:33:41,269
has a much more ominous name,

944
00:33:41,618 --> 00:33:43,729
but it will then look, oh, there is an

945
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:45,729
alert. Let me go back to cloudwatch. Let

946
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:47,410
me collect some additional information.

947
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:49,239
Let me determine the sentiment.

948
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,098
And let me then decide what to do with

949
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,279
that information.

950
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:56,500
So what this is doing is actually

951
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,880
relieving our engineers that they don't

952
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,979
have to be there for each and every event,

953
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,680
but they can basically just get the top

954
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,880
level, highest priority events and then

955
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,479
act on them.

956
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:09,750
OK, so this is the dive. Maybe one

957
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,648
thing to notice here

958
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:12,829
is just it's a version 7.

959
00:34:13,548 --> 00:34:15,867
I have run this multiple times, so

960
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:18,028
once we come to the end and and run it

961
00:34:18,028 --> 00:34:20,039
again, so when we go through all the files,

962
00:34:20,068 --> 00:34:22,068
it will be agent version 9, I think,

963
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,548
because we have run it multiple times. So there is

964
00:34:24,548 --> 00:34:25,447
versioning, of course,

965
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:27,268
within, within the agent.

966
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:30,679
We can see the invocation code itself.

967
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:36,269
In this case, Python

968
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:39,208
blurs some things which contain sensitive

969
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:43,070
information. So

970
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,590
it's very, very, very simple,

971
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,869
very simple code.

972
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,878
Multiple versions, currently 7.

973
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:52,898
Once we run it

974
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,769
actually again it will be 9.

975
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:57,099
Additional information is about endpoint

976
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:59,090
itself. You can add tags if you want, of course,

977
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,750
when it was created, status ready and so on and so

978
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,840
forth. OK,

979
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:08,500
this part is super important observability.

980
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,639
This is the thing.

981
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:13,809
That you definitely want to have, you want to

982
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:15,889
want to be able to have insights

983
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:16,628
into the

984
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:18,750
processes, what is actually happening

985
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:19,869
inside.

986
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:23,030
You can of course change the range

987
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,869
when something is happening.

988
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:28,429
Here I'm changing it for I think 4 weeks

989
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:30,809
because I run it for 4 weeks

990
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:32,889
before you see how many endpoints, how

991
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:34,090
many sessions, traces,

992
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,610
error rates, and so on.

993
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:39,050
So to see this information,

994
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,728
session invocations, invocations,

995
00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:43,929
and so on, so you need to enable this

996
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:44,789
in Bedrock.

997
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,289
So there is a checkbox basically

998
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:48,208
or switch

999
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:49,610
that you turn on

1000
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:52,369
that then enables invocations

1001
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:52,949
and then

1002
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:55,769
inside we'll just go now into into

1003
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:56,510
that part

1004
00:35:56,929 --> 00:35:57,829
into bedrock

1005
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,530
where you can see basically.

1006
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:02,869
What types of invocations you want to log

1007
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:05,250
and where do you want to store

1008
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,648
that information.

1009
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:09,349
So going to Amazon bedrock.

1010
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:13,579
In my case, it will be turned on because I already

1011
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:14,179
turned it on.

1012
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,579
So settings and then here,

1013
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,139
let me stop quickly.

1014
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:22,280
Did I stop?

1015
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:24,769
No, I did not hear, stopped.

1016
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:29,110
So, This needs to

1017
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,269
be turned on, model invocation logging. If you don't

1018
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:33,269
have that turned on, you will not see that data over

1019
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:35,349
there, which is not good. You, you want to have

1020
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,949
that data.

1021
00:36:36,418 --> 00:36:36,969
What type

1022
00:36:37,389 --> 00:36:38,739
do you want to include into log?

1023
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:41,030
I included all text, image, embedded video.

1024
00:36:41,188 --> 00:36:43,389
Where do you want to store that S3 cloud

1025
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:45,469
watch logs only. I will just store

1026
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,059
it in a, in a cloud watch

1027
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:47,969
log

1028
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:49,989
uh in this iteration.

1029
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,599
OK, let's go to cloud watch the

1030
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,539
cloud front to see what was deployed.

1031
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:03,349
So to see what was deployed, there were multiple,

1032
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,708
multiple resources deployed through cloud

1033
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:06,458
Front for this.

1034
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,728
I will stop quickly.

1035
00:37:09,878 --> 00:37:10,878
When it loads

1036
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,360
OK.

1037
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:16,478
So Let me hide

1038
00:37:16,478 --> 00:37:18,659
this. I hate how it doesn't hide.

1039
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:20,418
Come on

1040
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:24,800
OK,

1041
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,559
forget it. So we have lambda event

1042
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,179
bridge agent core. So that's

1043
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:30,659
when it comes to

1044
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:33,199
event bridge, event bridge invokes lambda

1045
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,739
that then talks to agent core

1046
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:37,599
in talks and tells him, OK,

1047
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,219
there is an event, investigate

1048
00:37:39,878 --> 00:37:42,228
lambda error generator, that's the fake, uh,

1049
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,300
generator for

1050
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:45,719
uh errors where I will click several times just

1051
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:46,820
to generate some errors.

1052
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,449
Error alarm itself, agent

1053
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:52,199
SNS topic which will be used to

1054
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:55,059
send an email to

1055
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:57,418
engineer in case the severity

1056
00:37:57,418 --> 00:37:59,489
or sentiment of the

1057
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:00,878
error is

1058
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,628
high. And then we have uh

1059
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:07,958
The role SAE itself and some and some metadata

1060
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:08,938
on the bottom.

1061
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,188
So and all of these have

1062
00:38:17,188 --> 00:38:18,610
adequate permissions

1063
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:21,110
to access all these services, so you can really scope

1064
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,228
the permissions for each of these to

1065
00:38:23,228 --> 00:38:25,668
have access only to what it needs to have

1066
00:38:25,668 --> 00:38:27,708
access. Now let's go to the project file. It

1067
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:28,809
is similar

1068
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,010
to the one that we already saw,

1069
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:33,550
so it's similar to the

1070
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,208
projects that we already saw. You see

1071
00:38:35,668 --> 00:38:38,128
requirements. You see instructions.

1072
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,570
The instructions are of course different.

1073
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:43,300
It's not the same thing. I'm instructing

1074
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,639
in this case, I'm instructing the agent

1075
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,820
to when it receives an alert, and when it

1076
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,860
receives the alert to go back to cloudwatch to

1077
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,659
collect additional data about that

1078
00:38:51,978 --> 00:38:54,260
alert, and then based on that to decide

1079
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,519
what level of sentiment

1080
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,340
it is.

1081
00:38:58,539 --> 00:38:59,829
Also, I am using

1082
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:01,909
several, I will see several different

1083
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:04,510
tools to get additional

1084
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,329
information about the

1085
00:39:05,648 --> 00:39:07,648
about the tool and about the alerts, and

1086
00:39:07,648 --> 00:39:09,340
those tools are defined in the code itself.

1087
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:12,228
So I want to get log group name, query.

1088
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:14,429
I want to create cloud of hog insights query,

1089
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,800
when it started, when it ended, and so on

1090
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,360
and so forth.

1091
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,050
So and then on the end.

1092
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:22,329
I also tell, you'll see, I also instructed

1093
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:23,949
the agents to retry

1094
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,849
to retry at least, at least

1095
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:28,458
2 times.

1096
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,139
If it can to do it.

1097
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:35,378
So get more information tool, notify

1098
00:39:35,378 --> 00:39:37,510
higher problem tool. So those are all the

1099
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,260
tools that an agent use

1100
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:41,000
once it gets

1101
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,340
more information and determines the

1102
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,418
sentiment of the.

1103
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,269
Of the problem itself.

1104
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:52,159
Everything in the instructions file, so better you

1105
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:52,780
do this.

1106
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,429
Better results you will have.

1107
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,938
Again, some error handling, you should always

1108
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:59,519
have some error handling, it's not the

1109
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:02,079
best or smartest one, but at least it's

1110
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,228
there for, for the tool to know

1111
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,070
the agent to know what needs to be done.

1112
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,659
Again, application, Python application.

1113
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,969
This application defines basically

1114
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:15,739
once the agent starts, how it starts,

1115
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:17,728
what tools are available,

1116
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:20,119
and what instructions are there,

1117
00:40:20,188 --> 00:40:22,128
and so on and so forth, so it preloads everything

1118
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,168
into the into the service.

1119
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,280
I've been using for this.

1120
00:40:29,398 --> 00:40:31,579
which is basically in the back end

1121
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:33,898
builds container. It deploys Docker

1122
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,139
container to ECR, then deploys

1123
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:38,659
agent in it and runs it

1124
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:39,418
runs it through that.

1125
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,219
And the tools itself, they are not invoked

1126
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:44,050
immediately, of course,

1127
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,489
when the tool is deployed or agent is deployed,

1128
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:47,639
they are invoked after

1129
00:40:48,418 --> 00:40:49,438
something happens.

1130
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:51,728
So there are two parts of this, you may say.

1131
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:53,760
The first part is how to

1132
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:54,840
start

1133
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:57,280
the agent, what are the instructions

1134
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,619
and what tools are available, and then the

1135
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:00,360
second part,

1136
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:02,780
when something happens, event driven,

1137
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:04,639
as we are talking all day,

1138
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:07,340
then what to do with it, what tools

1139
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,119
to use

1140
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,780
to construct proper query.

1141
00:41:11,389 --> 00:41:13,458
So to collect data from the

1142
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:15,860
logs and then to basically

1143
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,519
decide

1144
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,099
what level of severity the

1145
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:20,889
issue actually is.

1146
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,340
So all of this, we haven't even seen our

1147
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,139
engineer yet.

1148
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:25,438
This is

1149
00:41:25,978 --> 00:41:28,239
standing in the background of the of the

1150
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,199
service,

1151
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:32,079
listening for those alerts.

1152
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,679
And then

1153
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,750
Triggering when

1154
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,340
needed. So these are the tools

1155
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:41,000
that I have mentioned, either tools for sentiments,

1156
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:42,389
tools for generating inquiry.

1157
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,409
Tool for getting additional

1158
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:46,349
data on

1159
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:48,869
On the log file

1160
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:51,489
because I just, I cannot decide

1161
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:53,610
sentiment or the agent cannot decide

1162
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,639
the sentiment based just on there is

1163
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,688
an alert. It needs to go back, collect

1164
00:41:57,688 --> 00:41:59,789
the alert, and then basically decide

1165
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,139
the sentiment and what will happen, what will

1166
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:02,708
happen next.

1167
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,289
So those four, as you can see arguments log

1168
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,030
group name, query, start time and.

1169
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,750
And time.

1170
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:14,469
Of course, when that happens, it triggers

1171
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:15,708
lambda, which will then

1172
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:18,989
go to the agent and determine next next

1173
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:19,869
possible steps.

1174
00:42:31,938 --> 00:42:32,978
ECS service.

1175
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,478
Lambda

1176
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:38,619
RDS and so on and so forth. So again,

1177
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,360
it can be send a message, it can be

1178
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,898
restart service, it can be

1179
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,539
run code, it can be whatever, whatever

1180
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:47,628
is needed. The question of course here

1181
00:42:47,628 --> 00:42:49,708
is how much automation do you want to give

1182
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:50,300
it?

1183
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,110
Do you need to have somebody in the middle like a person

1184
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,398
that will go through this and validate if

1185
00:42:56,398 --> 00:42:58,809
something is wrong, how much power do you want to give

1186
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,829
to these kinds of services while restarting,

1187
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:02,728
rebooting,

1188
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:06,260
changing, modifying, or sending some commands

1189
00:43:06,269 --> 00:43:07,989
to to be something done.

1190
00:43:08,898 --> 00:43:11,128
So OK, here we are deploying the basically

1191
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:12,269
agent core

1192
00:43:12,949 --> 00:43:13,849
from the terminal.

1193
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:19,119
5. It

1194
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,699
will generate the Docker container

1195
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
and and run it.

1196
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:28,648
Use all the instructions.

1197
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:32,110
In the application Python code and

1198
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,188
collect all the tools that it needs

1199
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,309
to basically

1200
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:37,530
run the agent.

1201
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:48,099
2 lambdas, as I said.

1202
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:50,869
We have one lambda that is like dummy

1203
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:52,989
lambda for generating code. That's the one on the

1204
00:43:52,989 --> 00:43:54,510
top lambda arrow generator,

1205
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:56,938
and then the second lambda is basically to

1206
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:58,929
to be as a as a middleman

1207
00:43:59,418 --> 00:44:01,429
between the event event bridge and

1208
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:04,128
the Asian core itself, which then defines

1209
00:44:04,898 --> 00:44:07,050
again all those tools and how to access

1210
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:08,260
that information.

1211
00:44:08,668 --> 00:44:10,809
This is just a simple code generator which

1212
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:12,289
just trigger a couple of codes

1213
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,949
once we go back into the console to see how

1214
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:17,019
that gets triggered and and

1215
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,188
and the result which.

1216
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,708
I'm sorry to say it's not super spectacular,

1217
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:23,449
but it will show you what actually,

1218
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,469
what actually happens.

1219
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:26,628
So let's go back,

1220
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,188
agent run time.

1221
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:30,269
Let's see what happened as you can see,

1222
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,039
version 9, so

1223
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,409
there was one version in between which we, which we

1224
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:36,849
didn't see, uh, around it for test purposes.

1225
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,010
So this is now version, version 9.

1226
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:40,829
If we go to lambda functions.

1227
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,898
You will see those two lambda functions that we are

1228
00:44:45,898 --> 00:44:48,208
basically talking about. This one is to communicate

1229
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:48,739
with the

1230
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,478
Agent court.

1231
00:44:52,889 --> 00:44:55,000
No, this one is to generate event, right?

1232
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:56,188
Yes, test. So

1233
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,648
this one will generate click it multiple times.

1234
00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:01,148
It will just send some few

1235
00:45:01,148 --> 00:45:02,590
fake events.

1236
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:08,550
Expected errors against demo gods,

1237
00:45:08,628 --> 00:45:10,188
so we even recorded one.

1238
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,300
But it sends, so it

1239
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,418
sends to cloud watch,

1240
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,860
and you will see a couple of couple of

1241
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,300
events in the cloudwatch.

1242
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,199
Let's see that part.

1243
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,760
OK, so as you can see,

1244
00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:29,000
several events generated.

1245
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,059
From lambda

1246
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:36,869
In real life, of course this would be

1247
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:38,769
something that happened actually in the production

1248
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:41,228
again. Alarm that

1249
00:45:41,228 --> 00:45:42,090
is triggered

1250
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:43,269
changed state.

1251
00:45:43,628 --> 00:45:45,530
It says when the state is changed.

1252
00:45:46,228 --> 00:45:48,300
Go run, go

1253
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,668
into create an event bridge event

1254
00:45:50,909 --> 00:45:52,800
and then from there when you are here

1255
00:45:53,228 --> 00:45:55,309
we are choosing to send this to Agent

1256
00:45:55,309 --> 00:45:57,550
Corps. So that's one of the options where

1257
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:59,929
the Agent Corps with all those instructions

1258
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:01,820
will decide the severity and everything else.

1259
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,429
But once in here you basically can do

1260
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,369
anything. This is the beauty of Event bridge

1261
00:46:06,628 --> 00:46:08,668
from previous options that you that you

1262
00:46:08,668 --> 00:46:09,809
had. But here

1263
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,168
again I see two events

1264
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:13,030
happening.

1265
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:15,978
Again, back to lambda.

1266
00:46:16,829 --> 00:46:19,039
For the other one, the lambda that will actually talk

1267
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:19,860
to Agent Core.

1268
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:23,840
And it has instructions to do what, to

1269
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,260
go back to cloud watch.

1270
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:28,550
And look for more information on

1271
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,148
the problem.

1272
00:46:31,128 --> 00:46:32,458
So again, you will see here

1273
00:46:32,728 --> 00:46:33,949
that it has been triggered.

1274
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,199
It's a small trigger, but it's there,

1275
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:37,878
so.

1276
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:42,128
You see that this has been triggered.

1277
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,269
Let's see the logs itself.

1278
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:55,550
So this is, this is what's happening.

1279
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,369
And here, let me stop quickly here.

1280
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:01,030
So here you can see the full,

1281
00:47:01,728 --> 00:47:03,530
full log of what's actually

1282
00:47:03,849 --> 00:47:04,530
happening.

1283
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,760
Lambda errors errors and inside

1284
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,059
here you can even see that it's going back

1285
00:47:10,398 --> 00:47:12,550
instructing that it's going back to

1286
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:14,739
the cloud watch and basically

1287
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,159
saying, OK, I need to collect additional

1288
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:18,898
information on this error

1289
00:47:19,179 --> 00:47:20,760
and I need to define

1290
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,438
the sentiment of this

1291
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:23,438
of this error.

1292
00:47:27,938 --> 00:47:28,469
Again,

1293
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:30,869
there is no query anywhere. There is no secret query.

1294
00:47:30,918 --> 00:47:32,938
The query and all the queries are generated on

1295
00:47:32,938 --> 00:47:35,369
the fly based on the on the

1296
00:47:35,378 --> 00:47:36,168
information provided

1297
00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:37,449
from the log.

1298
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:41,000
It is at the end of Jason payload, as you can

1299
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
see severity high.

1300
00:47:43,918 --> 00:47:45,938
So severity was determined to be high

1301
00:47:45,938 --> 00:47:46,958
in this case,

1302
00:47:47,438 --> 00:47:49,119
so it could be low, medium, high.

1303
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:50,340
Again,

1304
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:52,898
we decide what is low, medium, high.

1305
00:47:52,978 --> 00:47:54,478
I mean, we decide what action

1306
00:47:54,978 --> 00:47:57,219
happens if low, medium, or high.

1307
00:47:57,878 --> 00:47:59,219
In this case, it's high.

1308
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:02,010
So high severity

1309
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,840
notification sent. Let me stop here.

1310
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:05,668
So as I said,

1311
00:48:06,128 --> 00:48:07,949
not very spectacular result,

1312
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:09,728
but this is what we

1313
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,489
went to our uh service

1314
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:13,708
reliability engineer.

1315
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,340
This is the email he got. You can make it more prettier.

1316
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,679
It doesn't have to go to email. It can go to a

1317
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:21,840
ticketing system with a high priority assigned to somebody

1318
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,909
and so on and so forth.

1319
00:48:23,329 --> 00:48:25,438
But this is basically the idea. The general idea,

1320
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:26,510
as Jeff explained,

1321
00:48:26,878 --> 00:48:29,119
is to actually automate

1322
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,159
part of this in a super easy way

1323
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:33,378
with the technologies that basically were

1324
00:48:33,389 --> 00:48:35,679
already there for most applications in

1325
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:36,769
event-driven architecture.

1326
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,898
We are just adding on top of it

1327
00:48:39,478 --> 00:48:40,559
some smarts.

1328
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,500
In a way that lets me reuse existing

1329
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,659
LLMs but give them on top some

1330
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:46,398
of my own knowledge

1331
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:50,260
from the logs that I'm collecting and then

1332
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,280
utilize that

1333
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,398
to offload work from our people,

1334
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,168
from engineers that need to resolve those

1335
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:59,340
issues, of course, at the end of the benefit of

1336
00:48:59,340 --> 00:48:59,938
the customer.

1337
00:49:00,989 --> 00:49:02,228
For the for the application.

1338
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:03,728
So I hope

1339
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:04,958
I managed to

1340
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:08,168
Put it a bit closer for all of you to understand

1341
00:49:08,168 --> 00:49:10,208
what is the possibility and

1342
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:10,809
how to

1343
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,849
Enhance your existing service application that

1344
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:15,849
you don't need to build up everything

1345
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:16,389
from the ground

1346
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:18,079
up. So

1347
00:49:18,929 --> 00:49:20,969
Jeff and I will close up now. Thank you.

1348
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:24,099
So,

1349
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:27,840
That's a good game.

1350
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,398
Hopefully that demonstrated health by starting

1351
00:49:32,398 --> 00:49:34,179
with building your architecture

1352
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:36,639
in an event-based manner using event bridge

1353
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,079
and then incorporating

1354
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,438
agentic agents into that process

1355
00:49:40,438 --> 00:49:42,958
can help you scale to deal with characteristics

1356
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,978
that you might have previously thought from your business

1357
00:49:45,438 --> 00:49:46,500
and with that we got

1358
00:49:46,878 --> 00:49:49,280
Martin, myself, we're happy in what we built

1359
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,320
our customers are happy, our engineers happy and

1360
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,260
our and our customer assistance happy.

1361
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,438
With that, we thank you very much for your time today.

1362
00:49:56,478 --> 00:49:58,519
We thank you for coming to reinvent and we're gonna be hanging

1363
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:00,519
around a little bit longer if you have any questions

1364
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:01,739
for us. Thank you very much.
