1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,973
- Okay, very good morning to everyone.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,160
Welcome to re:Invent 2025,

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,470
and it's our pleasure to welcome you all,

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,720
and to our session on accelerating

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,683
development and DevSecOps
with Amazon Bedrock and Kiro.

6
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:20,130
This is a funny thing,

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,190
two weeks back we had to kind of quickly

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,670
change from Amazon Q to Kiro to give you a

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,450
feel about how to use Kiro, and Kiro CLI.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,820
So, we've been chasing a lot of people

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,920
to get the things updated.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,800
So, finally we have some good content

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,533
to show you on the
latest services as well.

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,490
So, I just wanted to
understand the people here,

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,940
before we get started
with the introduction.

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,030
Can you tell me how many of
you in the room are developers?

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,653
Please raise your hands.

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,780
Okay.

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,180
I see quite a lot of
development community.

20
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,140
Fantastic.

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,220
And can you tell us how many of you

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,780
hold a title as a leadership,

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,470
like technology leaders or managers?

24
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,303
Wow.

25
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:17,490
It looks like more than 50%, right?

26
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,340
And how many are solution architects?

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,413
Okay.

28
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:25,650
Looks like, like Fabio,
you all have multiple caps.

29
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,880
Fantastic, right?

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,990
So, in this session we are gonna show you

31
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,200
how you can accelerate
software development lifecycle

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,520
using agents beyond just
code generation, right?

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,190
So, that's what we're gonna cover today.

34
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,930
So, my name is Dhana Vadivelan,

35
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,350
I lead the EMEA Partner
Solutions Architecture team

36
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,600
for Strategic Consulting Partners.

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,683
I'm based in London.

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,643
I'll let my co-speakers
introduce themselves.

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,580
- Hello, hi, hi re:Invent.

40
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,158
My name is Fabio Oliveira,

41
00:01:58,158 --> 00:02:00,420
as you can see with this
accent, I'm Brazilian.

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,530
I support partners in
the DACH and CE region.

43
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,930
I am located in Munich.

44
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,940
So, I'm part of the Dhana team.

45
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,470
And also I'm here probably

46
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,587
because I built part of the
system we will see later on

47
00:02:13,587 --> 00:02:15,510
in a part of the demo.

48
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,430
So, happy to be here.

49
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,780
Thank you.

50
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,613
- Hi everybody.

51
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:20,446
My name's Joris Conijn,

52
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:24,420
I'm the CTO for Xebia Cloud,
and also an AWS ambassador.

53
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,850
And I have something great to show you

54
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,240
as well during this
session, so hang in there.

55
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,290
- Thank you.

56
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,470
So let me give you a bit of story, right?

57
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,563
Why we are here, and how we
actually landed here, right?

58
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,960
So, a year ago we started
getting a lot of questions

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,083
from our partner network and
as well as customers, right?

60
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,910
So, "Tell us how to use Bedrock

61
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,510
to solve certain use cases
or certain adoption issues."

62
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,343
Right?

63
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:56,910
"Tell us how to use MCP.

64
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,340
Tell us how to integrate
with the existing tools,

65
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,990
the data silos."

66
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,860
So, then me and my team,
we took this as a mission.

67
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,090
We started creating quite a
lot of architecture patterns,

68
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,590
design best practices,

69
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,180
and we also went and started
creating some sample codes,

70
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,360
sample applications to show
the art of possible, right?

71
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,190
And then slowly, slowly we start seeing

72
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,230
our partners start adapting this.

73
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,140
And then we saw a trend of

74
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,870
creating a platform
driven approach, right?

75
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,600
By bringing all the different architecture

76
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,130
patterns that we created,

77
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,080
and then we saw some of our partners

78
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,350
fantastically created a
platform-driven approach

79
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,450
to address all the different personas

80
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,460
within the software
development lifecycle, right?

81
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,210
Not just limited to the
developer community.

82
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,300
And that's where it becomes
even more interesting, right?

83
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,590
Then our partners started
creating their own offering,

84
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,740
and offering that through the marketplace.

85
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,760
And some of them are
combined with our customers

86
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,470
and that's how we actually landed here.

87
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,750
So we wanted to share our learnings,

88
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,120
best practices, and experience with you,

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,340
and we would love to hear back from you

90
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,330
in terms of how you like to
use it for your organization.

91
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,450
So, at the end of the session,

92
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,820
you will have a clear takeaway in terms of

93
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,360
how to do this transformation
within your organization.

94
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,230
So stay tuned.

95
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,160
We are gonna show a lot of
QR codes for architectures,

96
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,540
sample codes,

97
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,460
and Fabio is gonna show a demo,

98
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,950
and then later Joris is gonna come

99
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,423
and explain about the
Xebia platform as well.

100
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,650
So, in the next 50 or minutes
we are gonna cover this.

101
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,453
We'll start with the
traditional SDLC challenges,

102
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,140
I will quantify with some financial impact

103
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,930
in terms of what we see from the industry.

104
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,500
And then we'll move into why agentic AI

105
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,460
is unavoidable in software
development lifecycle, right?

106
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,750
And why Gartner in the
recent Magic Quadrant says

107
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,740
the integration of agentic AI is very key

108
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,350
across the software development lifecycle.

109
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,780
And then, we will go dive deep into

110
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,480
the platform-driven approach

111
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,750
using various architecture
patterns that we created.

112
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,450
So, Fabio is gonna introduce some of our

113
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,633
virtual stakeholders like, Emily,

114
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,640
Anna,

115
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,473
Adam,

116
00:05:27,473 --> 00:05:28,306
and Chris,

117
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:31,050
from different personas in
terms of business analyst,

118
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,980
solutions architect, and
developers, and DevSecOps engineer.

119
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,930
And Fabio will also run through

120
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,120
in terms of day in a life scenario.

121
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,760
Obviously, we have a limited time today,

122
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,610
so we are gonna show you
a few demos and use cases,

123
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,170
but we have 20, 21 plus
architecture patterns

124
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,140
are actually published available today.

125
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,360
So we will share the QR code as well.

126
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,000
And finally, Joris is gonna talk about

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,040
how Delta Airlines have achieved

128
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,720
this remarkable journey with Xebia,

129
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,420
transforming their SDLC lifecycle.

130
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,493
So with that, let's get started.

131
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,350
So, let's be honest about
where we are today, right?

132
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,350
Most of the development team
spend lots of time in terms of

133
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,080
repeated task, manual activities,

134
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,700
and missing documentations,

135
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,103
which is resulting in
a productivity drain.

136
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,870
And let me also share stats from

137
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,520
one of the verified
industry analyst report.

138
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,330
78% of the software engineers spending

139
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,960
at least 30% of their time
in terms of doing this

140
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,493
manual repeated task.

141
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,300
So, let me give you an impact

142
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,220
in terms of dollar value, right?

143
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,420
So let's take a team
size of about 250 people,

144
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,480
in a software development team,

145
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,900
if I take an average
salary of about 107,000

146
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,310
in dollar per annum,

147
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,990
the financial impact we are looking at

148
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,470
is about 8 million in
terms of lost productivity.

149
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,860
Another report from Atlassian states that

150
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,860
20% of the development team
lose that time every week

151
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,090
due to inefficiencies,

152
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,430
such as constant contact switching

153
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,290
and technical debt accumulation.

154
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,640
If I do the same math,

155
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,610
it is another 5.4 million in terms of

156
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,680
lost productivity annually, right?

157
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,828
So if I sum it up, it's
about 13.4 million.

158
00:07:34,828 --> 00:07:39,828
It's definitely much bigger
number I'm talking about.

159
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,910
I'll give you an example, right?

160
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,090
So, how many of you here,

161
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,570
your teams are spending at
least more than 40 hours

162
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,940
in a week whenever there is
a tight deadline to release

163
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,860
products or any production issues?

164
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,910
Raise hands.

165
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,590
Yeah, that I see, right?

166
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,110
So this is the burnout crisis, right?

167
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,060
I'm not even counting that fact,

168
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,010
how much is the money spent

169
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,410
or the loss in terms of productivity.

170
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,570
And then the Atlassian
research also states that

171
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,400
if you provide a better
developer experience

172
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,550
and you will see a 30% productivity gain

173
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,380
for your development team.

174
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,540
Which means that we are talking about

175
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,210
the lost opportunity cost, right?

176
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,530
So, these are something which is,

177
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,240
I'm not factoring it, right?

178
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,070
So this is not a sustainable momentum,

179
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,280
that's why the AI agents or agentic AI

180
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,200
is so transformative.

181
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,730
So they don't just make
the old process faster,

182
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,640
they fundamentally change the process

183
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,073
and make it better and cost efficient.

184
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,620
In terms of Gartner Magic
Quadrant for AI Code Assistant,

185
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,413
and this is the one which got
published in September, 2025.

186
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,110
So, Gartner found that AI tools
are transforming everything

187
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,780
from requirements gathering to design,

188
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,760
to testing, to development,

189
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,580
to deployment and operations.

190
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,760
But here is the number that
you should make a note of,

191
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,760
by 2028, 90% of the enterprise
software engineering teams

192
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,570
will start using AI
code assistants, right?

193
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,570
Which is a big jump, 14% in early 2024,

194
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,000
to where we are looking
at in future, right?

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,723
Which is 6X increase
just four years, right?

196
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,280
And this is happening,

197
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,590
this transformation is happening whether,

198
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,800
the question is not you're embedding AI

199
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,450
across the SDLC, right?

200
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,430
So this transformation is gonna happen

201
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,230
with or without you.

202
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,090
So the question is,

203
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,310
are you gonna lead this transformation

204
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,700
or are you gonna be
following the competitions?

205
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,677
So, many of you will be thinking,

206
00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:01,983
"Dhana, this is great, right?

207
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,580
How about the real world challenges?"

208
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,380
That is exactly why we are here,

209
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,410
so we wanted to share you the experience

210
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,630
and the challenges that we learned

211
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,360
from our partner network and customers.

212
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,070
Let me bucket this into,

213
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,100
summarize into three categories, right?

214
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,473
The first one is the
toolsets and development.

215
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,020
The development teams
face primary challenges

216
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,630
in terms of fragmented planning

217
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,360
and fragmented development environments.

218
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,500
So, which means it creates
a disconnected toolset

219
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,160
for them to actually collaborate better.

220
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,020
So, therefore it slows them down

221
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,940
in terms of the release cycle, right?

222
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,460
And also creates a barrier from a team

223
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,380
across the team wide collaboration.

224
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,600
So, this is one common challenge

225
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,570
that we learned from our experience.

226
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,560
And then the second one is

227
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,960
the integration and interoperability.

228
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,690
We already said that there
are fragmented environments,

229
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,740
fragmented tools, which is also
creating data silos, right?

230
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,300
So therefore, there is a need
for everyone to actually,

231
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,770
how do you orchestrate this
complex tooling in data, right?

232
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,260
So nobody has the time to do this,

233
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,990
manage this whole
orchestration requirement.

234
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,830
And then the last one is
enterprise-wide security,

235
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,653
observability and scalability.

236
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,120
So again, there are teams who are lacking

237
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,660
in terms of the limited
monitoring and control.

238
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,730
So, which again, poses them a challenge

239
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,130
when they start scaling into production.

240
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,920
So POC is great, now I
need to move forward,

241
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,767
scale it from 10 users to 100s of users,

242
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,590
and 1000s of users, right?

243
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,350
And that's where security
compliance challenges hits.

244
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,600
And of course, it is important
for everyone to start

245
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,190
observing the performance of the agents,

246
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,140
the behavior of the agents.

247
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,030
So, all these things are the
enterprise level challenges

248
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,565
and this is exactly why

249
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:08,520
AWS developed agentic AI services,

250
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,430
and why it is important to kind of

251
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,823
have a platform-driven approach
to address these challenges.

252
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,280
So, how many of you in the room
are already building agents?

253
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,553
Can you show of hands?

254
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:25,763
Okay.

255
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:28,683
And how many of you are deployed
the agents in production?

256
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,230
Okay.

257
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,300
So I see about like 30, 40%,

258
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,230
just in the benefit of bringing
everyone on a common page.

259
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,060
I'll quickly cover a couple of next slides

260
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,510
to give you some foundation,

261
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,150
and then we'll dive deep
into the architecture, right?

262
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:50,150
So, at AWS we defined
agents, or agentic AI,

263
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,670
as autonomous software systems

264
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,980
that actually leverage to reason,

265
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,783
plan and complete task on
behalf of humans or systems.

266
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,690
I'll give you an example.

267
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,260
I'm sure most of you are using
generative AI today, right?

268
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,920
So generative AI, you give a prompt,

269
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,010
it gives you back the response,

270
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,290
which is one shot interaction.

271
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,750
On the other side, AI agents,

272
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,290
it can actually read your
business requirements,

273
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,280
it can read your user stories, epics,

274
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,570
and it can communicate,

275
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,110
interact with your tools
like Jira or Confluence,

276
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,850
and understand your,

277
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,470
let's say non-functional requirements,

278
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,960
understand your standards
within the organization

279
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,130
when it comes to compliance,

280
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,980
let's say GDPR for instance, right?

281
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,540
And therefore it can
help you to create codes,

282
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,510
it can help you to do the implementation,

283
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,130
do the documentation.

284
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,550
So, all the challenges that
we talked about earlier

285
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,550
in terms of losing 30% of time
due to repeated manual task

286
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,790
and 20% of time lost every
week due to technical debt

287
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,860
and the constant context switching, right?

288
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,410
That is where the agentic AI can help you

289
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,120
avoid those repetitive tasks

290
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,950
and improve the productivity.

291
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,680
So there's a creative
problem solving capabilities,

292
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,680
what exactly transforms
every stages of SDLC.

293
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:29,100
Now let's quickly look at in
terms of how agentic AI works.

294
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,770
So, we have agents in the middle,

295
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:36,240
it can be hosted on a AWS
fully managed service,

296
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,082
which is Amazon Bedrock AgentCore,

297
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:41,082
which Fabio is gonna talk about shortly.

298
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,080
Or you can even run agents
on a Amazon ECS platform

299
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,240
where you need to kind of
manage everything, right?

300
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,130
So, it has got four key components.

301
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,750
The first one is the memory,

302
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,410
to retain the context
between all the personas,

303
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,640
between the sessions,

304
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,760
in terms of short term
and long term memory.

305
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,330
And then the second component
is tool integration, right?

306
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:10,293
So that the agents can
execute task by writing,

307
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,750
issuing all the task in Jira based on

308
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,160
the user stories and epics,

309
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,810
just giving you an example.

310
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,320
And you can even integrate
with your ERP tools

311
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,220
or CRM tools where the data is residing.

312
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,850
And then the third one is
the planning capability

313
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,480
to kind of go through any of
one or more of the options

314
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,170
in terms of reflection,
self critiques, right?

315
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,310
Chain of thoughts.

316
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,310
So that the entire task execution
can be planned properly.

317
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,870
And then the last one is the actions.

318
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,810
The actions can be performed automatically

319
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,150
or with human oversight, right?

320
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,340
So, all these components work together

321
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,700
to actually help agent complete the task.

322
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,440
And now let's look at,

323
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,340
what are the key design best practices

324
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,560
that one should actually consider

325
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,250
when you are actually taking
this agents to production.

326
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,920
Again, this is purely
coming from our learnings

327
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,623
that we've been working
with partners and customers.

328
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,780
There are four key buckets we summarized.

329
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,330
The first one is the
selection of framework, right?

330
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,660
So, it is important to consider

331
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,110
the complexity needs of your project,

332
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,240
of your application that
you are building, right?

333
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,000
And what is the level of modularity

334
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,220
that the framework can offer you,

335
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,990
and the integration capabilities,

336
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,450
and the memory management capabilities.

337
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:44,040
And then you also need to factor
in things like scalability,

338
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,600
performance things, right?

339
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,410
These things will determine
how best your agentic care

340
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,110
is gonna help you to scale in production.

341
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,200
And then, the second one is
the tools and knowledge base.

342
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,800
Common tools, capabilities,
like, web search,

343
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,877
code interpreter.

344
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:06,660
And so you need to actually
evaluate those capabilities,

345
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,230
and making sure that provides
you a reliable output

346
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,810
what is needed for your
application, right?

347
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,780
So you need to test that ability

348
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,490
and check the reliability.

349
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,100
And then the third one is
selecting the LLM, right?

350
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,560
So again, the reasoning capabilities

351
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,820
and the execution speed,

352
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,030
all that matters for your application,

353
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,890
and that will also determine what is

354
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,110
the model size and performance,

355
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:35,430
which will also lead to the
cost of the inferencing.

356
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,460
And then the last one is
the execution technique.

357
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,770
So, there are many options available

358
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,980
within the react, plan
and execute, reflection,

359
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,630
so, you need to decide which one

360
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,570
is better suit for your needs.

361
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,170
And then finally, there are frameworks,

362
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,580
agentic care frameworks,

363
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,100
it comes with this own determined way

364
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,440
of doing workflow automation,

365
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,470
or you may have to do a
custom workflow automation.

366
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,360
So again, you need to
think before you start

367
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,860
using any of the agentic framework.

368
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,320
And finally, make sure you all aligned

369
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,160
the complexity needs of
your project and use cases

370
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,937
to the selection of LLM.

371
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,313
So, AWS meets where you are
in your agentic AI journey.

372
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,900
Our vision is to provide
the best place to build

373
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,880
and deploy most trusted and
performant agents in the world.

374
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,270
So, at AWS, we understand
different organizations

375
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,860
having different needs.

376
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,030
So, therefore we are offering

377
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,820
three distinct approaches here, right?

378
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,350
Just follow along with me.

379
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,920
The first one is for those who are seeking

380
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,020
specialized solutions.

381
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,950
So, we offer the agent power applications.

382
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,570
So, that's the first bucket.

383
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,190
So, within that there are
three services we offer.

384
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,130
One is Amazon Quick Suite.

385
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,660
You might have heard that's
recently launched service,

386
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,250
which is mainly focused on

387
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,790
enterprise productivity
and workflow automation.

388
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,030
So, the good part of Amazon Quick Suite is

389
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,550
it has a inbuilt
connection and integration

390
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,830
with all the tools that I talked about.

391
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,340
So, it is a platform
for no code or low code

392
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,150
for you to quickly create
a workflow automation

393
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,030
by integrating with different tools

394
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,090
and the data available
within your environment

395
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,210
to get a specific task executed.

396
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,870
And then the second one
is the Kiro Agentic IDE.

397
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,200
So, Fabio is gonna dive deep
and show you the console,

398
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,433
and the use case.

399
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,930
We are taking this Kiro
into the next level

400
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,300
of spec-driven development.

401
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,410
So, you just give Kiro
what you wanted to build,

402
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,460
just follow along,

403
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,010
it creates the implementation for you.

404
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,670
And then the last one is the Kiro CLI,

405
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,520
it is a new command line-driven interface

406
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,923
powered by agentic AI from AWS.

407
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,910
And it enables developers
and IT professionals

408
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,910
in terms of helping them to
scan your codes for errors,

409
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,410
do security vulnerabilities,

410
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,210
helps you to fix errors,

411
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,270
and automate the workflows in few seconds.

412
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,650
So, this is one bucket.

413
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,550
And the second bucket is the teams wanting

414
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,860
a kind of control and convenience.

415
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,700
That's where we offer fully-managed Amazon

416
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,650
and Bedrock agents, right?

417
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,340
And that provides the
built-in foundation models,

418
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,950
along with the orchestration capability.

419
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,930
And then the third one is

420
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,660
for organizations who are actually wanting

421
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,430
maximum flexibility.

422
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,790
So, we offer DIY approach.

423
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,073
So, right now there are two SDKs,

424
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:05,040
agentic AI framework,
Strands, and Nova Act SDK.

425
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,800
So with this you can
actually build your agent.

426
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,800
And for all these options,
one or more options,

427
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,160
you're gonna see here from
our partner Xebia today,

428
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,340
how they are actually using
this to build a platform

429
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,963
and drive at scale.

430
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,940
So for all these things,

431
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,120
you need a platform to kind of scale

432
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,500
from literally zero sessions
to thousands of sessions,

433
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,890
and that's where Amazon
and Bedrock AgentCore

434
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,460
that comes in provides
you capabilities such as

435
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,030
identity and access management,

436
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,150
the gateway capability, observability,

437
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,860
and then the tools that we talked about

438
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,190
in terms of code interpreter,
web browsing capability,

439
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,440
all these things helps you to manage

440
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,603
the agentic development lifecycle.

441
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,740
Right, so, now let's talk
about the architecture, right?

442
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,740
So, as I said,

443
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,770
we started creating the
architectural patterns

444
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,930
for each of the personas

445
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,810
and then slowly we started seeing

446
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,460
there is a need to actually bring

447
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,610
all those architecture personas together

448
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,990
and give them an UI,

449
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,200
and mainly for the non-developers, right?

450
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,160
Who are not using the IDE for example.

451
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,400
So, that's where we
saw there is a need for

452
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,380
building a platform-driven approach.

453
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,950
So I'll quickly walk you
through the solution approach.

454
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,190
Again, this is more to inspire

455
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,190
our customers and partners.

456
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,650
It's not a kind of fully product

457
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,060
or something like that, right?

458
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,120
It's a reference
architecture, best practices,

459
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,510
is published in AWS Samples,
it's open source today.

460
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:52,170
Anyone can actually clone
it, modify, customize it,

461
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,930
and test it, and use it
for the way you want.

462
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,090
So we have a user persona,

463
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:02,090
we created a custom UI based
on ReactJS application,

464
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,337
and we used Cognito to manage

465
00:23:05,337 --> 00:23:08,850
the authentication and authorization,

466
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,640
because there is a
role-based access needed.

467
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,340
You don't need to necessarily
give every full rights

468
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,290
to a business analyst,

469
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,440
rather you wanted to restrict
them to a specific task.

470
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,610
So, that's where the role-based
access comes very critical.

471
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,800
And then the backend is,

472
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,800
we created the SDLC agent
using Bedrock Agent,

473
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,070
and which is inbuilt foundation models

474
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,080
with orchestration capabilities.

475
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,070
So we integrated this as an MCP client,

476
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,983
integration and the fast API with our UI.

477
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,490
So now let's move on to the patterns

478
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,140
that I was talking about, right?

479
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,030
So, first we started creating
an architecture design pattern

480
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,120
for the business analysts to help them

481
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,540
do the requirements planning

482
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,310
more efficiently and effectively, right?

483
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,700
So, we created integration
between Confluence and Jira

484
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,540
using MCP server with Bedrock,

485
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,510
and then we connected
that to the MCP client.

486
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:16,560
So what we realized when
we started doing this,

487
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,460
before we get the next persona to start

488
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,460
taking from what the business
analyst have created.

489
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,330
So it is important to kind
of hold that output, right?

490
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,120
So, that's where we
created a another pattern

491
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,460
called as project knowledge base,

492
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,460
and this gives you a historical
data of every persona,

493
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,400
what they are actually
working on, which project,

494
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,530
what epics, user stories,
they have created,

495
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,390
what are the acceptance criteria,

496
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,030
how you can track the traceability back.

497
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,190
So, all those information
that they generate

498
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,350
from the first architecture pattern

499
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,540
needs to be stored, captured,

500
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,010
and that needs to be reused.

501
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,520
So that's where we use
Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base

502
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,650
and Amazon S3 Vector.

503
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,570
So, we created an MCP server

504
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:07,980
and we integrated that
back to the SDLC agent.

505
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,290
And then we started
creating other patterns,

506
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,720
which is the architecture design pattern,

507
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,580
mainly focused on architects.

508
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,120
So here, they will
basically able to create

509
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,550
architecture diagrams using draw.io,

510
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,520
they can create open API specifications.

511
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,340
And then the next persona
is the developer persona.

512
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,570
So here, for Kiro to kind
of have all the information

513
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,810
and create your specification
in the first place.

514
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,030
So again, we are actually integrating that

515
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:40,170
with the knowledge base so
that it can able to understand

516
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,840
what was the requirements of the project,

517
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,900
and what is the design that
was created by the architect,

518
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,730
and so on and so forth, right?

519
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,670
So then we were able to give
the kind of entire flow,

520
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,330
integrate each one of the stages of SDLC.

521
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,370
And then the testing persona,

522
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,910
again, the same integration
that we did using MCP server.

523
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,740
So in this case we took JMeter

524
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,820
because most of our customers
we saw this as a trend,

525
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,260
and you can actually create
literally any other MCP servers

526
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,500
or the MCP servers that
are available openly,

527
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,430
the open source.

528
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,670
And that's how we created each
one of the other personas.

529
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,490
And the last one is for maintenance,

530
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:25,020
which again, we used the
publicly available MCP service

531
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,510
from Splunk, PagerDuty,

532
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,430
and we integrated that with Slack

533
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,730
so that your ops engineer gets notified

534
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:36,150
when there is an anomaly in
your application automatically.

535
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,130
And then it gives you an opportunity

536
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,300
for an ops engineer to
further do RCA analysis.

537
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,940
So that's where Bedrock comes in,

538
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,770
do the RCA analysis by gathering
all the logs from Splunk.

539
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:54,450
And also, takes all the knowledge bases

540
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,280
that are available in your ITSM tool.

541
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,530
So, in this case we used PagerDuty,

542
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,450
if you have ServiceNow,
again with the MCP,

543
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,940
you can very well connect
with the knowledge base

544
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,730
so that all the previous incidents

545
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,430
and the resolutions that took place.

546
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,860
So, the agent can able to read

547
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,270
and then it can able to suggest

548
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,880
you remediation recommendations, right?

549
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,840
And that's how the whole
workflow starts moving in.

550
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,960
So, that's a QR code
where you can actually

551
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,790
scan and see all the patents.

552
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,910
As I said, we have more
than 20 plus patents

553
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,220
and multiple use cases,

554
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,530
but we have many more coming up, right?

555
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:35,220
So, make sure you store it, save it,

556
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,640
we will share again once more
at the end of the session.

557
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,870
So, let me quickly summarize

558
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,420
in terms of the architectural benefits.

559
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,110
So, by taking this
platform-driven approach,

560
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,390
it enables you to implement AI

561
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,790
across the software
development lifecycle, right?

562
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,843
And it also provides you an
ability to add, remove tools,

563
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,590
break all those fragmented things

564
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,770
that we talked about
in terms of data silos,

565
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,700
and also by making an UI so you can able

566
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,910
to customize the way how
you want for your users,

567
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,280
for your personas and organization.

568
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,180
And then, we've showed you
the project knowledge base

569
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,130
to hold all the information throughout

570
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,780
the software development lifecycle

571
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,720
so that the information gets passed on.

572
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,780
The agent only refers to the MCP server

573
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,700
for authorized information,

574
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,580
so that's the way how we
are grounding the context

575
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,590
and avoiding the hallucination, right?

576
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,540
So these are some of the problems that

577
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,173
we actually solved in real life.

578
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,690
And then we are letting agents to manage

579
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,940
the complex orchestration here, right?

580
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,570
Because the agent can
identify, based on your need,

581
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,580
which MCP server to choose,

582
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,810
rather than you creating your
own orchestration problems.

583
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,810
And finally, using the guardrails features

584
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,500
that are available we use

585
00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:01,860
to enable the responsible
AI, and other aspects.

586
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,500
So, we are going to come to the demo time,

587
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,570
I know I'm running a bit late,

588
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,240
so for the demo,

589
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,240
we are taking AnyCompanyReads
as a example scenario.

590
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,930
So, currently this company is going

591
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,243
through a traditional SDLC approach,

592
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,780
which is resulting in
the software releases

593
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,970
taking 18 months of time.

594
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,580
And that is mainly due to
challenges that includes

595
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,440
multiple endless requirement meetings

596
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,030
and the changes that happens

597
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,820
to the design documents very often.

598
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,720
And therefore, it gets
outdated before even

599
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,150
the coding begins, right?

600
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,240
And the team could not
avoid the scope creep

601
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,130
and budget overrun.

602
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,170
And in this demo we are gonna show you

603
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,530
how to use the platform-driven approach

604
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:00,330
so that any company leads can
accelerate all the SDLC stages

605
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,233
and reduce the release cycles
to six to eight months.

606
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,290
Take it away.

607
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,123
Fabio.

608
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,370
- Okay, thank you.

609
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,210
Thank you.

610
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,583
Hi, hi re:Invent.

611
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,690
Want to see a demo?

612
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,220
So yeah, I'm joking.

613
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,370
I think you don't have a
choice, I will show anyway.

614
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,850
So, now, well let's go with me,

615
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:27,060
we'll go through some of the SDLC phases,

616
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,090
and we'll see how our approach actually

617
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,090
is changing the lives of
some of our collaborators.

618
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,993
So then let's come, let's see how it goes.

619
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,310
So, first, let's meet Emily.

620
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,130
So, Emily is our business analyst.

621
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,880
She task is really to go

622
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,680
and to create epics,

623
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,290
from epics create requirements,

624
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,690
to write acceptance criteria.

625
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,870
So, basically, she uses the usual tools

626
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,950
like a knowledge management
system like Confluence or Jira

627
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,240
for the project management
to create the tasks.

628
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,240
So, let's see how
actually agentic AI system

629
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,070
can actually help her with her tasks.

630
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:18,690
And sometimes, for example,
she's building functional

631
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,190
and non-functional requirements,

632
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,640
she may take like many, many hours,

633
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,640
days sometimes even to create
a non-ambiguous requirements.

634
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,350
So, how agentic AI can actually

635
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,050
make these from a couple of hours

636
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,090
or days to a couple of minutes.

637
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,203
So let's take a look.

638
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:43,230
So Emily's journey starts in Confluence

639
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,110
as the majority of our
work that normally starts

640
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,270
in the knowledge management system.

641
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:52,620
So, she writes requirements
in plain English, as usual,

642
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,970
so known requirements,

643
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,950
non-functional and
functional requirements.

644
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,730
And then she can move, for
example, to our platform,

645
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:03,480
we have here represented all
the different SDLC stages.

646
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,400
So, you have here on the right hand side

647
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,030
you have chat bot where most
of the work will be done.

648
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,070
She can ask, for example,

649
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,310
to the agent to extract the requirements

650
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,512
and help her to build the epics

651
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:18,810
from extracting from Confluence.

652
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,020
So the system is using our MCP server

653
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,710
to contact, connect and to
extract the information.

654
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,180
And here we have it.

655
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,520
So we have the user authentication epic,

656
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,950
we have the Book Catalog epic,

657
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,270
so all of them with different
requirements inside.

658
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,870
So, you have user
registration, authentication.

659
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,930
For the Book Catalog epic,
we have different features.

660
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:47,930
So, with the integration
between a Confluence and Jira,

661
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,640
so this information can
be extracted by the agent

662
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,713
and put back on Jira as tasks.

663
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,070
So then,

664
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,560
so you can see e-commerce features,

665
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,880
social features,

666
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,683
it's quite a complex system.

667
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,640
So now what we can do,
or what Emily can do,

668
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,840
is to ask the agent to start
to write acception criteria.

669
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,393
So, based on the
organization best practices,

670
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,480
and here we have it.

671
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,080
So it's using a given-when-then format

672
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,380
for the different epics
for different requirements,

673
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,367
and this can be populated
back now to Jira, as well.

674
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:30,210
And as Dhana said, so what
is cool about this platform,

675
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,310
we have a central knowledge base

676
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:36,600
and every persona is contributing
for this knowledge base.

677
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,430
So, everything that we are building now

678
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,640
is populating the central
project knowledge base

679
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,850
that will be shared among
the different personas.

680
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,700
So moving on, now it's time for the team

681
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,070
to get a little bit more technical.

682
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,410
So we will meet Adam.

683
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,240
Adam is our solution architect,

684
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,240
and his task is to combine
the work done by Emily,

685
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,040
the functional requirements,

686
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,740
and is to start to add more information

687
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,290
about the non-functional requirements,

688
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,550
and also follow the organization policies,

689
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,070
best practices, compliance.

690
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,980
So, he needs actually to
digest all this information

691
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,660
and start to build architectural diagrams,

692
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,090
documents, specifications,

693
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,523
contracts between different systems.

694
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,160
So, he uses some of the tools

695
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,123
like diagramming, applications tools,

696
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,370
he needs to go through
sometimes to 100s of documents

697
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,600
and to go and to distill that
as architectural documents.

698
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,320
So let's see how AI-powered
solutions can actually

699
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,680
help him to accelerate his work

700
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,850
that sometimes can take like
a couple of, again weeks,

701
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,340
sometime months, depending
on the complexity

702
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,353
to come up with some of the solutions.

703
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,950
So again, we are back now to our solution

704
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,310
at our AI agentic platform,

705
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,910
and we have built some
shortcuts to help Adam

706
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,890
to go through to some of the tasks.

707
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:14,460
So for example, here in the
per epic we have a button to,

708
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,700
for example, to generate
a solution diagram,

709
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,700
and this will create the
nice prompt in the shot,

710
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,740
and this will trigger the process

711
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,180
and combining the agentic AI system

712
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,490
with MCP servers to create the diagrams,

713
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,570
we have something like that.

714
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,420
So we have like a diagram,

715
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,010
actually in this case with
a serverless solution,

716
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,660
so it looks legit.

717
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,630
So, we have like S3 buckets, we have CDNs,

718
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,873
we have serverless, we have
Lambdas, we have databases.

719
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,170
Adam can even, for example,
continue the discussion.

720
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:56,100
This is basically based on
the organization best practice

721
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,160
but can, for example, you start
to change the architecture

722
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,110
for something like containers.

723
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:05,820
So maybe moving on, part
of Adam role is also

724
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,200
to build like some contracts,

725
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,400
and so using OpenAPI to
build OpenAPI specifications.

726
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,820
So he can go back, select
one of the shortcuts,

727
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,920
and for example, here we have,

728
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,693
so build some of the contracts
for one of the epics.

729
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,900
So, we have like four endpoints,

730
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,090
we have the schemas defined,

731
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,160
the security defined.

732
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,160
So, this is normally JSON
object as you can see,

733
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,850
the OpenAPI specification.

734
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:40,230
Who likes to write JSON
specifications by hand, isn't it?

735
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,460
So, the agentic system
can help you with that.

736
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,370
And even like highlighting
the human in the loop.

737
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:52,370
So Adam can actually go
and preview the results

738
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,440
using a tool like Swagger, in this case.

739
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,440
And we can see here we
have get, post, get by ID,

740
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,700
put, delete by ID.

741
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,970
So the different endpoint
for that particular epic,

742
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,340
everything created by the agent,

743
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,940
and now again part of our
central knowledge base

744
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,700
that what helps then to
build up the knowledge

745
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,053
about this single project.

746
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,400
So, moving on, so our next
stop is to talk with Anna.

747
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,950
So Anna is our developer.

748
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:30,030
So, she's a lead developer
in our Any company,

749
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,083
fictional company.

750
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,770
And she leads her team,

751
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:39,770
and some of her tasks are to
go collect the requirements,

752
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,500
basically now built by Emily first,

753
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,320
and now all the function in
our functional requirements,

754
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,723
documentation built by Adam,

755
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,720
put together and start to build

756
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:56,100
the low-level design artifacts

757
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,670
that helps her team to start
to split the development

758
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,040
in development tasks.

759
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,920
So, setting the environment,

760
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,170
setting the CICD pipeline,

761
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,880
creating the documentation.

762
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,160
So, there is a lot of documents

763
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,010
and as you can see the
things start to compound.

764
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,100
So, we have the requirements,
we have the design,

765
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,570
so everything that needs
to be distilled by Anna

766
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,340
to go and to build the software.

767
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,590
So let's see how we can help Anna

768
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,513
with those pain points.

769
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:33,660
So, Anna and her team,
they are developers,

770
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,930
and we know the best place
to write code is an IDE,

771
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,443
so that's why we will move
to her favorite IDE, Kiro.

772
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,163
Kiro is our agentic AI IDE,

773
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:48,870
and basically Kiro is MCP compatible,

774
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:52,800
so we have built MCP
server that connects Kiro

775
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,513
to our central knowledge base.

776
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:58,170
And because of that,
she can do things like,

777
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:02,160
she can ask what are
the active projects now

778
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,050
in our knowledge base,

779
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,700
ask details about a single
project like the AnyCompanyReads.

780
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,920
And with that, the system,

781
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,840
we will start to show in the IDE

782
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,160
without leaving the IDE,

783
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,460
information about the different
epics that are available,

784
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,850
the functional and
non-functional requirements.

785
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,100
And when she's ready she can, for example,

786
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,580
even ask to start the work
in one particular epic.

787
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,510
And so, in this case,

788
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,783
we will start to work on
the book catalog epic.

789
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,780
So, because of that integration

790
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,650
between Kiro and our
central knowledge base,

791
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:44,710
she'll see the information
about the contracts

792
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,830
built by Adam,

793
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,110
the functional,
non-functional requirements,

794
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,540
the signed decisions, entities,

795
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,880
endpoints, as we saw before.

796
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,880
And as soon as Anna is ready,

797
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,790
she can ask, for example, to
Kiro to start to build the,

798
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,400
to use the spec-driven
development approach

799
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,760
to break out the requirements

800
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,630
in requirements design and tasks.

801
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,593
As you can see,

802
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,610
here, we start to help then to,

803
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:20,340
is split now to or to design
the presentation layer,

804
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,810
the business logic layer,

805
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,640
the data access layer.

806
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,270
So, decision about the
technological stack,

807
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,230
so front end, tables, entities,

808
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,630
so everything will be
part of the project now,

809
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,923
part of the repository.

810
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,490
And after that, she can, for example,

811
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:42,903
even start to ask to
splitting technical tasks,

812
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,550
and here we have it.

813
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,890
So now the project is empty.

814
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,260
So, Kiro is actually creating tasks

815
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,810
to build the project from scratch.

816
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:57,090
So, to build the different directories,

817
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,040
set up the Quarkus framework,

818
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,220
it's a Java application, the front end.

819
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,500
So, that basically now,

820
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,190
so you can start to click
on the different tasks

821
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,090
and this will start, now
will provide Kiro access

822
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:14,310
to the terminal where Kiro will start to

823
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,830
take over and start to run commands

824
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,770
to build the project infrastructure,

825
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,690
the directory,

826
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,303
the different microservices, and so on.

827
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,333
That takes a while,

828
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,623
so, that's why we will move
a little bit forward in time.

829
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,850
Yes, so here we have it.

830
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:43,850
So, after clicking some
tasks and moving forward,

831
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,090
so we can see Kiro help there

832
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,770
Anna to build different microservices.

833
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,110
So, we have models,

834
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:56,820
we have repositories in
Java, as I said before,

835
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,943
dtos, repositories,

836
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,283
services,

837
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,230
and even tests

838
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,040
for all the different,

839
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,413
for microservices we have in this epic.

840
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,703
We have deployment scripts,

841
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,913
we have the front end,

842
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:24,270
and even the CICD pipeline.

843
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,550
So, in this case, we are using GitLab,

844
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:30,003
so Kiro helped to go into
build the CICD pipeline,

845
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,210
and as soon as we deploy these codes

846
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,107
so we commit these codes to GitLab.

847
00:42:36,107 --> 00:42:41,010
GitLab will run the
first time, the pipeline.

848
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:46,010
So we have tests, unit
tests, security tests,

849
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,840
we have the setup of the infrastructure,

850
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,140
we have the build of the
different microservices,

851
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,190
and finally the deployment on production.

852
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,030
As you can see, we even
have some security tests,

853
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:03,780
some security scans on the first stage.

854
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,950
So, that is probably already

855
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,983
making our DevSecOps team smile.

856
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,890
And talking about them,

857
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:15,633
let's meet our next one,
and our next persona, Chris.

858
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,920
So, Chris is our DevSecOps engineer,

859
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,460
and he has many, many responsibilities.

860
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,213
So, he's responsible for
the security monitoring,

861
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,290
performance, infrastructure management,

862
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,120
compliance and maintenance.

863
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,030
So, many, many responsibilities

864
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:40,320
and he needs to access
many different platforms.

865
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,400
So, cloud platforms, monitoring tools,

866
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,680
login tools, ticketing systems,

867
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,180
communication tools.

868
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,070
So, there is a lot of overhead,

869
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:54,660
so cognitive overhead really
with all those different tools.

870
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,660
And time is in production,

871
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,990
time matters a lot.

872
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,840
So, he needs to be 24/7 available,

873
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,813
he needs to have apt incident response,

874
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,650
access to different systems to the data

875
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,470
that helps him to solve his issues.

876
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:17,040
So, let's see how agentic AI can actually

877
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,880
streamline his workflow
to help him to solve

878
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,893
the issues more efficiently.

879
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,381
So, here we are moving to Kiro CLI,

880
00:44:26,381 --> 00:44:31,381
Kiro CLI is our CLI-based agentic tool.

881
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,490
And with Kiro CLI, he can,
for example, in plain English,

882
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:39,240
ask the two to check the logs,

883
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,500
see what are the issues
happening in the last seven days,

884
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,970
and categorize them in priority.

885
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:52,050
So, the plain English
request is translated

886
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:57,050
in requests to the AWS APIs
using another MCP server.

887
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,230
And this will bring back information

888
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,813
about what are the issues
that are happening.

889
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,240
And here we have it,
so Kiro even classifies

890
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,200
in different priorities,
the different issues,

891
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,000
and with some recommendations.

892
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,280
So, let's move back and take a look.

893
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,590
So, we have for the high priority issues,

894
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,380
we have some issues
with our security token,

895
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,990
and with the refresh
of our security token.

896
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:27,480
For the medium priority issues,

897
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,820
we have some bad actors that looks like

898
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,460
they are scanning some endpoints.

899
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,658
So, maybe something that
we need to take a look.

900
00:45:35,658 --> 00:45:40,320
And Kiro even provides some
recommendations what to do next.

901
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,670
So, Chris can now even in a proactive way,

902
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,183
you start to plan what will
be the next best actions.

903
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,950
And we have a couple of
different AWS partners

904
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,960
that are actually providing official

905
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,150
MCP service that you can, for example,

906
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:01,383
even connect Slack with
PageDuty, Splunk, Datadog,

907
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,320
to have all the information
in a single place

908
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,250
so he can, for example, see
what is going on in production,

909
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,293
the issues that are happening right now,

910
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,880
can even check the logs, the metrics,

911
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,880
and based on the knowledge base, again,

912
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,730
the run books, the playbooks,

913
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,190
see what is the best next action

914
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:30,690
and what is the issues or maybe the risks

915
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,080
related with any of the
remediation actions.

916
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,913
So, with that, Chris is
well prepared to do his job,

917
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:43,740
and I think that's it.

918
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,480
So, we have done it.

919
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,777
So, I think in 15 or less
minutes we probably went from

920
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:57,110
from scratch, from zero to a
production-ready application

921
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,833
or deployed network with
security or without capabilities.

922
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:07,140
So, and I think the
best part of this demo,

923
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,910
it is available as open source.

924
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:13,910
So, we will share the QR code
at the end, so, stay tuned.

925
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:17,190
So, then will probably
show now the resource page,

926
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:20,940
the resource slides,
so you can take a look,

927
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,890
see, learn,

928
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:26,733
and who knows maybe even
build a product out of it.

929
00:47:29,774 --> 00:47:31,350
But maybe, let's go and take a look

930
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:34,230
a little bit at what help us to,

931
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:35,670
with a very small team,

932
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:39,633
to build this sample
you can see here today.

933
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:44,940
So, even hearing from
customers and partners,

934
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:49,770
we understand AWS start to
see that it's very important

935
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:54,690
to have an infrastructure
that is not on your way,

936
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:57,390
not to build agentic AI systems.

937
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:02,390
I think even like in the JSE
in the shareholder ladder

938
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:05,310
in 2024 said something,

939
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:09,603
how is speed matters all
the time in all industries.

940
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,160
So I think the things
didn't slow down since then,

941
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,330
even the opposite, so you
cannot have a platform

942
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:22,140
that will slow down taking
care of the small details

943
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,470
but empowers you to build
complex applications,

944
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,000
complex agentic applications.

945
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,610
And this platform needs to be flexible,

946
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:33,600
so this will adapt to
your technical stack,

947
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,880
not the other way around.

948
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,980
So, whatever is their choice,

949
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,580
the platform that needs to
support you with your choices,

950
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:45,000
and needs to be scalable, secure,

951
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,060
provides you with all the telemetry

952
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,190
so you can have an enterprise-grade

953
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,770
application deployed on production.

954
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:56,733
So, that's why we released
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore,

955
00:48:59,257 --> 00:49:02,250
AgentCore provides different modules

956
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:06,540
so we can use them together or separately.

957
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,390
We have, for example, AgentCore Runtime,

958
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:11,910
that's the place where in our sample

959
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:16,470
you are running our agents, we
are running our MCP servers.

960
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:19,560
So, it's a serverless runtime

961
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,160
that provides you all the security.

962
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,520
So basically every agent

963
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,450
or MSC server is running
in a session for security,

964
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:34,383
it is a related session for
that particular request.

965
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,920
We have the AgentCore Gateway,

966
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,020
that's where you will
expose the different tools

967
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:46,320
to the agents, so it
provides a semantic search

968
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,080
even to not overload the context

969
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,260
of the agent looking for
tools and to execute,

970
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:57,060
and also provide some building
tools like AgentCore Browser

971
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,330
that will provide a sandbox environment

972
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,060
for the agents to access the internet,

973
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:07,560
to access a server-based browser,

974
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,650
who can make actions and execute actions

975
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,060
to the outside world.

976
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,760
Or even like a code interpreter

977
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,490
that will provide also
a sandbox environment

978
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,413
where it can write code,

979
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,310
execute the code and receive the outcome.

980
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:28,310
So, to have like a more
predictive data-driven outcome.

981
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,060
You have like Identicore Identity

982
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:37,740
to secure the end-to-end conversation

983
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,730
between the user, from
the user to the agent,

984
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:44,100
agents to your tool, for your MCP,

985
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,810
for example, base tools,

986
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:48,900
and from the MCP to the outside world.

987
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,290
AgentCore Memory for your session memory,

988
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:54,420
for your long-term memory.

989
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,760
So, to have a place to store, for example,

990
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,810
in our case information
about the preferences,

991
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,130
the project,

992
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,980
so to have a more longterm memory

993
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,380
even to share between different agents.

994
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,380
And finally, AgentCore Observability.

995
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:13,680
So, to have information
about the telemetry,

996
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,730
what's going on,

997
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:18,360
how many tokens were consumed
by the different agents.

998
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,920
So, to have a open telemetry
agent based information

999
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,043
so you can guide the
optimization of your system.

1000
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,038
And now, I think I will leave the stage.

1001
00:51:31,038 --> 00:51:32,872
My colleague, Joris,

1002
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:34,963
that'll go to our customer success story.

1003
00:51:34,963 --> 00:51:36,303
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1004
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:42,710
- So Xebia is a global
technology firm founded in 2001,

1005
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,630
and we're active in over 16 countries,

1006
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:47,860
and our experts help organizations

1007
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,020
through software engineering,

1008
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,600
cloud, data and AI,

1009
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,583
DevOps and agile transformation.

1010
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:01,590
We work with some of the
world's leading enterprises

1011
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:05,130
from top global banks and major airlines,

1012
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,633
and retail and healthcare.

1013
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,443
As an AWS premier tier partner,

1014
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,953
we've built deep experience
over than a decade.

1015
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,430
Our team of 750 specialists

1016
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:21,930
hold 19 competencies

1017
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:25,293
and have done 20 map
migrations in the recent years.

1018
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,323
So, let's talk about Delta.

1019
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,000
Delta Airlines is
operating in a high volume,

1020
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,930
safety critical environment
where reliability,

1021
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:43,450
speed and innovation directly impacts

1022
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,070
customer experience

1023
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:52,650
and operational excellence.

1024
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:53,483
Sorry.

1025
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:58,750
We've been tasked to reduce error rates

1026
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,023
and improve productivity.

1027
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:05,490
We took an approach
that took generative AI

1028
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,290
and transformed the traditional

1029
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:10,683
software development lifecycle
into a generative AI one,

1030
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:16,713
with the goal to bring more
efficiency to the personas.

1031
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,500
So, what were the challenges
and business impact?

1032
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:26,103
Pre-development and architectural hurdles,

1033
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,310
unclear requirements,

1034
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:31,290
inconsistent criteria,

1035
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,150
slow prioritization,

1036
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:36,180
paired with a pattern
of inconsistent security

1037
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,060
and non-functional requirements,

1038
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,490
creating foundational issues

1039
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:43,353
leading into longer cycle times.

1040
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,250
Development and testing bottlenecks,

1041
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,200
code duplication,

1042
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,703
inconsistent reviews,

1043
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,163
weak test coverage,

1044
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:01,440
and poor data quality delivers,

1045
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,990
the delivery impact and impacts quality

1046
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,763
leading into quality variance.

1047
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,503
Pipeline and operational friction,

1048
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:14,670
problematic CICD workflows,

1049
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:15,600
alert fatigue,

1050
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,400
delayed troubleshooting,

1051
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,160
and limited cost visibility

1052
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,043
leading into higher
operational overhead and cost.

1053
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,520
To solve these challenges,

1054
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,110
we developed a platform

1055
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:30,483
and this platform is called Xebia ACE.

1056
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:34,560
We've combined Xebia's
value realization framework

1057
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,930
with AWS best practices,

1058
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:40,440
and with this system in
place we have have an ability

1059
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,103
to identify and track measurable benefits.

1060
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:48,840
This enables us to drive development,

1061
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,880
the development lifecycle transformation

1062
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,323
through various personas.

1063
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,273
We've identified 50,

1064
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:02,250
more than 50 use cases and
50% are already in production,

1065
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,263
and we have a 100% adoption rate.

1066
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,172
With this platform in place,

1067
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:11,910
we observed a 40% increase of productivity

1068
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:15,753
and a 30% reduction in error rates.

1069
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,070
The time spent on writing specifications

1070
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:22,803
went from days to minutes,

1071
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,950
cycle times and manual effort were reduced

1072
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,723
and additional cost was avoided.

1073
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,830
So, our AI-powered software development

1074
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:35,370
lifecycle acceleration platform
is an end-to-end solution

1075
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:40,230
that leverages the generative
AI and AWS services

1076
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,030
to streamline automatically

1077
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,733
the critical stages of a
software development process.

1078
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:49,590
ACE will have a holistic
view from the start

1079
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:53,043
till the end of your
software development profile.

1080
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,540
It takes the unstructured requirements

1081
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,590
into a production-ready artifact,

1082
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:04,383
significantly reducing development time,

1083
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,230
and improve quality consistency

1084
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,410
across your enterprise software projects.

1085
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,523
An example of these
artifacts is, for example,

1086
00:56:12,523 --> 00:56:14,880
a C4 architectural diagram,

1087
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,953
which is being generated by our platform,

1088
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,350
and that will power your
architectural decisions.

1089
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,510
With all these rich structures in place,

1090
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,730
we can feed solutions like Kiro,

1091
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,713
like you just saw in Fabio's demo.

1092
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,970
We also have a 15-day trial
available for this program,

1093
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:34,920
and we will show a QR code at the end,

1094
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,993
so, please stay there for that.

1095
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,350
So quickly, let's go
over the main components,

1096
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:43,590
because I'm also seeing that
I'm running a little bit late.

1097
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:48,360
So, various personas, just
like the other product

1098
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,593
that can use the system.

1099
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:54,030
Solution ACE is fully
running on AgentCore,

1100
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:57,573
so that powers the heart of our solution.

1101
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:03,980
We use Bedrock and the Bedrock
models to do the inference,

1102
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,970
and we use a knowledge base

1103
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:10,323
powered by OpenSearch to
do vectorized searching.

1104
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:14,820
We have a data layer
that will actually feed

1105
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:18,000
these vector stores so
that the agents are powered

1106
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,690
and make sure that they can do their job.

1107
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:24,990
And we connect various
tools like Jira, Confluence,

1108
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:29,880
through MCP servers to
actually create epics, stories,

1109
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,733
Confluence pages or Figma designs.

1110
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:35,813
Oh.

1111
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:40,010
Sorry about that.

1112
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,930
The whole solution was
designed to be serverless,

1113
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,640
secure and scalable.

1114
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,130
And this, this is just the beginning.

1115
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,780
I'm exciting for the future

1116
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:51,033
what will bring for this platform.

1117
00:57:51,949 --> 00:57:54,150
Thanks.

1118
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:55,050
- Thank you Joris.

1119
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,420
So like Xebia, we have other partners

1120
00:58:02,472 --> 00:58:07,110
built the platform driven
approach, like Integra Tech,

1121
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:11,013
Zero&One, IBM, Cognizant, and PWC.

1122
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,160
You can see lot more partners

1123
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,930
are actually going to adopt this,

1124
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,870
and they're actually
innovating quite fast, right?

1125
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,193
What you just heard from.

1126
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,310
There are a couple of more case studies

1127
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:25,080
we have in the limited time.

1128
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,530
I'm gonna kind of run
through very, very fast.

1129
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:31,170
But the slides and the entire session

1130
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:33,030
will be available in YouTube later,

1131
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,850
so you could able to see them as well.

1132
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:40,170
Iskaan is a Dubai-based
building management company.

1133
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:42,000
They had challenges,

1134
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,100
the traditional challenges in SDLC

1135
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,230
and scattered requirements.

1136
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:50,040
Integra Tech, one of our AWS
premier consulting partner,

1137
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:53,790
they built a platform-driven
approach called as iCODE,

1138
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:56,610
and using that they could able to address,

1139
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,640
solve some of those use cases as well.

1140
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,564
Specifically, the time
consumed in terms of designs,

1141
00:59:03,564 --> 00:59:04,397
reviews,

1142
00:59:04,397 --> 00:59:06,390
they were taking quite a lot of time

1143
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:10,380
in terms of fixing
issues in the production

1144
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,200
because there is no automated way

1145
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,930
to understand what is happening.

1146
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,100
So this is one.

1147
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:21,693
And the other case study is from Zero&One.

1148
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:27,180
Zero&One is another AWS
premier consulting partner.

1149
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:32,040
So, they created a
offering to help Zonevoice,

1150
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,150
is a customer based out
of, again, Middle East,

1151
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:40,860
and they also serve customers across Asia,

1152
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,980
Africa, and Europe.

1153
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,597
So, that challenges some of

1154
00:59:45,597 --> 00:59:47,610
the business critical applications,

1155
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:52,110
were actually hosted on Java 8 application

1156
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:55,200
having outdated critical libraries.

1157
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,420
So again, Zero&One,

1158
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,930
they created a AI-powered SDLC integration

1159
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,880
and with GitHub automation

1160
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,570
that actually accelerated
the modernization part.

1161
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,740
So, call to action.

1162
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,330
So, these are some of the resources

1163
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:11,280
we have actually put together for you

1164
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,260
in terms of reimagining the
operating model from an SDLC.

1165
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,920
100s of use cases that
we actually envisioned

1166
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,320
that you could actually
create and implement

1167
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:26,640
based on the value that
delivers to the customers.

1168
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,830
And then the last one is the accelerators,

1169
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:31,740
which is the samples and
reference architecture

1170
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:32,850
that you have seen.

1171
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:36,003
So, these are the QR codes
for each one of them.

1172
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,410
And if you wanted to get your organization

1173
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:43,770
on a learning path with agentic AI,

1174
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,800
so we have courses which are created

1175
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,800
for partners and customers as well.

1176
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,110
So, log into AWS Skill Builder,

1177
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,000
and then you would able to scan this.

1178
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,260
Once you scan the QR code,

1179
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,630
it takes you to the
whole learning session,

1180
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:00,180
like level 100, 200, 300, right?

1181
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:02,370
And as Joris was telling,

1182
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:06,120
they're offering 15-days
trial for their SDLC platform,

1183
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,150
so please feel free to contact them

1184
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:11,673
and they will arrange an
access to the platform.

1185
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,150
So, if you wanted to talk to us,

1186
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:18,780
we are gonna be staying there
for 15 minutes in the corner,

1187
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,733
feel free to come and reach us out,

1188
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:23,370
or you can also fill in the form

1189
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:25,530
so that some of our solutions architect

1190
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:26,580
will get in touch with you,

1191
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:29,610
in case if you wanted to work and help you

1192
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:32,340
with some of the customer
acceleration challenges.

1193
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:35,850
With that, thank you so much
for attending this session,

1194
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:37,860
and thank you so much for our co-speakers.

1195
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,390
I hope you enjoyed the session,

1196
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:42,061
and have a great rest of the re:Invent

1197
01:01:42,061 --> 01:01:43,203
Thank you so much.
