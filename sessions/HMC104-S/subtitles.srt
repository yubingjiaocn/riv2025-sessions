00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,030
- Hello, good evening to the Silent Room.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,830
My name is Bruno Vacetello,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,570
I'm financial services partner
for IBM Consulting in Chile.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,908
And here with me, Soledad Ovando.

5
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:20,790
Soledad Ovando is the General
Manager for Commercial Lending

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,173
at Banco Estado.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,600
So to start, over the past few years,

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,420
we have all been talking about

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,090
artificial intelligence
and how it has moved

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,573
to the center of the
conversation in banking.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,200
It's no longer just a concept.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,470
It's been applied across
different areas in banking:

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,580
risk, compliance, customer engagement,

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,980
everywhere in banking.

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,253
It is in particular, this year,

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,783
where the adoption
accelerated significantly.

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,450
So that means that artificial intelligence

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,250
is a fundamental part

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,013
of the transformational plans for banking.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,800
So far, many of the use
cases we are seeing right now

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,320
are mostly applied to
producing efficiencies

22
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,160
and incremental improvements.

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,410
According to a recent study

24
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,980
from the IBM Institute for Business Value,

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,980
one quarter of the
organizations are not using

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,310
artificial intelligence at the middle

27
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,620
of their intelligent workflows.

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,140
That means that they're avoiding

29
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,080
using artificial intelligence for growth,

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,220
for changing their
current business models.

31
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,643
As you can imagine, this is
a huge opportunity ahead.

32
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,420
And continuing with this study,

33
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,220
we are forecasting that
for the end of 2026,

34
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,810
intelligence workflows will
multiply by 12 in banking.

35
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,400
That will be, that's huge.

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,730
That will be a complete shift

37
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,170
in how the work is
being performed in banks

38
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,010
and how it will change
the customer interactions

39
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,473
of customers with the banks.

40
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,360
This kind of innovation

41
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:46,987
that is particularly important
in banking is regarding,

42
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,780
or it can leverage the richness

43
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,930
of the data the bank manages.

44
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,460
And as we'll take (stumbles
over words) advance

45
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,730
of the complexity of the current processes

46
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,073
that the bankings are now performing.

47
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,150
So this kind of innovations is part

48
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,420
of the soul of Banco Estado, and you know,

49
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,420
it's also part of the
story of collaboration we,

50
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,743
IBM and AWS, always try
to help with the gang.

51
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,623
So,

52
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,310
let me just give you a very
brief story of the past.

53
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,850
60 years ago, Chile was
facing, was undergoing,

54
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,980
a very important technological change.

55
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,980
By the end of 1969, IBM and Banco Estado

56
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,780
defined and deployed the first

57
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,740
tele-processing network in Chile.

58
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,890
That network allowed ranches

59
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,953
to perform transactions in real time.

60
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,490
That, my friends, was the
beginning of the innovation

61
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,530
and the modernization process

62
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,933
for the Chilean industry in banking.

63
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,310
Now, Banco Estado processes
more than 1 million transactions

64
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,563
per month on IBM technology.

65
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,800
You know, this history this epic,

66
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,210
is what we wanted to repeat last year.

67
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,670
So by the end of 2024,

68
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,290
we agreed a new statistical
alliance with Banco Estado

69
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,290
aiming to fulfill the
current Chilean needs

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,680
and being according to the current

71
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,703
technological possibilities
that we have nowadays.

72
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,600
And we set a particular goal.

73
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,840
Our goal is

74
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,560
to make technology and make innovations

75
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,200
available for helping the way

76
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,683
the Chilean client lives in Chile.

77
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,660
So before going further,

78
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,280
I would like Soledad to talk about

79
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,203
what Banco Estado is doing right now.

80
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,543
- Okay, thank you Bruno.

81
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,690
Good afternoon everyone.

82
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,690
I'd like to begin by
thanking Amazon Web Serve

83
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,410
for inviting me to be a part of this event

84
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,010
and especially IBM for inviting me

85
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,270
to talk about the work we
do at Banco Estado in Chile,

86
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,400
and our partnership for the development

87
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,670
of one of our resident innovation.

88
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,670
And apologize for my
limited English, which I,

89
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,890
why I will be giving my pitch,
my presentation in Spanish.

90
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,660
Isabel, help me. Yes?

91
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:09,014
(speaks in Spanish)

92
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,606

(speaks in Spanish)

107
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:03,810
- [Isabel] Banco Estado
is 160-year-old bank

108
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,730
controlled by the Chilean government.

109
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,640
Its social mission is
bringing technology innovation

110
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,160
to customers and companies in Chile,

111
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,790
a key role in promoting
financial inclusion in Chile,

112
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,170
including universal debit
card, banking correspondence,

113
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,630
and microfinance programs.

114
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,620
Among the 20 million
people population in Chile,

115
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,150
17.5% of them, 17.5% million

116
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,320
hold one or more Banco Estado products.

117
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Banco Estado app is the number
one in downloads in Chile

118
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,330
holding 12 million active users,

119
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,280
and 50% out of them use
the bank on a daily basis.

120
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,750
Banco Estado has 1.2 million
commercial clients that account

121
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,750
for more than 90% of the
total employers in Chile.

122
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,653
It makes it the leading mortgage
credit company in Chile.

(speaks in Spanish)

146
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:52,767
- [Isabel] Over the last years,

147
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,900
innovation has become a strategic pilot

148
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,080
to accelerate Banco
Estado business by pushing

149
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,830
the ecosystem model to raising
the bar for its services

150
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,830
and expanding its role
beyond daily banking.

151
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,830
Three strategic initiatives
are built around this priority.

152
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,100
Number one is digital customer experience,

153
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,870
both for helping educate
non-tech savvy customers

154
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,080
and to existing to the new generation.

155
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,630
Next one is the development acceleration

156
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,370
of a finance ecosystem,

157
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,670
managing the relationship
between large enterprises,

158
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,820
its providers, S&B, and end customers.

159
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,990
And finally,

160
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,623
to accelerate the sustainable
development of the country.

161
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,050
Some of the examples in the
strategic initiatives include

162
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,353
Rutpay, which will be the
first super app in Chile.

163
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,500
Startup financing program,

164
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,620
which in two years has
granted a hundred companies

165
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,350
plus $20 million in investments.

166
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,760
Impacto+ that articulates the
relationship between companies

167
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,373
and green impact for sustainability.

180
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,350
- [Isabel] When the
innovation space was born,

181
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,700
the opportunity to collaborate
with IBM Consulting and AWS,

182
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,520
the main assumptions were
to build an ecosystem

183
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,960
coexisting with the existing
banking teams of developers.

184
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,510
It started with the strategic analysis

185
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,920
that led into accelerating a
housing construction ecosystem.

186
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,570
The decision for deciding if, how to,

187
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,450
when and why to invest on housing.

188
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,880
Number one was that Banco Estado

189
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,030
is the leader in mortgage loans in Chile.

190
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,390
It has a large percentage of investments

191
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:14,160
in financing, construction
and other housing initiatives.

192
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,860
And Banco Estado holds
a close relationship

193
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,570
with the government and large
companies in the industry

194
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,240
that helps accelerate the connection

195
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,613
between the actors in the ecosystem.

196
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:31,076
(speaks in Spanish)

197
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:38,326
(speaks in Spanish)

198
00:15:42,546 --> 00:15:45,546
(speaks in Spanish)

199
00:15:50,003 --> 00:15:53,003
(speaks in Spanish)

200
00:15:57,252 --> 00:16:00,252
(speaks in Spanish)

201
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:06,330
(speaks in Spanish)

202
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,300
- [Isabel] The housing
ecosystem joins banking

203
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,770
with companies and clients
and changes the experience

204
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,050
in purchasing real estate in Chile,

205
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,050
converging this and helping
Banco Estado become one bank.

206
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,960
This is a unique opportunity
among all banks in Chile.

207
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,320
There's no other platform as this one.

208
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,170
It merges IBM Consultings deep expertise

209
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,430
in financial services and AWS
state-of-the-art technology

210
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,713
to benefit clients in Chile.

211
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,060
- Thanks Soledad. Thanks Isabel.

212
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,120
And let me show you a
very, very short video

213
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,643
to understand what this means.

214
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,810
- [Narrator] Throughout its 170 years,

215
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,760
Banco Estado has continuously evolved

216
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,640
to improve its services,
(bright music)

217
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,290
serving its 15 million customers

218
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,273
and acting as an economic stabilizer.

219
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,990
Manual and complicated processes.

220
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,480
The disarticulation between
the actors in the sector

221
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,660
and limited access to
financing prevent many Chileans

222
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,960
from achieving the dream
of owning their home.

223
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,603
Banco Estado has a solution.

224
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,200
A digital platform that
allows you to search

225
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,570
for the best housing option at any time,

226
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,510
support savings, and
provides financial education.

227
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,000
and makes it easier to
obtain a mortgage online

228
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,260
within its marketplace.
(bright music continues)

229
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,870
Customers can apply for loans
online with the support of

230
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,240
an artificial intelligence-based assistant

231
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,190
that helps them throughout the process.

232
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,780
The platform is also designed
for companies in the sector

233
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,150
integrating the government,
real estate companies,

234
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,740
construction companies, notaries,

235
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,660
and product and services providers,

236
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,100
creating a unified experience

237
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,510
from obtaining construction permits

238
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,893
to housing administration.

239
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,600
Risk models based on machine
learning allow Banco Estado

240
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,790
to provide access to
housing to more Chileans

241
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,160
who are currently rejected
by traditional models,

242
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,990
positioning itself as a bank for all

243
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,690
and inviting them to join in
the development of an ecosystem

244
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,276
that supports growth,
innovation, and prosperity.

245
00:18:12,276 --> 00:18:14,490
(bright music continues)

246
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,580
Together, Banco Estado and
IBM create a better future

247
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,480
for housing and construction in Chile.

248
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,333
Throughout its 100.

249
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,890
- Well, thank you, Soledad.

250
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,760
Let's look how the collaboration
is being put into practice.

251
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,960
So to address the different needs for the

252
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,960
construction and housing
players in this ecosystem,

253
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,980
we decided to build a new business model

254
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,750
and also a new operational
technological platform

255
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,380
that will be shared by all the
partners in this ecosystem.

256
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,380
So, all participants, banks, the notaries,

257
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,870
legal entities and other providers,

258
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,070
with access to this platform, will,

259
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,330
and they will be connected

260
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,310
by intelligent workflows
using artificial intelligence.

261
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,310
This approach promotes
collaboration, transparency,

262
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,173
and efficiency for the entire ecosystem.

263
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,760
And the fact becomes even clearer

264
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,660
when we look the client's perspective.

265
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,493
So,

266
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,990
what are we trying to deploy to the market

267
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,703
for the next couple of weeks?

268
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,520
A real change in the customer experience.

269
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,520
At the beginning, clients
will apply for a new mortgage,

270
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,580
we will apply for, will try
to search a new property,

271
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,010
and they will be assessed by agents.

272
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,680
They will help you
through the whole process.

273
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,273
After getting the approval,

274
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,110
agents will help the client in another

275
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,220
very, very, very complex part
with this process in Chile.

276
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,430
That means getting the documentation,

277
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:22,430
going through the processes
and then the closing stage.

278
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,660
Agents will help the client
just to accelerate that,

279
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,660
to prevent a lot of (stumbles
over words) interaction

280
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:38,670
and obviously get as fast as possible.

281
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,133
And after the sale,

282
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,620
we are also considering
a marketplace where

283
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,420
the providers with the different companies

284
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:56,420
interact with the clients
in order to get the offer

285
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,670
that the clients need,

286
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,010
put together the offer
that the clients need

287
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,243
in order to purchase services and goods.

288
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,200
This is one of the slides I like most

289
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,200
because it reflects the level of ambition

290
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,090
we set for this kind of process.

291
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,030
So first of all,

292
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,190
we are trying to reduce

293
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,320
by 15 days the total time

294
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,103
for mortgage approval and
processing at clientele.

295
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,540
We are also trying to reduce
the closing time in particular

296
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,710
after the processing of
the credit is being made

297
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,610
and that final stage where
everybody got stress.

298
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,350
So they want everybody,

299
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,260
the seller wants to get the
money as fast as possible.

300
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,810
The client was wants to get his house.

301
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:02,730
So we are making it 30% faster.

302
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,920
So as I mentioned before,

303
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,051
interactions will be key in
order to get these results.

304
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:12,450
We will reduce by health in interactions

305
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,753
between individual and business clients.

306
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:22,080
One very interesting
topic I definitely love.

307
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,903
We are considering for certain properties,

308
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:32,280
zero days, and disputes
for defined appraisals.

309
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,850
That means that for those properties,

310
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:40,850
appraisals will be made
instantly and automatically.

311
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:48,243
So this will change everything
in the local market.

312
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,270
So, and regarding the processing cost,

313
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:59,270
they will gradually
decline reaching around 30%

314
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,633
once the system is fully operational.

315
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,993
So

316
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,113
as we have mentioned before,

317
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,340
we made this new operational
model where Banco Estado

318
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:27,470
contributes with their unique
expertise in the local market,

319
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,390
knowing their customer,
knowing their products,

320
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,730
knowing their system at all.

321
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,730
And IBM shines to bring the
technological capabilities,

322
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,130
the operational capabilities, sorry,

323
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:46,130
that along with AWS
providing this infrastructure

324
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:52,920
help us put all together
and integrate processes,

325
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,030
business logics and data

326
00:23:57,752 --> 00:23:59,910
in order to produce this concept

327
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,940
that we are starting to call

328
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,940
the online operative model for Agentic AI.

329
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,750
That will be a combination of forces,

330
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,750
of different services where
people and agents will interact.

331
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,880
And will help us foster the culture

332
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,140
that Banco Estado pursues
with our capabilities

333
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,080
in order to create new ways of working

334
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,773
for Chile and for the customers.

335
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,160
So, obviously that a great
part of this conception

336
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,270
and this implementation is allowed

337
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:53,270
by our very strong partnership with AWS.

338
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,080
Our partnership grew very rapidly

339
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,390
during the last four years.

340
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,840
We made huge steps every year.

341
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,960
And so it allow us to deploy,

342
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,650
to build and deploy very complex solutions

343
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:14,610
in just very quick time.

344
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:19,610
And also it help us to strength our teams

345
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,983
in advanced technologies.

346
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,520
And this is, we believe, that
this will get even better.

347
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,287
So right now we are awarded
with different prices

348
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:42,150
regarding our capabilities and Agentic AI,

349
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,450
our specific capabilities that we have

350
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,300
with AWS for financial services.

351
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,850
And also we were recognized

352
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,383
for our capabilities in
the consulting business.

353
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,593
Yes.

354
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,443
And obviously there is more to come here.

355
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,203
But,

356
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,370
but, we wanted,

357
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:13,370
we wanted, we really wanted to
make a special announcement,

358
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,550
maybe a couple of days earlier,

359
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:22,230
but I think this will be
the right time to do it.

360
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,670
Soledad.

361
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,830
- Finally, we invite the audience

362
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,993
to learn more about this initiative,

363
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,743
the new quarter of what is represent.

364
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,933
The housing platform will
be launched next week.

367
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,413
- Wait, no.

368
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,703
Can they keep a secret?

369
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,990
- Can you keep a secret?

370
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,590
You're asking if they can, what?

371
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:06,226
Will it stay in Vegas?

372
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:08,850
- Search in your browser

373
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,433
- Stays in Vegas.

374
00:27:15,696 --> 00:27:19,555
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

375
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,763
Thank you.

376
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,870
- Okay. Okay.

377
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,240
We are very proud of
having the opportunity

378
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,540
of announce it here, oh it's like,

379
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,850
it's a little bit weird announcement,

380
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,153
but we said it.

381
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:42,350
So, and obviously,
we've been talking a lot

382
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:48,020
and we were talking about
the complexity of building,

383
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:53,810
discovering, deploying
agentic AI nowadays,

384
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,420
in particular in financial services.

385
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,290
Now I would like to
introduce Vikram Murali,

386
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:06,290
Vikram Murali who will
talk a lot more about

387
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,040
what are the real needs
in terms of scaling,

388
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,620
in terms of managing efficiency,

389
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,730
and in terms of making
sustainable for the future.

390
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,630
So Vikram, thanks, and thank you all.

391
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,360
Have a good rest of day.
(people applauding)

392
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,193
- Thank you.

393
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,983
Can you guys hear me? Perfect.

394
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,180
There is no feedback,
so I think that's why

395
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,070
we keep taking the mic away.

396
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,500
So first of all, you
know, we all talk about

397
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,540
AI and agents and all of that, right?

398
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,553
So the first half of the presentation,

399
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,130
to me that's very, very important,

400
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,560
because we want to understand
from our customers,

401
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,410
from our clients, as to
how they're using AI,

402
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,000
how they're using agents,

403
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,440
what is the return of investment,

404
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,630
return on investment, right?

405
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,400
So that's a phenomenal story.

406
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,070
Thanks for sharing with us, Bruno.

407
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,903
So

408
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,150
once you talk about AI
and agentic frameworks

409
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,660
and agents, you create agents,
the next question becomes

410
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,730
how do you scale these agents?

411
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,920
How do you make sure that these agents

412
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,470
are cost effective when you run them?

413
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,160
And what we are seeing
from an IBM perspective

414
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,310
is our customers on AWS,

415
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,390
they are building more
agentic capabilities than ever

416
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,090
in the last, I would
say, probably 12 months.

417
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,720
The pace of adoption has
accelerated dramatically.

418
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,390
Now, when this happens
with any new technology,

419
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,560
when any new thing that comes in the field

420
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,700
we see a few issues.

421
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,770
So one of the first issues we see

422
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,130
is around the dynamic
nature of agentic AI.

423
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,800
And what I mean by that is, so imagine,

424
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,250
in place of agents if you had, you know,

425
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,760
an SRE doing some work
or a human doing a work,

426
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,720
there were predictive paths
that that human would've taken,

427
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,660
from run books and things like those.

428
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,460
But now with agentic AI,

429
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,670
it's really, really complex
and dynamic in the sense that

430
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:13,670
agents are, they can think
about various different paths

431
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,380
and you cannot predict
which path they will take.

432
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,180
And that's the whole
purpose of an agent, right?

433
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,140
They're autonomous,
they can take, you know,

434
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,640
they can think about different paths,

435
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,370
they can evaluate much
faster than humans can.

436
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,530
So there is much more complexity involved

437
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,030
in running these agents at scale.

438
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,790
So that's one of the first
problems that we see.

439
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,410
The second issue that we see is

440
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,600
the diverse infrastructures and tools

441
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,120
that these agents will have to connect to.

442
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,300
So in agentic AI, one of the things that,

443
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,420
I've had so many customer
conversations since morning,

444
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,820
one of the common theme that is coming up

445
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,510
is customers want to use agents,
clients want to use agents,

446
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,070
to take automated actions.

447
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,780
That's the whole point.

448
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,970
Now, how much do you trust an agent

449
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,070
from taking an automated action?

450
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,990
And if you have to take
an automated action,

451
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,670
you may have to give up control,

452
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,540
you may have to give
connectivity to agents

453
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,550
to multiple infrastructures.

454
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,650
The agent could be running on one cloud,

455
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,110
but the infrastructure and tools
that it needs to connect to

456
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,140
could be running on any cloud,
could be running on-prem.

457
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,550
So you have to give up that control.

458
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,650
So that's the second
biggest barrier that we see

459
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,080
is the diverse infrastructure and tools

460
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,423
that these agents will have to connect to.

461
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,770
The third area that we
see is the rapid change.

462
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:31,770
I mean, if you take a
week off, go on vacation,

463
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,890
go on a cruise and come back,
there'll be a new platform,

464
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:38,493
a new something to do with the agentic AI.

465
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,690
A new method to create agents,

466
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,790
to monitor agents, observe agents.

467
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,180
So this field is rapidly evolving

468
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,240
and we see customers struggling to adapt.

469
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,420
And if you look at traditional
development methods

470
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,863
and development practices,

471
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,340
there was a particular
rhythm in doing things.

472
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,980
Now that rhythm has completely
gone out the window.

473
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,010
So customers and clients and end users

474
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,080
have to rapidly evolve and change

475
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,120
when you talk about using agents

476
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,090
and then having these agents in production

477
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,160
and scaling them and so on and so forth.

478
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,190
So these are some of the areas we believe

479
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,690
customers are struggling with.

480
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,900
Now, what do you do about it?

481
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,210
To make agents really enterprise ready

482
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,190
we deal with large enterprises.

483
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,020
I mean, the previous example was a bank.

484
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,890
We deal with banks, financial
institutions, you know,

485
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,520
the insurance industry, so many
different large enterprises.

486
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,850
So to make sure agents are
truly enterprise ready,

487
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,760
the number one thing is
to make sure that you have

488
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,710
enough control and confidence
that these agents are reliable

489
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,710
and that they can be consistent.

490
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,400
They're always available and
they are scalable, right?

491
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,450
So these are main areas that
you need to concentrate on

492
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,300
when you're building and
deploying these agents.

493
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,340
The second area that we believe

494
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,990
that you need to concentrate on

495
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,450
is around performance and the value.

496
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:10,740
What is the ROI for when
you deploy these agents?

497
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,280
Now if something costs you
$10 and you're bringing

498
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,360
automation in and the automation
is going to cost you $20,

499
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,660
you can't do automation just
for the sake of doing it.

500
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,430
There needs to be an ROI.

501
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:26,760
So we always look at how
are these agents performing?

502
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,220
What is the cost of running these agents?

503
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,460
What is the save, the return on investment

504
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,320
that you're getting by going agentic.

505
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,053
And then how are these agents performing?

506
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:42,660
How much CPU GPU infrastructure
they're consuming?

507
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,240
All of these things
are very, very crucial.

508
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,550
And these are things which become day two,

509
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:51,180
day three items that
customers are, you know,

510
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,983
they don't look at it from day one.

511
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:57,330
So, let's assume everyone
knows how to build agents.

512
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,800
You know, you build your own agents,

513
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,600
you have a reason why
you want to build agents,

514
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,980
you want to deploy agents.

515
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,960
So let's skip that topic here.

516
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,410
What we are talking about is,
when you build these agents,

517
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:11,700
make sure that you think about
these day two activities.

518
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,430
You want to build agents in a framework

519
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,350
where you can observe them.

520
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,910
You need to know what is happening,

521
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,400
why is an agent behaving
in a particular way?

522
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,660
So you need to observe them.

523
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,880
So observability is key

524
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,280
when you talk about agentic AI.

525
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,920
The second area is optimizing.

526
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,980
So make sure these agents can run

527
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,860
in a particular optimized way,

528
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,290
not just with the workload with a POC,

529
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,780
with a proof of value
that you established,

530
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,520
but when you open the flood gates

531
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,460
and when hundreds and
thousands of customers come in,

532
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,070
these agents need to perform
exactly the same way.

533
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,600
So performance and scalability

534
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,030
are gonna be very, very important.

535
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,680
Now, automation.

536
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,050
So automation, again, like I said,

537
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,050
I had so many customer
meetings since morning.

538
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,450
Almost every client that I met,

539
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,090
the one thing that they're
looking at agentic AI,

540
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,400
is to help them with automation.

541
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,040
Some call it self-healing,
some call it automation,

542
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,840
some call it auto-remediation.

543
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,040
But at the end of the day,

544
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,590
how can you remove that human in the loop

545
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:16,650
or maybe reduce the human in the loop

546
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,570
to maybe a one-click approval, right?

547
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,670
Let the agent take that decision.

548
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,850
So for that, automation is key.

549
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,130
And the last area is govern.

550
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,930
Now just because you have these agents

551
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,820
and they're taking automated actions,

552
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,550
you need to have secure policies in place.

553
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,410
So we, as I said, we work with a lot

554
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,860
of large enterprise customers,
and there are control,

555
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,200
compliance control frameworks

556
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,200
in every region in the Americas,
in EMEA, in AP and so on.

557
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,370
And you need to make sure
that there are proper

558
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,010
governance controls and
policies set in place.

559
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,660
That way you can control
what these agents are doing.

560
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,140
Now if you look at IBM, we have,

561
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,090
I come from the IBM automation side,

562
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,520
I lead development for IBM automation,

563
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,240
and we have these
capabilities that we use both.

564
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,380
We take it to customers,

565
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,730
which helps them observe and
automate as well as, you know,

566
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,170
monitor these agents.

567
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,000
But we also use agents internally.

568
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,080
And the next few slides,

569
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,440
I'll go through how exactly we do these.

570
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,210
Now the first product that we have,

571
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,460
the offering that we have,
is called IBM Instana.

572
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,110
This is our answer to our

573
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,420
application performance monitoring tool.

574
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,150
Now, I don't look at agents
as something different.

575
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,150
Applications are going to be using agents

576
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,240
so which means we should be
able to monitor these agents

577
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,950
using the same APM tools.

578
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,742
We can't invent new tools to say,

579
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:42,510
you know, you're going to monitor agents,

580
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,850
so we have to use the exact same tools.

581
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,670
So Instana delivers
full stack observability

582
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,340
and with that it delivers
AI observability,

583
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,950
including agentic observability as well.

584
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,590
And one of the differences with Instana

585
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,660
and some of the other tools in the market

586
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,170
is that we collect data every second.

587
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,780
Now there are tools out
there that collect data

588
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,530
every five seconds or eight
seconds or 15 seconds, right?

589
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,140
But we collect data every single second.

590
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,080
We call look at metrics, events, logs,

591
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,080
everything that happens
around an agent every second.

592
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,690
So when it comes to root
cause analysis that there's

593
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,450
nothing better than this
particular offering here.

594
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,130
And by the way, everything that I'm gonna

595
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,900
walk you through the next few slides,

596
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,300
we use these within IBM
for our own products,

597
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,360
both in development and when
we run our products at scale

598
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,660
for our customers as well.

599
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,860
The second one is Turbonomic.

600
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,710
Now Turbonomic started
with cost optimization,

601
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,510
resource optimization.

602
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,830
Now if you dial back 3, 4,
5 years back when ChatGPT

603
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:47,160
came on and LLMs were the
big craze at that time,

604
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,380
everyone wanted GPUs.

605
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,600
At IBM, we did have a bunch of GPUs.

606
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,690
Every developer wanted
GPUs to go do whatever they

607
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,483
wanted to do with their ML training.

608
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,448
But one thing we found is that about

609
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:04,620
60% of GPUs were not even being utilized.

610
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,120
That's where Turbonomic came in.

611
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,030
We turned Turbonomic on on
our own development practices

612
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,660
within IBM and very quickly
we found that developers

613
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,860
were waiting in line because
GPUs were not available,

614
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,330
and they were assigned to developers

615
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,500
who were not even using them.

616
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,990
60% were wastage.

617
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,930
So Turbonomic is that
tool that can help you

618
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,660
from a resource optimization perspective.

619
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,910
We don't have infinite resources, right?

620
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:34,710
Capital is, you know, a
constant and it is limited

621
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,410
and we need to make sure that
whatever you're spending on

622
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,990
you really need to spend on
and it's not just sitting idle.

623
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,960
And especially cost becomes a huge problem

624
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,710
if you are developing on the cloud.

625
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,140
The next one is webMethods.

626
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,720
Now webMethods is a very interesting

627
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,340
offering that we have within IBM.

628
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,030
And what webMethods enables you to do

629
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:02,030
is it enables agents to run
in a secure governed area,

630
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:06,905
and the security and governance
is just not for agents.

631
00:39:06,905 --> 00:39:11,400
webMethods is known for API
security and API governance,

632
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,720
that's where it started.

633
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,980
And we are extending that to
LLMs, Large Language Models,

634
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,230
and multiple enterprise assets.

635
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,680
And to us we see agents as one
of those enterprise assets.

636
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,510
Again, if you haven't
checked out webMethods,

637
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:28,830
it's our go-to answer from
a hybrid IPAs perspective.

638
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,630
So please go check it out.

639
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,690
It's the only way to make sure
that your agents are running

640
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,033
in a more secure and governed way.

641
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,620
Now, how do we improve operations

642
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,470
with agentic AI within our products?

643
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,720
Now it's not always
about telling customers

644
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,630
what they need to do, it's
about, within Instana,

645
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,620
if we look at Instana,

646
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,500
it's a product that has
been here for eight years.

647
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,860
So we constantly are looking
at within the product to see

648
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,670
how we can do code optimization
within the product.

649
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,520
Now one of the areas that we came up with,

650
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,280
this is called incident investigation.

651
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,890
So Instana is used for
root cause analysis.

652
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,780
When something happens,
we want to catch it,

653
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,330
we want to know why it
happened, that way we can avoid,

654
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:15,540
and Instana does learn from
it and we want to avoid it.

655
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,540
So this agent helps with
improving incident investigation

656
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,940
and it learns from it and it gets better,

657
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,430
and in most cases, it's
able to proactively tell you

658
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,140
this was the signature of the event

659
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,210
when it happened the previous time.

660
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,127
And when it is about to
happen it can tell you

661
00:40:33,127 --> 00:40:35,130
"The same thing happened two weeks back

662
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,480
and it led to an outage.

663
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,803
Take action." Right?

664
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,660
So this is one way we are using it.

665
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,010
In our other offering called Concert,

666
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,780
we have an agent that helps with

667
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,000
auto compliance and resiliency.

668
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,477
Now compliance, we are not a GRC tool.

669
00:40:49,477 --> 00:40:52,230
There are a dime a dozen out there,

670
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,800
But if you look at compliance
controls like NIST and SOC 2

671
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,560
and all of these other
compliance controls out there,

672
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,400
about 60% of these controls are not even,

673
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,340
you can't write a piece of
program to go evaluate it.

674
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,660
So how do you use agentic AI
to go through documentation?

675
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,480
One of my favorite
examples is a NIST control

676
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,120
called Media Control.

677
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,390
So if you are using
media, if you are on-prem,

678
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:22,680
if you're using a hard disk
drive or an SSD that goes bad,

679
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,840
your vendor like Dell or Intel or IBM

680
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,050
can't just come swap it out
and take the old hard drive.

681
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,610
You need to have a chain of command

682
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,040
to destroy that disc drive.

683
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,470
Now how do you prove that
with automation, right?

684
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,750
Those are the areas
that we are investing in

685
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,420
and this compliance and resilient agent,

686
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,720
it can help you with that.

687
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:47,520
So Gartner has, you know,
we are a leader in several

688
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,960
of these Gartner magic quadrants.

689
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,790
If you look at Instana from an application

690
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,610
performance management
observability perspective,

691
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:56,673
we are a leader in that quadrant.

692
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,510
CRN, we were a leader last year,

693
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,210
we were a finalist this year.

694
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,370
And same thing with some
of our other products,

695
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,350
API Connect and webMethods as well.

696
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:11,610
So each one of these products
can stand in its own right

697
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:15,240
and I think one of what I want
to leave this audience with

698
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,140
is anytime there is new
technology that comes out,

699
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,527
we don't want to come out and say,

700
00:42:20,527 --> 00:42:22,740
"Forget about all the tools
that you used in the past.

701
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,350
We are gonna invent a new
set of tool chain for you

702
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,390
to go monitor, maintain, observe,

703
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,360
and make sure that these
can perform at scale."

704
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,710
We are not gonna be doing that.

705
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,990
So instead we were able
to extend our existing

706
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,210
tool sets and existing technologies

707
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,763
to go monitor your new technology as well.

708
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,390
Okay, so enough of listening from me,

709
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,030
I'm gonna bring my client panel up.

710
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,183
So I would like to welcome
and hear from our clients.

711
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,800
Ganesh Somaskandan is the
vice president of TSYS,

712
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,000
and Sagar Chikkala is
the CIO of Flexi Van.

713
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,313
Please join me on stage.

714
00:42:59,254 --> 00:43:02,337
(audience applauds)

715
00:43:14,237 --> 00:43:15,659
- How are you gentlemen doing?

716
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,866
- Doing good.

717
00:43:16,866 --> 00:43:21,840
- Okay, so Sagar and Ganesh,
thank you for joining me today.

718
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,570
Now before we get into
AI and how you use it,

719
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,603
can you tell us a little
bit about your companies,

720
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,080
what they do, what business you are in,

721
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,910
and some of the challenges
that you have faced

722
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,260
in the last few years?

723
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,480
So let me start with you Ganesh.

724
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,038
- Thank you Vikram. Can you guys hear me?

725
00:43:39,038 --> 00:43:39,990
Okay, perfect.

726
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,950
So yeah, I'm Ganesh Somaskandan.
I am from Global Payments.

727
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:47,370
So basically we are into
the issuing organization

728
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,620
where we takes care of the payments

729
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:53,010
in every lifecycle of the credit card.

730
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:57,047
It starts from you either
you apply for the credit card

731
00:43:57,047 --> 00:44:00,320
or you swipe your card
in the PYS terminals.

732
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,700
It goes through the authorizations

733
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,860
and it becomes the transaction.

734
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:08,460
Or even when you go into the
phase of your self-management,

735
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,997
like an online banking
where you takes care of,

736
00:44:10,997 --> 00:44:13,410
you do the card controls
or anything, you name it,

737
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,600
we offer the services for our clients,

738
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,440
which are like really high
critical mission clients.

739
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,440
The main factor what we are doing is like

740
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,020
we are obviously in the
modernization journey.

741
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,680
So with respect to that, we
have the hybrid platform,

742
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,087
which means we have the on-prem

743
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:32,970
and the big cloud presence with AWS.

744
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,213
So that's what like our
background is Vikram, yep.

745
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,200
- Thanks Vikram. Can you hear me?

746
00:44:42,149 --> 00:44:44,730
Okay, so Flexi Van actually
a chassis leasing company.

747
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:47,100
I think before you
understand what a chassis,

748
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,910
I want to tell how imports comes, right?

749
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,840
Imagine we are getting
imports from Asia to US.

750
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,020
For example, it's going to Chicago.

751
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,570
When a ship arrives at the port,

752
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:05,430
the container discharge from the port

753
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,440
and has to go to the warehouse, right?

754
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,660
The container doesn't have wheels.

755
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,990
So it needs an equipment
which has a wheels,

756
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,290
which is called a chassis.

757
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:20,510
As you know, in the logistics
from a port to the warehouse,

758
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,120
you don't have the visibility

759
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,210
until it reaches the warehouse, right?

760
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,790
So that is where we
started a company called

761
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,840
American Intermodal in
2016, 10 years back,

762
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,910
with a smart chassis concept.

763
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:40,910
So we equip a chassis with
IoT devices like a GPS,

764
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,670
which gives the location, velocity.

765
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:47,580
We also have the mount sensor.

766
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,190
When a container is placed on the chassis,

767
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:53,670
it tells, and container actually
removed from the chassis,

768
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,040
it provides the state of the asset,

769
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,340
and we also have a weight sensor.

770
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,637
It provides what is the
weight of the container

771
00:46:00,637 --> 00:46:02,820
on top of the chassis.

772
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,600
So with all these sensors
capturing the data

773
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:11,600
from the sensors and getting
the data from the customers,

774
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:18,410
the terminals, railroads, container yards,

775
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,210
getting all the contested data,

776
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:24,180
augmenting with the sensor data,

777
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,900
that's how we develop supply
chain visibility platform,

778
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,733
which we call AIM360.

779
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,630
It's very, very helpful
because with this one,

780
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,840
customers knows when
it started from a port,

781
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,760
when it's coming to a warehouse,

782
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,040
they know ETA when it's going to arrive

783
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,560
so they can plan accordingly, right?

784
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,330
It's not only giving the
real-time tracking and visibility,

785
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:51,330
it also provides network insights

786
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:53,860
because it generates a customer network

787
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,100
where it is actually stuck
in that particular journey.

788
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:03,555
How long it is dwelling
at a particular warehouse?

789
00:47:03,555 --> 00:47:05,820
Where is the waste is in that network?

790
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,030
So we provide all those
insights to the customers

791
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,430
such that customers can use it

792
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,383
to reduce the cost of operations.

793
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,750
As you see the whole journey,
we scaled up thousands,

794
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,393
then went to the hundreds
thousands of assets.

795
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:25,260
As we increased the scale,

796
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,410
we ended up with so many integrations.

797
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:31,650
Integrations with the
customers, B2B integrations,

798
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:35,280
getting EDI, getting XML data,

799
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,710
integrations for the sensors,

800
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,920
integration with the API, the systems,

801
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,140
and we ended up is a really all these

802
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,270
integrations working as a silo.

803
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:47,070
It's really, really challenging.

804
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:51,780
That is where we migrated
all these integrations

805
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,340
into our integration backbone,
which is a webMethods.

806
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,280
- No, that is, thank you for sharing that.

807
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,740
You know, especially now we just went past

808
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,690
the Thanksgiving holiday last weekend

809
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,980
and then going into Christmas.

810
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,133
I'm sure from a logistics
perspective it's going to be,

811
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,290
you know, a nightmare if you don't have

812
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:12,060
insight into your operations, right?

813
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,250
And same thing with
Global Payments as well.

814
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,190
It's like, you know, customers nowadays,

815
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:18,540
if you look at the Apple card

816
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,130
and other cards that we are used to,

817
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,370
we expect everything to
happen instantaneously.

818
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:25,650
So, very insightful.

819
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,350
So one of the other
questions I had for you is,

820
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,423
maybe we start with you, Sagar.

821
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,980
So what has your company's
journey been with AI

822
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,353
and what do you see the future?

823
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,700
- Okay, I think we just
discussed the logistics, right?

824
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,960
It's always reactive.

825
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,930
I think most of you sometimes face the,

826
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:47,550
there's a flight delay.

827
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,350
when flight is delayed it
impacts the connective flight.

828
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,370
Same as when a ship is delayed.

829
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:57,810
Imagine it's coming from
Asia, it has to go to Chicago.

830
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,330
So it arrives, the ship arrives at the LA.

831
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:03,720
From LA to Chicago, it
might go on a train.

832
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,830
So when a ship is delayed,

833
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:09,030
it actually delays all
the connected conveyances.

834
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:14,030
So it's very important
to address the problem.

835
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,800
That is where we started our journey.

836
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,910
How can we make the reactive to proactive?

837
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:23,820
So we started a predictive logistics.

838
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,650
So, same problem.

839
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:29,250
Like you have assets
but there is no demand.

840
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,910
Where there is a demand, you
might have not have assets.

841
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:35,790
So there's a lot of network imbalance.

842
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:38,963
So to address this problem,
the predictive logistics,

843
00:49:38,963 --> 00:49:41,220
we have so much of data,

844
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:45,630
billions of events based on
this GPS and all the sensors.

845
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,160
We train the data

846
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,400
and we are able to
develop a predictive model

847
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,430
which is going to actually
predict the velocity,

848
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:55,230
supply chain velocity.

849
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:59,013
It's going to predict how many
assets the customer needs it.

850
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:02,430
When a container comes,
if there is no chassis,

851
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:06,090
container cannot move, so
chassis is very, very important.

852
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,130
So we are able to predict how many chassis

853
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:13,130
for that customer needs
by location, by customer.

854
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,120
So that's how our journey started

855
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,570
with the predictor logistics.

856
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:22,350
Then, when you, when I
explain about the whole GPS

857
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:26,160
and we are able to derive
the whole container trip,

858
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,733
GPS provides a signature
of the trip, node to node,

859
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:33,240
but the main important thing is

860
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,840
the container and the
cargo inside the container.

861
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,910
So it's very important to connect

862
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,700
what is inside the
container to the chassis,

863
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,220
because sensors are on the chassis

864
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,550
which provides the GPS signature.

865
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:51,000
So to connect the
container to the chassis,

866
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,210
the data we are getting from
the ports is not enough.

867
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:58,470
So we install the cameras each locations

868
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:00,300
where we get the video feed.

869
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:05,130
Then we implemented AI vision.
YOLO model, we use that one.

870
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:09,480
So we have AI vision engine
to process those videos

871
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,280
to identify the object,

872
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,090
the OCR to derive what
is actual container ID

873
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:16,740
and what's the chassis ID.

874
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,160
Once we have the container
ID, we have the cargo inside,

875
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,980
then we provide the cargo
tracking in real time.

876
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,370
So that's how we went with the AI vision.

877
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:28,860
Then later as LLMs came,

878
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,200
then we started the journey with the LLM,

879
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,270
we implemented our own Flexi GPT

880
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:36,660
as an LLM on our own enterprise data.

881
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,530
We also expanded LLM to our portal

882
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:45,150
to provide LLM-based user experience.

883
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:47,790
So, typical any website when you go,

884
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:52,110
you click on a link or menus,
you provide the data, right?

885
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:55,207
But our portal actually based,
you can ask the questions,

886
00:51:55,207 --> 00:51:58,620
"Where are my problems?
Where is my assets?"

887
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,923
Based on that, it actually
dynamically derive that UI.

888
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,610
Then we expanded our
journey to the agentic

889
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,960
because we have so much of manual, right?

890
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,090
Typical any business, when you look at it,

891
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,100
a lot of back office functionalities.

892
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,830
When you get invoice, processing invoice,

893
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:19,500
or getting the data, go to the websites,

894
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,750
then manually updating that one.

895
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:26,750
So we implemented EMCPs on
each legacy system we have it

896
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:30,120
because agent has to
connect to legacy system

897
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,590
to perform action.

898
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:34,440
So we actually build the MCP gateway

899
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,370
connecting to each legacy system,

900
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:42,450
and working with the agent to
execute the business process.

901
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,463
So all the journey, when you look at it,

902
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:49,110
data and integration is
very, very important.

903
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:50,850
It is the backbone.

904
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:53,400
Without data, there's no AI, right?

905
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,340
So the backbone for all our ecosystem

906
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,603
actually is webMethods.

907
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:00,900
- Oh that's, you know,

908
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,540
I keep thinking about my own household

909
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,613
when we go and order something on AWS.

910
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:09,660
We expect it to show up in
24 hours or less, right?

911
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,430
We don't understand the logistics

912
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,350
and everything that goes behind it.

913
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:16,890
So that's very insightful.
So what's your take?

914
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,500
- Yeah, definitely as I said that

915
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,180
the payments you mentioned about,

916
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,310
the holiday shopping and everything,

917
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,610
if I have to really share
the number of transactions

918
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,950
we just processed on the Cyber Monday,

919
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:33,030
it was like close to 1.5
billion transactions in a day.

920
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:36,390
Which means you see
how critical those are,

921
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,360
the applications, and from our
client commitment perspective

922
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,900
and also we know that even
if you miss five minutes,

923
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,640
you may lose the deal as a customer.

924
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,530
So, at the same time,

925
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:49,710
you need to have like a better
model in place and such as,

926
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,270
with the good observability.

927
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,520
That is critical for even though you have

928
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,710
your great functionalities
that you can offer,

929
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:58,830
if you don't have the good
scalability or reliability

930
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:01,920
and if you're not able
to react very quickly,

931
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,840
then you lose the customer,

932
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,180
you lose your credibility and everything.

933
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,447
So that's where our journey
with our observability started.

934
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:11,610
And I would say like even the you,

935
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:14,790
I know like Vikram, you
touched base about the Instana,

936
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,790
so we started using that
in our hybrid platform

937
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:20,190
because our is like, it's kind of like,

938
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,290
yes, we have the great
partnership with the AWS,

939
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:25,350
we have our APIs and other application

940
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:26,820
that runs in the cloud.

941
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,400
However, we have still
the on-prem presence

942
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,130
with the mainframe and the components.

943
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:32,963
With all this,

944
00:54:32,963 --> 00:54:35,310
we are talking about
such a mission critical,

945
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,920
we need the complete
end-to-end observability

946
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,800
and not just from the static one.

947
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,660
So we want to make sure we have,

948
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,540
we are taking advantage
of every AI solutions

949
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,210
that we are getting through
the observability tools.

950
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:51,690
The one thing I would say
is like the auto healing,

951
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:52,830
that's really critical.

952
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:55,110
We don't want, using the example,

953
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,900
let's say like I just
go and set up the alarms

954
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,960
and I set it up, that's
not the job is done.

955
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,470
We want to make sure that
you identify the issues

956
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:07,200
and you don't want to be reactive always.

957
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,810
You want to be proactive
so you take care of the

958
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:14,010
AI automated based
observability so that you can

959
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,860
let this, let it itself heal the system.

960
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,000
There is no need to have,

961
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,860
that's where we are marching towards,

962
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,430
and that helped us really on the MTTR.

963
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:26,100
The other one I would say
is like the Turbonomics.

964
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,480
That's again, like the very critical,

965
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,860
because many companies,

966
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:32,460
we are in the process of
the modernization journey.

967
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,060
So the challenge is you need
to take care of your on-prem,

968
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,350
because you have the clients

969
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,990
and you have to move it into the cloud,

970
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:43,290
so that means you have to
take care of your cost.

971
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:45,990
And with the Turbonomics and
other things in the place,

972
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:48,600
that's where we can get
the more efficiencies

973
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,730
with respect to handling your processing.

974
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:52,710
You gave the classic example of the GPUs,

975
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:53,543
which are not used,

976
00:55:53,543 --> 00:55:56,220
driven by the developers and other pieces.

977
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:59,010
So that's definitely where we
are marching towards on that.

978
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:00,600
Yep.

979
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,550
- No, thank you. Thank you for sharing.

980
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:08,640
My next question, and I'll
stick with you Ganesh.

981
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,870
So with everything
around AI and agentic AI,

982
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:16,170
like I don't know of a
single CIO or, you know,

983
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:21,030
a C-suite exec who doesn't have
AI on their roadmap, right?

984
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,930
They wanna do something,

985
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:24,790
which means there is a lot of
pressure within enterprises

986
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,780
to go do something with AI.

987
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,330
But then if you look at
downstream processes,

988
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:34,020
there are people who are very
reluctant to give up control.

989
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,830
They're afraid of security
and resilience and governance.

990
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,440
So how do you tackle that?

991
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,120
- Definitely, I think that's kind of like

992
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,360
a very common questions
we get from everyone,

993
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,300
including our customers and our clients.

994
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,250
Because there is always
a sensitivity about

995
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:53,580
when you put something in the
cloud, where is the security?

996
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,930
Or when you have the AI,

997
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:57,060
when you lose the control to the AI,

998
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:00,360
it's all at the mindset
and how we are actually

999
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,330
implementing and what is
the advantage by doing that?

1000
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,610
It's not about we are
replacing the resource

1001
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:08,847
or it's like we are just eliminating that.

1002
00:57:08,847 --> 00:57:10,620
The way we see it as,

1003
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,180
it's kind of like you're bringing in

1004
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:16,620
the quality of life to your
team, to your engineers,

1005
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,620
because it's not really worth
for your engineering team

1006
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,703
to spend time on the repetitive task.

1007
00:57:21,703 --> 00:57:25,440
Instead of that, they can
focus more on more innovation,

1008
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,320
the more products which will
benefit the customer base

1009
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,630
and the clients and as a company.

1010
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:33,300
So that's one of the rhythm, we kind of,

1011
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,910
we try to expand that to
across our organization

1012
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,600
that name it as AI generation-based one.

1013
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,830
It's about productivity you
spend focus on other things.

1014
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:46,440
Yeah.
- I like the way you put it.

1015
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,330
Improve the quality of your engineers.

1016
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:50,763
I think that's one good
way to sell it. Yeah.

1017
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,790
- Yeah, the technology is evolving, right?

1018
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,790
You know, every day we see some product,

1019
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,890
and as you see the export,

1020
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:02,463
I see a lot of new products I see today.

1021
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:06,360
So one of the important factor is,

1022
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:10,740
we use the technology
to take advantage of it

1023
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:15,393
and get some revenue, right,
or to reduce the cost.

1024
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,730
Or sometimes we use the
technology because if I don't,

1025
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,590
I will be left behind.

1026
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:25,773
So I have to use it to show
the competitive advantage.

1027
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,610
But I strongly believe that.

1028
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:34,610
A use case with the ROI
dictates the innovation

1029
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,123
not the other way.

1030
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:41,160
So it's very important to
have the businesses case

1031
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:45,153
to have a successful
implementation of any AI project.

1032
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:48,150
- Well said.

1033
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:51,900
I think I started to
hear more from clients

1034
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,733
on that same thought.

1035
00:58:52,733 --> 00:58:55,950
They don't want to hear about
offerings or what they can do.

1036
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:58,020
It's all about use cases.

1037
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:01,680
So what is the use case and
how can you make my life better

1038
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,970
with what you're proposing, right?

1039
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:04,590
So I think that's good thought.

1040
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:06,210
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sorry.

1041
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,950
- I just want to talk about,

1042
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:11,820
because when we think about
the risk and the speed,

1043
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,740
there should be always a balance, right?

1044
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,630
You look at our journey,

1045
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:19,530
if you look at as the three
pillars of all our integrations,

1046
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:24,360
one pillar is about all
the legacy B2B integration.

1047
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,990
The second pillar is
about the API gateway,

1048
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:29,403
and the third pillar is all about this

1049
00:59:29,403 --> 00:59:32,910
MCP, MCP gateway and AI gateway.

1050
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:37,910
All these three pillars of the
integration are orchestrated

1051
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:44,560
through IBM webMethods
Hybrid Control Plane

1052
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,490
and providing a end-to-end visibility.

1053
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:49,680
So we are actually migrating to that one.

1054
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,990
I'm very, very excited about the product

1055
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:54,120
