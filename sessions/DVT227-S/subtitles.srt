1
00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:02,028
All right, folks,

2
00:00:02,528 --> 00:00:03,950
almost revving it up here.

3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:07,269
I heard there are a couple of more talks

4
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:09,349
after me, but let's

5
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:10,769
talk about reliability.

6
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:14,028
Reliability is hard and it's rare.

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,929
What we do, what I do is I'm

8
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:17,708
Hannes Lenke.

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,798
I'm CEO and co-founder of

10
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:23,289
Checkline, and we help you to

11
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,908
detect, communicate, and resolve

12
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:27,388
issues fast.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,929
I'm on a mission

14
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:32,408
to help your engineers

15
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:33,969
to own reliability

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,509
from pull request to postmortem.

17
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:41,069
Software,

18
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:43,509
take a step back a decade ago,

19
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:45,189
software was built.

20
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,798
Yearly,

21
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:48,728
shipped quarterly,

22
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:50,389
then monthly,

23
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:51,418
weekly,

24
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:52,529
daily,

25
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,079
and now we're almost there

26
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:56,848
where agents can

27
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:59,789
build the software, ship faster,

28
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,069
almost instantly.

29
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,529
That's cool.

30
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,778
On the other side,

31
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:10,198
Reliability is eroding.

32
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,418
Reliability is still in 2013.

33
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,489
And we gotta think about how

34
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:18,489
to bring that in the into the

35
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:19,430
modern age.

36
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:21,028
Why is that though?

37
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,049
Yesterday,

38
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:26,480
Applications were very simple, right?

39
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:27,870
You had one single team,

40
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:30,790
maybe 123 dependencies,

41
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:32,290
a database.

42
00:01:33,308 --> 00:01:34,370
And when you

43
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,909
uh released something and something went

44
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:37,489
wrong,

45
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:39,400
then you do exactly.

46
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,329
What kind of service was responsible for it?

47
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:44,409
That was yesterday.

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,739
Now today,

49
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,180
Applications are much more complex,

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,909
right? They

51
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:55,290
have dependencies, a renewed dependency

52
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,609
that you're introducing.

53
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:58,510
Introduces

54
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,099
potential. Failure

55
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,709
risks to your reliability

56
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,250
and I'm, I'm not saying that's bad to

57
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:06,870
be honest,

58
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:09,808
you know, all these integrations if it's off

59
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:10,990
if it's

60
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,849
uh payment providers, databases,

61
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:14,588
etc.

62
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,250
they allowed us to ship fast and they're

63
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,250
still allowing us to ship fast because we don't need

64
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,189
to build everything

65
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:22,788
right? But

66
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:24,889
everything is kind of connected to each other.

67
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:26,689
And

68
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,038
Reliability is left behind.

69
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:32,360
Now,

70
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,719
the answer was for years.

71
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:36,758
More people,

72
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,419
more processes,

73
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,479
more tech.

74
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,088
You tested your application,

75
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:44,710
you monitor your application.

76
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,649
And

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,118
we had, you know, different teams

78
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:51,520
doing that, right, so there was a QA team doing

79
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,860
these tests, developers building the

80
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,258
application and

81
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:57,379
operations monitoring.

82
00:02:58,189 --> 00:02:59,960
Being responsible for production.

83
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,520
The funny thing though is.

84
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,349
You know,

85
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,028
both teams,

86
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,788
both processes

87
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,868
try to answer a very similar,

88
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,740
if not the same question.

89
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:18,368
Does your application work from an end user

90
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:19,110
perspective?

91
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:22,308
It's all about validating that

92
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:24,050
your boat works on staging.

93
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,050
Validating that it still works on

94
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:27,778
production

95
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:29,258
after a while,

96
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,240
catching failures

97
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,479
before your users actually

98
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:36,520
see these failures on staging

99
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,939
and catch failures later on

100
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:41,338
because you know, one of the services that

101
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:42,399
you depend on

102
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:44,979
might have an issue or someone

103
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:47,219
might change an API end point, etc.

104
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:51,599
Want to verify your uh integrations.

105
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:55,729
And look at performance over time, right, a

106
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:56,929
certain performance over time.

107
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,838
These are a lot of things that you.

108
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:01,689
That you need to do

109
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:03,649
That we're

110
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:04,849
used to doing.

111
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:07,629
Whose automated tasks.

112
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:11,349
During

113
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:13,250
uh CICD.

114
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,129
And later on,

115
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:18,670
on production, we use manual testing,

116
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,350
etc.

117
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,829
Of course we try to automate as much as

118
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,639
possible. You

119
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,819
know, throughout

120
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:29,600
all of our customers that we have, we have

121
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,509
1300 paying customers

122
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,459
across the world.

123
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,178
There's three principles that we are seeing

124
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:38,059
that the high performing teams are

125
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,480
pretty much adopting.

126
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,319
One is predictability,

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,678
really being able to predict how your

128
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:45,059
app works.

129
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:47,220
When you release it to production

130
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,389
and before you release it to production,

131
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:51,540
is accountability,

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,059
really knowing

133
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,319
what changed.

134
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,129
Who changed it,

135
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:56,928
why,

136
00:04:57,238 --> 00:04:59,358
when, and really knowing

137
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:00,470
if a problem

138
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:01,470
occurs.

139
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,639
Where it comes from,

140
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:06,600
and then that feeds into resiliency,

141
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,209
you wanna be able

142
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:11,298
to really build a resilient

143
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:13,079
application and worst case,

144
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:14,278
roll your application back

145
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:17,540
fast so that your users are not

146
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,059
affected.

147
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:25,629
So what Jackie does is

148
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,389
we unify

149
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:29,829
testing and monitoring

150
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:31,689
in one workflow.

151
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:35,000
Your playwright tests, your API

152
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,670
tests, your uptime checks,

153
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,838
your alerts, status pages,

154
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,238
they all follow one workflow. They

155
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:42,600
follow a workflow

156
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,819
that is made

157
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,769
for a software development life cycle.

158
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,269
All version controlled

159
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:50,809
and it's built for speed.

160
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,470
So how do we do this? How do our

161
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,528
customers do this?

162
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:57,899
They build these

163
00:05:58,269 --> 00:05:58,939
checks,

164
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,949
tests.

165
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:03,420
In playwright for UI automation.

166
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:06,559
JavaScript TypeScript

167
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,329
for API testing.

168
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:09,608
Um,

169
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:12,399
And then uptime monitors, all

170
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,119
as code.

171
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:16,278
And then they deploy them over

172
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,778
to our platform and we run them

173
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,798
continuously across the world

174
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,910
to let you know.

175
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:25,399
About issues before you use or face them.

176
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:31,689
This was our mantra for, for the

177
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,809
last decade, right? You build it, you

178
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:34,850
run it, you own it.

179
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,009
This is a mantra of the past.

180
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:40,619
I don't think it keeps up until today.

181
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,738
Who's you in this case?

182
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:45,738
Who is it?

183
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,819
You know, everyone who touches

184
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:51,278
the user experience of a

185
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:51,980
customer.

186
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,379
Is you in my mind

187
00:06:55,238 --> 00:06:57,699
and touching the user experience of customer

188
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,980
nowadays

189
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,829
is obviously SIE uh SIE,

190
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,420
uh,

191
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,759
you know, someone who's responsible pretty much for the

192
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,220
code, a developer, an engineer.

193
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,470
And the reality though is

194
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:16,459
It's now augmented with agents,

195
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,858
it's cloud code and all the other tools. Who

196
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:21,100
are you use is using today,

197
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:22,290
agents

198
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:24,338
to develop code?

199
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,329
All right. Some of

200
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:30,699
you Tomorrow,

201
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,778
I believe.

202
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:35,319
Agents will be capable enough

203
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:36,980
to build even more code,

204
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:38,600
in the end ship code,

205
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,278
monitor code,

206
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:41,939
so it will become.

207
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:44,108
You build it,

208
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,428
you test it,

209
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:46,778
you monitor it.

210
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,189
You're on it.

211
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,048
That's what Jackie's made for.

212
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:54,730
We give you tests.

213
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,028
That you can promote to monitors.

214
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:00,519
You can define alerts.

215
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,689
Status pages,

216
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,139
so really detect issues,

217
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:06,410
communicate them,

218
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,988
and in the end you get the assets that

219
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,009
you need to resolve issues fast.

220
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,459
To do one thing,

221
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,338
it's pretty much integrating

222
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,420
your monitoring stack

223
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,559
into the CICE stack.

224
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,939
So your CICDs pipeline

225
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
that you have today, maybe with end

226
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,239
to end to end tests speaks the same

227
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:34,479
language as your reliability pipeline.

228
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,700
You speak in your organization

229
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,408
the same language.

230
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:41,330
All teams use the same frameworks,

231
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,139
use the tests that are already built during,

232
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,340
uh, during the software development.

233
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,928
For monitoring,

234
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,288
they look at the same assets when something

235
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:53,048
fails,

236
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:54,590
really know

237
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:56,029
if something goes wrong.

238
00:08:57,918 --> 00:08:59,219
That speeds you up.

239
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:02,469
Also enables you to speak pretty much

240
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:03,548
uh

241
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:05,969
that language from your local

242
00:09:05,969 --> 00:09:06,750
development

243
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:08,408
towards production.

244
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,269
All right. That

245
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:14,969
was my talk

246
00:09:16,178 --> 00:09:18,440
If you want to talk about how to bring

247
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,609
reliability and monitoring

248
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:23,200
into the modern age, then

249
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:26,479
visit us at our booth. It's 1856.

250
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,379
It's over there.

251
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:31,000
Thank you.
