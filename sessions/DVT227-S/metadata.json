  "title_cn": "AWS re:Invent 2025 - 为什么可靠性如此困难？(DVT227)",
  "abstract": "Software is faster to build than ever, yet reliability has quietly eroded. We reboot, refresh, and retry because the industry optimized for velocity over trust. But reliability isn’t an accident — it’s a choice, a discipline, and increasingly, a business differentiator. As AI accelerates creation and systems grow more dynamic, the consequences of failure compound. Modern software demands a new model: continuous reliability across the entire lifecycle. Testing and monitoring can no longer be separate worlds; they must converge, in code, versioned, automated, and always on. This talk explores why reliability matters now more than ever — and how to build systems people can count on. This presentation is brought to you by Checkly, an AWS Partner.",
  "abstract_cn": "软件构建速度前所未有，但可靠性却悄然下降。我们重启、刷新、重试，因为行业优化了速度而非信任。但可靠性不是偶然——它是一种选择、一种纪律，并且越来越成为业务差异化因素。随着AI加速创建和系统变得更加动态，故障的后果不断累积。现代软件需要一种新模式：贯穿整个生命周期的持续可靠性。测试和监控不能再是独立的世界；它们必须融合，在代码中、版本化、自动化且始终运行。本次演讲探讨为什么可靠性现在比以往任何时候都更重要——以及如何构建人们可以信赖的系统。本演示由AWS合作伙伴Checkly为您呈现。",
