1
00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:02,410
Well, thanks, uh, everyone for joining

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,519
today. I know we're on day 4 of, uh,

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,690
reinvent in Las Vegas, so I know you guys got a lot

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,810
to choose from. So really appreciate you making

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,890
it out to Mandalay Bay to join me for this session.

6
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:13,589
Uh, so today we're gonna talk about how you

7
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:15,948
can master your carbon footprint using the AWS

8
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:17,769
customer carbon footprint tool. So

9
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,269
my name is Alexis Bateman. I head up our AWS

10
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:22,388
sustainability tech team. Uh, what,

11
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:24,589
what does that team do? So we actually are

12
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:27,030
the enabling team behind a lot of our sustainability

13
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,190
goals. So our, our renewable

14
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,228
energy goals are water positive, our net

15
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:34,090
zero carbon. So we're sort of the underlying

16
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,709
enable enabling, uh, team.

17
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:38,161
And we also support the customer carbon footprint

18
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:40,283
tool that all customers can access in the

19
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:42,393
console. So we're sort of like the backbone

20
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:44,472
of the of that work, uh, so

21
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:46,521
today in the next 20 minutes, um, we're

22
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,603
gonna go through a little bit about how we

23
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:50,841
actually built the customer carbon footprint

24
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:52,963
tool, what powers it, and then I, I do

25
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:53,942
wanna send you along

26
00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:56,521
to potentially go over to the expo where we actually

27
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:58,722
have a demo of the customer carbon footprint

28
00:00:58,722 --> 00:01:00,776
tool there, and you can actually. Go and have

29
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:02,875
a a complete walk through, uh, with some of my

30
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,974
teammates. So that would be a great thing to end the

31
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:07,215
day with if, if you, if you're interested in its peak

32
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:09,254
today. So we'll go through sort of our

33
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:09,834
top line

34
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:12,254
sustainability objectives. Then I'll, I'll

35
00:01:12,254 --> 00:01:14,375
show you a little bit about how we built the

36
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,435
what I like to call the guts of the tool, and then,

37
00:01:16,614 --> 00:01:18,685
uh, we'll kind of wrap up with, uh,

38
00:01:18,765 --> 00:01:20,974
uh, sending you over to the expo when you have a chance

39
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:23,786
later today as we're wrapping up, uh, reinvent

40
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:26,019
so. So

41
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,180
what the customer carbon footprint tool is really

42
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,299
a representation of our sustainability

43
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,629
objectives at AWS.

44
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,000
So we have,

45
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,808
uh, we are, uh, a climate pledge signatory.

46
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:37,049
So the climate pledge was,

47
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:39,819
uh, founded in 2019 in partnership

48
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,370
with Amazon and the, uh, nonprofit

49
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,540
organization Global Optimism. And so we

50
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,219
are a signatory along with other 591

51
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,338
other companies that have the same goal

52
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:51,778
to be net zero carbon by 2040.

53
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,230
So at AWS we do this in a couple of

54
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,049
different ways, uh, some of which is our carbon-free

55
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,338
energy and efficiency objectives. So,

56
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:02,668
uh, in 2023 we actually met

57
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:04,980
our goal to be, uh, to have 100%

58
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,549
renewable energy, uh,

59
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:09,149
several years early in 2023. Um,

60
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,429
we do this in a couple of different ways. So we have also

61
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:13,538
our power usage effectiveness which is,

62
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,020
uh, measures our energy overhead. So the,

63
00:02:16,258 --> 00:02:18,389
uh, PE, uh, perfect PUE score

64
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,629
is, uh, 1.0, and so

65
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:22,635
the industry average is. 1.25.

66
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:24,996
We're sitting at about 1.15. So that

67
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:27,037
means we're performing really well. And so when

68
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:29,515
we're talking about PUE, this is actually how we're

69
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:31,676
powering our data centers, the energy we

70
00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:32,515
source to power,

71
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:35,156
how efficiently operate operate those, and

72
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,436
then that feeds directly into the AWS services

73
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:39,197
that we offer our customers every day.

74
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:40,317
We also,

75
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:42,597
uh, have our circularity program. So

76
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:44,716
this is how we actually reuse and

77
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:46,716
take back components that we use to build our

78
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:48,876
data centers, our hardware that goes into

79
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,782
the servers that actually power. Our compute

80
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:53,092
and so, uh, as of, uh, since

81
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:55,612
2023 we've recovered over 23

82
00:02:56,582 --> 00:02:58,983
million different components and actually

83
00:02:58,983 --> 00:03:01,104
was able to repurpose them and take them

84
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:03,122
out of sort of the end of life and and reuse and

85
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:03,733
recycle.

86
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:06,562
Uh, we also have our water positive

87
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,463
objective and so we have a goal to be

88
00:03:09,312 --> 00:03:11,403
water completely water positive by 2030

89
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:13,483
and so this what is water positive means? That means

90
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:15,764
we're actually replacing more water than we actually

91
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:18,723
use in our data centers so we're about 53%.

92
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:20,960
Of the way there and so that happens

93
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,189
across a couple of different ways. We operate our

94
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:25,469
data centers extremely efficiently. We have

95
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,330
recycling and then we also have water replenishment

96
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,450
programs that we work on with communities where

97
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,610
we operate. So we're about 53% there.

98
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:34,890
We have a couple more years until we get the 100%

99
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,719
in 2030.

100
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,091
Um, we also publish our water usage

101
00:03:38,091 --> 00:03:40,510
effectiveness score, which is also industry leading

102
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:42,890
and is what we can, is how you can

103
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,010
kind of capture how we're performing at a regional level, and

104
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,091
this is, uh, publicly available

105
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:49,300
information. Uh, so

106
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,479
we, we are doing this at very large

107
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,500
scale. So AWS operates at

108
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,860
a, a large, uh, scale. So

109
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,500
we are actually, uh, operating in 117

110
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,460
availability zones, over 245

111
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,819
countries and territories, uh, 37

112
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,008
geographic regions, and, uh,

113
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,129
we, we are also. Uh,

114
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:10,588
offering, uh, 4.1 times,

115
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:13,189
uh, at times more than actual on-premise

116
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:15,460
computes. So this is sort of how our

117
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,588
customers we're supporting them by operating at

118
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:18,178
this scale,

119
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,819
uh, operating more efficiently, um,

120
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:23,069
and, and actually able to support

121
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:25,389
our customers and their sustainability objectives

122
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:26,709
by running on AWS.

123
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,350
So now I'm gonna dive a little bit into how we

124
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,548
actually built the customer carbon footprint tool and

125
00:04:31,548 --> 00:04:33,588
how, what, what actually powers the, the

126
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:35,790
underneath, sort of like how we actually generate

127
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,649
those numbers.

128
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:39,678
So you know, I, I, I maybe

129
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:41,678
here in the audience some of you guys are familiar with how

130
00:04:41,678 --> 00:04:43,798
you're kind of calculating carbon footprint. If you're not,

131
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,959
you know, I'll give you a little bit of a rundown of how we do

132
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,959
that, but we, it's, uh, essentially it's

133
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,069
sort of like a, a common data flow where we're actually

134
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:50,819
ingesting

135
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:53,119
millions of data sets from around the company.

136
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:53,980
So this is

137
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,660
anything from, you know, component level

138
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,939
information about our hardware and how we build our servers

139
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,119
all the way to, uh, the cement that

140
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:03,125
goes into our data centers that we're actually. Bu il ding

141
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,264
it out so we ingest all those different

142
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,444
data sets and we have to go through a process of

143
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:09,613
what we call it sounds a little biological but

144
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,824
which it is, which is carbonating that so actually

145
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:13,903
translating that that

146
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:15,944
information into carbon numbers and so we have to

147
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:17,983
model and transform that. We actually have a

148
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:19,204
team of scientists that

149
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,744
model the different components and servers

150
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:22,324
and different

151
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:24,903
materials that we use to build our, our, our

152
00:05:24,903 --> 00:05:27,165
data centers and the energy we power to actually

153
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:29,569
make we translate this in. The carbon emissions so we

154
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,928
can actually understand how we're performing, of

155
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:34,178
course, you know, operating at the scale we have to persist

156
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:36,209
and govern govern our data as we

157
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,309
would in any scenario.

158
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:39,809
And then of course the, the step that makes it out

159
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:41,809
to the customer carbon footprint tool is

160
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,009
an allocation model. So we are actually

161
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,048
generating the total footprint measurement

162
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:48,048
of AWS and then we need to go through

163
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,160
a process of actually allocating that to

164
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,290
customers based on their usage, so how

165
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,369
much they use different AWS services.

166
00:05:54,545 --> 00:05:56,673
And of course the, the kind of last step which would

167
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:58,754
be the interface that you might see in

168
00:05:58,754 --> 00:06:00,795
the billing console would be analyze

169
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:03,184
and act so you're able to actually see, uh,

170
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:05,233
how, uh, your usage of AWS

171
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:06,944
services and what is the carbon

172
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,434
representation of that on a monthly basis

173
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:11,673
and so you can actually see the breakout of

174
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:14,095
that across our different regions, uh,

175
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:16,274
and, and, um, uh, and actually

176
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:18,535
be able to use that in, in terms of how you're

177
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:19,975
leveraging AWS.

178
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:23,019
So what, what are some of the different input

179
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,079
sources I touched on them a little bit, but just to kind of

180
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,178
give a, a more visual representation.

181
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,439
So the types of data that we actually need

182
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,798
to, to, to actually, uh, uh,

183
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,100
carbonate to generate the customer carbon footprint

184
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,139
tool, this would be anything from our, our

185
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:38,540
hardware components, uh, and our

186
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,738
processes, our data center building and

187
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:41,358
equipment.

188
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,959
Uh, could be the energy consumption

189
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,199
that we're actually using within our data centers

190
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:46,738
and of course,

191
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,079
uh, what type of energy we're using.

192
00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:50,028
So as I talked,

193
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:52,519
started the talk, we, um, actually,

194
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,319
you know, are powering a lot of both our renewable

195
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,540
energy and carbon-free energy sources, uh,

196
00:06:57,588 --> 00:06:59,858
uh, such as wind and solar and other,

197
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,238
um, and then of course, you know, as I was talking

198
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:04,319
about our water positive program, we have water usage, so

199
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,324
we need. To get all of this data

200
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:08,564
to be able to generate our corporate carbon footprint

201
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:10,644
and then allocate it to our customers in

202
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:12,665
the customer carbon footprint tool. So

203
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:14,923
what does this look like? So we actually have a

204
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:17,045
sustainably data platform that we have

205
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:19,045
built internally that power

206
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:21,064
that ingest all of this data goes through

207
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:23,184
complex model and orchestration processes

208
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:25,483
to actually put that entire footprint

209
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:27,514
together. So this is driven, of course by

210
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,009
the. Goals that we've taken at the top line AWS

211
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,069
objective and then we actually have

212
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,509
uh scientific methodology that we've

213
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,970
uh partnered with our scientists to actually

214
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,329
generate these numbers and this is uh

215
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,528
something that actually creates the deep rigor

216
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,769
of how we're actually calculating our carbon, our

217
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:45,588
carbon footprint and this is actually,

218
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:48,069
um, we've done this in a very,

219
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,470
uh, deep and scientific way largely because.

220
00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:52,954
We use it both for to actually generate

221
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:55,254
the footprint that goes out to the customer carbon footprint

222
00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:57,814
tool, but we also use it to make internal

223
00:07:57,814 --> 00:07:59,975
decisions about how we're designing our

224
00:07:59,975 --> 00:08:02,053
server racks, how, what, what components

225
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:04,134
we're procuring, right? So the more that we

226
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:06,363
understand the sustainability impact of all

227
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:08,923
those different, uh, processes we're conducting

228
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,014
across the company, we can make better and informed

229
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:13,254
decisions on continuing to drive down our carbon

230
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:14,629
footprint. And of course,

231
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,970
uh, we use this in a variety of different

232
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,178
ways and so I kind of touched on it a little bit

233
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:21,410
just now, but, uh, we actually have

234
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,488
something called our glide path. This is when

235
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:25,809
we talk about a glide path that's how we forecast

236
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,910
out to 2040 so it helps us understand

237
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:30,329
how we're doing and how close we are getting as

238
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:32,440
we go through sort of like the next few

239
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,489
years. And so if we're seeing that we're

240
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:36,614
underperforming in a certain area we're able. To

241
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:38,734
make different investment decisions, for instance,

242
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:41,065
in emerging technologies that we wanna

243
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:41,974
invest in and actually

244
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:44,264
accelerate how we're decarbonizing, for

245
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:46,465
instance, some of our, our hardware and our

246
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:48,825
servers and other materials that we use every day,

247
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:51,585
uh, we can also use it for sustainability optimization

248
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:53,325
decisions. So how do we actually optimize,

249
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,695
for instance, the energy use and, and how we're

250
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:57,864
buying energy and partnering with utility

251
00:08:57,864 --> 00:09:00,160
providers and so actually you. Using that to understand

252
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:02,682
some of those partnerships we're developing around the world,

253
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:05,160
um, we, of course, uh, as any

254
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,241
company we have corporate re regulatory

255
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:09,480
reporting that we need to abide by in all the regions

256
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,110
that we operate. And then of course the,

257
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,660
the one that, uh, I've been talking about

258
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,980
is our customer facing metrics which is

259
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,520
our customer carbon footprint tool which is the public

260
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,600
representation of, uh, of, of

261
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,562
these numbers, and

262
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:24,041
it's something every customer can access in,

263
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:25,121
in the billing console.

264
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,099
So, uh, oops, yeah, no,

265
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,149
it, so it just as

266
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,609
like an example to walk through,

267
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:34,308
uh, we have, for instance, this is a, a

268
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,538
fictional scenario, of course, trying to be a,

269
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,070
a little festive here. So hypothetically

270
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,308
if we have, if we're sourcing energy from

271
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:43,349
the North Pole, North Pole 1 kilowatt

272
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,349
hour, right, we actually have to take that

273
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:47,869
data. So this is uh again a fictional scenario

274
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:49,918
and actually ingest the data,

275
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,190
and this is, uh, frequently ingested

276
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,590
data that we actually then have to carbonate, so. Using,

277
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:56,928
uh, you know, our scientific methodology

278
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:58,979
in this case for something like energy,

279
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,500
right, we have a publicly available emissions

280
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,668
impact factor that is regionally sourced and regionally

281
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:05,668
relevant, and from there that actually

282
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:06,889
translates into,

283
00:10:07,229 --> 00:10:09,408
you know, how we're actually generating, uh,

284
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,548
energy and the carbon emissions impact of that

285
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:13,629
energy usage in our, our data centers every

286
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:15,700
day. This then, of course, uh, you know, as,

287
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,529
as I just went through kind of feeds into

288
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,408
these downstream, uh,

289
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,009
downstream decision scenarios that we need to inform.

290
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,440
So what does this look like? How do we actually do this at

291
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,668
scale? So you know, we are,

292
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,759
uh, you know, a very large enterprise and

293
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,798
so when we actually have to compute our footprint,

294
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:34,000
we have to, uh, uh, do this

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,629
at scale. So we're actually operating 250,

296
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,908
250 ETL pipelines. Uh,

297
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,158
we, we actually support 51 terabytes

298
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:43,340
of data, and that's growing every single day.

299
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:45,798
So this, this input of the data actually allows

300
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:47,500
us to continue to get more

301
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:50,178
decision making, more granular. Information about how

302
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:52,379
we're supporting our sustainability

303
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:54,418
objectives. We also have 800

304
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:55,570
managed data sets,

305
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,899
uh, 300 ingested data sets,

306
00:10:57,979 --> 00:11:00,019
and 30,000 daily queries of

307
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:00,840
that data. So

308
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:03,379
this is, for instance, any of our internal partners

309
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,658
that need to make decisions about procurement,

310
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:08,139
about optimization decisions, about planning,

311
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,379
they're actually querying this data to understand

312
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,379
and, and actually make, uh, informed

313
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,418
choices about how we drive sustainability

314
00:11:14,418 --> 00:11:15,190
across the company.

315
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,500
And of course you know we abide

316
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,658
by our same architectural principles we sup we've

317
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:22,700
offered to our customers right to actually develop

318
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,700
this and and um put this in

319
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,739
front of you as the customer carbon footprint

320
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:29,019
tool so you know we

321
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,178
know that we can't just, uh, put data

322
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:33,178
out there we have to make sure it's, it's, you know, a

323
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:35,224
scalable. That we have we're we're

324
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:37,715
leveraging some of our AI tooling to drive insights

325
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:39,835
and enable our, our internal

326
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:41,695
customers to actually query the data.

327
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:44,075
Of course we have to continue to get higher

328
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:45,835
and higher quality data so

329
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:48,274
uh, you know, the, the old adage

330
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,335
of what you can't measure, you can't manage,

331
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:52,629
um. So this is actually when

332
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,668
we're continuing to drive decisions we

333
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:56,808
actually get more and more granular data

334
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,389
that is higher quality so that when we make

335
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:01,389
decisions on top of that it's, it's actually driving

336
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,469
down carbon emissions.

337
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:04,908
We are, you know, security is paramount. We need, we need

338
00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:06,908
to continue to be obsessive about our

339
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:09,119
security, making sure we're handling data at scale,

340
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:11,769
and then of course that the, the data is actually

341
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:13,830
actionable, uh, so you know, we, in,

342
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:16,229
in a, in original, you know, so in years

343
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:17,849
ago, right, we might have been able to generate

344
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:20,700
a dashboard and say, all right, let's make some decisions

345
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,735
out of. Top of that, that is no longer

346
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:24,855
sort of like how we need to operate we need to make sure

347
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:27,056
that the data is accessible, that,

348
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:29,495
uh, all of our internal and external customers

349
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:31,495
are able to access this information

350
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:32,975
and use it to make their decisions.

351
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,535
Sometimes we're piping it directly into some of the

352
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:37,735
downstream systems, for instance, like our

353
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:39,875
product life cycle management, other areas where,

354
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:42,216
for instance, our hardware engineers can make decisions

355
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:43,995
around what kind of components they're using

356
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,615
and buying and of course how we actually

357
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:48,695
design our systems is, is resource

358
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:50,655
efficient as possible so we.

359
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:53,520
Use, uh, fundamental guidance from the well architected

360
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,841
pillar to actually design our systems and,

361
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:58,121
and, and, and actually build out our

362
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:00,360
own infrastructure to support the customer carbon

363
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,192
footprint tool.

364
00:13:01,552 --> 00:13:04,121
So this is sort of like a, like a quick

365
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:06,160
run through of, of how we've actually built the guts.

366
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:07,501
I would, um,

367
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:09,822
you know, in, in our, in our final minutes

368
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,921
together, uh, kind of could do

369
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:14,081
some, uh, final recommendations about

370
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:15,822
how we actually do this at scale. So,

371
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:18,160
um, you know, we have built this for our

372
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,701
external customers like yourself

373
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:22,207
in terms of the. Customer carbon footprint tool that

374
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:24,087
that is available in the billing console.

375
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:26,957
So we, we talk, we are obsessive

376
00:13:26,957 --> 00:13:29,177
about knowing what our customers need every day,

377
00:13:29,427 --> 00:13:31,626
what do they need to actually drive the decisions

378
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:33,866
that they need to use their carbon emissions. So whether

379
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:35,986
that be regulatory reporting, whether they

380
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:38,097
wanna make that more actionable. So when we're

381
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:40,467
building out these systems, we actually have different,

382
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:42,866
uh, input mechanisms like product feature

383
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:45,126
requests like our customer roundtable that we

384
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:46,866
are working with customers every day,

385
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:49,626
uh, to actually build this out and, and serve the

386
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:50,227
serve it, um.

387
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:53,053
Serve their needs, um, you know, as

388
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:55,133
we've, if you, if, as I've gone through how we actually

389
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,722
calculate this at, at scale,

390
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:59,163
right, we don't, I, I wouldn't expect everyone would have to,

391
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:01,212
uh, uh, do this themselves at

392
00:14:01,212 --> 00:14:02,653
that type of scale, but, you know,

393
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,114
every day when you're thinking about how to

394
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,332
actually calculate carbon footprint, you can

395
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:07,913
start small,

396
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:10,452
uh, thinking about how you're actually looking at one

397
00:14:10,452 --> 00:14:12,533
activity, uh, layering as I went

398
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:14,533
through that one scenario, an emissions

399
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,893
impact factor generating the emissions of one scenario,

400
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:19,313
and then it, it tallies up into our entire

401
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:20,053
total footprint.

402
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:22,529
Um, we build our system for evolution

403
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,469
and scale. We

404
00:14:24,048 --> 00:14:26,690
intend over time to continue to make sustainability

405
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,690
at the heart of every decision we make across

406
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,690
AWS. And so how do we actually

407
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,808
build our data systems and our supporting

408
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:34,928
infrastructure so we can feed that into every

409
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:37,090
different, uh, activity we, we conduct

410
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,509
across the business. So we've built this so that we can actually

411
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:41,129
scale this out over time.

412
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,340
Uh, and then of course, um, do

413
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,418
you want to, um, uh, just

414
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,538
kind of obligatory, you know, this is, uh, this

415
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:50,690
is sort of our obligatory in slide, but level up

416
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,779
your skill on AWS skillBuilder, so this

417
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:53,710
is really cool.

418
00:14:53,979 --> 00:14:56,298
Make sure you take some time to, um,

419
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,820
actually go and access the, the SkillsBuilder

420
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,178
and, and continue to evolve and, and innovate

421
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:02,279
on AWS.

422
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:04,678
Um, I will leave us

423
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:06,739
a little early, but I wanna thank you. I know you

424
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,940
have a lot of choices about what you can come and, and

425
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,019
see. Uh, I, um,

426
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:14,062
I do. Highly recommend you go over to the sustainability

427
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:16,062
section of the showcase. So if you look

428
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:18,102
at, you know, the entire expo hall, there's

429
00:15:18,102 --> 00:15:20,222
a big overhang in theater 3 that

430
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:22,501
says sustainability. We have, uh,

431
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:24,621
a real live demo of the customer carbon footprint

432
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:26,663
tool where we can help you kind of find where

433
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:28,663
it lives in billing console, go through all

434
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:30,702
the different features that we actually have,

435
00:15:30,783 --> 00:15:33,023
and, you know, talk to, for instance, Marta Fraga,

436
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:35,293
who's, uh, our product manager on the customer

437
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:37,602
carbon footprint tool. So I definitely go over there. There's also

438
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,962
additional demos about how you can actually

439
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:41,702
leverage AWS native native service.

440
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:44,546
Is to, uh, build more other scenarios

441
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:46,625
around circularity and biodiversity, so I'd

442
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,225
go and spend a little bit of time there.

443
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:50,575
Um, if you have any questions, please do stick

444
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,666
around. I would love to answer them and, uh,

445
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:54,785
take some time to rate the app. We wanna continue to

446
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:56,825
have sustainability content at Reinvent,

447
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:59,105
so 5 out of, it's a, it's like a Yelp rating,

448
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,264
5 out of 5 stars please, um,

449
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:03,585
because we wanna make sure we can continue to tell

450
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:05,905
some of the innovative stuff we're doing in sustainability

451
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,025
and of course, you know,

452
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:09,384
continue to kind of share out how we're building

453
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:11,525
this for our customers. So thank you very much.
