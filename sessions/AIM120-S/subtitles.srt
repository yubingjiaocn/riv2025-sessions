1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,040
- Very warm welcome, everybody.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,964
Hopefully this isn't your last session

3
00:00:03,964 --> 00:00:06,000
of the day after a very long day.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,075
It was an amazing keynote this morning,

5
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,558
and I hope today will set
the scene for that too,

6
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:14,988
for all of those incredible
things that are coming

7
00:00:14,988 --> 00:00:19,022
as we evolve and adapt our
journey through Agentic AI.

8
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:21,082
And I think, if there was ever a time

9
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:22,890
to be in technology, it's now,

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,754
and I'm sure you're all as excited as me

11
00:00:25,754 --> 00:00:28,530
to be not only here at re:Invent,

12
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,645
but also in this profession.

13
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:33,371
It's an amazing privilege.

14
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:35,337
Anyway, I'm going to talk to you about

15
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:37,499
the data transformation journey at NatWest

16
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:39,963
that Nina just signposted.

17
00:00:40,883 --> 00:00:43,426
I'm gonna talk a little bit
about the technology, of course,

18
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:45,381
'cause I know that's what
you're interested in.

19
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:47,567
But I'll set the scene at first,

20
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:50,580
just with a little bit more
around who we are as a bank

21
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,290
and what we're trying to achieve,

22
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,290
because I do think, you know,
all of us as technologists,

23
00:00:57,309 --> 00:00:59,958
we seek out really challenging problems

24
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:02,796
with amazing people to work with

25
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,520
and where those problems have mission

26
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,388
and purpose that connect
with us personally.

27
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:08,700
At least that's what I do.

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,040
And I'm sure that's the case for you too.

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,237
And I joined NatWest because
of those three things

30
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:15,180
coming together, you know,

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,596
the opportunity to bring
world-class technology to work

32
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:22,787
with incredible people,
with incredible partnerships

33
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:26,378
with Accenture and AWS on a mission

34
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,494
and purpose that actually
really matters for people.

35
00:01:29,494 --> 00:01:32,311
And in the UK and in Europe

36
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:37,311
where financial services is
disrupting hugely right now,

37
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:39,810
where the competition is really hot,

38
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,402
but where people want to be
able to trust their bank,

39
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:47,242
they want to be able to be
treated as a human being

40
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:49,471
at their time of greatest need, perhaps,

41
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:51,390
when they're most vulnerable

42
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,954
or at the time of greatest joy

43
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:55,528
when they perhaps are
buying their first house

44
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:58,800
and no doubt every other
interaction in between.

45
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,951
But for those interactions
to feel personal,

46
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:03,121
and I know that's what I want.

47
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:07,243
So the opportunity to bring cloud,

48
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:11,340
to bring mobile, to bring digital,

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,117
to bring AI, to bring Agentic,

50
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:17,876
to bring excellent
engineering practices into

51
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:21,360
what is a really big transformation

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,799
is a super interesting
problem to be part of,

53
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,463
but also a privilege.

54
00:02:29,337 --> 00:02:30,780
So, a little bit about me.

55
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,120
So I joined NatWest just last year,

56
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,055
having spent three and a
half years in healthcare,

57
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:40,500
on a similar mission, all cloud-native,

58
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,906
modernizing core data
and digital backbones.

59
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:44,940
And prior to that, 10 years at BP,

60
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,940
where equally huge global organization

61
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:52,994
wrestling with its own
modernization journey,

62
00:02:52,994 --> 00:02:54,510
its own transformation,

63
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,420
its own reinvention to renewables

64
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,320
and again, bringing scaled
enterprise technology

65
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,374
to that problem has been really what I do.

66
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:08,130
And it's great to then to be able to bring

67
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,173
that experience now to NatWest.

68
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,527
So, NatWest, one of the most respected

69
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,064
and well-known brands in the UK,

70
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,649
purple, my favorite color, actually.

71
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:24,649
20 million customers and
a huge committed staff.

72
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,319
So 60,000-plus employees,

73
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,010
half of whom are engineers and technology

74
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,419
and half of whom are
supporting our customers

75
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:37,980
and many of those in frontline roles.

76
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,248
So, you're a very big community

77
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:43,358
of people supporting
those customers every day.

78
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:45,775
And as part of that journey,

79
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:48,000
as part of that core infrastructure,

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,220
supporting upwards of half

81
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,250
of the UK's payments
transactions every day.

82
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,730
It's a very complex technical landscape

83
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,230
and real ambitious plan to modernize

84
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,710
that traditional banking platform

85
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,010
and banking architecture into something

86
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,590
that is really genuinely
fit for an Agentic future,

87
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,775
a modern digital, customer-centric future.

88
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:16,042
And the bank is all
about bringing customer,

89
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:18,678
bringing that hyper-personalization of one

90
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:21,030
to everything that we do

91
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,623
and using modern cloud-native
technologies to do it.

92
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:29,040
Really, I loved, I don't
whether you did too,

93
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,113
I loved the Sony presentation this morning

94
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:37,113
that talked about experiences
that make you feel different.

95
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:41,247
And just imagine if
your banking experience

96
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,915
felt different too.

97
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,588
And I do genuinely think that it matters.

98
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:48,173
It matters how your bank treats you

99
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:49,947
and how your money is managed

100
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:52,290
and whether you trust the people
that are looking after it.

101
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,963
So that's what we're
trying to do at scale.

102
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,429
But it doesn't start in a way that's easy.

103
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:05,242
So, not only are we a 300-year-old bank,

104
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:09,390
sometimes it feels like we
have 300-year-old technology,

105
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,884
a 50-year-old mainframe,
200 million lines of COBOL,

106
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:15,690
very fragmented landscape

107
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,690
that has been diversified
through acquisition.

108
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,914
We have the main retail bank,

109
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:25,045
which you all know and love, NatWest.

110
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:27,355
We have a private bank, a wealth bank,

111
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:31,128
Coutts, banker to the royal family,

112
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:35,416
many of the wealthy inhabitants of the UK,

113
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:39,690
and then a very strong and well respected

114
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,666
commercial institutional bank.

115
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,146
But guess what, we don't actually know

116
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:49,146
which of those customers are
using products from Coutts

117
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,323
or NatWest or the commercial
bank or the business bank.

118
00:05:54,323 --> 00:05:56,460
And that's the journey that we've started

119
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,200
that, recognizing the huge ambition

120
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,940
to become a hyper-personalized,

121
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,780
customer-centric digital bank starts

122
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,303
with knowing your customers.

123
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,770
And that's the heritage

124
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,464
to this transformation that we're on

125
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:16,877
and establishing a world-class
data spine for NatWest

126
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,125
that will enable that
hyper-personalization,

127
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,790
that will enable that growth,

128
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,498
will enable those intimate experiences,

129
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:27,228
but delivered in a way that
is simple, is standardized,

130
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:31,203
is automated, and is cloud-native.

131
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:32,583
And that's the journey.

132
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:37,590
So when we think about
becoming a simpler bank,

133
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,460
we think about simplicity

134
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,460
in terms of how that simplicity
shows up to customers.

135
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:47,190
So it's not just about
switching off technology,

136
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,019
it's not just about turning off apps.

137
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,496
It's not just about
removing that horrible COBOL

138
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,900
that we've all lived with for so long.

139
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,390
It's not about that at all.

140
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,100
It's about simplifying the journeys

141
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,840
and the experiences of our customers

142
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,120
and doing that in a way
that is sustainable,

143
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,738
that is frictionless, that is modern,

144
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:07,954
and that creates those
experiences that we want.

145
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:10,507
And we're starting from a place that

146
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:12,599
perhaps no one would
really want to, actually,

147
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,548
where we have today nearly 30

148
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:20,910
customer master databases across the bank.

149
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,210
And our ambition is to
reduce that significantly

150
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,663
to three or less,

151
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:31,663
where we have very slow delivery,

152
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:34,187
particularly in our data environments,

153
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,030
but also in our core banking environments

154
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,283
where we're looking to often weeks,

155
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,559
if not months to release

156
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:47,340
and an ambition to compete
with the near banks

157
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,340
of not only hundreds of
releases a day, but thousands.

158
00:07:52,816 --> 00:07:54,333
And that's our ambition.

159
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,709
And then of course, as any bank,

160
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:02,370
a very demanding regulatory environment

161
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,820
that requires really strong governance,

162
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,975
not just of our interactions
with our customers,

163
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:09,540
but of course with our data.

164
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,969
And our ambition is to
really simplify all of that

165
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:17,969
in a way that enables those
customer-centric interactions.

166
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,596
And when we looked at this journey,

167
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:24,000
we realized that two things,

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,675
one, we didn't have the capability really

169
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:28,295
both on the engineering side

170
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:30,735
and on the product side to deliver it,

171
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,948
but secondly, it was gonna take too long.

172
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:36,314
And that's where we looked
to our partnerships,

173
00:08:36,314 --> 00:08:39,000
that's where we looked to Accenture

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,090
and we looked to AWS as
our technology partner

175
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,940
to enable that agility, that pace,

176
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,578
but most critically,

177
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:50,133
bringing forward the timeline to delivery.

178
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,861
And when you're in transformation
of this kind of scale,

179
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:57,420
I know many of you all know
from your own companies

180
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,722
that partners really matter.

181
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:02,835
And how you select your
partners really matter.

182
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,448
Are they aligned with your ambitions?

183
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:07,521
Do they connect with you personally?

184
00:09:07,521 --> 00:09:10,575
Do you have that alignment on mission?

185
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:12,990
But more importantly, is there mutuality?

186
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,291
Is there capability that
will be brought to you

187
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,953
by that partner that will create

188
00:09:18,953 --> 00:09:22,290
a one plus one equals three multiplier.

189
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,980
And we were incredibly
fortunate to have two

190
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,243
of those partners here today,

191
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:30,244
AWS and Accenture, who are
creating that multiplier effect

192
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:32,640
for this transformation journey.

193
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,442
And we're really delighted with
the progress that we've made

194
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:37,920
so far, and the journey continues.

195
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,491
And of course, it's not
without bumps in the road.

196
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:44,313
Transformations of this scale never are.

197
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:48,911
But a lesson in selecting
partners to be aligned

198
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:50,520
to your mission and purpose,

199
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,999
to be bringing something
that you don't have

200
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:56,491
and to creating that
real cohesion of outcome

201
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:59,523
is really what's driving
the success of this program.

202
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,870
So establishing the data spine of NatWest.

203
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,990
So, we've done a huge amount of work

204
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,230
to define our target architecture,

205
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,348
our target reference
architecture for the bank.

206
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:14,250
I'm super happy to talk about that

207
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,005
in more detail in the break or afterwards.

208
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:19,200
Please do reach out to me.

209
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,160
A big part of that, the
modernization of NatWest,

210
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,980
comes through its data.

211
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,138
And how we think about those outcomes,

212
00:10:28,138 --> 00:10:30,060
again, is not about the technology,

213
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,070
it's about what those
outcomes are for customers.

214
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,999
And within our institutional
bank, for example,

215
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,680
it can take up to 17 weeks

216
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,730
to onboard a business banking customer.

217
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,570
I mean, that's a
ridiculous amount of time.

218
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,500
Why is that?

219
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,120
Because the processes are fragmented.

220
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,144
It's because there's a
lot of paperwork still.

221
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:48,407
There's a lot of to'ing and fro'ing,

222
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:50,532
'cause we don't know our customers.

223
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:52,620
We don't know that perhaps they're already

224
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,610
a retail customer.

225
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,221
They might already be a
business banking customer.

226
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:59,010
And we're not able therefore
to accelerate that journey

227
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,719
or avoid repeating and
asking the same questions.

228
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:05,274
In the retail bank,

229
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:09,150
retail banks win and lose on the pace

230
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,286
and the agility and
delivery of new products

231
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:16,033
and the delivery of products
which are really personalized

232
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,643
to you as an individual.

233
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,520
I don't know about you,

234
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,354
I get deeply irritated when
you get emails or messages

235
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:26,693
or WhatsApp messages from organizations

236
00:11:26,693 --> 00:11:28,350
who clearly don't know you,

237
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,490
because they're trying
to sell you something

238
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,740
you obviously don't need.

239
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:33,990
And banks can be the same.

240
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,659
But our ambition is to
know our customers so well

241
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:40,290
that our interactions with
them are hyper-personalized

242
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,270
to those individuals.

243
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,493
And that's our retail banking ambition.

244
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,389
In the finance space,

245
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:52,389
we have enormously
complex finance landscape,

246
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:55,096
both from a regulatory
reporting point of view,

247
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:58,590
but equally because of the variety

248
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,904
and disparate nature of
the financial transactions

249
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:04,830
across all of our banking platforms.

250
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,790
And the finance aspect of
the finance simplification

251
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,950
is a big part of this
data transformation too.

252
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,650
But arguably actually
one of the most complex.

253
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,497
We have 30,000 Informatica batch jobs

254
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:19,533
that run every night, for example.

255
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:24,322
Most of which are posting
adjustments to transactions

256
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:28,440
that are making, aggregating apples

257
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,243
and pears to create oranges.

258
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:33,325
And this simplification journey

259
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:35,137
from a finance point of view is all about

260
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:37,200
just creating that seamless,

261
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,050
frictionless transaction to general ledger

262
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,043
to P&L in a world-class way.

263
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,230
And then financial crime.

264
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,400
And one of the things that probably most

265
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,403
of us worry about every day
with our money is, is it safe?

266
00:12:51,257 --> 00:12:54,753
And even for me actually
yesterday arriving,

267
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:57,925
trying to pay for the
hotel with my credit card,

268
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:00,990
the fraud detection jumped in.

269
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,296
Well, if the bank had actually
known that I was traveling

270
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:06,157
and they should have done,

271
00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:09,330
then that would've been a
more seamless experience.

272
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,334
And that's what we're trying
to achieve with NatWest,

273
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:13,470
that we know our customers,
we know where they're going,

274
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,020
we understand their transactions

275
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,100
and we're able to keep them safe every day

276
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,780
through world-class AI,

277
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,169
through world-class detection response

278
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:23,842
and prevention of
financial crime and fraud.

279
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:26,993
So an enormous vision, enormous ambition,

280
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:31,440
all of which, of course,
starts with the data.

281
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,143
If we're to be the nation's
most customer-centric

282
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:38,670
and digital bank, then we
need to know our customers.

283
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,800
And this data transformation is anchored

284
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,813
on that very premise.

285
00:13:44,675 --> 00:13:46,942
So let's talk a little bit
about the technology then,

286
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:49,609
which I'm sure you're all waiting for.

287
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:54,240
So we started in a world
of a very traditional

288
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,120
on-prem Teradata, Snowflake architecture,

289
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,650
a traditional data warehouse

290
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,800
and emerging analytics capability,

291
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,403
but a very traditional
monolithic architecture.

292
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,530
And we are moving to, through
this transformation journey

293
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,351
and we're well on the way, thanks to many

294
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:18,835
of the great products from AWS,

295
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:23,160
we're moving to a modern
data mesh architecture,

296
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,297
but with a twist,

297
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,559
and I'll tell you a little bit
about that twist in a minute.

298
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:30,360
Traditional data mesh architecture,

299
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,070
which has the four characteristics.

300
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,920
So, distributed data ownership,

301
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,175
so establishing data
owners in the businesses

302
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:43,560
and real governance and
control of that data.

303
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,104
Secondly, data as product.

304
00:14:45,104 --> 00:14:49,500
So establishing foundational
data products across the bank

305
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,223
that are reusable and consumable.

306
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:55,247
Third is self-service infrastructure.

307
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:59,802
So where we started was
in a world that said,

308
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:01,920
if you want to know about your data,

309
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,924
then you get a report
in a spreadsheet that

310
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:06,660
ask someone, you raise
a ticket in service now

311
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,240
and then it comes back to you in a week.

312
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,031
This is about turning that
180 degrees to a self-service,

313
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:14,040
data-driven architecture.

314
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,310
So that's the third
characteristic of the data mesh.

315
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,779
And then fourthly, distributed
and automated governance.

316
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,034
And I'd argue, in reality,

317
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:26,583
that's the hardest bit of this journey.

318
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:32,370
So, that architecture that we're building

319
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,773
is anchored on replacing Teradata

320
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:39,540
over time, diminishing and
reducing the Snowflake footprint

321
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,939
into AWS Lakehouse

322
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:45,711
with glue and lake
formation for governance,

323
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:50,550
and then a fantastic mesh architecture

324
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,550
through what we know within
the banker's data marketplace,

325
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,800
but it gives you that access
to federated data products.

326
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,300
And then, where the twist is

327
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,772
and where the magic comes, of course,

328
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:11,250
is how you then make those
data products enabled

329
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,590
and accessible through a semantic layer

330
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,840
through natural language for consumption.

331
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,004
But then critically,

332
00:16:17,004 --> 00:16:21,990
how you have that foundational platform

333
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,090
to enable agents and Agentic AI.

334
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,040
And that's where we're really excited

335
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,890
with the partnership with AWS.

336
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,670
We're really excited with the
partnership with Accenture,

337
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,573
who brought some of
those agents to the table

338
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,439
with us already to enable that,

339
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:38,019
not just the scale build,
but the scale consumption

340
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:42,570
and the automated augmented
consumption of data

341
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,403
to everybody in the bank.

342
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:48,603
When I started at NatWest,

343
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,493
there was very little concept
of a data-driven culture.

344
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,588
Some of this may resonate
with you, I'm sure.

345
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:59,670
And I would be in an EXCO

346
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,121
and I would perhaps ask a question,

347
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,891
"So how many customers do we have?"

348
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,225
And the head of retail would say,

349
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:11,697
"Well, I think we have about
19 and a half million."

350
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,563
Well, where we're moving to
now is we've banned the term

351
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:19,717
"I think" in favor of,

352
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:23,726
"I know because the data
tells me," or "I don't know,

353
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:26,427
but I'll look to the data to find out."

354
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:32,400
And that shift from subjective thinking

355
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,900
that you might know the answer,

356
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,020
to real trusted data assets

357
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,110
delivered through a modern data spine,

358
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:45,110
accessed through a semantic
natural language consumption

359
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,300
and then automated through and with agents

360
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:56,040
could not be a more different world.

361
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,200
And we've achieved much of that already

362
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,189
in an 18-month period.

363
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:03,960
And the partnership with
Accenture enabled WS is all

364
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,535
about scale, but it is
critically all about pace,

365
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:12,535
and we expect to have been
very well along that journey

366
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,388
by the end of 2027, and
that's our ambition.

367
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,620
And this isn't for the faint-hearted.

368
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,581
You can imagine a world
of a 300-year-old bank,

369
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:27,042
5,500 applications,

370
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:30,462
very little discoverability
of those applications

371
00:18:30,462 --> 00:18:32,940
and a mindset that is very traditional

372
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,267
anchored on traditional
management information

373
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:38,633
accessed through spreadsheets.

374
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:41,220
So this journey isn't
just about the technology,

375
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,320
of course, it's about the ways of working,

376
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,460
which I think is also super interesting

377
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,149
how you can use these emblematic programs

378
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:53,850
such as this data of transformation

379
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,145
to not just enable that
outcome for our customers,

380
00:18:57,145 --> 00:18:59,845
not just simplify and modernize the bank,

381
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:04,530
but also use it as the
focal point to simplify

382
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,747
and modernize the practices as well.

383
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:09,240
And I think that's where you
really get the multiplier

384
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,753
effect of working with partners
such as Accenture and AWS.

385
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,300
Oh, I pressed the button twice.

386
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,350
It might go on twice.

387
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,100
So a little bit more about
the architecture then.

388
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,540
You probably can't see this terribly well,

389
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,952
but I know the slides
are available afterwards.

390
00:19:31,952 --> 00:19:34,290
So as I said, what do you see here?

391
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,210
You see a classic mesh architecture

392
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,110
that is then coexisting with a modern

393
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,953
cloud-native Lakehouse architecture

394
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:50,610
and a series of transition
architectures that allow us

395
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,637
to decommission the
Teradata, diminish Snowflake,

396
00:19:54,637 --> 00:19:59,637
bring in self-service, bring
in the Agentic AI layer.

397
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,430
And these are three boxes you see.

398
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,958
So, in the middle of the
slide there at the bottom,

399
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,770
that's the data marketplace.

400
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,000
That's the mesh,

401
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,320
that's the engine room
of our transformation.

402
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,001
And then slightly to the left
of that is the governance.

403
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:20,313
And then just above that is the Lakehouse

404
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:24,528
and the cloud-native data lake

405
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:25,890
for the management information

406
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,900
and the MI reporting, et cetera.

407
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,290
So yeah, I mean, pretty
standard probably for some

408
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,443
of you more advanced
practitioners out there.

409
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,920
But where this is interesting
for us as technologists

410
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,920
is where you're doing two
things, one, coexisting.

411
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:47,673
The target architecture is
never the hard bit, is it?

412
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:52,020
It's the transition to it,
to managing that coexistence.

413
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,940
And then secondly,
recognizing that actually some

414
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,534
of these products are still very immature.

415
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:01,385
So we've been working very closely

416
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:06,385
with AWS on the development
of SageMaker Unified Studio,

417
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,570
which, of course, is the platform

418
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,136
for our data marketplace.

419
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:17,561
And then increasingly
with the product teams

420
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:22,380
with Bedrock and now, of course, AgentCore

421
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,500
for creating our Agentic architecture

422
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,660
that is consuming these data products.

423
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,560
Incredibly exciting.

424
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,700
We would never even been having

425
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,670
that conversation had we
not got this fabric right

426
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,140
and then enabling it to scale.

427
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,970
And working with the product
team at AWS is a privilege.

428
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,510
Of course, you've got some
outstanding technologists there,

429
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,700
but the openness to
adapt to our requirements

430
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,544
has been a really, really strong feature

431
00:21:47,544 --> 00:21:49,230
of this partnership actually.

432
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,650
And so if you're sat
there, you're wondering

433
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,055
about some features
that perhaps are missing

434
00:21:55,055 --> 00:21:57,865
or wondering how you get
those into the backlog,

435
00:21:57,865 --> 00:22:00,210
just to engage with those product teams.

436
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,570
I think you get a really,
really strong response

437
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,593
and teams of people who are
desperately keen to work

438
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:08,421
with you and anchor their
own product features

439
00:22:08,421 --> 00:22:10,976
off your own needs.

440
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:12,633
So that's our architecture.

441
00:22:15,357 --> 00:22:18,589
But of course, it's not
just about the technology.

442
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:20,447
I wish it was.

443
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:22,830
It's about so many other things.

444
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:27,390
And when you're scaling and transforming

445
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,848
a 300-year-old bank, there's a number

446
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,830
of things you really need to get right.

447
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,846
And choosing the technology probably

448
00:22:35,846 --> 00:22:37,743
is one of the easiest things.

449
00:22:39,398 --> 00:22:41,335
What's been most important for us, then,

450
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:45,016
is real clarity on mission and purpose.

451
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:49,080
You recall I said at the
beginning, I certainly am

452
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,427
personally motivated by complex problems

453
00:22:53,427 --> 00:22:55,709
that can be solved with
modern technologies,

454
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,562
working with incredible people

455
00:22:58,562 --> 00:23:03,360
on a mission and purpose that matters.

456
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,196
But getting that clarity
for all 60,000 employees

457
00:23:07,196 --> 00:23:09,720
and the broader communities
from across our partnerships

458
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,834
is really important.

459
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:13,353
And we've been incredibly
lucky and work very hard

460
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:15,810
actually across all three
of our organizations

461
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,390
to get executive-level
sponsorship for this program.

462
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,619
And I can't underestimate
the importance of that,

463
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:24,584
you know, particularly
when things get a bit bumpy

464
00:23:24,584 --> 00:23:25,890
at times, don't they?

465
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,723
Of course they do.

466
00:23:26,723 --> 00:23:29,070
They're meant to, progress
isn't meant to be easy,

467
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,820
but having that executive-level,
CEO-level sponsorship

468
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,946
of this program with
real clarity of purpose

469
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:39,213
where there's obvious
value for the customers

470
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:43,637
that we serve across our nation

471
00:23:43,637 --> 00:23:46,440
is the most important thing,

472
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,173
and alignment on that
across the three partners.

473
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,410
And a few others too.

474
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,917
I mean, you probably also wrestle

475
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:57,522
with this annual funding debacle.

476
00:23:57,522 --> 00:23:58,650
Hopefully you don't,

477
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,750
maybe you've all moved to product models

478
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,280
and continuous funding.

479
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,293
We haven't, sadly, not fully anyway.

480
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:08,620
So you're really setting out
an ambition that is multi-year

481
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,830
and then committing to the funding

482
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,210
and sticking with it.

483
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,290
You have to do that.

484
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,010
I think that this relentless
hair cutting of budgets

485
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,523
every year just causes these
kind of programs to fail.

486
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,524
So we've committed to the
duration of this program

487
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:27,153
and we've committed to
the funding upfront.

488
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,040
And then, of course, having the ability

489
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,085
and the adaptability to
course correct though.

490
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:36,517
So I think in reality
what we set out to build,

491
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,490
even at the start of this year,

492
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,930
is different to what we're now building,

493
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,850
because what's happened?

494
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,100
Well, the world of AI's come, hasn't it?

495
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,200
Agentic AI wasn't even in our vocabulary

496
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,273
probably six months ago, let alone three.

497
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,620
So, thinking about how we
course correct this architecture

498
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,118
to really scale AI and agents
has been an important part

499
00:24:56,118 --> 00:24:59,352
of the adaptation, which has been possible

500
00:24:59,352 --> 00:25:01,299
through having the foundations

501
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,273
and having those foundations built.

502
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,110
And then finally, I
probably would call out

503
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,820
sticking to an industrialized method.

504
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,288
And I think that's also
where partnerships come in.

505
00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:17,070
How are you gonna deliver
this and stick to it?

506
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,623
How are you gonna mobilize
your whole organization,

507
00:25:18,623 --> 00:25:21,110
have a standardized pattern of delivery

508
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,740
that is industrial scale
that allows you to go faster?

509
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,840
So, establishing that factory mindset

510
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,207
and factory model has
been really critical.

511
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:33,045
We're not fully there yet,
but we're getting there.

512
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:34,753
But I would absolutely say

513
00:25:34,753 --> 00:25:36,385
that if you're embarking on a program

514
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:38,588
of this kind of scale,

515
00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:42,900
working through really
precisely your delivery model

516
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,470
and approach, codifying
that, automating that

517
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,166
so that you can go as
fast as you possibly can

518
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:51,843
is really important.

519
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,760
So, what have we learned along the way?

520
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,080
We've learned a huge amount actually.

521
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,380
And I'd love to hear any
questions you may have

522
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,710
that I've not covered yet,
but across three areas really.

523
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:09,710
And this is towards the
end of what I'm gonna say

524
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:11,940
and then we'll open up for questions.

525
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,710
So, I've covered this
already on the context side.

526
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,547
So, it is fair to say,
and I'm sure you all know,

527
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:24,570
AWS SageMaker Unified
Studio is a new product.

528
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,244
It's been evolving over
the last 12 months.

529
00:26:27,244 --> 00:26:32,100
So, working with AWS
directly on developing

530
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,840
that product so it's fit for purpose

531
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,415
and not just has the
features and functions,

532
00:26:36,415 --> 00:26:39,240
but also has the industrial
strength that's required

533
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,322
of a platform of this scale.

534
00:26:41,322 --> 00:26:42,750
That has been a journey,

535
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,542
but we've worked really hard on it

536
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:48,270
and been super successful, I'd say.

537
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,980
Of course, collaborating
with the product teams,

538
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,982
I've talked about that already.

539
00:26:51,982 --> 00:26:56,073
I think, in terms of opportunity,

540
00:26:57,963 --> 00:27:00,150
this federated model.

541
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,300
So, with the data mesh,

542
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,520
I'm sure many of you have
built data mesh architectures.

543
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,111
One of the huge benefits is
autonomy of the consumers

544
00:27:09,111 --> 00:27:11,463
of the mesh.

545
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,910
But also your ability
to federate ownership

546
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,910
and accountability to where the
data is created and managed.

547
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,315
And that's been a really,
really high-impact journey

548
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:25,103
and high-impact outcome for us at NatWest.

549
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,460
Some more to go,

550
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,460
but empowering people to take
responsibility for their data

551
00:27:32,177 --> 00:27:35,943
is such an incredible part
of any data transformation.

552
00:27:38,638 --> 00:27:43,638
And then where the challenges be.

553
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:48,650
The biggest challenge really
is clarity on operating model.

554
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,240
I would say it's the technology, it's not.

555
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,410
It's not the technology at all.

556
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,941
We've got amazing technologists,
incredible technology.

557
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:57,885
We've got amazing partners.

558
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:01,869
It's about mobilizing those
towards a magnetic north

559
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:04,047
that we're all bought into.

560
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:07,131
But actually the hard bit comes

561
00:28:07,131 --> 00:28:10,770
when you're not clear
on whose job is what,

562
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,651
and getting the operating
model of the delivery

563
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:17,960
and the operating model of
the consuming businesses,

564
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,010
super important to do that up front.

565
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,780
And I think, probably for me,

566
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,553
that's one the strong lessons learned

567
00:28:27,553 --> 00:28:30,142
is not to leave that to the end,

568
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,712
is to establish that
operating model early.

569
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,459
So you've got people bought in,

570
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:35,791
they're learning the technology,

571
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:36,957
they're learning the vocabulary,

572
00:28:36,957 --> 00:28:38,973
they're learning the ways of working

573
00:28:38,973 --> 00:28:42,097
that enables these platforms
to be really successful.

574
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:44,132
And guess what, now once you've done that,

575
00:28:44,132 --> 00:28:46,816
you can then scale the
automation through Agentic,

576
00:28:46,816 --> 00:28:49,833
and the magic really does
happen then for customers.

577
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,980
And with that, I'll pause and
open the floor for questions.
