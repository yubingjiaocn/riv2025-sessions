1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,100
- Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,660
I am Brian Ray.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,780
I head up the data and AI business line

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,270
for North America at Atos.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,103
- Hello, everyone.

6
00:00:10,103 --> 00:00:10,936
My name is Justin Cook.

7
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:14,400
I'm the global CTO for
the AWS Alliance at Atos.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,510
- Hi, and I'm Mark Ross.

9
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,053
I'm our chief architect for AWS
in our engineering function.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,580
- So we're gonna demystify
a bit about the agentic AI

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,240
and give you guys a little bit about

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,270
the critical path forward
productionizing AI

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,760
and give you a real honest landscape

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,263
of what it looks like today.

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,490
First off, a little bit
about where Atos is at.

16
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,640
Atos has been around 20 some years.

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,160
My group came in from a lot
of different acquisitions,

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,510
17 or so.

19
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,390
Philippe Salle, our chairman
of the board CEO said,

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,390
data and AI is gonna be
extremely important to consulting

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,820
and we need to make a
data and AI business line.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,367
So that represents 2000

23
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:03,060
and we're on track to be 10,000 by 2028.

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,280
Firm overall by 80,000 folks.

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,980
So it's a small portion of a big firm,

26
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,073
but it's really a path forward
for us and our customers.

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,490
Myself, I'm an industry expert

28
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,140
and I also really rely a lot on

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,970
what the industry's saying here.

30
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,780
And how many here have seen the
gardener hype curves before?

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,300
I'm gonna interpret this
for you a little bit.

32
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,370
It's really important to understand

33
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,350
what they're trying to say here.

34
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,440
Basically, agents, believe it or not,

35
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,700
are at the tip of hype right now.

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,050
I know you're shocked.

37
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,390
Has anybody here heard AI?

38
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,980
Can everybody spell it?

39
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,813
Good.

40
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:42,063
It is a big topic and it's at
the tip of the hype right now.

41
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,390
Model ops is coming down

42
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,610
and they call this a
trough of disillusionment.

43
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,820
That's when people say the reality sets in

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,530
this is harder than we thought.

45
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,570
We have data availability issues.

46
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,970
We don't have the
technology needed to do it.

47
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,850
We need to go to the AWS
conference and learn something.

48
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,020
Many reasons.

49
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,020
It becomes the trough of disillusionment

50
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,940
and you see model ops.

51
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,620
Gen AI is already in that.

52
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,160
The bubbles bursted to some
degree with some of that.

53
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,350
And then if you see on the far side,

54
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,320
that's the plateau of productivity.

55
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,630
That's where we come
back out of that trough

56
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,950
and that's where we all want to get.

57
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,590
We want this technology to be seamless,

58
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,870
part of our daily business life,

59
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,940
and we want it to make our
lives better and easier,

60
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,410
not being challenged by it every day.

61
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,630
So that's where we want to get.

62
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,330
What we're hearing is we need
to make that data available.

63
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,010
We need it to be governed.

64
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,790
We need to have access to
data in all sorts of places.

65
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,420
SharePoint, other places like
that, protocols are coming up.

66
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,890
You've heard MCP

67
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,770
and other protocols making
that more available.

68
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,920
And also just being able to
take some of those use cases

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,010
and prioritize them
based off of ROI and risk

70
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,510
and be able to do that better.

71
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,630
MIT said 95% of those use cases

72
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,470
people plan to do are not
really getting into production.

73
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,750
That makes a lot of sense
if you take a lot of swings,

74
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,000
of course, we're all aiming to be that 5%

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,863
to get your use cases in production.

76
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,950
Another thing from Frances
Karamouzis and Gartner

77
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,180
and this is very helpful

78
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,800
because this lays out AI

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,320
especially GenAI in the five buckets.

80
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,080
On your far right, those
are your market makers.

81
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,970
Those are of course Anthropics

82
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,130
and you know Googles, Mistral,

83
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,360
those are the ones that are doing

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,760
the a hundred million
dollar investments in it.

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,480
On your far left, target category one.

86
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,260
Those are your very
consumer based easy entry.

87
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,320
My mom uses ChatGPT for recipes.

88
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,780
It doesn't make her cooking
better, but she uses it.

89
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,600
And your embedded technology as well,

90
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,273
you're getting it embedded
into your category two.

91
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,490
Category three is where you
start using AI to solve specific

92
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:57,750
vertical or horizontal use
cases for a specific industry

93
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,400
or a department.

94
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,030
And then the category four
is where you take your data

95
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,940
and you train a model or fine tune it

96
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,020
or you gear it specifically to a problem.

97
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,610
So those category three and four

98
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,900
it gets more expensive as
you get into those spaces.

99
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,050
So it's really a hockey
stick curve of cost.

100
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,160
Speaking of Atos,

101
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,100
one of our big focuses
is those category three

102
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,110
and category four use cases.

103
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,420
It requires lots of partnerships to do it,

104
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,740
lot of technology to do it,
but it really has a value

105
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,840
and we're seeing that value every day now.

106
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,530
The other thing that you're hearing too

107
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,630
is adoption problems.

108
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,340
People are given these tools sometimes

109
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,920
and there's a large fallout rate

110
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,480
and it depends on who you are.

111
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,820
There's the everyday user.

112
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,000
Everybody wants to move from
left to right in the slide.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,290
Everybody does.

114
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,890
Everyday users want to be
able to get advanced with AI.

115
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,953
Your children will be better
at prompt engineering than you.

116
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,613
So everybody wants to use this technology.

117
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,210
Lots of reasons for that governance.

118
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,640
I always say that AI without governance

119
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,920
is like playing tennis without a net.

120
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,680
It doesn't really work and
it's not that much fun.

121
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,510
But everyone wants to move that direction.

122
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,890
If you're advanced or you're agentic

123
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,450
you wanna move to more advancing.

124
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,040
Why do people fall out of that?

125
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,010
Why do they fall out of that
matrix and what happens?

126
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,850
When they fall out of it

127
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,920
sometimes they'll see them shadow AI.

128
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,500
Shadow AI is when you're using it anyway.

129
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,200
Or you'll see someone
abandon it completely saying,

130
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,990
we're not gonna adopt this
AI technology in my workflow

131
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,660
because it just isn't
working well enough for me.

132
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,510
And then what's the solution for that?

133
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,760
Partners and technology help

134
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,030
and a need for consulting,
a need for community,

135
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,520
eventually there'll be a
community around agentic,

136
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,280
believe it or not, there'll
even be a currency someday

137
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,040
around agentic agents will
have their own currency

138
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,040
speaking to each other someday very soon.

139
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,540
Think about that for a second.

140
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,780
- Hello, everyone.

141
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,190
So I'd like to talk for a minute about

142
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,930
how we can help you get to the place

143
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,190
where Brian wants you to go.

144
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,280
At Atos we're very focused
on outcome-based solutions.

145
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,260
Instead of just listing
a bunch of services

146
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,510
and going at that angle,
we want you to understand

147
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,490
where you're going before you get there.

148
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,320
We do that by scaling out competencies.

149
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,170
We have 19 of them, a
lot of partner programs.

150
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,250
What we really focus on

151
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,140
is how do we build a relationship with AWS

152
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,930
to get the client there
faster and more efficiently.

153
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,480
So the ultimate goal of our
partnership with our clients

154
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,870
and with AWS is to grow the
relationships on all facets

155
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,933
to make agentic evolution come faster.

156
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,810
One thing I also really wanna discuss

157
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,210
is how fast AI is evolving.

158
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,670
We know from this conference
we are seeing frontier agents.

159
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,800
We're seeing different
kind of model distillation.

160
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,750
One thing that's interesting
is the different nuances

161
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,010
that we're seeing it with.

162
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,530
It's going everywhere from
browsing to scraping the web,

163
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,310
executing multi-step tasks
with strong governance.

164
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,360
We see it across a bunch

165
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,100
of different standards for security.

166
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,370
But when is the actual right
time to implement is key?

167
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,960
And that is where Atos can help you.

168
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,070
We know how to roadmap

169
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,870
and we know how to carve out the solutions

170
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,620
to do a consistent
strategy around agentic AI

171
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,660
with all the new feature
sets with them, right?

172
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,520
So the goal is really around

173
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,230
not just creating better agents,

174
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,060
but around better frameworks.

175
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,440
We want to create a deployment

176
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,600
and an orchestration platform with tools

177
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,420
and marketplaces that can build and scale

178
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,220
and manage the agents in real time, right?

179
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,190
This is not just about agility
and latency and scalability,

180
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,550
but this is about your individual
domain needs for that data

181
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,440
that's attached to the AI.

182
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,550
So what does this all mean?

183
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,380
This all means that we're
gonna start moving towards

184
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,330
personifying AI, right?

185
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,210
These agents can be self
adaptable, they can collaborate,

186
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,515
they can sync, and it's
all about using real-time

187
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:44,130
enterprise data that's your data.

188
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,810
So we're leveraging your specific data

189
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,630
to feed these agent workflow.

190
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,900
So as we start shifting more
and more towards agentic AI

191
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,850
we're gonna accelerate more outcomes

192
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,010
with that minimal human intervention.

193
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,360
So that's really the key, right?

194
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,310
So I want you to ask
yourselves the question,

195
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,020
is there a path for agentic AI

196
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,390
to artificial general intelligence, right?

197
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,040
What assumptions are baked into the goals

198
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,070
that we give AI in your own
individual organizations?

199
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,020
And then how do you see that growing?

200
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,710
So at Atos we created a
platform called Polaris AI.

201
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,930
The ultimate goal is to
give an extraction layer

202
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,240
to actually how you
build into marketplace.

203
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,970
As we grow and grow agentic more and more,

204
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,830
we're able to help you build out

205
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,090
those professional services.

206
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,280
And the objective is that
we are always client-focused

207
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,840
with what you need to do with your data

208
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,073
and your AI solutions.

209
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,970
So let's talk about go
to market around agentic.

210
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,260
You're gonna hear a lot of services

211
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,340
in this conference today.

212
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,360
You're gonna hear a lot about

213
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,700
what exactly is going
on, new possibilities.

214
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,050
But how do you get to the point

215
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,450
where you're actually using
this with your customers

216
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,790
or with your use cases specifically?

217
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,260
So the first one is how do we bring

218
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,820
the agents to our system, right?

219
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,920
We're seeing a lot more industry flavored

220
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,000
super agents, right?

221
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,100
As 2026 evolves, we're go to market,

222
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,770
there's a lot of AI targeted super agents,

223
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,410
we're seeing domain specific applications.

224
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,840
So maybe it's finance, maybe it's tax,

225
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,550
maybe it's accounting, whatever that is

226
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,380
industry standards are baked horizontally

227
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,290
and vertically across
all organizations now.

228
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,300
Autonomy, multimodal integration.

229
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,190
We know this, this
coming out more and more.

230
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,290
We're seeing different
modalities, tax vision,

231
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,140
whatever it is, and they're
acting with more flexibility

232
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,180
and they're handling those novel tasks

233
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,130
we don't really need to do anymore.

234
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:20,970
But last but not least,

235
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,160
a lot of safety alignment and oversight.

236
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,600
How do we put those guardrails

237
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,760
and frameworks around detection drifting,

238
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,010
ensuring alignment, and
items like run checks.

239
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,390
So it's tricky,

240
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,430
but you need to make
sure that you're prepared

241
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,510
and that is the next point.

242
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,950
How do we proactively prepare

243
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,320
to move towards this go to market, right?

244
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,240
So at Atos, one thing
that we really specify

245
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,850
is industry aligned solutions
where we're amplifying

246
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,700
the actual value of the AWS services.

247
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,230
So you can look at the service catalog,

248
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,370
you can put them together,

249
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,470
but how does this work
to create an outcome?

250
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,880
That's what we really design, right?

251
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,280
We design the roadmap for you.

252
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,190
And this is always about
business outcomes, right?

253
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,710
We can go and talk about
AI innovation all day,

254
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,170
but if you do not put that
through a business lens

255
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,870
you're not able to prioritize
those measurable outcomes

256
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,750
and connect those to things like KPIs

257
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,190
and actual cloud capabilities

258
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,190
that you're having to spend with, right?

259
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,660
The third, differentiation,

260
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,310
understanding differentiation factors

261
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,440
through an AI first strategy,

262
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,580
which you're gonna see more and more

263
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,140
over the next year is critical.

264
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,973
And that's just because

265
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:21,570
we're not just bolt on anymore, right?

266
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,020
We're building cloud native
now, that changes how we see AI.

267
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,720
So the key is to bring your vertical depth

268
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,900
and your AI accelerators with
that native implementation

269
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,140
for that faster TTV or your time to value.

270
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,990
And last but not least,
a really important one,

271
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,020
proprietary IP, the vertical AI solutions,

272
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,910
I wanna talk about that,
which is really critical.

273
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,190
How do we scale our AI
solutions vertically

274
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,530
and horizontally, maybe
against different geos,

275
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,940
different industries, different regions

276
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,190
is gonna be really critical
in the next year, right?

277
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,040
You wanna grow across all
methodologies all at once.

278
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,240
And then how do we look through a lens

279
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
of sovereign cloud expertise as well?

280
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,810
That's something that
we specialize at Atos

281
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,160
that we can help you with

282
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,140
as well as the data first architecture.

283
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,910
This one is very interesting, right?

284
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,800
We wanna make sure that we're
leveraging the data we have

285
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,600
in our ecosystem for our models

286
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,740
and for agentic AI.

287
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,450
It's there, we need to leverage
it and we need to make sure

288
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,040
that we're using it correctly.

289
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,320
And lat but not least,
how does this all fit

290
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,900
into agentic AI orchestration, right?

291
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,730
How does this build
and how can we help you

292
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,800
get there is the next step.

293
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,180
Thank you.

294
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,180
- Thanks, Justin.

295
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,300
So at Atos we are a large DSI.

296
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,540
We've got a cloud on an
infrastructure practice.

297
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,993
One of the things we provide
to customers is cloud advisory.

298
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,440
Traditionally cloud advisory has been done

299
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,340
with one of our cloud advisors
sitting down with customers

300
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,850
and talking to them about
their current environment,

301
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,330
their goals, and helping to
map out how they get there.

302
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,030
It can be quite a time consuming process

303
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,120
involving discussions
with multiple stakeholders

304
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,710
on the customer side.

305
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,770
And we've chosen as one of the use cases

306
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,830
that we've taken forward with agentic AI

307
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:06,060
to modernize that with
our Atos digital advisor.

308
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,060
So the idea here is that using agentic AI,

309
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,640
we connect to the customer's environment.

310
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,760
We learn a lot of information
about their environment,

311
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,680
connect to the web, learn
a lot about the customer

312
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,570
before the advisor sits down

313
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,940
with the key stakeholders
from the customer

314
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,230
for the first time.

315
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,320
So this frees up our advisors initially

316
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,320
to be able to spend more
meaningful time with customers

317
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,180
having more meaningful conversations.

318
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,470
And it's great for the customer

319
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,940
'cause they haven't gotta
sit down and explain

320
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,970
their environment to
us and spend that time,

321
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,580
the time can be better spent talking about

322
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,933
where they want to go and how
we can get there with them.

323
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,540
We can see on the screen here,

324
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,190
we've just got a couple of screenshots

325
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,260
of the digital advisory platform.

326
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,280
We look across a number of domains

327
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,750
and we assess the customer's
maturity in those domains.

328
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,670
And then that helps to have
the conversation about,

329
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,850
okay, what's the priority for you?

330
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,230
Is it security?

331
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,340
Is it sustainability?

332
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,173
That sort of thing.

333
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:15,510
And help to, you know, move
them in the right direction.

334
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,560
We then have agentic AI
powered reporting as well.

335
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,940
So it creates this maturity
assessment automatically.

336
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,180
It comes up with the
recommendations of how the customer

337
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,370
maturity can improve.

338
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,920
And then when the advisor
sits down with the customer,

339
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,360
this information's all available

340
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,453
to start that meaningful conversation.

341
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,870
As you probably expect,
given it's an AWS conference,

342
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,740
this is all powered by AWS services.

343
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,030
The front end UI that I
showed on the last screen

344
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,390
connects to Amazon API gateway,

345
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,700
which triggers a Lambda function

346
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,450
and then AWS step
functions kick in to answer

347
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,690
all of the questions
within our advisory pack.

348
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,360
They can be a range of technical questions

349
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,330
about the customer's AWS environment.

350
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,780
They can be a bunch of
non-technical questions

351
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,993
about compliance regimes
and things like that.

352
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,730
The step functions are triggering
Amazon Bedrock Agent Core.

353
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,250
So we're using the agentic AI services

354
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,090
that we're all hearing a lot
about this week within Bedrock,

355
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,697
we're storing information in Amazon S3,

356
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:32,613
we are caching information in DynamoDB.

357
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,830
The Amazon Bedrock Agent Core
supervisor agent kicks in.

358
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,870
It takes the questions
from the questionnaire

359
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,850
and it works out what to do with them.

360
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,360
If it's a question about
security and compliance,

361
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,200
for example, it defers it to an agent

362
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,060
that's doing web searching.

363
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,720
So for example, if this
was gonna do an assessment

364
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,040
for a healthcare customer here in the US

365
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,520
and the question was around
what compliance regimes

366
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,800
might that customer need to comply with

367
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,830
then the agent will go
out, learn from the web

368
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,390
that likely this customer's

369
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,550
gonna need to be HIPAA compliant.

370
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,800
If it's a question of a
more technical nature,

371
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,740
that gets delegated to another agent.

372
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,720
So for example, let's
say how does the customer

373
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,823
separate their networking?

374
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,820
That's a fairly generic question.

375
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,340
So the first thing that
happens is it goes to an agent

376
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,340
that talks via an MCP server
to the AWS documentation.

377
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,590
And that generic question about

378
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,189
how do you segregate your
networks becomes a much more

379
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:49,189
AWS specific question involving
security groups, NACLs,

380
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,180
AWS network firewall,
routing of transit gateways

381
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,230
and things like that.

382
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,830
That more detailed question
then gets passed on

383
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,100
to the next agent, which
actually does querying

384
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,950
via MCP of the customer's environment.

385
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,120
So that much more complex
question is handled

386
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,220
by the agent and the MCP server,

387
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,250
it goes off and interrogates
the customer's environment.

388
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,900
And then that information all
comes back into the reporting

389
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,813
that I talked about on the previous slide.

390
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,450
The human agent then sits
down with the customer,

391
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,620
validates that information.

392
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,400
So we've got human in the
loop to ensure accuracy

393
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,290
of the information

394
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,160
and they'll talk through
with the customer,

395
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,380
they'll discuss the relevant information,

396
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,570
check it for accuracy, et cetera.

397
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,340
And as I said before,

398
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,410
have a much more meaningful conversation

399
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,800
with customers about
how we help them to move

400
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,120
to where they want to be,

401
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,850
rather than spending all
the time talking to them

402
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,043
about where they currently are.

403
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,410
So we are over on booth 1661, we're Atos.

404
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,930
If you are interested in a conversation

405
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:11,930
about digital advisory or cloud
modernization and migration

406
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,480
or data and AI, then
please come and see us

407
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,550
and I wish you good day.

408
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,750
Have a great conference.
