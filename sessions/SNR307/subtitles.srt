1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
- Good afternoon, I think
it is good afternoon

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,150
by a few seconds.

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,430
If you're in the walkup queue,
congrats on making it in,

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,780
that was quite a line outside.

5
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,130
Note to self for next
year, need a bigger room.

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,610
My name is Jonathan Allen,

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,070
I'm an executive in residence,
Amazon Web Services.

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,150
What on earth is an
executive in residence?

9
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,020
Well, I've been with AWS over eight years.

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,370
Before that, I was actually a customer.

11
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,320
I spent eight years at Capital One bank.

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,990
My final role was as a divisional
chief technology officer

13
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,760
as Capital One moved
everything into the cloud,

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,350
I learned a lot of lessons.

15
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,390
I run in teams in cloud on that.

16
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,950
And in the last eight and a half years,

17
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,210
I and my colleague Stephen

18
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,610
who'll introduce himself
a little bit later on,

19
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,380
have spent time working

20
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,060
with over a thousand different customers.

21
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,023
And of course, in the
last year in particular,

22
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:47,550
the big conversation for us
in our executive engagements

23
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,770
has been like, what is
happening to our people?

24
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,720
'Cause as a leader, which you all are,

25
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,090
'cause you're in this room,
as the senior leaders track,

26
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,230
what is gonna happen

27
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,320
and how we are learning to
build these agentic systems

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,120
is absolutely crucial.

29
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,860
And certainly, one of my biggest learnings

30
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,220
being a CTO was it is
all about the people,

31
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,600
and where we're going on this journey.

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,649
So let's get started.

33
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:11,220
It's no surprise, of course,
for us that know the cloud

34
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,990
if cloud is peanut butter, and bless you,

35
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,170
strawberry jam is agile,

36
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,030
then of course, they go together.

37
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,940
And of course, AI is coming along to use

38
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,320
and use this powerful mechanism

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,453
to make this great sandwich, of course.

40
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,590
But there's a hell of a
lot more to it than that.

41
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,610
All of us in this room,

42
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,950
I'm sure have used large language models

43
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,000
by this point in time.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,980
And we are well aware of
the rise of the vibe coder.

45
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,020
And certainly, the biggest epiphany

46
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,140
as I work with customers
that are pre-cloud still,

47
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,700
and those customers are in the cloud,

48
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,677
the biggest realization
for those in the cloud

49
00:01:46,677 --> 00:01:49,257
is, oh my gosh, like the
large language models

50
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:51,300
instantly can generate my CloudFormation,

51
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,370
or my Terraform script,

52
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,902
or however I want to
instate my cloud setup.

53
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,100
But I need to do this

54
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,520
in obviously a very disciplined way.

55
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,770
So let's go all in into agentic,

56
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,750
let's look at building our teams.

57
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,760
And immediately sort of time out,

58
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,503
this comes with a challenge,

59
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,270
a huge challenge for us as leaders.

60
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,520
And this is a mental model challenge

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,710
because certainly all of us,

62
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,390
and especially those like myself

63
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,100
that come from regulated businesses

64
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,740
such as banks or financial
services industries,

65
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,440
today, whether we like it or not,

66
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,751
we have optimized largely
since the industrial revolution

67
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,450
if we're honest with ourselves.

68
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,620
For determinism, we want
a predictable output.

69
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,870
And while agile and cloud

70
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,810
have enabled a completely
different way of working,

71
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,760
largely, when I was running agile teams,

72
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,570
building on cloud, we're aiming
to meet a business outcome

73
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,643
or a goal in what we're doing.

74
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,710
This changes, this changes,

75
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,300
and now we've gotta deal with the fact

76
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,720
that non-determinism in
these agentic systems

77
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,790
is a feature, not a bug.

78
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,510
And the truth, when I speak
to executives like yourselves

79
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,420
and other leaders, this is
distinctly uncomfortable for us,

80
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,230
distinctly uncomfortable
as we're managing this.

81
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,150
And this is not that different

82
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,563
from managing any of our folks
that have really high agency.

83
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,820
Those folks where you
agree a goal with them,

84
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,350
maybe at the start of the year,

85
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,780
and you know they're
gonna find that right path

86
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,680
to get through it.

87
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,133
And certainly, we're used

88
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:37,133
to moving ideally away
from gates to guardrails.

89
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,910
So we put our teams together

90
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,770
and we've got this
hopefully straight road,

91
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,570
it's never a straight road as we know.

92
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,130
But there are certain quality markers

93
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,960
that we're looking to get
through these toll booths

94
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,310
is the analogy.

95
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,470
Through to these teams now,

96
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,410
where we've got agentic systems,

97
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,480
that have got memory requirements,

98
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,399
short term, long term,
context requirements.

99
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,440
This is more akin as I was kind of looking

100
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,450
for the right mental model for this.

101
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,430
It's like a river that
busts its banks continually

102
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,800
and reforms how it's gonna do that

103
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,603
is a very different shape.

104
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,400
But if we're really honest
with ourselves as leaders,

105
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,740
if we're really honest with us,

106
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,182
there's a quote here that
I think is very poignant

107
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:19,204
from one of the world's
leading advertising executives

108
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:21,690
who actually is really
good at understanding

109
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,980
how human psychology works.

110
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,470
And he says most business
is probabilistic,

111
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,570
but if everybody in
business wants to prove

112
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,860
or pretend it's deterministic,

113
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,040
so every spreadsheet is in
some way an act of pretense

114
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,450
because it is past information,

115
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,850
which he pretend has
wonderful predictive value.

116
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,097
And we have been doing that

117
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:41,373
and we do know what
high agency looks like.

118
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,653
But as I know,

119
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,160
as a CTO who was booked
from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM

120
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,480
running from crisis to fire

121
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,583
because that's just the nature of the job.

122
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,660
I am juggling a whole
lot of balls in the air

123
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,640
from legal to scale to ethics,

124
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,800
to control to security and HR.

125
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,830
Now I've gotta deal with the
emergence of agentic systems

126
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,240
and my executive team

127
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,210
who is very determined
that we're gonna get value

128
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,703
as appropriate for our business outcome.

129
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,640
So we look at the people.

130
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,560
And those of you familiar
with Professor Scott Galloway

131
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,307
may have seen this quote,

132
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:18,810
"AI won't take your job,
somebody using AI will,"

133
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,760
which sounds great.

134
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,250
And then, you read this analogy

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,950
and I sure wouldn't wanna be the horse.

136
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:38,940
So how do we take control
both of ourselves as leaders

137
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,820
and to help our folks

138
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,460
who have delivered these business outcomes

139
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,741
to be aware of this journey on agentic?

140
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:48,510
And one of the things

141
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,800
that Steve and I have been putting

142
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,816
this presentation together

143
00:05:51,816 --> 00:05:53,730
is to focus actually on what
is really going on in the world

144
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,751
and to use the research,
not just hyperbole.

145
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:02,751
And those of you may have seen
this report from MIT NANDA.

146
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,270
And this report, there's a
link on the page coming up.

147
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,089
Despite 30-40 billion in
enterprise investment into GenAI,

148
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:10,920
this reporting covers a surprising result

149
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,923
in that 95% of organizations
are getting zero return.

150
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,504
Now you can argue on sample size

151
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:20,223
and methods used to correlate that data.

152
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:26,153
We don't want to be in that
95%, we want to be in that 5%.

153
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,115
So let's look even deeper at the data.

154
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:30,300
Let's look at this report.

155
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,640
And by the way, all of reports used

156
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,466
or referenced in this
presentation are 2025.

157
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:37,470
There really is no point
in this world using data

158
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,630
that's older than that because
its relevance as we know,

159
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,190
just changes continually.

160
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,360
And this one's a really interesting one,

161
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,580
which economic tasks
are performed with AI,

162
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,680
evidence from millions
of Claude conversations.

163
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,240
I don't expect you to
read that, of course,

164
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,770
I've summarized it here

165
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,410
into visually stimulating content for you

166
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,460
that 37.2% from Anthropic

167
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,560
used for computer and mathematical tasks.

168
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,690
No great surprise for those
of us that have used it.

169
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,070
10.3, arts and media,

170
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,730
7.9, office and administration,

171
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,854
9.3, education and library,

172
00:07:05,854 --> 00:07:07,896
6.5, life, physical, social science,

173
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:09,750
5.9, business and financial.

174
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,368
Now I do not extend,

175
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:15,000
I do not expect to talk
about the next detail,

176
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,140
but I know and have been asked,

177
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,280
having already done
this a couple of times,

178
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,660
people want the next level of detail.

179
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,850
So this is up there purely for you

180
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,433
if you wanna take a picture of it.

181
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,500
So how does that translate

182
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,840
into actually what's happening
in the US jobs market

183
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,423
'cause that's where we have data.

184
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,519
So we can see here,

185
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,140
representation relative to the US economy,

186
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,150
okay, farming, fishing and forestry.

187
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,320
Yeah, not really being disrupted,

188
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,670
no great surprise there.

189
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,900
In the atomic world,

190
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,210
legal and services was lower
than I actually thought

191
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,460
when I looked at this,
and so on and so forth

192
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,170
through to computer and mathematical.

193
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,300
For our industry, if you're
coming here as a developer

194
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,867
or a leader of developers,

195
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,999
or a CIO or a CTO or even a CEO,

196
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:01,500
we have many attend re:Invent,

197
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,430
then yes, the disruption
and usage is profound.

198
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,200
Certainly for me who used
to be a hands-on coder

199
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,113
for 15 years to be able to use Kiro again

200
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,500
to get back into coding

201
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,630
without having to memorize
all the individual syntax

202
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,870
has been groundbreaking for me

203
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,460
to actually produce
business outcomes again.

204
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,003
So when we look at this, that
yes, the disruption is real.

205
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,193
And the next epiphany as I
work with customers is this.

206
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,720
Change versus run models don't
make sense in a cloud world.

207
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,770
Now the truth of the matter

208
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,290
is many people still
have a change versus run.

209
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,400
And what do I mean just for those

210
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,230
that aren't quite with this metaphor

211
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,240
means I normally have
a part of my business

212
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,490
that is for change typically
in a projects context

213
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,070
and people are there to do
that, and then I have a run.

214
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,600
And then, when something
finishes and change,

215
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,490
it moves over the fence to run.

216
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,060
Now largely, cloud has broken
that model down completely.

217
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,063
Agentic destroys the old model.

218
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,760
Why does it change it?

219
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,920
Because now we need observable systems.

220
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,440
These changes, we need to be
on top of what is going on.

221
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,760
We need to be looking

222
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,410
at the floor limits that are occurring.

223
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,790
We need to understand the trust,

224
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,650
we need the context area and engineering

225
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,060
of these agentic systems.

226
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,920
So the big mental model to think about

227
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,530
is if you're still in a change versus run,

228
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,170
it is not gonna work for
you in an agentic world.

229
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,400
Customers are now organizing

230
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,123
around business outcomes specifically.

231
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,680
So if you are really
organized like this still,

232
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,240
and I put this purely on the screen

233
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,810
for how I see people organizing themselves

234
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,850
who aren't on cloud yet.

235
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,540
And I've put into silos,
I've operated in this model.

236
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,340
What you actually see in
this model, by the way,

237
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,300
is a lot of escalation and
matrix management of resources.

238
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,900
And while it makes so much
sense for us on one level

239
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,820
to put skills into teams like this,

240
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,830
I mean I've used to be a network engineer,

241
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,540
I've done software engineering,

242
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,189
I've worked in the client server team

243
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:55,301
and I was in a siloed team before cloud.

244
00:09:55,301 --> 00:09:58,230
And after cloud that changes completely.

245
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,580
So you've really gotta challenge yourself

246
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,192
that this model will not get
you to that agentic world

247
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:05,520
because we're moving from
that world of, you know,

248
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,885
just in 24 months, 36 months,

249
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:11,370
you know, going from auto-complete
all the way to agents.

250
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,870
And we're seeing that massive acceleration

251
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,140
every seven months.

252
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,650
We're seeing at the moment
the doubling of size

253
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,863
of execution path of an agentic
system at the present time.

254
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,430
So that brings us down
around to five questions

255
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,560
that we're gonna lean
into in this presentation.

256
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,900
And we're gonna lean into the first one,

257
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,280
what tooling do I need for the teams?

258
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,040
Now this is not a tooling presentation,

259
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,450
but the two absolutely,

260
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,663
which we're seeing out there
are addressing this problem.

261
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:43,080
I don't know if you saw
the little animation

262
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,460
of the red eye on the raven by the way,

263
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,844
took a little time to do that.

264
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:49,320
Proof of concept lasted four
weeks, but you know what?

265
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,363
Hey it works on my laptop, right?

266
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:54,090
We need to like get away from that.

267
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,310
If it works on your laptop, awesome.

268
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,920
But production systems
don't run on laptops.

269
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,710
Production systems do take a team.

270
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,850
And if you're on holiday
and it doesn't work,

271
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,010
somebody needs to be around to support it.

272
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,180
And I think Kiro,

273
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,490
which you'll hear a lot about,
of course, at re:Invent,

274
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,620
and I'm not deep diving into Kiro.

275
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,063
But the epiphany for
customers I've worked with

276
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:19,260
that use this is that the drive
to spec-driven development

277
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,800
immediately gives
discipline to the execution

278
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,260
of how we're using these new systems,

279
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,380
to actually generate purposeful
outcomes on the backend,

280
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,196
aligned to business outcomes
that need reliability,

281
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:35,310
that need to understand disaster recovery,

282
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,950
that need to understand
the element of determinism

283
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,200
that we still try strive for
that we do want our system

284
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,033
to be online.

285
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,890
We do want it to meet requirements
that we've thought about.

286
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,380
So Kiro has absolutely changed the game.

287
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,213
And of course,

288
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:50,220
I'm sure you've already
heard about AgentCore.

289
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,290
So Amazon Bedrock AgentCore,

290
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,450
everything you need for
getting agents to production.

291
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,540
The big thing, the big
thing for my customers

292
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,730
is that final model on
the right hand side,

293
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,033
observability, what is going on?

294
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,670
Because of course, we're striving

295
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,290
for that determinism still,

296
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,580
of course we are, it's a human nature

297
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,990
that we want predictability,

298
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,610
but we're dealing with
a high-agency system

299
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,870
when we're building it.

300
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,520
So that observability thing

301
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,580
really coming through very clearly.

302
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,673
So cool, I've got Kiro, so
how do I structure my teams?

303
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,960
Well, before we lean into that,
again, another mental model

304
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,200
that we are moving from
builders to orchestrators.

305
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,760
This is tough,

306
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,100
I'm privileged to have
worked in IT for 30 years.

307
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,560
I started coding when I was nine years old

308
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,193
on a Commodore 64 in BASIC,
those of that did that journey.

309
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,320
I was very used to being a
builder, how to build software.

310
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,750
We are now moving to a
world with this tooling,

311
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,340
which we are orchestrators.

312
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,653
And that's a tough mental shift.

313
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,210
For our techies, that's
really tough because again,

314
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,790
that fear of replacement strives through.

315
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,450
But that Scott Galloway quote of,

316
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,660
I actually want to be in control of this.

317
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,160
It's something as leaders

318
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,950
that we've gotta in really
double down with our folks

319
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,230
to say far better to lean into this,

320
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,910
not be a victim to change,

321
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,460
but be in control of that
change by being informed.

322
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,590
And then, people ask me,

323
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,770
well, in the cloud and agile world,

324
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,630
typically I've had this mental model

325
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,830
that I've had different folks,

326
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,840
whether they're, you know, FinOps experts,

327
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,220
or software development engineers,

328
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,670
or security or data or
cloud developer DevOps,

329
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,710
or folks that are focused in UX and UI,

330
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,350
which we've seen certainly
since the rise of web apps,

331
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,120
and mobile apps.

332
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,920
And then, typically I've
got this product management,

333
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,440
maybe business analyst
coming in at the side,

334
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,076
and they're like, well,
how do I organize these?

335
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:42,120
Well, typically, no great surprise,

336
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,290
when I had teams like this,

337
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,440
I would structure them as
the business outcome needed.

338
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,600
There was no massive strict formula

339
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,100
to how many SDEs were in a team,

340
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,587
or data engineers or cloud engineers,

341
00:13:52,587 --> 00:13:55,705
it was as the business problem required.

342
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:57,360
Although, I did take the ability

343
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,460
to put security engineers
outside of the team

344
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,930
'cause there's never
enough security engineers

345
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,100
to put one in every team.

346
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,560
And typically, there are a MATRIX resource

347
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,940
where you end up with a security engineer

348
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,060
assigned to multiple
teams to do AppSec review.

349
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,621
And typically, yes, most
teams now do have a person

350
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:14,130
in a business outcome team
running cloud and agile

351
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,720
to focus on that.

352
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,723
This isn't really massively
changing for agentic.

353
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,750
So when you, you know, you
look at this as a leader going,

354
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,740
I've got all these teams,

355
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,260
how do they work on agentic systems?

356
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,950
Hey, I've got Kiro, I can
do spec-driven development.

357
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,910
Well then, you start going,

358
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,280
hey, I can just have a small team now.

359
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,080
I can just have maybe a product manager

360
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,960
who might become a product
strategist, a business analyst,

361
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,060
maybe one or two software
development engineers

362
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,530
and agentic software engineer

363
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,773
seems to become a very
emerging title for these folks.

364
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,770
And then, suddenly, you
hear things like, hold on,

365
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,660
business analysis is now an agent.

366
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,586
So actually design lead
in this small team,

367
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:54,273
hey, now I can get to a market.

368
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,733
And I'm here to say, hold
on, not quite so fast.

369
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,980
Because those of us that are used

370
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,998
to running production systems at scale,

371
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:08,280
it takes more than this to run a team.

372
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,410
And more than this for
a team to be on-call,

373
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,600
looking after agentic systems.

374
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,433
And the really thing,

375
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:15,270
the thing that when we
look at production systems,

376
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,320
it's really important

377
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,940
that we actually think about 24/7 on-call

378
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,630
for these agentic systems.

379
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,370
Now right now, I don't see anybody putting

380
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,870
in charge banking systems

381
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,800
with acid-based transactions with agentic,

382
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,580
but they're building agentic
systems around that in fraud,

383
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,703
in customer service, in mobile,

384
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,700
and there's a lot of value there.

385
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,200
But you still need to support this,

386
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,630
and that traditional on-call
structure of human gets paid,

387
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,360
human investigators, human
fixes is changing right now

388
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,857
to AI agent gets alerted,

389
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:53,857
AI investigates, proposes
maybe an RCA, heavy language,

390
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,153
and a human will then get involved.

391
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,770
I have not yet witnessed
the customers passing over

392
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,880
to fully allow that,

393
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,913
but that is surely being
challenged right now.

394
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:11,940
And we are seeing phenomenal
usage of AI on log analysis.

395
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,901
So rapidly drawing logs in

396
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:18,120
and helping the engineers
hypothesize on what is going on,

397
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,080
that's having a dramatic
impact positively on meantime

398
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,073
to problem finding.

399
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:28,260
And this is also shown from
our own usage inside Amazon,

400
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,480
this sort of dramatic
analysis improvement,

401
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,520
detecting that signal to the noise,

402
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,953
and then allowing humans
to make that decision.

403
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,460
And of course, when you transpose that

404
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,620
to maybe your P0/P1 matrix,

405
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,663
I see most customers still doing this.

406
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,380
Which then leads us to the data,

407
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,563
and this is the area
where I see real focus.

408
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,680
The data not only remains
an organizational change

409
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,561
for most customers,

410
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,127
but its importance increases exponential

411
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:03,570
in an agentic world.

412
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,819
This isn't just about having databases

413
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,310
in your operational data
store or your warehouse,

414
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,380
or your, you know, your data lake.

415
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,888
It could be PDFs and typically
is PDFs in my experience,

416
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:15,030
it's still in people's heads.

417
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,520
And the truth is, and don't
feel bad about this in any way,

418
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,630
a lot of customers still struggle

419
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,810
even to create a unified data
catalog in their business.

420
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,970
And quick bit of advice
if you're on that journey,

421
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,590
business owner, technical owner,

422
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,710
for every bit of data
you've got is required.

423
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,030
Put your data catalog back

424
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,025
to the nomenclature you use every day,

425
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:35,313
as the parlance in your
business, super, super important.

426
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,863
But data engineers are where
the real need is right now.

427
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,040
Data engineers are
becoming more important.

428
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,680
And this is almost this critical
missing layer I'm seeing.

429
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,330
And when you look at the research,

430
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,940
the North American IT
leaders report from IDC,

431
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,185
leaders reporting 55% difficulty

432
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:55,323
finding data engineer roles.

433
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,860
So you wanna look, again,
this is always true,

434
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,880
by the way, in human history

435
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,560
when any general purpose technology

436
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,800
gets to a position where we
think it's gonna displace jobs,

437
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,123
it creates more jobs.

438
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:12,611
And there's always this
painful learning curve.

439
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:14,262
But data engineers are required,

440
00:18:14,262 --> 00:18:16,140
you know, to build the pipelines

441
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,700
to manage those vector databases.

442
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,110
Yes, of course, we are looking

443
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,570
for self-managing vector
database to all S3

444
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,910
is a miracle service in my mind.

445
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,770
But someone's still gonna make sure

446
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,540
that the context of that data,

447
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,890
I was talking to a customer recently,

448
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,250
and they had 18,000
tables in their warehouse.

449
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,061
Goodness knows the actual line detail,

450
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:37,020
the column, the table
detail of all of those.

451
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,487
But somebody needs to
know what that value is

452
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:39,540
and what it relates to.

453
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,800
And by the way, typically,

454
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,870
humans have done a really
poor job of labeling those,

455
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,940
because the context of that
data change is massively.

456
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,410
So we still need humans to
work alongside these agents

457
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,690
to help understand that data.

458
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,130
And then, there's another paper,

459
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,079
which is really interesting for me.

460
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,553
Small language models are
the future of agentic AI.

461
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:03,333
Interesting, this one from Nvidia,

462
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,480
and I do see this playing out.

463
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,110
So large language models are
incredibly sophisticated,

464
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,110
we've all used them.

465
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,400
But when you're building
an agentic system,

466
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,510
actually, this tremendous
use in having a small model,

467
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,190
one of the customers I've
worked with actually built

468
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,900
a 20,000 parameter.

469
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,820
Now we're used to talking
about trillions of parameters

470
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,230
now with these large language models.

471
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,270
But a 20,000 parameter model

472
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,800
to do something reasonably
predictable for them

473
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,629
that they trained in SageMaker AI.

474
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:36,300
It was so efficient they could
run it on a CPU, not a GPU.

475
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,550
And it did what they wanted it to do.

476
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,613
And this is the rise that
we're seeing in customers.

477
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,670
So you're gonna use a combination

478
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,297
of what agents are created
appropriately for you

479
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:49,920
to solve a business outcome.

480
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,740
So actually, the real
challenge for most customers

481
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,440
is still a little locked
in legacy systems,

482
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,270
complex ETL transformations.

483
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,440
I mean when I'm speaking to most

484
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,570
of the really big FSI institutions,

485
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,753
they have ETLs or extract,
transform and load jobs

486
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:05,070
in the hundreds of thousands,

487
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,560
and typically, whatever
product they're using

488
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,879
to release their ETLs,

489
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:12,630
that team is normally a
bottleneck team in their mind.

490
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,850
So actually, when you look at
agentic and what's going on,

491
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,640
this focus on data is
still very legitimate.

492
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,470
Again, a lot of the data is still stored

493
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,502
in incompatible formats,
subject to data governance,

494
00:20:22,502 --> 00:20:24,875
spoiler alert, we don't like sharing data

495
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,373
by the way, very easily.

496
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,300
Like, heaven forbid,
somebody gets to my data

497
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,473
and find something useful in my data

498
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:33,090
that I didn't know about.

499
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,077
So again, we've gotta deal
with that in organizations

500
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:38,707
of how do we get over
that, how do we set up,

501
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:42,630
and yes, a lot of the
principles in data mesh,

502
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,080
huge fan of the approach

503
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,810
from the author who originally
came out of Thoughtworks

504
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,643
and proposed that,

505
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:51,360
because a lot of it doesn't
care about the technology,

506
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,757
it cares on the human
nature of sharing that data,

507
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:55,950
but still understanding the
governance of that data.

508
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,620
And of course, we don't
wanna create duplicate copies

509
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,180
of that data, it needs quality monitoring,

510
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,790
and this is where the
challenge still rise.

511
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,580
So a lot of times when
people are putting together

512
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,060
these production agentic
systems, data scientists,

513
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,160
understanding how do I create that small,

514
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,076
if necessary, 20,000 model

515
00:21:13,076 --> 00:21:15,810
to solve a task might just be a calculator

516
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,630
that you want that does
a particular calculation

517
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,130
that you want to be done
over and over and over

518
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,590
without invoking a really
large LLM each time.

519
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,120
'Cause of course, that's
a hell of a lot cheaper

520
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,220
for you to invoke that.

521
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,250
You know, millions of
times than a large LLM,

522
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,960
data engineers have always mentioned,

523
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,310
getting that data from A to B,

524
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,170
breaking down those human silos,

525
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,730
understanding how we release it,

526
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,040
absolutely required data analysts,

527
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,280
a lot of people say data
analysts have gone away.

528
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,360
Not really, because context,

529
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,760
and the rise of context engineering,

530
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,320
super important in agentic
systems, super important.

531
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,810
And again, while LLMs
can help us with this,

532
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,000
we need the humans to truly understand

533
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,650
who owns that data,
what's going on with it,

534
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,470
these 18,000 systems, 18,000 tables,

535
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,223
and again, a lot of customers
are still struggling with ETL.

536
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,580
So when you think about building a system

537
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,750
to solve that business outcome,

538
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:14,423
data remains crucial, crucial.

539
00:22:14,423 --> 00:22:17,070
And that's why, for now for
a number of years at Amazon,

540
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,930
we've been focusing and investing heavily

541
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:23,670
on this zero-ETL approach
that's helping you get away

542
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,456
from the ETL longest poll in the tent,

543
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:26,980
a customer used it for me the other day,

544
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,460
which I thought was very poignant,
longest poll in the tent,

545
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,750
'cause it's always the slowest thing.

546
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,920
It doesn't matter how much resource

547
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,630
that they seem to put at it.

548
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,458
So moving away and getting away

549
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,740
and simplifying that cost and resources

550
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,577
and near real-time insights,
super, super important.

551
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:42,913
So let's look

552
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:45,863
and this next slide comes with
a health warning by the way.

553
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,330
It comes with a health warning

554
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,166
because it entirely depends
on the business outcome.

555
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,967
But what I do see

556
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:55,710
and Stephen and I have
looked at this quite closely,

557
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,800
is yeah, so we do see teams

558
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,350
that are building agentic systems

559
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,409
and supporting multiple agent systems here

560
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:07,200
are putting together teams
that have a product manager,

561
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,440
a business analyst, software
developers, data engineers,

562
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,450
data scientists as required.

563
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,070
And typically, in an Amazon,

564
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,010
we will normally have a
principal software engineer.

565
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,501
So in Amazon we call these P engineers.

566
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:22,560
We don't have architects
inside of Amazon by the way.

567
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,330
We have solution architects,

568
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,060
which handle your interactions

569
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,890
as an Amazon Web Services customer.

570
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,130
But inside of Amazon, we
actually have P-level engineers,

571
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,450
which is a very senior role,

572
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,640
and each team has a P-level engineer,

573
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,532
and it's their job to basically
ensure that the goals,

574
00:23:39,532 --> 00:23:43,200
technical goals of that
team are being met.

575
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,300
And they also have a
lot of responsibilities

576
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,320
over making sure

577
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,970
that new software development engineers

578
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,910
coming into the team can shift
code and override problem.

579
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,110
And when we have a problem

580
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,930
that requires multiple teams to interact,

581
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,670
you know, we actually get
a bunch of Ps together

582
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,200
and they'll solve that problem.

583
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,183
Now not everyone has that model,

584
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,906
so it's far very far
more familiar to people

585
00:24:02,906 --> 00:24:04,500
to have something like this

586
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,740
where at the end, you've
got an architect doing that.

587
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,502
And these job titles by the
way are incredibly fungible

588
00:24:09,502 --> 00:24:12,153
at the moment, incredibly fungible.

589
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,140
And of course, multiple agents

590
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,350
are helping this team do their job.

591
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,250
They're going to build an
already building agents to help.

592
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,350
Now typically, I've talked
about the delivery team.

593
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,620
When you are touching
an established process

594
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,020
and bringing some agentic side on there,

595
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,971
you'll absolutely have a
sister or a brother team

596
00:24:39,971 --> 00:24:41,280
coming alongside that,

597
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,520
that says, well, what's my
business process experts?

598
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,530
And if you're touching
a really complex flow,

599
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,400
that's gonna occur,

600
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,470
you're gonna have
business process experts.

601
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,660
You're gonna have, again, an architect.

602
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,430
You typically, I'm seeing every customer

603
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,530
put a legal representative in there,

604
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,350
a financial analyst, a data owner,

605
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,700
and again, a software development lead

606
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,830
who's an interfacingq
leading that technical side

607
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,330
that I talked about in the previous slide.

608
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,070
So it's almost like a two in the box model

609
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,420
for building these agentic systems

610
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,890
is what's coming to the fore.

611
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,612
This model in particular took
on an established product.

612
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:12,853
My colleague Stephen's gonna
talk to you in about Amazon,

613
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:14,790
about how we think about different stages

614
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,623
of product development

615
00:25:15,623 --> 00:25:17,880
and how we put different teams together.

616
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,020
And yes, these teams are
gonna use different agents

617
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,310
or create their own agents,
absolutely, absolutely.

618
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,538
We're seeing that occur immediately

619
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:29,940
because they're using agents

620
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,130
and realizing they can
build these small agents

621
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,844
in SageMaker AI to solve things for them

622
00:25:34,844 --> 00:25:37,088
to reduce their cognitive burden,

623
00:25:37,088 --> 00:25:40,923
so that they can focus
on what really matters.

624
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,130
Because the world is
really changing quickly,

625
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,900
I mean this was a venn diagram

626
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,070
I looked at a little while ago

627
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,750
with the congruence
between software engineer,

628
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,170
data engineer, data
scientist and data analyst.

629
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,480
And that sort of middle bit
of the venn diagram there,

630
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
that blue where it
talks about SQL, Python,

631
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,333
Cloud services, NoSQL,

632
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,794
I think a lot of us are seeing

633
00:25:59,794 --> 00:26:03,060
where that becomes the top of the T-shape

634
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,830
if you look at how you skill yourself,

635
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,163
that bar of cross-functional knowledge.

636
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,880
And this is actually coming to the fore

637
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,940
in context engineering.

638
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,600
So I need to understand the
context of the agentic system.

639
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,040
And if you're at the presentation before

640
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,672
where Johnny talked about a
leader's guide to agentic AI,

641
00:26:22,672 --> 00:26:24,570
he talked about this in more detail.

642
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,620
If you missed that presentation,

643
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,510
it'll be online hopefully in
the next 48 hours on YouTube,

644
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,063
you can look at that.

645
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:32,400
He talks a lot more
about context engineering

646
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,998
and we absolutely see that
role emerging right now.

647
00:26:35,998 --> 00:26:39,603
These systems have gotta
understand that linkage for data.

648
00:26:39,603 --> 00:26:44,490
So again, data is is becoming
that critical, critical pole.

649
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,430
And actually, what we do
see is a role emerging.

650
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,270
And it's interesting, I was looking

651
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,950
at how Thoughtworks think about this.

652
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,170
This is Martin Fowler,
he's one of my heroes.

653
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,339
He came up with a strangler pattern

654
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:56,499
for deconstructing monoliths.

655
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:59,324
And he talks about it like this,

656
00:26:59,324 --> 00:27:01,713
as computer systems
get more sophisticated,

657
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:04,380
we've seen a growing trend
to value deep specialties,

658
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,270
but we've found that our
most effective colleagues

659
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,460
have a skill in spanning many specialties

660
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,500
where they're starting to
explicitly recognize this

661
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,113
as a first-class skill
of expert generalist.

662
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,830
And that is emerging, particularly
for context engineering.

663
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,470
You need to understand what
is going on at the system.

664
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,420
And if you want to go and
look more at Martin's work,

665
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,270
which I fundamentally always
read when Martin has a blog,

666
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,150
he talks about these expert
generalists emerging.

667
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,890
And I think this for context engineering

668
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,450
and agentic systems again,

669
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,323
another emerging role, prompt engineering,

670
00:27:32,323 --> 00:27:33,714
I don't think any of us ever thought

671
00:27:33,714 --> 00:27:35,040
that was gonna be a role.

672
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,633
Context engineering
absolutely is, absolutely is.

673
00:27:43,242 --> 00:27:46,983
And with that, I will hand
over to my colleague Stephen.

674
00:27:48,443 --> 00:27:51,610
(audience applauding)

675
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,408
- Thanks Jonathan, so
I'm Stephen Brozovich.

676
00:27:58,408 --> 00:28:00,890
I joined Amazon in August of 1999,

677
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,490
so that was a little while ago.

678
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,750
The world has changed a ton since then.

679
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,130
We've spent a little bit of time now

680
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,870
thinking about how agentic AI

681
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,640
is gonna be impacting both the work

682
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,990
and the roles in our teams.

683
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,330
And you might be sitting
here as a leader going,

684
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,920
but what does that mean for me?

685
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,120
How about my role?

686
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,100
How is that impacted by this work?

687
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,997
And so I wanna frame the
question a little more clearly.

688
00:28:22,997 --> 00:28:25,680
As leaders, right, we
all know we're trying

689
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,030
to generate value,

690
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,060
and we have a limited
amount of time, attention,

691
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,170
budget and talent

692
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,763
that we can allocate
towards the work, right?

693
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:36,902
In his book, "The Day After Tomorrow,"

694
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:39,239
Peter Hinssen talks about
different categories

695
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:41,729
of work we can be thinking
of, the work of today,

696
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:44,130
which actually leads to current value.

697
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,840
Then there's the work of tomorrow,

698
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,460
which is gonna lead to
value in the future.

699
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,190
And then, there's the day
after tomorrow, right?

700
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,450
What's that thing that we're doing

701
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,350
that contributes long-term
value to the organization?

702
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,420
And as leaders, we know we're all supposed

703
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,356
to be thinking about these and
prioritizing appropriately.

704
00:28:59,356 --> 00:29:00,976
We gotta focus some on today,

705
00:29:00,976 --> 00:29:03,960
but gotta make sure we take
care of the day after tomorrow.

706
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,960
Now reality is, today tends to
insert itself uncomfortably.

707
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,550
It's that pile of emails we wake up to

708
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,140
that we weren't necessarily expecting

709
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,460
or that next meeting.

710
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,960
Today tends to dominate.

711
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,020
Now we know we're
supposed to carve out time

712
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,980
for tomorrow, right?

713
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,510
So we take additional time to figure out

714
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,370
how do we write that three-year plan

715
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,489
or work on next year's budget.

716
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:27,450
And we still intend to think about,

717
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,180
but and we know we spend
far too little time

718
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,705
actually doing those activities
of the day after tomorrow.

719
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,800
That's when we're looking
at that new technology

720
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,560
or a shift in our business
that could actually set us up

721
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,800
for an entirely different
direction in the long term.

722
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,020
And that's not even taking into account

723
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,393
the stuff of yesterday.

724
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,957
That's a kind way to put it.

725
00:29:47,957 --> 00:29:52,890
But this is that shortcut
we took three years ago

726
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,248
and the tech debt is
rearing its ugly head today

727
00:29:55,248 --> 00:29:58,080
and is demanding to be paid.

728
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,064
Reality is all the time we
intend to spend on tomorrow

729
00:30:02,064 --> 00:30:06,150
and the day after tomorrow
often gets consumed

730
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,940
by the stuff of today.

731
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,200
Are we getting depressed yet?

732
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,880
Let me make it even more clear.

733
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,280
We still have to remember
all this stuff too

734
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,560
on top of the work that we're doing.

735
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,256
And at this point, we might
be feeling a little bit like,

736
00:30:19,256 --> 00:30:21,750
we're the only ones not
enjoying the party, right?

737
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,314
All the glossy ads make you
think that every business

738
00:30:24,314 --> 00:30:26,553
in the world has this figured out but you.

739
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,386
The reality is, most businesses

740
00:30:31,386 --> 00:30:35,070
are figuring this out themselves,

741
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,870
but the clock is ticking.

742
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,044
Now good news is that
there are some patterns

743
00:30:40,044 --> 00:30:42,780
that we are seeing your peers use

744
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,106
that are helping navigate these changes.

745
00:30:45,106 --> 00:30:47,652
If you were in Ishit Vachhrajani's
session a little bit ago,

746
00:30:47,652 --> 00:30:49,680
this will look a little bit familiar.

747
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,810
Here, four mental model shifts

748
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,944
that we see is key for organizations

749
00:30:53,944 --> 00:30:56,730
that are successfully
managing these changes.

750
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,930
Now as Jonathan mentioned,

751
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,540
most of our organizations
are set up to deal

752
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,670
with a deterministic world.

753
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,410
And in that sense, it makes sense for us

754
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,870
to have this culture of
operational execution.

755
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,630
How do I do the job extremely well, right?

756
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,360
Avoid deviation from known good processes,

757
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,870
being focused on measurement
and individual optimization.

758
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,230
But leaders that are successfully
navigating agentic AI

759
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,610
actually see themselves

760
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:24,180
and their organizations
more like research labs,

761
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,550
this attitude of
continuous learning, right?

762
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,420
As continuous learners,

763
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,600
our focus needs to be on
shared experimentation,

764
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,540
embracing adaptation and
providing psychological safety,

765
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,060
so that we can learn from failures.

766
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,400
This mental model shift in particular,

767
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,340
requires us to look at
other areas of leadership

768
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,633
when we need to adapt.

769
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,720
The first of those, Jonathan
already made a nod to,

770
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,230
which is in a deterministic
world that makes sense for us

771
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,001
to govern through gates, right?

772
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:54,810
We can define the process,
we can control each action,

773
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,880
check for compliance
through checklists, right?

774
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,320
And audit for deviation.

775
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,160
But agentic AI is making
us confront reality.

776
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,202
Since we live in a probabilistic world,

777
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:06,894
we should probably be
spending less time defining

778
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:08,702
and refining the process,

779
00:32:08,702 --> 00:32:11,790
and more time providing
strategic direction,

780
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,760
defining guardrails and
creating feedback loops

781
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,459
that allow for rapid experimentation

782
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:18,153
and continuous calibration.

783
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,231
When we live in a deterministic world,

784
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,780
it makes sense to manage the
business like a factory floor

785
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,361
because we can set finite limits

786
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,190
and measure and calculate
against those limits.

787
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,141
But successful organizations in this space

788
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:34,020
are operating more like trading floors.

789
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,590
How do I provide enough
autonomy to the teams?

790
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,770
But I need to have
real-time risk visibility

791
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,050
and I even need to have
adaptive circuit breakers

792
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,650
that can respond quickly
to emerging risk patterns.

793
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,320
And then, finally, it makes sense

794
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,180
to organize in functional silos

795
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,650
when we live in a deterministic world,

796
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,870
when we have a known set of problems

797
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,280
and a known set of solutions

798
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,930
that we can deploy against those problems

799
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,610
because those functional silos

800
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,230
allow us to be incredibly efficient

801
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,191
at doing the same thing
again and again and again.

802
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:08,891
But when there's rapid change,
that rigid org structure,

803
00:33:08,891 --> 00:33:11,250
those sequential handoffs,

804
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,960
and the isolation of data systems

805
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,400
that Jonathan talked about,

806
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,829
sometimes make change
feel like it's impossible.

807
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,315
Organizations that are successfully
navigating these changes

808
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:24,033
actually respond much more
like an immune system.

809
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:29,940
They swarm and reshape based
off of changing customer needs

810
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,460
and challenges driven
by business objectives

811
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,760
and customer outcomes, not hierarchies.

812
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,587
Now if you'd like to dive
into this topic a little more,

813
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:40,054
there will be a recording
of Ishit's presentation,

814
00:33:40,054 --> 00:33:43,751
but we also have a link to
a blog that Ishit authored

815
00:33:43,751 --> 00:33:46,230
that dives into these mental model shifts

816
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,430
more significantly.

817
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,707
It's one of just many
topics that the executive

818
00:33:49,707 --> 00:33:52,170
and residence team produces every year

819
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,700
of the challenges and patterns

820
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,350
that we are seeing as we
talk with our own customers.

821
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,591
But what I wanna do now
is shift as we talk to,

822
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:02,340
you know, in our team,

823
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,510
we talk to over 1500 different
organizations annually,

824
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,040
we're talking at that C-level change,

825
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,560
and we see that the patterns
and the questions that we get,

826
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,398
and we often hear from
our customers like, okay,

827
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:13,830
that's an interesting story,

828
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,870
but what's Amazon actually doing?

829
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,595
And in this case, this is a
very rapidly emerging question,

830
00:34:18,595 --> 00:34:22,500
like how is Amazon thinking
about org structure

831
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,450
in an agentic world?

832
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,297
Like many of you, this
technology is challenging some

833
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:30,990
of our basic assumptions
about how we should organize

834
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,580
and get work done.

835
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,494
And with over 1.5 million employees,

836
00:34:34,494 --> 00:34:37,293
that question is not optional.

837
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,950
We have a team of
organizational scientists

838
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,410
that are helping us
understand which patterns

839
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:47,613
are helping us, which
are hindering us and why.

840
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:51,331
Now the answers are shifting,
we are still learning,

841
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:53,696
but I'm excited to share
with you some of the insights

842
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:55,200
that we've gained

843
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,510
from this work inside
our own organization.

844
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,990
The first insight shouldn't
be too surprising.

845
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,241
Organizations that align
their operating model

846
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:05,790
with their business lifecycle phase

847
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,160
outperform those that do not.

848
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,480
Now some of you are probably starting

849
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,710
to break out into hives,

850
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,870
please not another conversation

851
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,450
about centralization and decentralization.

852
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,563
Look, we all know there are
some benefits to centralization

853
00:35:19,563 --> 00:35:22,140
and others you gain from decentralizing

854
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,360
and granting team autonomy.

855
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,353
But what we've found is that
this model is too simplistic

856
00:35:27,353 --> 00:35:30,030
and it often leads us swinging

857
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,880
from one end of the pendulum to the other.

858
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,266
What we actually need is an
organizational design model

859
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:39,240
that is adaptive to
ever-changing environments.

860
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,450
In addition to that, our
businesses are too complex

861
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,930
to be served by any
one-size-fits-all model.

862
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,100
So the emerging thinking

863
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,070
is that our organizations

864
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,403
need to be optimized around
three distinct tensions.

865
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,370
The first is speed.

866
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,790
As Andy Jassy has said, speed is a choice.

867
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,610
How much should you be
optimizing for consistency,

868
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,610
and when should your
primary objective be agility

869
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,843
and iterative change?

870
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,560
The second tension is resourcing.

871
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,360
When should you be
thinking about optimizing

872
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,220
for scale and efficiency

873
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,650
through shared centralized
resources and tools?

874
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,900
And when should your focus be on providing

875
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,783
dedicated resources for
business specific outcomes?

876
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,460
And the third tension is connections.

877
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,720
When should you be building

878
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,760
deliberately interconnected systems

879
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,220
for coordinating complex workflows?

880
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,570
And when should you be striving

881
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,170
to create more and more
autonomous activity?

882
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,230
Let's dive into each one of
these in a little more detail.

883
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:47,910
First, your customers
require different speed

884
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:52,200
versus reliability
depending on their context.

885
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,261
And so we find that organizations
that focus on consistency,

886
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:58,500
they gain speed through
systematic execution

887
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,820
and standard processes

888
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,820
that deliver reliable,
repeatable outcomes.

889
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,885
In contrast, agile organizations

890
00:37:04,885 --> 00:37:08,460
position critical activities
close to customers,

891
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,043
enabling rapid feedback and iteration.

892
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,030
When it comes to resourcing,

893
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,730
your customers actually vary in their need

894
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,760
for specialized attention
or standardized solutions.

895
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,320
And so as we think about this,

896
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,392
teams want to drive efficiency
by centralizing delivery

897
00:37:25,392 --> 00:37:27,360
and building common infrastructure

898
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,030
that scale solution across multiple needs.

899
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,760
Whereas in other situations,
we need those dedicated teams

900
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,110
to focus on core capabilities
with deep customer context,

901
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:40,563
delivering specialized
solutions for specific needs.

902
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,586
And finally, on connections,
because guess what,

903
00:37:43,586 --> 00:37:46,260
your customers are actually the
ones who should be dictating

904
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,470
that balance between autonomous innovation

905
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,733
and integrated delivery.

906
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,751
Interdependent operations
optimize for end-to-end outcomes

907
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:58,650
through coordinated planning
and shared standards.

908
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,054
Whereas independent
teams maximize autonomy

909
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:05,040
by ring fencing work into logical units,

910
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,600
enabling direct customer signals

911
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,000
and modular decision making.

912
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:14,090
Now where you sit, the optimal
balance on each of these

913
00:38:14,956 --> 00:38:18,420
actually varies based on business context,

914
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,450
customer needs and
organizational maturity.

915
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,150
These tensions aren't mutually exclusive.

916
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,670
Successful organizations
are thoughtfully positioning

917
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,284
different parts of their business

918
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:32,220
along each spectrum based
off of their requirements.

919
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,220
The key is not to choose
one end of the spectrum,

920
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,040
but to position different
parts of your organization

921
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,910
according to your specific
needs and regularly reassessing.

922
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:44,379
We see this pattern at play across most

923
00:38:44,379 --> 00:38:45,930
of Amazon's businesses,

924
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:49,290
depending on the maturity
of that individual business.

925
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:52,080
Younger businesses often
skew towards depth,

926
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,963
they're favoring agility,
custom functionality,

927
00:38:56,076 --> 00:38:58,590
but as the businesses mature,

928
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:01,560
they tend to skew towards breadth.

929
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,802
Because consistency, economies of scale

930
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:07,173
and cohesive user experience
become ever more important.

931
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,590
So let's follow that evolution.

932
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,530
As we're starting out,

933
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,820
we're gonna skew heavily
towards depth over breadth.

934
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,170
'Cause early adopters are the ones

935
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,760
that are using this new product

936
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,380
and they are seeking innovation,

937
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,450
and they will accept some
amount of imperfections.

938
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:27,180
So we're maximizing speed and flexibility

939
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,543
through small, dedicated teams
with direct customer access.

940
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:36,300
The breadth depth mix starts
to shift as the business grows.

941
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,940
Early majority customers now
join those early adopters,

942
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,400
but they bring higher
quality expectations,

943
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,560
while tolerating some iteration.

944
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,450
And so now we start to see the emergence

945
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,080
of hybrid structures of
dedicated and shared teams

946
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,900
because we need those shared
teams to support scaling,

947
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,970
and we still need those dedicated teams

948
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,643
for rapid iteration and adjustments.

949
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,670
As the business matures now,

950
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,670
mainstream customers start to
jump and they become dominant.

951
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,600
And so they're requiring
consistent, reliable experiences,

952
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,070
high quality customer support,

953
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,740
and structured feature request processes.

954
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,960
We shift our operating model

955
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,390
to balance established
processes with innovation

956
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,690
through horizontal platform
teams for core infrastructure

957
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,603
and federated product teams
for customer facing features.

958
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,380
As a fully business-

959
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,870
sorry, when the business fully matures,

960
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,790
late majority customers dominate,

961
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,350
requiring proven solutions

962
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,990
with comprehensive support,
predictable experiences,

963
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:37,380
and consistent quality
across all interactions.

964
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,020
At this point, our
emphasis is optimization

965
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,030
and efficiency through shared services,

966
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,830
automated solutions and support systems

967
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,333
and self-service platforms.

968
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,640
Now this is actually where
most organizations stop.

969
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,350
They stay at phase four, right?

970
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,030
Refining and squeezing efficiency

971
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,860
out of every single process.

972
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,773
But this is also where they
are the most vulnerable,

973
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,070
because that execution excellence

974
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,050
actually becomes the very
thing that prevents them

975
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,530
from adapting when
business climates change

976
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,510
or that new startup shows up on the screen

977
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,553
to disrupt their business model.

978
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,090
And so at Amazon we understand,

979
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,193
we like the phrase we say at
Amazon, it's always day one.

980
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,807
The need for that startup like flexibility

981
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:24,300
is important in phase one initiatives

982
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,280
like the NFL on Prime,

983
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,170
but it's equally if not more important

984
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,770
for well-established
businesses like home delivery.

985
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,750
And so we have to constantly challenge

986
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,410
our own recipes for success

987
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,000
because customer's needs are not static.

988
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,920
We need to shift our mix yet again

989
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,080
to inject fresh innovation.

990
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,160
In phase five, we now have a
mix of both loyal customers

991
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,677
and customers seeking new experiences.

992
00:41:48,677 --> 00:41:51,360
And so we need different
value propositions for risk

993
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,490
for each of those
customers and the balance

994
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,610
between familiar and
innovative experiences.

995
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:00,000
We want to enable transformation
while maintaining stability

996
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,220
through sophisticated
dual operating models

997
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,509
and hybrid team structures.

998
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:06,463
We find that organizations

999
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,000
that are following an adaptive model

1000
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,070
are far better positioned

1001
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,850
to react when technologies
like agentic AI emerge.

1002
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,760
In fact, I'd argue it's that
organizational flexibility

1003
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,560
that has enabled Amazon

1004
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,440
to weather all the changes
in customer needs and demands

1005
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,240
all the way from our very beginning.

1006
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:29,910
Rigid one size fits all
approaches just don't work.

1007
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,030
The second key insight we've
gained is that organizations

1008
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,491
that asymmetrically
allocate human AI resources

1009
00:42:36,491 --> 00:42:40,980
based on the type of work
outperform those that do not.

1010
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,150
Like organizational models,

1011
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,730
it turns out there is no
one size fits all approach

1012
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,200
to agentic.

1013
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,000
So let's look at resource allocation

1014
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,680
across four types of work.

1015
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,360
The first type of work we call strategic

1016
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,830
differentiated work, right?

1017
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,550
This is the work that
customers view as uniquely you.

1018
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,230
It creates competitive advantage,

1019
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,970
it defines customer experience

1020
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,133
and directly enables key goals.

1021
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,750
The next type of work we look
at is strategic enabling work.

1022
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,770
These are the capabilities

1023
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,900
that power your differentiation.

1024
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,220
They support competitive work

1025
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,620
and reinforce organizational culture

1026
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,900
to achieve business outcomes.

1027
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,750
The third category we would
call business essential.

1028
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,310
This is the kind of work that's required

1029
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,365
for basic operations
and near term success,

1030
00:43:22,365 --> 00:43:25,530
but it usually isn't tied
directly to market value.

1031
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,260
In fact, most of this work is
the keep the lights on work

1032
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,960
that you just have to do
to maintain market parity.

1033
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,640
And finally, we would
call another category

1034
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,160
of work business compliant work.

1035
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,630
This is the work that's required, right?

1036
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,310
For legal or regulatory compliance.

1037
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,260
There's usually little
to no market return,

1038
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,843
but it's essential for
keeping ourselves afloat.

1039
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,710
So if we think about these
four work categories,

1040
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,020
let's look at how Amazon

1041
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,050
is currently allocating
human and AI resources

1042
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:54,900
against these different
categories of work.

1043
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,980
Who's involved in this?

1044
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,680
Well, first, it's you, right?

1045
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,353
As strategic leaders, it's
our responsibility to provide

1046
00:44:01,353 --> 00:44:03,990
that vision, that insight, the conviction

1047
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,390
and the judgment to define
the business outcomes

1048
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,010
and guide the work.

1049
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,377
The next group involved in
this is AI and agentic work.

1050
00:44:11,377 --> 00:44:15,150
It's a combination of AI
agents and traditional AI

1051
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,578
used to solve complex challenges

1052
00:44:16,578 --> 00:44:19,470
and sift through
mountains of probabilities

1053
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:21,060
to drive results.

1054
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,090
The tactical execution team is the humans.

1055
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,620
All those roles that Jonathan

1056
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,220
talked about earlier in the day.

1057
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,840
Those humans are the ones
that are creating the agents

1058
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,570
and processes needed to
achieve the business outcomes.

1059
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,240
And then let's not forget,
there are significant portions

1060
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,130
of our businesses still today

1061
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,290
that can be made far more efficient

1062
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,120
through simple automation

1063
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,970
or by leveraging utility
solutions like managed services

1064
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,650
from AWS and other partners

1065
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,110
without reaching for
more expensive options

1066
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,103
like generative AI.

1067
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,580
So let's look at how we allocate these

1068
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,430
into those different work categories.

1069
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,670
Strategic differentiated
work is really the only place

1070
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:02,580
where executive leadership is critical.

1071
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,770
We have to set strategic direction,

1072
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:07,650
define our own customer
facing competitive advantage,

1073
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,510
and make high judgment decisions

1074
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,313
on product design and innovation.

1075
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,660
AI and agentic systems carry
about 25% of the workload.

1076
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,920
We're leveraging machine learning

1077
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,560
for things like advanced
targeting algorithms,

1078
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,350
and we're using AI agents
for predictive analytics

1079
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:23,730
and customer behavior modeling

1080
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:26,280
to ensure competitive outcomes.

1081
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,260
The rest of the work is
going to be carried out

1082
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,101
by that tactical execution team, right?

1083
00:45:30,101 --> 00:45:32,040
They're the ones dealing with ambiguity,

1084
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,485
solving those complex challenges

1085
00:45:33,485 --> 00:45:36,150
and executing strategic initiatives.

1086
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,940
Notice here, automation and outsourcing

1087
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,280
are next to non-existent

1088
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,680
because there's no known
solutions yet to automate,

1089
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,740
and we would never want to
outsource our differentiator.

1090
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,770
As we move into strategic enabling work,

1091
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,600
the leadership team can take a back seat.

1092
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,663
Our role changes to one more
of auditing and advising.

1093
00:45:54,663 --> 00:45:57,000
Now is when we can start
to look at the things

1094
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,400
of tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,

1095
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,020
because we've set those guardrails

1096
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,023
that empower our teams to go and build.

1097
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,890
AI systems take on a greater
percentage of the work.

1098
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,170
They're tackling things
like insight generation,

1099
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,200
anomaly detection, and
process optimization.

1100
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,450
On the human side,
technical program managers

1101
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,040
and solution architects take the lead

1102
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,780
for technical implementation

1103
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,060
and for cross function coordination.

1104
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,180
Now we start to see the
beginnings of automation

1105
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,890
and the use of utility solutions

1106
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,080
for things like routine
coordination of activities

1107
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,643
and basic workflow management.

1108
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,385
When we look at business essential work,

1109
00:46:33,385 --> 00:46:36,360
agentic systems are used
for routine analysis,

1110
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,240
standard reporting and
basic process optimization.

1111
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,340
Now the humans look more
like operation teams,

1112
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,620
account managers and business
intelligence analysts

1113
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,530
providing operational
oversight, exception handling

1114
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,480
and process improvement.

1115
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,580
Agents and people are the ones now

1116
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,730
that are co-creating
these rule-based workflows

1117
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,320
as problem become better understood

1118
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,290
and turn those into automation.

1119
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,660
And then finally, as we
look at business compliance,

1120
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,900
we even skew away from agentic

1121
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,980
to even more automation

1122
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,130
as we're now looking for
deterministic execution

1123
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:10,290
against well understood problems.

1124
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,085
Here, the human
contribution is that context

1125
00:47:13,085 --> 00:47:15,000
that Jonathan was talking about.

1126
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,550
It's that dedicated expert
knowledge that's needed

1127
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,290
for those human in the loop decisions.

1128
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:22,027
And those situations where
rapidly evolving regulatory

1129
00:47:22,027 --> 00:47:24,900
and compliance frameworks can be digested

1130
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,383
and understood in the
context of the business.

1131
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:30,990
Taken as a whole.

1132
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:33,174
This asymmetric approach
allows us to deploy

1133
00:47:33,174 --> 00:47:37,530
the right kinds of resources
to the right problems.

1134
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,960
Like most approaches, it's not perfect,

1135
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,600
but it's proving to be highly adaptable

1136
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,673
a way to leverage this new technology.

1137
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,550
And so our question for
you, how are you thinking

1138
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:53,340
about team structure in agentic world?

1139
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,530
Hopefully these ideas will
give you some new perspectives

1140
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,750
as you apply them to your own space.

1141
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,840
For another view on the
impact of agents on the work,

1142
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,570
I'm excited to welcome to
the stage Richard Davis,

1143
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,013
CTO of Danske Bank.

1144
00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:09,568
(audience applauding)

1145
00:48:11,515 --> 00:48:12,397
- Thank you.

1146
00:48:12,397 --> 00:48:14,220
Thank you very much.

1147
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,190
I actually forgot I was coming up here.

1148
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,775
I was so engrossed in the presentation.

1149
00:48:17,775 --> 00:48:19,311
So, excuse me.

1150
00:48:19,311 --> 00:48:21,540
So I'm Richard Davis, as I said,

1151
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,040
I'm the CTO at Danske Bank

1152
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,810
and we're based in Copenhagen.

1153
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:27,780
And Jonathan mentioned earlier

1154
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,338
about 95% of organizations

1155
00:48:29,338 --> 00:48:31,740
not seeing value from GenAI yet.

1156
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,300
And we actually think we are part

1157
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,950
of the latter part of that equation

1158
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:39,000
that are seeing the 5%
of real value from GenAI.

1159
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,430
And today, I'm gonna
just touch upon our story

1160
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:42,690
and some of the challenges we see

1161
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,730
both from a technology perspective

1162
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,320
and a human perspective.

1163
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,910
But before I go into a bit more detail,

1164
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,170
I'll just give you some background

1165
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:51,390
of where we are at Danske Bank.

1166
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,542
So we are a bank in the Copenhagen

1167
00:48:55,542 --> 00:48:58,620
and we have a rich 150-year history.

1168
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,270
And we've been running
infrastructure on-prem

1169
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,647
for many, many years.

1170
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,690
And to date, it's given
us a lot of the value

1171
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,060
that we've seen through
our banking systems.

1172
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,991
But of course, as we
wanna become more agile,

1173
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:10,740
we've introduced the public cloud

1174
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,180
and we've gone from public,

1175
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,650
from on-prem, sorry,

1176
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,420
to the public cloud

1177
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,660
and we've now migrated 850 applications

1178
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,060
into AWS for the last 18 months.

1179
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,250
But it's really been
around about mindset change

1180
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,200
rather than just the technical change.

1181
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,220
But also on top of that,

1182
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,460
it's given us a great opportunity
when it comes to GenAI.

1183
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,620
It's really given us the infrastructure

1184
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,833
for us to adapt and deliver

1185
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:34,511
really, really quick solutions

1186
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:36,663
as well as things such as sandboxes.

1187
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:40,860
So we say to ourselves
that we are catching up,

1188
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,930
from catching up to winning a Danske Bank.

1189
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:45,240
And it really is cloud
being our foundation

1190
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,590
when it comes to delivering GenAI

1191
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,750
and us becoming an agent workforce.

1192
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:51,840
We really feel that we are
gonna become an AI-first bank.

1193
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,100
People often say,

1194
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,410
are you really gonna
put AI into Danske Bank?

1195
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,750
But of course, we
already think it's there.

1196
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,610
So yeah, it's a bit cheesy,

1197
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:01,740
but you know, we had to do it.

1198
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,540
Anyway, so as we've been delivering

1199
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,130
GenAI into our organization,

1200
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,320
we've got something we
now call 10 Big Wins.

1201
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,450
We used to call them Big Bets, Big Rocks.

1202
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:11,850
We're now saying that
we feel so passionate

1203
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,650
that these things are gonna give us value,

1204
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:14,790
that we're gonna deliver them

1205
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:15,990
and they're called Big Wins.

1206
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:17,100
Now, one of them I'm delivering

1207
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,530
is around our product delivery lifecycle.

1208
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,990
It was based on software
delivery lifecycle.

1209
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:23,820
But as we've kind of gone through,

1210
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,620
as we've rolled out AI coding assistance,

1211
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,540
like I'm sure many of you've had,

1212
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,040
we've seen a huge reduction

1213
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,410
in our change lead time by about 50%.

1214
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:32,490
So this is great,

1215
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,710
huge amount of benefit to our developers.

1216
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:37,530
But when we started
speaking to our developers,

1217
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,090
we started doing a level of analysis

1218
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:41,880
using our live engineering
tooling where we could see

1219
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,610
all the different touch points
in our delivery life cycle.

1220
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,650
And we've soon realized
that many of our developers,

1221
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,120
we do have quite a few,

1222
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,040
were actually working very, very hard,

1223
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,090
but only 35% of their
time was spent on coding.

1224
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:54,923
So a lot of the time,

1225
00:50:54,923 --> 00:50:56,070
they were working really, really hard,

1226
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:58,290
but in other areas of delivery process.

1227
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:01,230
So what we found was there was
one process for development,

1228
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:04,680
but many, many other processes
across the organization.

1229
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,060
And they were working hard,

1230
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,067
working with the other processes.

1231
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:10,140
And to a certain extent, if we move on,

1232
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,190
when we asked them how they feeling,

1233
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:13,050
well, they felt that
progress they were seeing

1234
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:14,880
still didn't equal the level of effort

1235
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,280
that they're putting in on a daily basis.

1236
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,630
So where are we?

1237
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,850
So we're on a journey to
what we call our new PDLC,

1238
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:23,760
which is the product
development lifecycle.

1239
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,410
We are actually looking at how we can look

1240
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:27,930
at the development teams
that are stuck in processes

1241
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:29,580
of endless Kanban boards,

1242
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,790
handover meetings, documentation, testing,

1243
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,110
all sorts of things like that.

1244
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:36,030
And we feel there's a major opportunity

1245
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,948
for us to deliver one agentic workflow

1246
00:51:37,948 --> 00:51:39,510
with zero friction

1247
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,373
and to a certain extent tool.

1248
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,550
So some of the agents that
we are starting to build,

1249
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,620
we've actually put one
into production already,

1250
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,453
we are starting to see

1251
00:51:47,453 --> 00:51:49,230
some immediate benefits from the agents.

1252
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,330
The first one, I think
Jonathan mentioned earlier,

1253
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:53,610
was around business analysis, BAs.

1254
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,110
We have a large number of BAs,

1255
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:57,870
but we also have a lot of
developers working on BA.

1256
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:59,610
And so now we're looking
at how we can automate

1257
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:00,960
the specs and validation

1258
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,900
and reducing the manual
effort of our resources.

1259
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,490
We're also looking at QA.

1260
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:08,160
This testing, how can
we get an agent to start

1261
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,500
accelerating the generation of test cases

1262
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,170
and looking for the detection?

1263
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,610
Now of course, we know
that a lot of people

1264
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,230
don't like actually writing test scripts,

1265
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:18,390
but they also don't want to
execute so many tests as well.

1266
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:20,270
So this is, I think, something

1267
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,605
that we think would
give us a lot of value.

1268
00:52:22,605 --> 00:52:24,150
And then, something
that's close to my heart

1269
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:25,650
as an ex support person,

1270
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:28,440
I think Jonathan mentioned
before about the 24 by 7

1271
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,820
is really how do we start thinking

1272
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,130
about reliability engineering agents?

1273
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,200
This one really, really excites me.

1274
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,030
So we already have something
called Cloud Buddy,

1275
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:38,040
and I think we are gonna
rename it at some point,

1276
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,170
but it actually sits in production today

1277
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,526
and cuts triage time down by about 75%

1278
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:45,355
and also improves our root cause accuracy.

1279
00:52:45,355 --> 00:52:47,850
We're also looking at how
this can actually help us

1280
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:49,440
with incident resolution.

1281
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,880
It doesn't actually perform an action,

1282
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,140
but it actually helps us

1283
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,149
going through log analysis, for example.

1284
00:52:54,149 --> 00:52:56,670
I'm pretty sure this agent, at some point,

1285
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,710
is gonna be part of our organization.

1286
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,346
In fact, as we are looking to give it

1287
00:53:00,346 --> 00:53:01,590
more and more tasks,

1288
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:03,420
we're almost thinking
about how we can call it

1289
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,130
a promotion for the agent.

1290
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:07,470
But this is the first kinda wave

1291
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,500
of agents that we are putting in our PDLC,

1292
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,970
but we really think that at some point

1293
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,787
we will have the complete agent framework

1294
00:53:13,787 --> 00:53:16,243
when it comes from having an idea

1295
00:53:16,243 --> 00:53:18,960
all the way through to running
the agent in production

1296
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,093
and potentially even retiring the product.

1297
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:25,119
So I've talked a little
bit about the technology,

1298
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,706
I've talked a little bit
about the history of the bank.

1299
00:53:27,706 --> 00:53:29,580
One of the biggest things we've seen

1300
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,660
is the change management,

1301
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,790
the people element, the human resources.

1302
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,740
And as I really, really feel

1303
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,020
that there's a lot of
change management to happen.

1304
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,120
And the reason is is because
there's a huge amount

1305
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,070
of background of different generations,

1306
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,100
cultures and experiences
across the organization.

1307
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,533
Some are super excited with
the agentic opportunities

1308
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:48,990
that we have and some not so much.

1309
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,000
So we all know the corporate jargon.

1310
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,340
The first one here, right?

1311
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,080
I'll circle back to you, sounds harmless.

1312
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,617
But what we really think this says is,

1313
00:53:56,617 --> 00:54:00,090
"Why should I be using
something that can replace me?"

1314
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:03,007
Well, I think Jonathan
mentioned it already.

1315
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,950
We actually tell them, look,

1316
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,644
GenAI won't necessarily replace your role,

1317
00:54:06,644 --> 00:54:10,860
but people using GenAI potentially will.

1318
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:11,693
Then there's the classic,

1319
00:54:11,693 --> 00:54:12,870
"Let's take it offline."

1320
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,277
Now this one's okay, but
really what it means is,

1321
00:54:15,277 --> 00:54:17,100
"Look, sounds okay, but where do I start?

1322
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,980
Do I really have the time to
start learning new tool sets?"

1323
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,360
And this is where we have champions

1324
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,301
that train the trainers
in our organization,

1325
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:26,404
continue leaning in to the employees,

1326
00:54:26,404 --> 00:54:28,590
teaching them and giving them demos

1327
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,498
of how others in the organization
are getting benefits.

1328
00:54:31,498 --> 00:54:34,050
And then finally, we have the supporters,

1329
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,250
usually the kinda younger rats

1330
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,360
who are really, really hungry

1331
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,910
to use some of their anyway
tooling and the agents.

1332
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,117
And really what they're saying is,

1333
00:54:40,117 --> 00:54:41,790
"It's really about time

1334
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:43,590
we implemented some great processes here."

1335
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,390
So this is something that we are seeing

1336
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:46,833
across the organization.

1337
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,728
So this is really around the resources,

1338
00:54:49,728 --> 00:54:51,720
but what does it mean for me as a CTO?

1339
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,360
And I think this role is
continuing to evolve as well.

1340
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,251
So we talked to about it earlier

1341
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,620
about being the expert generalist.

1342
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,500
And I don't think that actually me now

1343
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,620
is not as deep in
technology as I used to be.

1344
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,960
I see myself as a connector of experts

1345
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,540
across both technology
and the wide employee.

1346
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,710
This is where the magic happens

1347
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:13,893
and really where platform,
technology, and processes align.

1348
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,950
I did actually say that
I'm a man of many hats

1349
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,287
and I didn't actually expect my team

1350
00:55:18,287 --> 00:55:20,460
to put this on the slide,

1351
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,840
so I'll move on very, very quickly.

1352
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,490
(audience chuckling)

1353
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,050
But if there's anything I would say,

1354
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,400
so there's a couple of things.

1355
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,110
One is momentum being profession.

1356
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,820
When we started off,

1357
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,380
we really, really kept on planning,

1358
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,935
we were planning, we were planning.

1359
00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:34,530
And by the time we
actually went to implement

1360
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,808
any type of GenAI tooling
or agentic opportunities,

1361
00:55:37,808 --> 00:55:40,680
we really felt that it
had already moved on.

1362
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,170
So we really felt that
we've got to get moving

1363
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,550
really, really quick.

1364
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,160
And what we started to do
with some GenAI hackathons.

1365
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,480
Now with these GenAI hackathons,

1366
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,580
what we did, we gave the end users,

1367
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,660
the people in the front line

1368
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,540
with some of the low-code
no-code tools that we have.

1369
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,280
And we said, look, we guarantee you

1370
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,110
a path into production for the winner.

1371
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,711
Actually, we ended up at having three,

1372
00:55:59,711 --> 00:56:03,510
the top three solutions all
getting ready for production.

1373
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,730
The winner called
CheckMate is in production

1374
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,980
and it's actively used by this team

1375
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,570
that delivered it in the hackathon

1376
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,970
every day today, every day.

1377
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,130
So the commitment that
we had said to people

1378
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:15,420
about it going into production

1379
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,710
has really, really driven

1380
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,025
the hunger for people to get involved

1381
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:21,030
and understand more about GenAI.

1382
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,904
And then finally, we'd team up.

1383
00:56:23,904 --> 00:56:27,210
We've teamed up with a
number of great partners

1384
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:30,399
and strategic supporters

1385
00:56:30,399 --> 00:56:32,280
across the organization.

1386
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,520
Our CEO is mandating that the use of GenAI

1387
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,280
and we continue to kinda
focus on the north star

1388
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,980
with becoming an AI-first bank.

1389
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,910
And then finally,

1390
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:43,080
this isn't Jonathan and I,

1391
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,700
this is actually just put together,

1392
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,697
but we will actually just say,

1393
00:56:45,697 --> 00:56:48,210
"Look, as we partner up,
having that north star

1394
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,860
and that end vision gives us something

1395
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,660
for us to kind of focus upon."

1396
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,680
Without further ado,

1397
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,175
I'll hand it back to Jonathan, thank you.

1398
00:56:55,175 --> 00:56:56,975
(audience applauding)

1399
00:56:56,975 --> 00:56:57,975
- Thank you.

1400
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:02,400
Thank you very much for
listening to us today.

Thank you, Richard,
for sharing that story.

1402
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,040
I love the hackathon idea

1403
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,890
where we're gonna guarantee
it goes into production.

1404
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,763
All of this is such a
fungible state right now,

1405
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:11,250
such a fungible space.

1406
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,020
It's changing every single day.

1407
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,520
We wanted to give you
some deep snippets though,

1408
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,110
on what's happening we see
happening with the roles

1409
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,270
and in particularly what's
happening with Amazon.

1410
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:20,160
Finally, please leave feedback for us.

1411
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,090
I'm the track owner

1412
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,440
for all the senior leader sessions today.

1413
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,970
I will read every single comment

1414
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,650
that you leave for us today.

1415
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,020
We greatly appreciate the scores
and feedbacks you give us.

1416
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,220
And with that, thank you very much

1417
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,520
for listening to us today.
