1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,253
- [Assaf] Alright.

2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:07,800
Hi everybody and welcome to
the Enhance Contact Center

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,710
with Salesforce and AWS.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,390
Really excited to be here today.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,520
My name is Assaf Ben-Gur
and I'm the product lead

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,660
for Salesforce Channels

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,693
and Contact Centers and I'm
honored to be joined by Marc.

8
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:19,881
- Hey everybody, Marc Rudkowski.

9
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:22,200
I'm a principal product
manager for Amazon Connect.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,592
Been with Connect since we
launched it back in 2017.

11
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:26,640
You know, we're a lightning talk,

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,050
so we've got less than 20 minutes.

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,640
So I've got the timer to get going.

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,770
We've got about 19 minutes
left, so we're gonna go

15
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,940
through this as, as best we can

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,680
'cause we've gotta demo the
show as well as part of this.

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,947
So, let's go.

18
00:00:35,947 --> 00:00:36,935
- Sounds like a plan.

19
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:38,520
Before we start, we wanna share

20
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,110
with you the forward-looking statement.

21
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,478
Don't make any purchase decisions based

22
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:43,710
on non-generally available product.

23
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,959
Let's start a little
bit with the challenge

24
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:46,965
of contact centers today.

25
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,929
When your customers phone in
today, they expect your agents

26
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,939
to be super knowledgeable
about who they are, what type

27
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:54,655
of relationship they have with you.

28
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,510
They expect them to be super knowledgeable

29
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,148
and experts in solving
the issue that they have.

30
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:04,117
Instead, the experience they're
getting is being put on hold

31
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:05,241
because your agent is trying

32
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:07,219
to stitch the customer
profile in real time

33
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:08,442
behind the scenes.

34
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:10,118
And when they're ready to action

35
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:12,540
and resolve the issue that
they called about, they need

36
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,254
to swivel between multiple systems.

37
00:01:15,254 --> 00:01:17,146
We keep hearing three things

38
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:19,710
from contact center leaders today.

39
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,510
They want to boost agent productivity

40
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,434
with high customer satisfaction.

41
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:25,319
They want to reduce operating costs

42
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,810
because it's still considered
a heavy cost center

43
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,917
for the company.

44
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:31,187
And now more than ever, they want

45
00:01:31,187 --> 00:01:34,620
to actively participate
in growing the top line

46
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,820
for the company.

47
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,920
They want an active role
in growing the revenue

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,820
for the company.

49
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,190
So after resolving the
customer issue, they want

50
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,010
to free up their agents to
quickly focus on upselling

51
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:44,910
and cross-selling.

52
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,364
And AI, specifically generative
and addressing experiences.

53
00:01:50,364 --> 00:01:51,635
Exactly the technology

54
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:54,333
that can help you transform
your contact centers.

55
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:57,396
It's intuitive, it's smarter, it's faster,

56
00:01:57,396 --> 00:01:58,582
it's everything we need

57
00:01:58,582 --> 00:02:01,680
to take the contact
centers to the next level,

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,030
but it's not easy.

59
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,520
We know a lot of those projects just fail.

60
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,688
You can't just take AI and
just slap it on your data

61
00:02:08,688 --> 00:02:11,410
and on your channels and hope for good.

62
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,960
Remember that agent that go

63
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,329
and stitch your customer
profile because it's all over?

64
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:17,250
Your data is all over.

65
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,710
Your channels completely disconnected,

66
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,780
your call center completely disconnected

67
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,013
from your digital channels.

68
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:24,741
Your agents can do either telephony

69
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:27,030
or they can do email or messaging.

70
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,998
They're not versatile.

71
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:30,510
They're walking off of
totally different systems

72
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,880
and totally different desktops.

73
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,460
And last but not least, AI is the new toy.

74
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,370
Everybody in your company
wants to do something with AI.

75
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,190
Your marketing team is doing
something completely different

76
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,530
from your sales team that
is doing something different

77
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,251
from your servicing team.

78
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:47,124
And your R&D and product team,

79
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:49,625
just last week they had
this amazing hackathon

80
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,854
and they came up with
an amazing way using AI

81
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:55,650
to solve a specific use case.

82
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,910
That single use case amazing,
but the contact center leaders

83
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,677
and the CIO, specifically,
are being left with a lot

84
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:07,326
of like point solutions
completely fragmented across.

85
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:10,170
And this is exactly where Salesforce

86
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,349
and Amazon Connect came together
to bring you an experience,

87
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:16,380
come taking channels
natively from Salesforce,

88
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,100
all bring them over from Amazon
Connect and give your agents

89
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,270
and your contact center
experience one unified, cohesive,

90
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,593
standardized way to manage
everything customer interaction

91
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:31,378
in one single space.

92
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:35,368
From agentic self-service portals
to channels like WhatsApp,

93
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:40,286
chat, email, voice studies
coming in from Amazon Connect,

94
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,950
Apple messaging for
business line for Japan.

95
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,380
We have all the channels you need in order

96
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,120
to standardize all this experience

97
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,910
throughout the customer lifecycle journey.

98
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,593
And all those channels are
agent force, AI agent ready.

99
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:57,150
The same agent force builder helps you

100
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,440
to build this logic in one
place and then distribute it

101
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,214
and attach it to any
channel that you need.

102
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:04,880
You need a channel to completely automate

103
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,080
your email interaction?

104
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,460
Just use the same agent.

105
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,810
You need that channel to walk off

106
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,990
of your WhatsApp experience,
your line, your web chat?

107
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,400
That same agent.

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,770
And now as of October, thanks to Marc

109
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,860
and Amazon Connect, we have
a fully integrated solution

110
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,865
with Agent Force Voice running on top

111
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:24,120
of the Amazon Connect voice channel

112
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,497
- And our other channels as well, right?

113
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:27,507
And so this is where
the key aspect of this

114
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:28,856
that gives you that optionality

115
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,330
between our platforms, right?

116
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,460
Because we both bring rich capabilities,

117
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,340
we're on the digital engagement
and your voice interactions.

118
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,720
And you know, basically, because that,

119
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,771
we can run, whether
it's using Salesforce's

120
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:40,320
native agent force agents

121
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,576
or it's using Amazon
Connects AI agents, you have

122
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:44,460
that flexibility in terms of enabling that

123
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,343
and having the right fit for each

124
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:48,510
of your use cases in the
contact center and CRM.

125
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,343
- Exactly.

126
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:50,604
And now that you free up your agents

127
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:55,604
from focus on like tier one,
FAQ type of interactions,

128
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,100
they have a lot more bandwidth

129
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,003
to focus on more eye value interactions.

130
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:02,490
Really focus on the interactions

131
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,340
where you need a human touch.

132
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,840
You need them for dealing with escalation.

133
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,450
Those like more of the
complex type of experiences.

134
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,170
And this is where all the
assistive AI capabilities come in.

135
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,320
Things like service replies
attached to your email channel,

136
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,305
grounded by your knowledge.

137
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:19,366
That same email reply application

138
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:21,392
and service reply application apply

139
00:05:21,392 --> 00:05:24,622
to your messaging channels,
your WhatsApp, your web chat,

140
00:05:24,622 --> 00:05:26,823
your Apple business for messaging.

141
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:29,651
At the end of the call,

142
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:31,800
you wanna reduce that wrap up time.

143
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Call summarization help you
to reduce minutes out of it

144
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,185
so you can free up your human agent

145
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:39,107
to focus on the next interaction.

146
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:41,935
And last but not least is your supervisor.

147
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:44,376
It's a whole new world
for your supervisors.

148
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:49,376
Yesterday, they just
manage just the labor,

149
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,700
human labor workforce.

150
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,190
Now they need to manage
all those AI agents.

151
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,192
This is why we, our omni
supervisor to be command center

152
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:03,714
for service, really bring in a cockpit,

153
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:07,191
one single unified
workplace that allow you

154
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:11,940
to manage both your human
agents and your AI agents.

155
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,367
So your supervisor can
get alerts in real time

156
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:17,642
and flag raise based on conversations

157
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:19,968
that their AI agents are driving,

158
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:23,700
and then be able to listen in
and interject where needed.

159
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,870
But there's so much more.

160
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,210
I know Marc, you guys have been busy

161
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,720
in the last nine months,

162
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,202
like building the next wave of innovation.

163
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:30,595
- Yeah, so let me talk a little bit

164
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:32,700
in terms of what we've
actually announced this week

165
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,388
and I'll talk a little bit
in terms of the integration

166
00:06:34,388 --> 00:06:36,375
that we have with
Salesforce Contact Center

167
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,208
with Amazon Connect.

168
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,400
Yeah, thank you for the clicker.

169
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,791
So back in March, we announced

170
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,370
and launched Salesforce Contact
Center with Amazon Connect.

171
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,390
I know that's a mouthful.

172
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,308
So for the rest of the presentation,

173
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:48,378
you gonna hear me use the term SCCAC

174
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:51,034
'cause it's a lot easier to
say from that perspective.

175
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:54,510
Back in March when we
announced and launched this,

176
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,410
essentially what it was,

177
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,450
was we worked super
closely with Salesforce

178
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,822
and we saw a lot of success that we had

179
00:06:58,822 --> 00:07:02,119
with Agent Force Voice in terms
of enabling that with a lot

180
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:04,380
of our core contact centers.

181
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,447
But what customers really wanted was

182
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:07,050
they wanted additional channels,

183
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,820
they wanted additional
Connect capabilities

184
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,674
that were unified as part
of Agent Force Voice.

185
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:13,290
So when we released this in March,

186
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,729
we were actually the first contact center

187
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:16,803
to implement Bring Your Own Chat,

188
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,500
which essentially takes our native chat

189
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,380
and it integrated with
Salesforce's chat capabilities.

190
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,690
So the advantage of that is
that when you're in Connect

191
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,326
and you're in our IVR experience,

192
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:27,930
you can leverage our voice,

193
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,460
you can leverage our native chat.

194
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,379
But when it gets to the
point of actually escalating

195
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:34,080
to an agent, we actually then send it in

196
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,195
through Salesforce chat UX,

197
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:37,200
and it essentially pops up

198
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,380
as a native Salesforce chat
within Agent Force Voice.

199
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,020
So the advantage of that is
from an agent perspective,

200
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,730
whether they're using Salesforce chat

201
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,470
or our native chat, it looks the same.

202
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,440
You get that deep rich
integration across the capability.

203
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,525
So for example, being able

204
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:53,493
to have those pre-configured
replies, right,

205
00:07:53,493 --> 00:07:56,010
to be able to answer, you
know, those customer inquiries

206
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,843
that are often happening

207
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,621
and giving agents shortcut
to quickly answer questions.

208
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:02,689
We can enable that really
easily and natively

209
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:04,677
within Salesforce as part of that.

210
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:07,350
The other aspect of that of
what we announced this week is

211
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,060
now what we started to
do is really then start

212
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,091
to expand additional Connect capabilities.

213
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,003
So, you probably heard a lot this week

214
00:08:13,003 --> 00:08:16,210
with Connect is us announcing
our native AI agents

215
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,330
integrated as part of Connect.

216
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,620
And part of that is really giving you

217
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,971
out-of-the-box AI agents
that you can start

218
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:23,820
to leverage both from a
self-service perspective as well

219
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,350
as an agent assist perspective.

220
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,520
So what we announced this week is,

221
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,486
essentially, the next version
of SCCAC, which now allows you

222
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:31,146
to add agent assist capabilities

223
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:34,710
with Connect AI agents natively
within Agent Force Voice.

224
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,260
So the advantage of that now
is essentially, you know,

225
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,615
from a self-service perspective,
whether using our voice

226
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:40,830
or our chat channels,

227
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,800
you can have that rich AI agent experience

228
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,320
and then hand all of that
interaction, you know,

229
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,570
through the Agent Force Voice experience.

230
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,787
And then as the agent
is trying to continue

231
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:51,428
to resolve the issue with that context.

232
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:52,320
For example,

233
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,667
they could be plugging into
Salesforce knowledge base,

234
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,646
you know, for getting all
the SOPs and recommendations.

235
00:08:57,646 --> 00:08:59,160
And essentially as they go through that,

236
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,990
and I'll show a demo of
this in a little bit,

237
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,800
have that interaction, you
know, walk through that

238
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,410
and then give the agent the, essentially,

239
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,090
the right recommendations
to solve that issue

240
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,777
as quickly as possible.

241
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:11,550
Once the chat or the voice
call is over, at that point,

242
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,033
give them the summary of the
interaction that they have

243
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:17,220
so they can quickly update
the Salesforce case to ensure

244
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,747
that, you know, there is,
as Assaf mentioned earlier,

245
00:09:19,747 --> 00:09:23,160
like saving often minutes
right from the agent's time

246
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,590
in terms of improving
their overall productivity

247
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,947
to not only solve the issue

248
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:28,530
but then update the issue

249
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,330
from an after call work perspective.

250
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:34,410
And what you see here
is you see, you know,

251
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,506
we've got quite a rich roadmap
in terms of capabilities

252
00:09:36,506 --> 00:09:39,279
that we've recently announced
in terms of overall sets

253
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,609
of features.

254
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:41,950
You know, what I just
talked about here was

255
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,516
essentially our agent assist
and summarization capabilities.

256
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:46,850
I'll do a demo of that in a few minutes.

257
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,060
What's that?

258
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,893
Yeah.

259
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:49,770
Okay, just so.

260
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,110
And then real time transcription
for additional languages.

261
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,790
So back at Dreamforce,

262
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,620
Salesforce announced
the additional support.

263
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,454
So that runs a lot on our
core underlying capabilities

264
00:09:58,454 --> 00:10:00,240
like Amazon Transcribe

265
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,031
and it really talks to the
global capabilities that we have

266
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:04,980
as a better together story.

267
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,646
So Connect brings that particularly

268
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:09,770
around our telephony
capabilities as global telephony.

269
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,349
We bring that at scale in
terms of managed telephony

270
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:15,390
across the entire world.

271
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,803
And part of that is
really now with, you know,

272
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:18,690
with Salesforce from an agent experience,

273
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,270
you get all the language support
around all of that as well.

274
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,850
So again, we are truly a
global solution in terms

275
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,791
of all the capabilities that you get

276
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,001
between Salesforce and Amazon Connect.

277
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,347
We had also announced Agent
Force Voice with Amazon Connect.

278
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:32,111
So in terms of supporting
third party voice experiences,

279
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:35,975
we now enable that as part
of Amazon Connect as well.

280
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:38,580
And then finally, from a
workforce management perspective,

281
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,452
if you're using our chat
and our voice capabilities,

282
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:42,444
you can leverage our workforce management

283
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:45,913
or FCS capabilities, for capacity planning

284
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:48,990
and scheduling capabilities
natively within Connect.

285
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,375
And from a roadmap
perspective, we're working

286
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,350
with Salesforce to start
to support their channels

287
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,700
in the future as well.

288
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,680
So again, we continue...

289
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,380
You can see we continue to
evolve the overall capabilities

290
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,753
and integration between the two in terms

291
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:01,811
of overall feature sets and just richer

292
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:03,693
and richer integrations overall.

293
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,560
So, let's jump into a demo.

294
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,240
Let's see, I'm looking at my
clock, I got eight minutes

295
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,073
and 34 seconds,

296
00:11:10,073 --> 00:11:12,270
- Plenty.
so plenty of time here.

297
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,393
So, let's see if we can
go through the demo.

298
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,505
Alright, perfect.

299
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:20,223
And so this is a bit
of a click through demo

300
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:23,130
because nobody trusts me doing live demos,

301
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,817
especially on stage when
I've only got 20 minutes

302
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,460
to walk through that.

303
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,750
Actually less than
that, eight minutes now.

304
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,050
So, we've got, so just to
set up some background.

305
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:31,883
So this is AnyCompany.

306
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:35,146
It's an energy company use case
that we talked through here.

307
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:37,110
We've got Nikki as the customer.

308
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,589
She's coming in, she has a
problem with her generator,

309
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:42,175
and we're gonna help her,
basically solve that issue

310
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:43,808
with, you see, within a few clicks

311
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:46,500
overall from that perspective.

312
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,866
So the chat comes in.

313
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:51,298
Essentially what you see here is...

314
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:54,063
Actually, this is always
the challenge here.

315
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:57,033
There we go.

316
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,557
And so we have the chat
here with Nikki, you know,

317
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:03,630
and she say, "Doc, thank
you for contacting us."

318
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,838
Now again, this is, for the sake of speed,

319
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:09,030
we're doing a fairly simple use case here.

320
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,250
But you can imagine this
could be using, you know,

321
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,300
one of our AI agents.

322
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,920
It could be using Agent Force
agents in terms of creating

323
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,000
that interaction,

324
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,320
that self-service experience

325
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,164
in terms of overall
capabilities around that.

326
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:20,338
You know, once we escalate to an agent,

327
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:22,140
which is what we're gonna show here,

328
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,057
essentially, all the contacts of

329
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:27,025
that iteration gets handed
over to Nikki is part of that.

330
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:30,004
So essentially at this
point, the chat comes in,

331
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:33,451
Nikki gets this essentially
omni item in terms of being able

332
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:35,730
to answer the chat as part of that.

333
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,870
This is her dashboard by the way.

334
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,850
So she has a rich dashboard
in terms of seeing

335
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,050
how she's doing overall or across her day.

336
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,020
Great, click on that.

337
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,240
And now, at this point, you see the chat,

338
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,073
the messaging window.

339
00:12:46,073 --> 00:12:46,906
Again, you can see it's,

340
00:12:46,906 --> 00:12:49,320
if you're familiar with
Salesforce's chat window,

341
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,153
it looks very, it's similar.

342
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:52,740
It's identical to that in terms
of that overall interaction.

343
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,450
They're having that interaction
from that perspective.

344
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,710
Now, a few clicks later, you
know, she's asking essentially,

345
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,216
you know, "I need guidance
on a generator installation,

346
00:13:00,216 --> 00:13:01,440
can you please help?"

347
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,273
Sure, right?

348
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:03,557
So at this point in real time,

349
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:06,498
the Connect HAI agent,
which is also hooked up

350
00:13:06,498 --> 00:13:08,730
to a Salesforce knowledge base,

351
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,170
is now understanding the intent

352
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,128
and the ask that's happening
as part of the chat.

353
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:14,310
And as part of that,

354
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,973
it's now going to provide a
recommendation back to the agent

355
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:18,360
where the agent can then,

356
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,680
you know, quickly read that,

357
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,377
and then provide that guidance
back to Nikki in terms

358
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:25,110
of solving this overall generator issue.

359
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,120
In addition to that, it's
also gonna provide the links

360
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,170
to the sources.

361
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,359
So if the agent, you
know, wants to, again,

362
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:31,873
with a human in the middle,
being able to look at in terms

363
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:33,483
of the sources of that data

364
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:35,925
and do a little bit
deeper research if needed,

365
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:36,933
you know, they can understand where

366
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:39,300
that information's coming
from, which is great.

367
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,680
They can also search as well.

368
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,181
So, if it doesn't quite meet

369
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:43,560
in terms of what they're looking for

370
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,910
in terms of a recommendation,

371
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,470
they can easily there
and continue to go search

372
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,000
through the knowledge base
for additional answers

373
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,050
as part of that.

374
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,007
So great, the agent responds,
you know, as part of

375
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:54,870
that interaction, and then
we solve Nikki's problem.

376
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,788
And then at the end, you see that there up

377
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:57,177
in the upper right corner is

378
00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:59,310
the Amazon Connect summarization.

379
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,824
So now we've taken that
end to end interaction

380
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:02,795
that have from our chat perspective,

381
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:04,000
we've summarized that,

382
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,210
and then essentially,
we can update the case,

383
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,590
you know, within a few clicks,

384
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,990
and, you know, we've solved
the overall issue again.

385
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,823
So, you can see here

386
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:14,014
that we've taken the native
Amazon Connect capabilities

387
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:14,847
and we've integrated

388
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:17,762
into the Salesforce Agent
Force Voice experience

389
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:18,595
and really providing

390
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:21,270
that overall unified experience overall.

391
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,890
- [Assaf] So Marc, the agents don't need

392
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,463
to log in into multiple systems?

393
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:28,350
The agent just walk off of that
one single unified desktop?

394
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,280
- [Marc] Exactly, exactly.

395
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,856
So, we've removed a lot of
the heavy lifting, right,

396
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:34,732
that our customers will
have to do in terms

397
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:36,660
of integrating these capabilities.

398
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,550
And we've made it from an
out-of-the-box perspective,

399
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,580
simple, easy to set up,
configure, and start to enable.

400
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,480
- [Assaf] Perfect.

401
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,510
- [Marc] All right, so let's switch back

402
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,673
to the presentation.

403
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:52,483
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

404
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,003
Alright.

405
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,360
So some of the things here

406
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,749
to note here too is Amazon
Connect, we have tens

407
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:04,470
of thousands of customers soaring

408
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,330
more than 16 million interactions a day.

409
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,163
So this really talks

410
00:15:07,163 --> 00:15:10,190
to the scale at which Amazon Connects is

411
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,408
leveraged and deployed with.

412
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:13,407
You can see here the numerous customers

413
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,782
and we have a lot of joint customers

414
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:17,490
that are also Salesforce
customers that we work so closely,

415
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,552
like Vista, Truist, Air Canada,

416
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,161
are all great examples in terms

417
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:23,220
of who uses integration today

418
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,166
and have continued to scale
this, you know, overall across,

419
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,484
you know, solving their key
contact center capabilities

420
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:30,212
and problems that they have overall.

421
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:32,147
So again, we've seen a lot of success,

422
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:33,445
you know, from that overall.

423
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:35,202
And just as a reminder...

424
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:36,928
Oh, go ahead, did you wanna say something?

425
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:38,490
- We have just, you know,

426
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,560
thousands of joint customers already,

427
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,520
- Thousands of joint customers today.

428
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,606
- Like growing really, really nicely.

429
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:43,762
You know, double digit,

430
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:47,610
almost hitting like 100
million voice call a month.

431
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,984
And this is amazing
number for Amazon Connect

432
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:51,846
across all customers.

433
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:54,030
- We are the largest
contact center, right,

434
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,513
in terms of leveraging
this with Salesforce

435
00:15:55,513 --> 00:15:57,720
in terms of the integration
capabilities that we have.

436
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,936
And for those of you that
were in PQ session yesterday,

437
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:01,895
I brought this up as another reminder.

438
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:04,438
Last yearm in terms of, you know,

439
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:06,480
the number of customer interactions

440
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,570
that are using AI, you know,
within using Amazon Connect

441
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,913
to optimize those interactions,

442
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:13,203
it was about 6 billion a year ago.

443
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:15,480
We've doubled that now to 12 billion.

444
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,917
So again, it continues to show the fact

445
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:20,511
that we have used AI from
the beginning with Connect

446
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,080
and we continue to use that journey

447
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,690
and we continue to enable
that natively within Connect,

448
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,526
but also working closely with
our partners like Salesforce

449
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:29,430
to give you the, those
capabilities as well, right,

450
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,650
from a joint perspective,
better together story

451
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,858
as we work together to continue to evolve,

452
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:36,213
what is, I'd say, is a very fast,

453
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:39,569
rapidly changing space
from that perspective,

454
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:44,160
but it is the number one use
case is the contact center

455
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,993
with AI.

456
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:46,667
And so, you know, we're here
working together in terms of

457
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:49,851
how do we best solve your
use cases as end customers

458
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:52,511
and large enterprises to
make sure that, you know,

459
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,780
we're meeting that to the speed

460
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,950
and capabilities that you need

461
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,500
from an overall contact
center and CRM perspective.

462
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,180
And so with that, I've got two minutes

463
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,442
and 40 seconds, so I
think I did all right,

464
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,720
and with that.

465
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,788
So, you know what, I'll say
we've got our booths here,

466
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:10,530
so definitely come, you know,

467
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,281
come visit the Salesforce
booth, booth number 739,

468
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:16,183
I think it's like right over
there from that perspective.

469
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:18,180
And then come visit the
Amazon Connect booth.

470
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,013
That's hard to miss.

471
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:21,930
It's that big AWS one
that's right in the middle.

472
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,098
I've got a QR code here as well.

473
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:24,450
And then obviously,

474
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,981
for those of you who
have your account teams,

475
00:17:25,981 --> 00:17:27,278
feel free to reach out to them.

476
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:29,910
They can definitely, you know,
in terms of getting you up

477
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,510
to speed on all the capabilities.

478
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,450
Follow me on LinkedIn.

479
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,344
Follow Assaf on LinkedIn.

480
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,116
I posted a bunch of stuff up there as well

481
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:38,370
so you can take a look
in terms of, you know,

482
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,590
links in terms of how
to get more information

483
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,864
about Agent Force Voice or SCCAC, right.

484
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,514
We've got all that information up there

485
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:46,950
and obviously, we're here as well,

486
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,620
so, happy to have the conversation
and talk some about it.

487
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,260
- And regardless of what
footprint they have, right?

488
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,672
Like whether they have other
point solutions that they want

489
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:55,616
to go and transform

490
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,716
and take it to the next stage
potentially with Salesforce

491
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:00,565
and Amazon Connect, or
whether you already invested

492
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:03,150
in Amazon Connect channels or you want

493
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,324
to evaluate Salesforce channels
and bring it all along.

494
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:07,598
We have the solution for you.

495
00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:10,398
We've built it in a
modular way that can build,

496
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:12,198
bring all this modularity

497
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:14,850
and all these components
together meaningfully

498
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,490
for your agent and supervisor.

499
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,220
So we're looking forward
for any next steps here.

500
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
- Great.

501
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,209
And with that, we thank you everybody

502
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:24,150
for attending today, and I
did it with a minute left.

503
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,140
So thanks everybody.

504
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,543
Have a good rest of your day.
