  "abstract": "Cyber resilience is the ability of an organization to continuously deliver the intended outcome despite adverse cyber events. It has an overlap with disaster recovery where both cyber resilience and disaster recovery involve plans and actions to restore normal operations after an incident. Cyber resilience includes disaster recovery as part of its broader strategy.\nThere are multiple key themes when it comes to designing for cyber resilience:\n- Protect: Proactive measures taken to safeguard systems, networks, and data.\n- Prepare: Activities to ensure an organization can effectively respond to and recover from a cyber incident.\n- Recover: Actions taken to restore systems, networks, and data to their normal state after a cyber incident.",
