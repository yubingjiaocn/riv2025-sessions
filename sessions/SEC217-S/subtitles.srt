1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:00,790
Awesome.

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:06,780
Hello everybody. hello, how are we doing? How are we doing?

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,460
Everybody had lunch,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,618
good lunch.

5
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:12,198
All right, awesome. Well, my name is Matt Gibbets

6
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:14,358
and I'm the principal solutions engineer with Dyna Trace,

7
00:00:14,398 --> 00:00:16,478
and I'm lucky to be joined by one of my esteemed colleagues,

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,760
Shannon, as well as one of our esteemed colleagues

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,879
from AWS Raj.

10
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,620
What we will be talking about today

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,440
is the automated cloud security remediation

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,190
with um agentic workflows.

13
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,019
Pretty loaded title, right?

14
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,519
Anybody has any idea what we'll be talking

15
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,779
about? It's,

16
00:00:33,848 --> 00:00:35,990
it's definitely going to be AI. I mean, we have to talk about

17
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,298
AI to stay relevant, right?

18
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:39,399
And we'll be talking about automation.

19
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:40,759
So with that said,

20
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:42,679
let's actually take a look at the agenda.

21
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:44,359
Looking at the agenda,

22
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,259
we definitely want to highlight and start with the partnership

23
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,289
between Dynaches and AWS because it has been

24
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,319
amazing over the years.

25
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:53,090
We will then dive in into today's cloud

26
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,098
security challenges,

27
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:56,810
and lastly, we'll then talk specifically

28
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,859
about security mediation with agentic

29
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:59,598
workflows.

30
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:02,209
Now, we do have some Q&A at the end. I'm

31
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:04,250
more than happy to take it if we have time during the session, but

32
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,290
if we don't, we will stick after, or you can

33
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,430
meet us at the Dina Tre's booth, which is booth 575.

34
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:11,558
Well, let's just dive in.

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,620
We have to start highlighting the key,

36
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,400
essentially highlights of this session. The first one

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,838
that we will be talking about is the integration

38
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:21,980
of DynaTrace

39
00:01:22,278 --> 00:01:23,980
with the AWS security hub.

40
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:27,209
If you guys are familiar with DynaTrece, obviously DynaTrace

41
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:29,370
is an observability platform, so we already

42
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,049
provide a lot of value to our customers,

43
00:01:31,808 --> 00:01:33,930
understanding how your application workloads are performing, how

44
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,870
your cloud native services are performing,

45
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,319
whether you have any vulnerabilities in your environment.

46
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,150
But obviously you're all here.

47
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:42,680
Because you guys are AWS customers, that means

48
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,838
that a lot of your workloads run

49
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:45,799
in AWS.

50
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,379
So what happens when

51
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:50,079
there's a vulnerability in one of your AWS

52
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,308
Cloud native services?

53
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:53,879
Maybe some ports are open in one of your EC2

54
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,278
instances that shouldn't be open.

55
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,269
Now that integration between the AWS

56
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:00,269
Security hub and

57
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:02,629
Dynatrace will allow you to have all of your performance

58
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:05,028
and security data in the same observability

59
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:05,659
platform.

60
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:08,399
Once that data is in the same observability

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,439
platform, This is now where the AI

62
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,419
enters the stage.

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,460
You will be able to use Davis co-pilot

64
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:16,939
to actually understand and trigger

65
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:18,258
automation

66
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,000
for any detected security vulnerabilities

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,099
and bottlenecks in your AWS environment.

68
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,729
And how is it going to be done?

69
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,169
This is where MCP comes into the stage.

70
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,710
That integration and that igentic

71
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,889
workflow is driven

72
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:33,990
through an MCP protocol in here.

73
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,969
So with that said,

74
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:38,629
before we dive into the actual meat and potatoes of how

75
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:40,750
that um automation will happen, we

76
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,699
have to talk a little bit more about Dynatrace.

77
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:45,330
This is a slide that I love that word, one

78
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,538
of my favorite words out there,

79
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,189
the architecture slide,

80
00:02:48,788 --> 00:02:50,830
because it shows you a little bit of the architecture of

81
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,990
the Dyna Trece platform,

82
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:54,429
but it's not deep enough, so, you know, it, it

83
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:55,800
overlaps with the marketing.

84
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:58,349
But really what I want you guys to get out of this slide

85
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:58,868
is

86
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,169
Dyna Chase is an observability platform.

87
00:03:01,868 --> 00:03:04,679
That allows you to understand all of your observability

88
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,460
data in context of each other,

89
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:09,118
to proactively let you know when there are

90
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:10,379
issues in your environment,

91
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,308
perform root cause analysis for you automatically,

92
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,838
and then trigger those automation remediation

93
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:18,080
actions, whether it is remediating

94
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,300
security vulnerabilities

95
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,258
or whether it is actually remediating security bottlenecks.

96
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,778
Since I mentioned that this is the architecture slide,

97
00:03:26,278 --> 00:03:28,719
I know there's probably somebody in here that's, who's wondering

98
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,099
how this is really happening.

99
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,699
So my next slide

100
00:03:32,118 --> 00:03:34,038
lets you guys a little bit under the hood.

101
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,599
How is this really possible that Dynaches is able

102
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,758
to touch the performance data, the security data,

103
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:40,919
the business data, marry all that in

104
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,960
context, and at the end of the day actually

105
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,838
drive automation.

106
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,199
The key answer to that is grail.

107
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,618
The architecture of the Dyna Tree's platform

108
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:51,838
is the difference

109
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,538
from many other vendors that you will see on this floor

110
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:55,889
when it comes to observability.

111
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,219
We created our own back end of

112
00:03:58,219 --> 00:03:58,919
our platform

113
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:00,278
called Grail.

114
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:03,300
What Gray allow, allows us to do, it allows

115
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,349
us to store all of that telemetry that

116
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:07,868
we capture from your environment, whether it's coming from AWS,

117
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:10,189
whether it's coming from an application workloads, whether

118
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:12,710
it's coming from logs, whether it's coming from AWS

119
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,379
security hub,

120
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,069
and have all that data in context

121
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,850
of each other.

122
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,920
Once we have all that data and context of each other,

123
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:22,278
this is where we're not a points tool anymore.

124
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,649
You don't need to have multiple different tools to really

125
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:26,290
tell you what's happening in your environment.

126
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,410
You have Dyna Chase as your one-stop

127
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,410
shop to understand everything about

128
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,449
your environment and fulfill all of your

129
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:34,678
observability needs,

130
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,170
whether it has something to do with performance or

131
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,278
with security, how we'll be able to talk about

132
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,379
today. Now, having all the data and context,

133
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:42,559
being able to analyze it,

134
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:43,629
this is now

135
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,528
when the key component comes into place, which is automation.

136
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,970
Automation is, is almost a buzzword,

137
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:52,170
right? Like everybody wants to automate

138
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,139
everything, but if you have incorrect data,

139
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:56,608
if you have data that doesn't really tell

140
00:04:56,608 --> 00:04:58,678
you the full story of your environment, you will start

141
00:04:58,678 --> 00:04:59,910
automating mistakes.

142
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:03,988
This is what Dynatree stops you from doing,

143
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,238
because having all that data in context, we'll

144
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:08,399
be able to really understand what's happening in your

145
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,600
environment at all times and drove, drive

146
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,660
the remediation actions that are accurate

147
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,720
based on the telemetry that we are capturing from your

148
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,858
environment, whether it is from application workloads,

149
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,189
infrastructure, logs,

150
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,519
or like in this case, AWS security

151
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,059
hub.

152
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,920
So with that said, I'll pass it to my colleague from AWS

153
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,278
to talk a little bit more about the partnership between Dynatrace

154
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:27,959
and AWS.

155
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,139
Thanks a lot, Matt. Uh,

156
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,639
so, before we continue with the presentation, I

157
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,980
would like to talk a bit about

158
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,379
The partnership between DTS and AWS.

159
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,108
DyneTS is an advanced technology partner,

160
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:45,028
uh, with competencies in, uh,

161
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:46,730
AI, journey AI,

162
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,829
machine learning, modernization, and migration.

163
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:53,600
Uh, both Danetrace and AWS have at least about 10+

164
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,470
years of partnership with about

165
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:58,230
100+ AWS service integrations.

166
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,238
And, uh,

167
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:01,689
today, the key differentiator between

168
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:04,028
what we have with DTS and AWS is

169
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:06,290
AI powered automation and advanced

170
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,338
observability.

171
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:09,699
So this is what we are going to do a soil

172
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,100
demo after this presentation.

173
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:14,170
But I just want to highlight that we have like

174
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,750
already 100+ native AWS services

175
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:19,069
and we have these active integrations in production today.

176
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:24,350
Let me now introduce you to AWS

177
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,048
Security Hub,

178
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:27,588
our unified cloud security

179
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,809
solution. So what security hub

180
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:31,379
does, it's like, it's an

181
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,048
environment or a platform where you can ingest

182
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:35,410
like vulnerabilities,

183
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,488
threats, security controls,

184
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:38,769
network exposures,

185
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:40,129
sensitive data,

186
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,439
and once you collect. This data,

187
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,488
they are

188
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,829
on the back correlated so that you

189
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:48,428
know which one to pick up, which is like of

190
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:50,428
maximum importance to you, which you need

191
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:51,889
to address immediately.

192
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:54,358
And it also has some actionable insights.

193
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:56,088
It gives you like a workflow

194
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:58,629
that tells you like, OK, this is something happening

195
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:59,358
with the environment,

196
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,709
and these are some of the workflows available for you.

197
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:03,920
These are some of the remedies available for you.

198
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,608
And you can also have integrations with

199
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:08,889
various different applications like

200
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,290
Jira or Slack or ServiceNow.

201
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:13,639
So all these integrations are already available for you.

202
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,980
So when there is an event or any issue

203
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,970
happening with your environment,

204
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,759
Security hub will create all those alerts and all

205
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,809
those remedations automatically for you.

206
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,199
Finally,

207
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:25,759
the prioritization, right? This is very important. Like

208
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,980
if you're getting hundreds and thousands of

209
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,238
incidents happening, right, it's very hard

210
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:32,358
for you to pick out which is the right one. So the

211
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:34,500
prioritization will help you to look into the

212
00:07:34,678 --> 00:07:36,879
top priority one so that you know which is

213
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,178
affecting your business right now.

214
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:39,470
And

215
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,988
monitoring the security trends, so it's

216
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:44,309
continuously monitoring your environment against

217
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:45,689
like AWS inspector,

218
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:48,230
Amazon guard duty. So all these

219
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,528
are available in a single dashboard for you.

220
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:52,988
And finally, you can respond at scale.

221
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,298
So like if you have like thousands and thousands of

222
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:57,470
virtual machines working and you have

223
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,629
all this exposures coming in into

224
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:00,189
security hub,

225
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,048
it can respond at scale also.

226
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,079
And uh what are the key benefits

227
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,079
of AWS security hub, right? It

228
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,199
prioritize, as I said, it prioritize your

229
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,399
critical security issues so

230
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,439
that you can only look into the top priority

231
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,199
one and

232
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,738
ensure that it has been addressed properly.

233
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,528
It detects core inlets and

234
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:22,769
then it also has integrations with

235
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,850
various, as I mentioned, like Jira,

236
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:25,889
ServiceNow,

237
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,528
all those Slack systems so that the

238
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:30,809
operations teams or the DevOps teams can actually

239
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:31,949
go and look into it.

240
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:35,029
And the main advantage of security hub

241
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,609
rather than going into individual dashboards

242
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:39,702
like. Inspector, you can

243
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:41,861
have security hub as just one

244
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:44,072
console where you can have all the

245
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:46,543
top 10 trends or top highlights happening in

246
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:48,702
just one console so that you can just concentrate

247
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,773
on the main security hub console rather

248
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:53,222
than going into all the other

249
00:08:53,222 --> 00:08:54,552
applications or other services.

250
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:56,942
So before we get into Dimbo, I

251
00:08:56,942 --> 00:08:58,102
will hand it over to Sharon.

252
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:00,754
Talk about how we are getting all this data from

253
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:01,325
security hub,

254
00:09:01,634 --> 00:09:03,035
then ingest them into Dina trace

255
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:05,405
and then work on the remediations, all those things.

256
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,716
Sharon, awesome, thank you so much, Raj.

257
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,355
So who in here is a cloud, uh,

258
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:11,796
security practitioner? Is anybody a security practitioner?

259
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,735
OK, my friends, my friends, my friends,

260
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:16,275
um, so are any of you guys doing manual

261
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:18,596
processes to remediate configuration issues now?

262
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:21,460
Yes, yes, yes, yes,

263
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,538
OK, so this slide will really resonate

264
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:26,029
with you, right? So today's security cloud challenges,

265
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:28,330
um, having a ton of alerts and alert overload

266
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,729
is huge, right? All of us have all this

267
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:32,080
information flooded and we're not really sure

268
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,379
how to prioritize it, right? So this is where AI and

269
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:36,330
AI workloads are critical now,

270
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:38,663
uh, manual processing. These are still in place uh

271
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,695
that are creating bottlenecks and errors across your

272
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:42,695
teams, um, and again this is just one of

273
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:44,854
the, the many challenges you're seeing now and

274
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:47,244
then having these fragmented workflows that are slowing

275
00:09:47,244 --> 00:09:49,575
your response time to critical configuration

276
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:51,854
issues and, uh, are creating critical gaps

277
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:54,014
in prioritization and actually your overall

278
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:55,234
security posture coverage,

279
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:57,759
um. So this is where

280
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,649
AWS and DynaTrace can help you out.

281
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:02,320
So using AWS Security Hub to

282
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,440
prioritize and understand those critical

283
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,558
security posture issues, we're able to port those

284
00:10:06,558 --> 00:10:09,048
into DynaTrace using EventBridge and Lambda,

285
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:11,719
uh, and then using Open Pipeline, which is a DynaTrace

286
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,759
feature. We're able to contextualize all of

287
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,678
those, uh, security alerts and understand.

288
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:18,234
Their effect against production applications,

289
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:20,604
right? So how important is this actual security

290
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:21,565
alert for me to fix?

291
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:22,504
Very important.

292
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:24,864
And then, as Matt mentioned, storing it in grail, right?

293
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:27,004
So that's how we're able to contextualize it with the rest of

294
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:27,663
the business.

295
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:29,744
And then DynaTrace allows you to visualize,

296
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:32,293
analyze, and of course auto remediate, right,

297
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:34,404
which is the whole purpose of today's

298
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:36,460
flow. So let's talk a little

299
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,450
bit about what this architecture could look like.

300
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,190
Um, so as we're ingesting these security hub

301
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,830
events, uh, into DynaTrace using OCSF

302
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,308
format, um, we can actually run a workflow

303
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:48,509
to help you prioritize and

304
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:50,509
understand the impact of those issues against

305
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,009
your production applications.

306
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,450
Uh, so that workflow will create that Jira ticket,

307
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,629
um, that will basically roll up all of those high

308
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:57,913
priority issues. For one,

309
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:00,734
agent to action on and then using

310
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,864
Dynatrace MCP server and Quiro

311
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:03,423
CLI

312
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:06,014
we're able to actually apply those fixes

313
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:06,884
automatically,

314
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:09,173
right? So think about an agent running, uh, you know,

315
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,875
natural language to remediate these issues automatically

316
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:13,154
and then having those issues

317
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:15,484
closed in AWS security hub and then

318
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:17,183
ultimately closed in DynaTrace.

319
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:19,075
So let's take a look at this live.

320
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,558
So what you'll see here is we're an AWS security hub

321
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:27,808
and we're, we see a couple of critical issues here, right?

322
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:30,210
Related to um an EC2 instance.

323
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:32,609
So we're gonna go into DynaTrace and find

324
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,808
the security hub integration on our hub,

325
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:37,558
and you'll see all these really great out of the box dashboards,

326
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:39,070
right? So kind of plug and play with us.

327
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:42,570
Once you log in here, you'll see those two issues

328
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,678
and. These particular issues are actually a

329
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:46,519
EC-2 port that's open, right?

330
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:49,029
So not something we want to have an EC-2 open to the

331
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:51,719
internet. This workflow is running, contextualizing

332
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:52,239
this issue,

333
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,899
understanding the production impact,

334
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,428
and mirroring it in one Jira ticket

335
00:11:56,428 --> 00:11:58,178
with all of your high priority items.

336
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:00,259
So this is happening automatically in the background.

337
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,239
No need for human intervention.

338
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,158
We can go into Jira and see, um, that

339
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,200
particular, uh, uh, critical issue that we

340
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,440
were looking at, along with all the other high priority

341
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,029
issues that we need to action on.

342
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:13,428
So let's go ahead and auto remediate using QA.

343
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,960
So we're going to pull up that same JIRA ticket that was automatically

344
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,119
created, pull up those high criticality

345
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:21,119
findings. And again, your agent is doing

346
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,038
this, not you.

347
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:24,759
We're going to say, hey, can you verify that this is still an

348
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,759
issue? And that's what's happening here. We're saying,

349
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:29,298
OK, is that port still open on that EC2?

350
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:31,918
The answer is yes. So we need to go ahead and fix

351
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:32,460
it, right?

352
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,479
So from here, we're gonna see what it's uh

353
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,519
affecting in Dynatrace against your production

354
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,700
app. So how critical

355
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,099
is this security issue to the business?

356
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:43,879
And I can see here all the different applications it's

357
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,239
impacting and everything. And again, an agent is running this

358
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,859
completely autonomously.

359
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,509
And then basically all I did was apply the fix.

360
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,788
I said, go ahead and patch this, close these ports,

361
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,479
and it's completed in 1 2nd.

362
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,859
The last thing we're going to do is verify that our

363
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:00,019
fix has taken place and the

364
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,599
security issue is no longer a problem.

365
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,250
And what we'll see here is green.

366
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,889
Green is good. Green means yes,

367
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:08,830
we no longer have this security issue.

368
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:12,330
And then we're going to verify now that this is automatically

369
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,658
closed in DynaTrace.

370
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,808
So again, we went basically like completely autonomously

371
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:18,009
from prioritizing the issue,

372
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:21,190
understanding the impact to completely auto remediating.

373
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,918
So what we're going to do now is go back to security hub

374
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:24,950
and just as a human,

375
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,908
verify that these issues are no longer a problem.

376
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,288
I can see we went from 7 to 5 critical

377
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:30,869
issues

378
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:33,450
and that the 2 that we, we had an issue with

379
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,450
are now automatically resolved. Pretty great,

380
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:37,599
right? And then we'll

381
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,899
go over to Dina Trace

382
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:41,320
and make sure that those issues are also no longer

383
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,879
an issue.

384
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:45,239
And again, totally dropped off our

385
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:47,558
security issue. So an agent

386
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:49,960
completely autonomously did that for you, right,

387
00:13:50,158 --> 00:13:51,000
which is really cool.

388
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,099
Um,

389
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:55,658
so what does this mean? In 2 minutes,

390
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:58,658
we went from understanding the issues, prioritizing

391
00:13:58,658 --> 00:14:01,250
them, understanding the production and business

392
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,658
impact to auto remediating them using,

393
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,779
uh, like, basically agentic AI,

394
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:08,288
right? So that gets you speed, uh,

395
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:09,178
and time to value.

396
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,779
This also gets you efficiency, right, which is reduction

397
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:14,139
in those configuration errors, uh, basically

398
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:16,504
by marrying. That with the Dyna trace observability

399
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:17,033
data

400
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:19,774
and as our systems, thirdly, as

401
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:22,065
our systems continue to scale and get more

402
00:14:22,065 --> 00:14:24,134
complex in the cloud, um, and with

403
00:14:24,134 --> 00:14:26,183
AI systems, every business needs

404
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:28,384
a workflow like this in order to

405
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:28,984
speed up

406
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:31,543
their time to value, right, which ultimately

407
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:33,744
leads us to your acceleration of security

408
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:35,884
posture management within your organization.

409
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:39,009
So if this demo resonated

410
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:39,599
with you,

411
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:41,928
um, please go ahead and scan our QR

412
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:44,038
codes here to check out the integration on the hub. Yes,

413
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,330
I see a few of you scanning. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

414
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:49,048
And then on the right, if you want to check out observability

415
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:49,889
with AWS,

416
00:14:50,168 --> 00:14:51,009
go ahead and do that.

417
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,469
I'll leave it up for a little bit longer for our friends.

418
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:57,830
Awesome. And let me ask one more question. Who could

419
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,918
use this workflow to resolve their issues?

420
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:01,418
Everybody,

421
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,259
right? Literally everyone,

422
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,928
uh, so if you want to see this live and in action,

423
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:08,418
please stop by booth 575. We'd be happy to

424
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:10,469
talk with you and thank you guys so much for your time today.

425
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:10,940
Cheers.
