1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,970
- Hey team, welcome to
our session here today.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,010
I'm really excited to be your host.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,210
My name is Soulat Khan.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,700
I've been with Amazon for
about six and a half years.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,590
I'm with a group of esteemed colleagues

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,980
from some of our select customers.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,520
They're gonna introduce themselves.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,780
And the reason why we have this session is

9
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,510
to have our audiences
learn from the experiences

10
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,030
from our customers and their
transformational journey

11
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,340
with their SAP workloads on AWS.

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,900
So, as a quick introduction,

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,050
I'm gonna have our esteemed
panel introduce themselves,

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,460
and we'll start with Pete,

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,500
we'll go to Purna, and then Simon.

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,887
Pete, over to you.

17
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:35,100
- Thanks, Soulat. So, my
name is Pete Rauchenstein.

18
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,100
I am a cloud engineer slash
SAP basis platform guy

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,020
at Mondelez International.

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,430
If you're not familiar with Mondelez,

21
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,820
we are one of the largest
consumer products companies,

22
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,424
making wonderful, delicious
treats like Oreos, Cadbury,

23
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:53,640
and many other fun goodies.

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,870
Really excited to be here.

25
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,420
- Thanks, Pete. I love all
those goodies too, by the way.

26
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,447
- Hi, I am Purnachand Aravapalli.

27
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:01,364
I work with Colgate-Palmolive

28
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:04,827
as a director for infrastructure
and database architecture.

29
00:01:04,827 --> 00:01:07,920
And you know, the
Colgate-Palmolive is the one

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,883
of the global consumer company
with $20 billion turnover.

31
00:01:14,077 --> 00:01:17,010
- Thanks, Purna. Simon, over to you.

32
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,180
- My name is Simon Davies.

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,360
I am the general manager for
what's known as core banking

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,480
at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

35
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,640
For those of you who aren't
familiar, Commonwealth Bank,

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,060
or CBA, is the largest bank in Australia.

37
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,290
We bank about one in
three people in Australia,

38
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,240
so just to give you an indication.

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,940
- That's amazing, so for the
first part of this section,

40
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,380
I'm gonna ask our colleagues
here what caused them

41
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,620
to choose AWS for their SAP
transformational journey.

42
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,580
A couple of questions,

43
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,410
and just a couple of housekeeping items.

44
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,390
We're not gonna have any Q and
A at the end of this session,

45
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,700
but if you have any
questions, we invite you

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,250
to please join us at Smith
and Wollensky tomorrow.

47
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,810
And if you have any
questions on where to go

48
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,643
and where to sign up,

49
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:01,140
I've got two of our marketing
gentlemen right in the front.

50
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,060
You can come ask them to
make sure you register

51
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,520
and you can access both our customers

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,250
and folks that are from SAP and AWS.

53
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,750
All right, so for our
first question, Simon,

54
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,851
you just introduced yourself

55
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:14,490
from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

56
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,100
This is a company that processes

57
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,830
40% of Australia's transactions.

58
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,680
This is a transaction workload
that is really risk averse.

59
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,160
Can you talk to us about
what made you select AWS

60
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,600
in your transformational journey, please?

61
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,250
- Yeah, so as you said, 40% of
transactions in the economy,

62
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,000
so it's, CBA is Australia's biggest bank,

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,643
almost one in two times money
changes hands in the economy,

64
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:43,387
it goes through our SAP system.

65
00:02:43,387 --> 00:02:46,770
So you buy lunch, buying your groceries,

66
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,000
sending money to people,

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,403
good chance it goes through this system.

68
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,410
So not only is this CBA's
most critical system,

69
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,350
but in a real sense this
underpins the entire economy.

70
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,893
So it was a big decision for us to make.

71
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,641
Just by way of a like frame of reference,

72
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:10,200
core banking transformations
in general, SAP or no,

73
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,480
about 70% of them fail.

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,480
And you often end up
seeing CIOs or CEOs move on

75
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,973
as a result, so quite a big obligation.

76
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:26,550
We chose AWS, I think, for
probably three reasons.

77
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,080
And the first is really
about scale and resilience.

78
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,590
I think AWS were a good
cultural fit for us.

79
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,140
They shared our value
of customer obsession,

80
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,780
and they deeply understood
that the level of obligation

81
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,453
that a workload of this magnitude had.

82
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:46,920
And they had the experience
in running other very,

83
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,640
very large SAP workloads
to give us that trust

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,393
that this would be a
safe place for us to run.

85
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:55,140
I think the second reason is really

86
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,763
in the engineering partnership.

87
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,180
Running a workload of this scale,

88
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,880
it's a little bit different
to your traditional ERP

89
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,213
in that this is like very,

90
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:07,830
a very high throughput online
transaction processing,

91
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,830
really tight NFRs, low
latency online workload.

92
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,680
We knew that we would
need to engineer our way

93
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,700
out of a lot of problems.

94
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,310
And certainly we discovered
quite a few things

95
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,790
that aren't in the
standard SAP architectures

96
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,290
that we needed to work through.

97
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:30,240
And we did things with AWS to
solve some of those problems.

98
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,420
There was a new feature
introduced into EC2 as a result,

99
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,560
which I'm really proud of,

100
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,053
that all SAP customers
can leverage from here.

101
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,360
And that partnership,

102
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,801
having AWS with us every step of the way

103
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:44,730
to tackle those really hard problems,

104
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,590
was really, really important.

105
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,277
And then I think the last one is

106
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:51,480
when we thought about this migration,

107
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,700
it wasn't really just a case

108
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,980
of lift and shifting the technology.

109
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,130
Certainly we had the
same 2027 end of service

110
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,700
that I think a lot of us were
staring down the barrel of

111
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,280
that was the original impetus.

112
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,320
But it was also like an opportunity for us

113
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,670
to be really honest about ourself,

114
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,440
about the state of our technology stack,

115
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,770
which had, we'd lived with
for about a decade and a half,

116
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,330
and we came from sort of mainframe
and mid-range rock solid.

117
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,640
But characteristically,
rocks are not known

118
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,383
for their flexibility or agility.

119
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,577
And that was certainly true of
our operations, quite siloed.

120
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,410
We had eight different teams

121
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,390
that ran the stack, top to bottom.

122
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,970
They all spoke different
and obscure languages.

123
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,910
It was really difficult to
like coordinate between them

124
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,293
or get anything done.

125
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:43,260
Moving to S/4 on AWS
gave us the opportunity

126
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,780
to look at this from a
full stack perspective.

127
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,390
But not just with that
workload in isolation either,

128
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,980
but we could land it in an ecosystem

129
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,839
that was constantly evolving
and innovating itself

130
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,729
and allow us to take advantage of the best

131
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:00,343
that AWS have to offer, and
more seamlessly integrate

132
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:03,090
with the rest of our workloads,

133
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,060
be it our digital channels
or some of the work

134
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,093
that we're doing in the
agentic and AI space.

135
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,380
So yeah, definitely AWS, we
thought, was a good partner,

136
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,380
not just to run this safely,
but to run it in bold new ways.

137
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,510
- That's excellent, Simon.
Those are some really nice gems.

138
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,340
Thank you for selecting AWS.

139
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,350
So the audience, just to summarize,

140
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,230
if you are going through
your selection process,

141
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,620
looking for a partner, a
cultural fit is really important.

142
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,630
I heard Simon say that, it's really good.

143
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,070
Not only is it leadership principles,

144
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,630
but having an innovation partner

145
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,090
where you can work backwards
from your customer needs,

146
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,820
like co-development of EC2
health monitor health checks,

147
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,590
which is really important as well.

148
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,423
And then for scale,

149
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:46,890
so experience in scale
is really important.

150
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,010
I would tell you if the
audience here in the room

151
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,526
is thinking about going to
move their SAP workloads

152
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:56,310
or move into S/4HANA,
or even consider RISE,

153
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,350
that's a workload that you
really want to be active

154
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,420
and functioning at all times.

155
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,690
And you heard from Simon
on the choice that CBA made

156
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,240
for selecting to run their
SAP workloads on AWS.

157
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,300
That's great, Simon. Pete, over to you.

158
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,790
You've got some experience
running SAP in the cloud already.

159
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,950
Can you talk a little bit about
your journey and what came

160
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,928
to selecting AWS?
- Sure.

161
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:18,019
I think it's really
important to understand

162
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:19,500
that everyone's got a little bit

163
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,810
of a different starting
point to their journey.

164
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,470
Mondelez is, if people
haven't heard of that name,

165
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,390
it's 'cause it's only been
around about 16 years.

166
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,100
It's really a combination

167
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,560
of the Kraft North America business

168
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,140
and the Cadbury business in Europe

169
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,090
and other parts of the world.

170
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,780
And as a result, a lot
of our core systems are,

171
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,120
they have different approaches
that have grown over time.

172
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,097
And part of our journey,

173
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:47,250
and I think the challenge
is how do you go from,

174
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,450
I have some systems that are

175
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,060
on a legacy on-prem data center,

176
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,500
and then I have other systems

177
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,070
where we did a number of
migrations to the cloud earlier

178
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,486
on a different hyperscaler.

179
00:07:57,486 --> 00:08:00,150
Started that journey, I think, in 2017,

180
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,593
a little bit before my time.

181
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,020
But I think it was clear

182
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,010
that running things differently
wasn't really going to scale

183
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,290
as we wanted to continue our journey.

184
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,840
Now that, I kind of pause and let's talk

185
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,510
about just why AWS first.
- Love to hear that

186
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,040
- Because I think there's kind of

187
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,960
two different conversations.
- Yep.

188
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,780
- About four years ago,
some of my colleagues and I,

189
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,010
who are all here in the audience,

190
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,200
joined Mondelez to really stand up

191
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,110
an internal cloud
engineering organization.

192
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,000
And a lot of what Simon
was just talking about

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,037
really resonates, about having
a consistent operating model.

194
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:36,600
One of the things that
we're really proud of is

195
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,360
that everything that we have done in AWS,

196
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,920
with the exception of the vending

197
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,930
of the very first root account,

198
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,570
has all been done using
infrastructure as code

199
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,365
and the Account Factory for Terraform.

200
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:51,390
We've had a wonderful
partnership from day one

201
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,860
with AWS Pro Service.

202
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,260
We've set up kind of this
really awesome plumbing

203
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,160
where we can go from
requirement to realization,

204
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,830
in many cases, in less than a few hours.

205
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,090
It's a really funny story.

206
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,830
My boss actually deployed some servers

207
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,290
from his son's soccer
game, from his phone,

208
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,760
with some of the tooling that we've built.

209
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,087
So that's really interesting.

210
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:13,443
But a lot of that focus
was on the non-SAP stacks.

211
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,933
We have started recently
our journey to S/4HANA.

212
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,970
Again, if this were just a
straight upgrade process,

213
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,790
it would probably be a much
less difficult journey.

214
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,310
But because we're sort of
addressing some of the,

215
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,830
what I'll call foundational
issues of the past,

216
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,940
of having different systems

217
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,290
that were built by different teams

218
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,660
over different times in
different hyperscalers

219
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,464
with different OSs and different versions,

220
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:42,510
there's a lot of just
foundational harmonization work

221
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,120
that is happening at the same time

222
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,360
that we are also going to S/4 on RISE,

223
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,630
so new ways of working for
the entire organization.

224
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,630
You've got a very experienced
basis and platform team

225
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,623
that works with us.

226
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,780
And I think it's somewhere
in the neighborhood

227
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,540
of like 425 years of combined experience,

228
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,640
so we're very, very-
- Awesome.

229
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,030
- We're very, very particular
about how things are done.

230
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,653
And so shifting to RISE,

231
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,040
running those workloads
in a new hyperscaler

232
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,860
with a new way of working, that
added a little bit of risk.

233
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,720
So for us, it was really important

234
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,570
to build on the wonderful relationship

235
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,549
that we started developing
with AWS in 2021

236
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:27,810
to be able to say, "Well,
how can we de-risk this?

237
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,690
How can we make this easier
for the organization?"

238
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,523
Having a trusted partner
like AWS to help us navigate,

239
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:36,060
hey, have we set everything up correctly

240
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,410
from an infrastructure perspective?

241
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,150
Does our landing zone look correct?

242
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,270
Hey, we have to have capacity
reservation conversations.

243
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,190
Some of our colleagues here have helped us

244
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,000
in many, many ways, helping
SAP even beat their own SLAs

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,385
for delivering some of
that infrastructure.

246
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:50,477
- Awesome, excellent.
- So building on

247
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:51,930
that trusted partnership

248
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,990
and having people that know
us has been really awesome.

249
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,910
- That's great, Pete, thank you so much.

250
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,743
That's really awesome.

251
00:10:57,743 --> 00:11:00,417
I mean, I love the
comment you made earlier

252
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:01,860
and resonates with me is

253
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,230
that everyone has a
different starting line,

254
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,360
but it's the journey that really matters.

255
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,530
And speaking of the journey,

256
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,840
I'd love to have Purna share your journey.

257
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,120
I think I caught up with
you a little bit earlier

258
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,730
and I learned that you kind
of made the decision of AWS

259
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,500
coming to re:Invent just last year.

260
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,110
So I'd love to learn a little
bit more about that, Purna.

261
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,720
- Yeah, so again, the good point mentioned

262
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,110
by Simon and Peter, we
have different perspectives

263
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,460
and different journeys started.

264
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,933
So from the Colgate, it's
a 250-year-old company,

265
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,280
serving across world, 200
countries and territories.

266
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,220
So our mission is like
re-imagining the healthier future

267
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,590
for all the people,
their pets, and planet.

268
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,140
It's a strong statement from Colgate,

269
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,570
so we have been, it's always
been the transformation.

270
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,570
You can imagine companies
surviving for 250 years

271
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,940
has been going through
the great transformation.

272
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,030
So we started our journey.

273
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,280
So currently we have six
production landscapes running

274
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,480
on RISE on the AWS platform.

275
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,400
We are going to migrate another
eight systems by mid 2027,

276
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,300
including our most critical
transactional systems.

277
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,200
So we are going good.

278
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,660
So we have the, we are on the
plans, everything going good.

279
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,510
So then the point, your point,

280
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,620
how did we start that, right?

281
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,590
So we have been there, we
have been in the cloud.

282
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,990
So the first thing, so we went with the,

283
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,010
when we started the things,

284
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,841
we were brainstorming
internally and we decided,

285
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:27,480
so okay, these are the
things we want to go with.

286
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,780
So the first thing is that
the performance, right?

287
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,280
Where do we get the performance?

288
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,353
Always what we say is the same or better.

289
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,040
So we have the, again,
like Simon mentioned,

290
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,540
that we are rock solid on-prem.

291
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,590
So we are running, we are
with the systems like IBM.

292
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,970
But transformation is important.

293
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,340
So then we decided, okay,
let's go with the performance.

294
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,877
And the second one is with
the roadmap aligned with SAPs.

295
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:53,017
And the performance,
when we were looking at

296
00:12:53,017 --> 00:12:54,996
what we are done, we had
done the benchmarking

297
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:57,420
across the comparable workloads.

298
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,900
So we have seen AWS has
met that expectations.

299
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,030
So we have seen the desirable performance,

300
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,910
so that gave us confidence
to go in the scale.

301
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,130
So when we wanted to run large systems,

302
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,510
that gave us confidence.

303
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,980
And also the roadmap that
SAP has aligned with AWS

304
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,960
is also gave us confidence.

305
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,230
And the other thing is that we
want to diversify the cloud.

306
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,580
Diversification is important.

307
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,388
That is our company strategy,
so that is one of the things.

308
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:28,317
So all together came up, really
gave us the path to do this.

309
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,419
And again, just to add that
we migrated our systems

310
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:36,720
to S/4 in 2019.

311
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,607
So we always work very
closely with our partners.

312
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:44,340
We don't call as vendors,
we call it as partners.

313
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,730
So when we started SAP, so we did in 2019,

314
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,790
so for our business case
was only to go to cloud.

315
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,370
So we are, we had our
business case covered

316
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,170
in the transformation.
- I'm jealous.

317
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,660
- Yeah, it was not easy

318
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,440
because you always, you can
show the benefits with the,

319
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,780
what do you call S/4 transformation

320
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,913
and cloud together, right?

321
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:06,300
For us, the challenge is that,

322
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,430
oh, you have transformation
already for five years,

323
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,263
how do you do that?

324
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:11,142
So that's where those three principles,

325
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:15,314
and also the same or
better, clearly helped us.

326
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:19,470
We are running six systems
so far, we are doing that.

327
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,940
- That's awesome, Purna.
Thanks for sharing that.

328
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,620
I'm jealous too, that's pretty amazing

329
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,000
that you guys started in the cloud

330
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,710
and moving into transformation.

331
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,030
That was really good.

332
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,080
So like Amazon has a
lot of programs to offer

333
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,470
to SAP customers and really
to all enterprise customers,

334
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,360
whether it's in the areas of assessments,

335
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,250
or building business cases,

336
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,085
or helping you accelerate
your migration journey

337
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:43,800
with our partners or directly
with our services teams.

338
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,500
And the next couple of set
of questions are really

339
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,910
to kind of get a lessons learned.

340
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,010
Like did you use some of the programs?

341
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,990
Did you get some good experiences?

342
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,170
What could you share with our audience

343
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,250
from your transformation journey?

344
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,380
I'll start off with Pete.

345
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,500
Pete, love to learn about
what kind of programs worked

346
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,150
for you and any lessons learned you'd like

347
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,370
to share with the crowd.

348
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,410
- Sure, I mean, I think the biggest one

349
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,940
that has been very successful for us

350
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,270
has been our relationship with
AWS Professional Services.

351
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,360
They have been with us from day one,

352
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,670
and really working with
our core engineering team,

353
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,770
pushing the boundaries of what's possible

354
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,716
and how do I do this.

355
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:24,900
I think we even have weekly
office hours still to this day,

356
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,670
four years in, where we're learning

357
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,560
about the latest techniques.

358
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,660
We have a chance to ask questions,

359
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,013
to work on things together.

360
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,130
One of our colleagues who has been with us

361
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,630
pretty much from the first, from day one,

362
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,609
is still here with us today,
here at AWS re:Invent.

363
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:43,620
So having that kind of
deep personal relationship

364
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,764
has been really, really wonderful.

365
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:48,543
I would also say like for us,

366
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,560
maybe not an AWS-specific
specific program,

367
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,800
but using forums like this

368
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,560
to meet other leaders in the space.

369
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,022
We have a relationship with an SI partner.

370
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:08,520
Am I allowed to say names?
- Yes, you can.

371
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,730
- Lemongrass, who we
met here at re:Invent,

372
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,320
four years ago, I believe.

373
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,170
And again, the question was who's the best

374
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,970
at taking SAP to the cloud.

375
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,700
We know that's gonna
be a thing for us soon,

376
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,380
so building that relationship

377
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,650
and finding people that think
about systems engineering

378
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,800
and automation the same way that we do.

379
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,650
Everything that we want to
be able to do is about scale,

380
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,750
doing things in a repeatable way,

381
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,112
leveraging IAC principles where we can,

382
00:16:36,112 --> 00:16:39,060
automating the mundane
so that we can focus

383
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,783
on those really truly transformational

384
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:43,065
value-added activities.

385
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:45,585
Getting a chance to
meet partners like that

386
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:47,730
here at re:Invent has been wonderful.

387
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,240
And of course having
access to a broad array

388
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,680
of subject matter experts,

389
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,410
people who can maybe take a
look under the hood at some

390
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,140
of the things that we've done
in RISE, offer suggestions,

391
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,320
find things that may or
may not be issues later,

392
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,020
but it's always good to walk
into things eyes wide open.

393
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,300
- That's excellent. Thanks
for sharing that, Pete.

394
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,130
Simon, I'll ask you a question.

395
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,455
Can you touch on some of the
quantitative improvements

396
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:13,680
and organizational change you've seen

397
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,840
by moving your transformation
journey forward?

398
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,630
Love to learn from you and your team.

399
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,743
- Yeah, absolutely.

400
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,703
I'd probably look at this
through three lenses, right?

401
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,140
The first one, I think, is
performance improvements.

402
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,870
This was certainly a
system of record for us,

403
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,760
our most critical system of record.

404
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,760
But increasingly, we wanted to turn it

405
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,340
into like a system of intelligence.

406
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,210
We wanted to do more things
with deep personalization,

407
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,950
behavioral banking, and
that requires grunt, right?

408
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,490
So what we actually saw
moving away from our legacy,

409
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,490
like DB2 on mainframe
R/3 stack to S/4 on AWS,

410
00:17:55,632 --> 00:17:57,810
we got about a 30% improvement,

411
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,920
and that was for both online,
like web service traffic,

412
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,070
but also web services would obviously

413
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,360
improve their response time,

414
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,370
and it kinda manifests most readily

415
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,740
in things like balance updates happen

416
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,000
a lot faster than they used to.

417
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,710
Previously, someone would make a payment

418
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,480
and then they'd have to
kind of refresh the screen

419
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,890
to see their balance update.

420
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,290
Now that happens straight away.

421
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,990
It also enables sort of
more inline processing,

422
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,430
things like fraud checks, et cetera,

423
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,110
that can happen in real time.

424
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,170
But also like for the batch workload,

425
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,450
that also happens much more quickly.

426
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,130
And it allows us to do things

427
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,090
like increasingly do
customer-based pricing,

428
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,490
which requires millions and millions

429
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,920
of recalculations every day

430
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,690
to determine what is the best price

431
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,733
for a given customer segment.

432
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,870
And we got a quite a bit
more headroom with this move

433
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,460
that allows us to do more

434
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,713
in those batch windows, which is great.

435
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,340
Resilience, I think, is the second lens.

436
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,230
And we sort of touched
on that a little bit

437
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,610
in terms of the operating model,

438
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,140
but I think one of the other things

439
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,400
that I'm really proud
of with this move was,

440
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,230
our recovery time objective previously,

441
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,580
if we were to do a site swap,

442
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,220
RTO was about an hour and a half.

443
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,710
We used to like rehearse this every year,

444
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,380
and it'd be a bit of a
manufactured exercise.

445
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,080
Everyone would get at their
keyboards, get warmed up,

446
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,660
they've got their coffee,
they've got their run sheet,

447
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,130
start your engines.

448
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,990
And in that manner, we could kind

449
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,000
of like choreograph the entire thing

450
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,160
and execute it in about 30 minutes.

451
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,191
It's pretty good, but
it's a bit artificial.

452
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:35,100
When we moved to S/4, like out of the box,

453
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,027
we were seeing about a 16-minute
failover when we did HANA,

454
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:41,520
15, 16 minutes, still pretty good,

455
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,060
but like I said, very,
very downtime sensitive,

456
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,680
a sensitive environment in banking,

457
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,270
we wanted to optimize
that a little bit more.

458
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,270
So we did some deep engineering with SAP,

459
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,970
with Red Hat, and with AWS,

460
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,139
and we actually pushed in a
whole bunch of improvements

461
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:04,470
at the both, at the Red Hat kernel level

462
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,350
to Pacemaker, to that config,

463
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,150
and as I said, an enhancement to EC2

464
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,020
with the skip shutdown
feature that was released.

465
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,730
So it's awesome to see some of the work

466
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,563
that we've done-
- That's excellent.

467
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:16,993
- To try to push the boundaries

468
00:20:16,993 --> 00:20:19,289
make its way back into the main code line

469
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:22,797
for these software vendors and for AWS,

470
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:25,710
and we can see that
all customers in future

471
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,790
will be able to benefit from

472
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,623
some of this innovation.
- That's great.

473
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:28,858
- Which is awesome.

474
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:30,030
And I think the last,

475
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,653
the last thing I'd probably
call out here is efficiency.

476
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,130
I mean, firstly,
infrastructure efficiency.

477
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,280
We came from very, very
expensive specialized compute.

478
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,660
That's not gonna be true for everyone.

479
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,190
But the move to Commodity
X86 saw a 30% reduction

480
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,160
in just infrastructure
costs, which is wild.

481
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,740
But more than that, I like Pete's journey,

482
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,480
'cause we had a very similar approach,

483
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,490
it was automate everything top to bottom.

484
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,960
And that's not just provisioning,

485
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,940
but our operations as well.

486
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,822
So it's things like scale
out, restart, fail over,

487
00:21:03,822 --> 00:21:08,220
start, stop, cluster moves,
all of this kind of stuff.

488
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,620
And what that did was it took out hundreds

489
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,060
of manual touch points

490
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,130
per month.
- That's excellent.

491
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,230
- And it moved us to just executing

492
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,300
these automated pipelines.

493
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,837
Our focus is now less
about keeping the lights on

494
00:21:21,837 --> 00:21:25,470
and we get to focus more
now on building what's next.

495
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,780
And one of the things we
talked about this morning

496
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,360
was got a real focus now on AI ops.

497
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,700
How do we build a system
that detects anomalies

498
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,190
and learns and takes action?

499
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,780
So that's what I'm really excited about.

500
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,613
- That's really excellent.

501
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,990
Yeah, I've heard you mention
resiliency a couple of times,

502
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,313
and I love the perspective

503
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:44,550
that it's not only being
resilient within your environment,

504
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,110
but also in your operations

505
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,240
and your daily activities
that can be automated as well.

506
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,500
I love hearing that.

507
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
And Purna, you mentioned
you've got a number

508
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,890
of environments running in the cloud.

509
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,650
Can you kind of touch on which
programs worked well for you,

510
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,750
and kind of lessons learned

511
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,413
in moving that journey into AWS as well?

512
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:04,413
- Yeah, sure, so we
started this AWS journey,

513
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,910
mainly specific SAP RISE, early,
first quarter of this year.

514
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,040
So you can imagine like it is six months,

515
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,450
within almost eight months,

516
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,280
we migrated six production landscapes.

517
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
- That's pretty big.

518
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,350
- And again, we have a strong cloud team,

519
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,360
so they understand the cloud very well,

520
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,410
the cloud technologies,

521
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:25,080
but we are kind of something new to AWS.

522
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,323
So for us, the enablement was key because,

523
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,620
and we had very limited time
to get into that, right?

524
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,080
So considering that critically
of SAP applications,

525
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,370
so the focus was to get that support,

526
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,920
ensure that we have everything needed

527
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,330
for the RISE migrations.

528
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,670
So it's like crawl, walk, and run.

529
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,170
So we started on those things.

530
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,350
So we used the immersion days

531
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,450
and AWS Well-Architected Framework

532
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,820
and help from account team.

533
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,420
So initially the main key was
with the connectivity, right?

534
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,170
So for the users to connect

535
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:04,170
with our existing infrastructure to AWS,

536
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,840
it was key for the
performance and everything.

537
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,360
So we worked closely with AWS,

538
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,780
we had a workshop very
quickly, like on-prem workshop.

539
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,240
They flew, they had like
multiple discussions

540
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,150
and we were discussing about
the connectivity patterns,

541
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,340
so the size of different options.

542
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,327
So finally we could deploy
the interconnect very fast

543
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:25,420
and we could run it very well.

544
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,953
So it helped us in the
performance area as well.

545
00:23:30,593 --> 00:23:32,062
And in addition to that,

546
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:36,090
the support from the AWS
account team was very good.

547
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,310
So they have been helping us throughout.

548
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:42,120
So we have like, even
we go through SAP RISE,

549
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,670
we do have regular
calls with the AWS team,

550
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,290
and they do discuss the requirements,

551
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,190
they understand what
is coming new with us.

552
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,429
And they had a couple of sessions too,

553
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:54,510
mainly on the security side.

554
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,470
So we are working on,

555
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,160
we are trying to build
our AWS security posture.

556
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,223
We are going to, that is
something really helped us.

557
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,103
- That's really good.

558
00:24:04,103 --> 00:24:07,350
So immersion days,
well-architected reviews

559
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,700
are all service offerings

560
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,300
that anybody in our audience
can choose to leverage.

561
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,270
These are offered at no cost
and they're complimentary.

562
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,880
My team leads them, your
account teams can lead them,

563
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,490
and we can bring in our
innovation roadmap to go through

564
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,860
where it makes sense to
deliver your business outcomes.

565
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,390
- Yeah, and just to add one more point,

566
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,580
we were doing the proof of concept,

567
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,770
like before deciding RISE.

568
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,960
So the team was, when we were working,

569
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,854
were so much comfortable.

570
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:35,700
They could talk in the customer language.

571
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,560
- Loving that.
- So sometimes it's hard

572
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,150
to get like why to,

573
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,150
because every enterprise
has their own requirement.

574
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,750
So we see that the AWS team

575
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,720
could understand the
requirements and help us,

576
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,070
like what is needed,

577
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,980
and ensure that even the
testing was successful.

578
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,030
- That's excellent.

579
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,760
Yeah, working backwards from
customer requirements is key.

580
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,160
In fact, one of the biggest
announcements we made this year

581
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,010
was our AI co-innovation program with SAP,

582
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,780
where we work with our
customers and partners

583
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,030
to build out their agentic capability,

584
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,270
leveraging SAPs full
stack, and AWS full stack.

585
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,610
And on topic of
modernization and innovation,

586
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,190
I'd love to hear from our
panel your perspective

587
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,660
of what it means to modernize.

588
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,599
Simon, if I might, starting off with you,

589
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,460
core banking innovation is pretty big,

590
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,440
and pretty huge and close to your heart.

591
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,970
We'd love to learn about what is,

592
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,850
what's happening next in
the modernization journey

593
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,250
for core banking, with respect to CBA,

594
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,050
and really the economy in Australia.

595
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:36,240
- Yeah, I mean, I think, like
you said, it's a journey.

596
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,353
And even getting here, we
definitely learned a lot.

597
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,220
AI certainly being a thing
we experimented deeply with,

598
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,957
with how we use this for building

599
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:53,400
more robust automated test cases,

600
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,280
as well as increasing
engineering productivity

601
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,110
for a lot of the code remediation

602
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,180
that we needed to do with the move.

603
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,570
And I think the state of the art

604
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,820
for the tools changes so rapidly.

605
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,160
We started off with Amazon Q

606
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,960
and we had kind of mixed success.

607
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,610
We also experimented a little bit

608
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,723
with tools like Roo and
Cline, or GitHub Copilot.

609
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,726
We've got some sort of clunky
workflows at the moment.

610
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:24,030
A lot of these plugins
don't exist for Eclipse,

611
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,470
so we end up with this situation

612
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,260
where developers are using VS code,

613
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,550
and then copying and pasting

614
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,610
from VS code into Eclipse to push changes.

615
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,600
So you can imagine, from a
developer experience perspective,

616
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,830
you get a little bit of pushback,

617
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,450
but the people who are
really, really keen,

618
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,450
they get really excited and
they can live with that.

619
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,476
But that can only get better.

620
00:26:45,476 --> 00:26:46,886
But then we, you think about

621
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:49,350
beyond the actual implementation

622
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,314
and change on the system itself.

623
00:26:51,314 --> 00:26:52,890
What this system is,

624
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,140
is not just like our
biggest system of record,

625
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,170
it's about 90% of all of our customer

626
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,260
and account and transactional data in CBA.

627
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,850
You really need to think about it

628
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,930
as the richest source of
customer behavioral insights

629
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,240
that we have in the bank.

630
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,650
We often hear it said that
data is the fuel for AI.

631
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,120
There is no higher octane
fuel than what we have here,

632
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,652
so really being able to
exploit that is important.

633
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:24,690
Historically, there was
sort of high friction

634
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,400
with getting access to that data

635
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,020
and that was a combination of,

636
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,850
in kind of a lockdown ecosystem,

637
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,400
but also some like performance constraints

638
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,880
on being able to push data out en masse.

639
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,770
With the move that we've made here,

640
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,500
we can actually event
everything that comes out

641
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,630
of this system in real time,

642
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,200
makes a real live signals
coming out of this system,

643
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,870
tested up to about 5,000
transactions per second.

644
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,720
- That's amazing.

645
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,430
- So it means that we can
get that customer data

646
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,360
to our data scientists,
to other engineering teams

647
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,972
who are building new agentic solutions

648
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:05,610
a lot faster than we
were ever able to before.

649
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,990
So straight out of HANA to Amazon MSK,

650
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,750
we can push it through
like Kinesis to SageMaker,

651
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,160
and increasingly we're doing things

652
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,600
with Bedrock and AgentCore
as we sort of imagine

653
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,233
what the next decade of
agentic banking might mean,

654
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,190
and experimenting with
Bedrock and AgentCore

655
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,520
and what capabilities that
will give us to deliver

656
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,150
more hyper-personalized
behavioral banking experiences,

657
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,540
like intelligent experiences
to our customers.

658
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,120
So we think the potential is huge,

659
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,990
and this one move that we've
made to something so critical,

660
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,110
certainly, to CBA has
just been foundational.

661
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,670
I think it's gonna unlock,

662
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,580
like I said, the next decade for us.

663
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,563
- That's excellent, I can feel the passion

664
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:54,450
and it's a really exciting space.

665
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,460
I would say to the audience, and Simon,

666
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,600
I'm gonna follow up with you as well.

667
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,750
We recently announced full
support for ABAP in Amazon Q Dev,

668
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,520
including the Eclipse plugin,

669
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,660
and we have a lot more planned.

670
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,040
So if anyone's interested,

671
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,170
we actually have a developer workshop.

672
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,130
I think we call it a,

673
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,380
I think it's called Developer
Workshop on a Chalk Talk,

674
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,260
where you can actually go
hands on keys with Amazon Q Dev

675
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,780
and start building out some
of those workflows yourself.

676
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,480
So I highly encourage our
audience to try that out.

677
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,430
And I love hearing the
modernization capability

678
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,050
that you have available.

679
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,780
We also have a lot planned around Strands

680
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,810
and AgentCore within Bedrock

681
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,640
to help you manage those agents as well.

682
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,620
So everybody who's listening in,

683
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,480
please keep a close eye on that space.

684
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,570
We'll have a few
announcements coming out soon.

685
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,600
Purna, I'd love to hear your
perspective on modernization,

686
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,800
what services you're leveraging
at Colgate-Palmolive too.

687
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,273
- Yeah, so for us, AWS is like
for SAP RISE core platform,

688
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,320
because SAP systems generally are the key,

689
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,033
the central thing where you get the data

690
00:29:55,033 --> 00:29:57,450
and the data goes into the systems, right?

691
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,990
So what we are doing
currently is that, again,

692
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,520
our journey is just started,

693
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,607
so currently we are using
like a compli services,

694
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:08,730
AWS services complimentary
for RISE platform.

695
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,420
So one of the example, the
thing we started is like

696
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,760
for SAP systems to run,
we need like storage,

697
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,557
or compute for the system
to connect, like NetApp,

698
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,479
printing all of the services,

699
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:23,100
so we are trying to use those services,

700
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,321
we are using actually.

701
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:28,860
We are using those services
and they're helping us to,

702
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,050
it's a kind of a transformation

703
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,370
slowly getting into the cloud,

704
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,343
the other components spending and on-prem.

705
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,480
In parallel, we are also
doing the data collection,

706
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,110
what we call that.

707
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,930
So we have systems running
in different locations.

708
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,870
What do you call, like
on-prem or different places?

709
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:52,770
We are collecting the data
related to network storage,

710
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,330
how much data is getting transferred,

711
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,529
egress or ingress, the latency,
so we have applications.

712
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:59,949
We are evaluating those things like,

713
00:30:59,949 --> 00:31:04,350
what components should be very
closer, what can be things.

714
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,930
So I think that way is
going to give us the clarity

715
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,120
to move the systems, some of
the systems into AWS proper,

716
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,620
what we call our own accounts.

717
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,700
So then run it, right?

718
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,340
So I think including AI as well.

719
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:25,340
So it would give us to leverage
AWS AI capabilities also.

720
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,170
And one more thing to tell,

721
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:31,290
we have our branding
websites for multiple brands,

722
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,833
they already run on AWS,
so they're helping us

723
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:38,573
with the global reach in
the strong performance,

724
00:31:38,573 --> 00:31:40,603
and even for the brand advocacy.

725
00:31:40,603 --> 00:31:42,007
So even that is one thing.
- Gotcha, good performance.

726
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:44,880
- Yeah, so we started with RISE,

727
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,970
but we do know, like
we have AWS, it's not,

728
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,927
it's not easy to avoid AWS, right?

729
00:31:49,927 --> 00:31:51,467
(panelists laugh)
- I like that, okay.

730
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:53,996
- So AWS touches everything.
- Gotcha.

731
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,703
So that's where we can say

732
00:31:55,703 --> 00:31:58,650
that our business is
happy with those things.

733
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,790
- Excellent, love hearing that.

734
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,660
- That's what we could share.

735
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,790
- So not only do you run
your enterprise workloads,

736
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,160
but your company's website,
your marketing platforms,

737
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,310
all consume AWS services, okay, excellent.

738
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:11,310
Pete, can you talk to
us about your tooling,

739
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,070
your automation, talk about other services

740
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,040
that help you complement your
SAP and SP workloads too?

741
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,540
I'd love to hear your perspective.

742
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,400
- Sure, I mean, I think a lot of

743
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,490
what Simon was talking
about resonates pretty well,

744
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,160
maybe less on the SAP
development side and more on just

745
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,370
how we do core cloud
infrastructure management.

746
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,950
Again, everything infrastructure is code,

747
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,830
a nice machine from GitHub.

748
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,360
We use a tool called Spacelift for all

749
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,880
of our Terraform automation
and software deployment.

750
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,243
And then creating those
different accounts in AWS.

751
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,540
A lot of what we've dipped
our toe into recently

752
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,520
has been with Amazon Q,

753
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,680
maybe because we're not
writing ABAP in that yet.

754
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,410
We haven't had some of the
fun things that Simon's found.

755
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,910
But I'm very interested
in the plug that you gave

756
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,920
about the workshop.
- Let's do that.

757
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,260
- I kinda wanna learn more about that.

758
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,910
But yeah, a lot of developer
efficiencies coming from that.

759
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,250
As someone who is, you know,

760
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,050
I don't get to write a lot
of Terraform these days,

761
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,870
a little less than I used
to, but when I'm struggling

762
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,820
with some sort of a complex map object,

763
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,885
oh, what's the most
efficient way to build this?

764
00:33:13,885 --> 00:33:17,647
Something that I think I
spent literally eight hours

765
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:20,160
at re:Invent a couple
years ago working on,

766
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,800
I did a similar thing in about
10 minutes with Amazon Q.

767
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,960
So that was kind of fun.

768
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,550
- I love hearing that.
- A nice plug of

769
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,450
finding the right prompt

770
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,710
to ask the question.
- Definitely.

771
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,150
- Instead of having to
ask my colleague Zach,

772
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,060
who's in the audience, "Hey
Zach, how do you do this?"

773
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,183
So I think that's one thing
that's really important.

774
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:41,670
But other things that we're
doing with our journey to RISE,

775
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,940
not every one of our SAP
workloads is gonna land in RISE.

776
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,787
We have some specific
workloads that SAP has said,

777
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:50,580
"You know what, that probably makes sense

778
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,110
for you to host it yourself."

779
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,850
So it has been a lot of fun.

780
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,730
Again, a shameless plug
for our partner Lemongrass,

781
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,520
working with them on
really revamping the way

782
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,100
that we are delivering
workloads in the cloud.

783
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,640
They have their own, I'll
call it infrastructure

784
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,460
and SAP initial deployment
automated solution

785
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,120
that you can go from basically
a well-defined JSON document

786
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,760
to a working, installed vanilla SAP system

787
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,440
in a couple of hours, from
infrastructure provisioning,

788
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,930
all of your user accounts
set up at the OS level,

789
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,730
all of your DB users,

790
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,860
very, very repeatable, highly scalable.

791
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,865
And again, it allows our
teams on the functional side

792
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:30,690
to start working sooner.

793
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,994
So it's about accelerating time to value.

794
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:35,130
- That's great to hear.
- In a way that's consistent,

795
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,800
repeatable, and easy to execute.

796
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,617
And I think we find a
lot of value in that,

797
00:34:39,617 --> 00:34:41,910
'cause we're able to
take a lot of the tooling

798
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:42,960
that we've already built out

799
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,540
for some of our non-SAP applications

800
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,780
and apply those same
techniques and principles.

801
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,980
It's a little different, but
it's more same than it is not.

802
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,180
So I think that's kinda cool.

803
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,480
And then I think last
one, it's been really fun

804
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,840
to watch SAP's journey as
they talk about clean core,

805
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,020
all of the work on the
business technology platform.

806
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,530
I know they do all of their
initial development in AWS,

807
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,040
I don't know why, I think we all know why.

808
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,890
So it's been fun to see not
only the new capabilities

809
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:14,970
that they are delivering,

810
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:18,000
but then also to see that oh
they have a Terraform provider.

811
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,270
We can find new ways to do the same things

812
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,730
and take those same
infrastructures code principles

813
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,670
and instead of, "Oh I need
a new BTP sub account,

814
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,020
will you do this for me manually?"

815
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,000
from a click ops perspective,

816
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,220
we take those existing
pipelines that we've written.

817
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,960
- That's great. Yep.
- Quick pull request.

818
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,677
A great example for
some of you who've been,

819
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:36,750
if anyone's familiar

820
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,290
with the new business
data cloud product, BDC,

821
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,910
one of the tools in there is Datasphere.

822
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,150
We did a POC earlier
this year on Datasphere,

823
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,707
and we were on a call with the
SAP team and they were like,

824
00:35:47,707 --> 00:35:50,040
"Well, we need a new sub account,
can you vend this for us?

825
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,270
It'll probably take you about a week."

826
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,290
And I asked a few questions,

827
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,757
and then by the end of the meeting,

828
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:56,850
"Well, I've already vended
your account, here it is."

829
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,040
- I love that.
- It's ready to go.

830
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,400
- That's fantastic.
- So finding ways

831
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,660
to accelerate the easy stuff, it's a lot,

832
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,330
you have to go slow at the
beginning to go fast later,

833
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,760
but we're having a lot
of fun moving fast now.

834
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,320
- That's excellent. I
love hearing that journey.

835
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,700
Thank you so much, Pete.

836
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,870
ICP does build first on
AWS for a lot of reasons.

837
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,240
We're a first class, well
SAP's a first-class citizen

838
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,400
for AWS workloads as well.

839
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,850
We've got a robust roadmap of
innovation, joint innovation,

840
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,320
for those in the audience.

841
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,770
Anytime we launch a region,
we ensure that those systems

842
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,440
that support SAP
workloads, RISE and native,

843
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,510
are accessible and
available at launch date.

844
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:36,450
So love hearing that conversation as well.

845
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,470
All right, we're gonna move on

846
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,450
to wrapping up this customer panel.

847
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,050
I'm like to ask each
of our guests on stage

848
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,600
sort of a personal lesson in the journey,

849
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,380
for both transforming
your business to consume

850
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,950
and work with SAP in AWS,
but also in the organization.

851
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:56,040
Like from all that you've
learned and experienced,

852
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,520
what would you advise your
audience to take home with them?

853
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,803
I'll start with you, Steve.

854
00:37:02,464 --> 00:37:07,110
- I mean, I guess I would
say the biggest thing for me,

855
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,500
I've always been in roles
where I've had to be sort

856
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,540
of the subject matter expert.
- Sure.

857
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,540
- And I think learning that,
all of us, it's a team sport.

858
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,000
It's an open book test, you
have help with everybody,

859
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,170
and it's pass-fail.

860
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,099
So whether you're the one
that answers the question

861
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:27,210
or whether you are bringing
as many of your friends

862
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,720
and colleagues and partners
to the game as possible,

863
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,920
like that's okay.

864
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,380
And kind of being able to, again,

865
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,110
maybe be a little bit more
humble, in terms of I don't have

866
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,670
to be the one that knows everything.

867
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,260
Not everyone knows everything,

868
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,140
but there are lots of people
out there who are willing,

869
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,410
able, incentivized to
help you on your journey.

870
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,850
They want to see you be successful.

871
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,980
So finding, I've heard
the word partnership

872
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,830
about 18 times up here,
finding the right partners,

873
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,350
whether it's with AWS,
or your different SIs

874
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,690
who can help you on that journey,

875
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,730
that's probably the most important thing.

876
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,220
And then I think maybe the other thing

877
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,420
is just don't be afraid.

878
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,717
We're doing a lot of things
that people have told us,

879
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:10,830
"Oh, you can't do that,
you can't make that work."

880
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,287
And I guess maybe the more
crass way to say that would be,

881
00:38:14,287 --> 00:38:15,786
"Okay, here, hold my beer."

882
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:17,880
- I love that, I love that.
- Having fun challenging

883
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,230
the status quo of

884
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,300
just because we've
always done it that way-

885
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,290
- Yes.
- Doesn't mean we can't find

886
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,910
better ways to do things.
- Yes.

887
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,250
- I think having a little bit of courage,

888
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,770
and trusting that if you build a good team

889
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,380
with the right partners and
the right technical expertise,

890
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,570
you can do a lot of really cool things.

891
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,330
- I love that, so I'll just iterate

892
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,680
what Pete mentioned in the beginning.

893
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,995
It's an open book test team.

894
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:44,610
There's a pass-fail, but fail fast.

895
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,370
There are plenty of
opportunities and safe spaces

896
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,310
that we offer for you to
explore, for you to invent,

897
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:53,403
for you to simplify and learn
from that development journey.

898
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:56,280
And what did you say about failure?

899
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,960
Failure's not an option
or don't be afraid.

900
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,330
Don't be afraid. Definitely
take that first step.

901
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:04,140
There's a lot of options for
you to co-develop with AWS,

902
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,382
and co-develop with your
partners to find a better path.

903
00:39:06,382 --> 00:39:10,140
And I love the comment,

904
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,790
Simon, I'm gonna come to you on this one,

905
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,620
that, "Oh no, you can't do that."

906
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,920
We hear that a lot from customers

907
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,020
that are exploring SAP workloads.

908
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,084
And I would tell you there's a lot

909
00:39:21,084 --> 00:39:23,340
of opportunity to break glass.

910
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,250
Co-innovate with both SAP
and AWS in your journey

911
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,570
for your transformation.

912
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,460
Purna, a lesson learned for the team.

913
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,640
- Yeah, so specifically I would like

914
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,490
to highlight a few points
on the RISE journey.

915
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:39,450
So as we have been discussing,
our systems are running fine.

916
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,860
- Yes.
- You want to transform.

917
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,693
How do we prove it?

918
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:44,011
So the first thing, the thing I learned is

919
00:39:44,011 --> 00:39:45,881
that let the evidence lead.

920
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:48,060
So because there are different opinions,

921
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,470
like, oh, this system performed better,

922
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,655
that one perform better,

923
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:55,620
so that benchmarking or
PO testing the things

924
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,960
so that cut through the opinions,

925
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,760
like whatever we have it, right?

926
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,620
So it helped us to make the decision.

927
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,733
So initially when we
started, it was difficult,

928
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:07,260
then it made it easy because
we have the numbers, right?

929
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,580
The data is key.

930
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,890
I think that is one of the learning.

931
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,070
The other thing I would
say is that always work

932
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,980
with your partners or vendors.

933
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,765
It's very critical because they
are transformation enablers.

934
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:25,110
We have been working with SAP
was one of our key partners.

935
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,280
So we follow them.

936
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,820
That is where like we started
S/4 journey at the beginning.

937
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,260
We are even, we are doing RISE,

938
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,850
we want to align with their roadmap

939
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,460
because they're also
one of the key enabler

940
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,560
because the technology
is key for the success.

941
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,372
So that is always ensure
that you are aligned

942
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:45,270
in different areas and
work with them closely.

943
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,413
Have that trust.

944
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,730
Giving feedback is important,

945
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:52,740
while you're appreciating
feedback is important.

946
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,210
That is what we do always.

947
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,350
So we work with them closely.

948
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:58,500
This is what, and always it's
what's in it for me, right?

949
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,510
So tell it like what do you,

950
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,760
we also tell what customer needs,

951
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,447
and also we can tell
the others saying that,

952
00:41:04,447 --> 00:41:06,690
"Oh, this is what you
will gain with this one,"

953
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,750
so they can also take the
learnings, that is one thing.

954
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:14,100
The other one is take that
SAP as this is a platform.

955
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,870
So use that additional
transformation things to make it

956
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:22,437
as enablers for the business
growth, that is one thing.

957
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:26,340
You can use AI capabilities
or anything that you have it,

958
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,160
but you can start with certain point

959
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,923
and start enabling with
the other components.

960
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,580
So because I know we both were saying many

961
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,020
of the competence in AWS,

962
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,820
we are still trying to get into it.

963
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,467
That's why I couldn't talk much about it.

964
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:44,160
There are some interesting
technologies, right?

965
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,530
So the other thing is, personally,

966
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,900
I wanted to say the couple of things,

967
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,370
is always like change management is key.

968
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,990
- Yep.
- Yeah, so when you are

969
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:57,000
doing transformation, it touches everyone

970
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,650
from business within IT, right?

971
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,813
- Yep.
- So we are putting

972
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:03,090
a huge focus on change management,

973
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,635
communicating to the teams,

974
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:06,637
because sometimes they say,

975
00:42:06,637 --> 00:42:09,540
"Oh, RISE is just going to cloud.

976
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,548
What is it? Why should I test it?

977
00:42:11,548 --> 00:42:12,870
What do I need to do?"

978
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:16,170
So we are using that change management.

979
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,630
And also whenever something new comes up,

980
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,680
because it's a long journey,

981
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,080
so be ready to adopt those changes,

982
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,793
be ready, be open for it.

983
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,723
And capture the learnings
from every migration,

984
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:31,800
and apply to the next, that
is very important, very, very.

985
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,600
So we have seen issues,
some strange issues,

986
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,930
I mean, new issues, right,
and capture it and apply.

987
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,240
So because every migration is,

988
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,643
you'll have some new learnings as well.

989
00:42:42,506 --> 00:42:45,000
And the other thing is that,

990
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,510
so link every iteration
with a business case,

991
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,610
because you start these large projects,

992
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,170
these things with the
business case, right?

993
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,540
So always you don't want
to derail the project,

994
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:58,650
so be clear on what you are
doing with the specific scope.

995
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:01,410
Anything changes, ensure that,
oh okay, I'm doing this one.

996
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,000
Is it within the business case?

997
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,833
- Yep.
- Is outside of

998
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:06,000
the business case.
- Makes sense.

999
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,960
- That is something.

1000
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,130
And over prepare for cutover
and day two operations, right?

1001
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,750
There's nothing wrong in that.

1002
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,220
I've seen that, in my experience,

1003
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,400
like where we've done last
four migrations, any things.

1004
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,470
So if you were prepared, it is good,

1005
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,090
because if nothing happens, it's fine.

1006
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,170
But if you over prepare,

1007
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:24,180
if something happens,
you're prepared for it.

1008
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,040
So even our CA, or some of the people

1009
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,173
when we go for meetings, they ask is that,

1010
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,210
"Are we prepared for everything?"

1011
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,560
It means, everything means everything.

1012
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,810
If it goes well, if not,
it doesn't go well, right?

1013
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:37,980
We don't want, they don't
want business to be impacted.

1014
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,813
- Of course.
- They're from IT,

1015
00:43:38,813 --> 00:43:41,393
that is our job, so those are the things.

1016
00:43:41,393 --> 00:43:45,060
- Gotcha, so have evidence lead the way,

1017
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,870
partner with everyone to help
you find the right journey,

1018
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:52,620
and prepare for go live,
cutover, and day two operations.

1019
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,660
Yeah, love, love that feedback.

1020
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,190
Simon, I'd love for you to close,

1021
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,190
share with us some perspectives
and lessons learned.

1022
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,700
- Yeah, I mean, I agree with
all those lessons that I,

1023
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,880
all of those just completely
resonated with our experience.

1024
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,630
I definitely like the hold my beer,

1025
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:10,446
'cause you hear so much about like,

1026
00:44:10,446 --> 00:44:12,960
this is standard architecture,

1027
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,340
this is reference architecture,

1028
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,990
this is certified, blah blah blah.

1029
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,990
But I think the reality is
that like simplicity is earned.

1030
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,933
You have to find the
solution that fits for you.

1031
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,970
Purna was talking about

1032
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,450
change management being really important.

1033
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:32,450
I think when you're doing
something like this,

1034
00:44:32,889 --> 00:44:35,220
it's as much equal,

1035
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,220
it's equal parts about
transforming the culture

1036
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,540
as it's doing,

1037
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,100
as it is like transformation-
- Definitely.

1038
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,723
- For mission critical systems.

1039
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:49,190
But I guess my personal lesson,
just laying some context,

1040
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,450
CBA's quite a big place.

1041
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,970
I think a lot of us work at
very large organizations.

1042
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,430
Ours is about 50,000 people,

1043
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,250
huge distributed organization,
different priorities,

1044
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:03,060
different silos that people work in.

1045
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,970
It's kind of a tough thing
to navigate at times.

1046
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:10,202
And you sort of fall into the
trap of being in what I call,

1047
00:45:10,202 --> 00:45:13,950
what Dr. Seuss called
actually, the waiting place,

1048
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,410
which is you're waiting
for someone to respond,

1049
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:18,510
or you're waiting for somebody

1050
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,880
to do the work that they promised to do.

1051
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,009
or you're waiting for
the right conditions.

1052
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:28,489
And at CBA, we've got
like three core values,

1053
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:31,230
care, commitment, and courage.

1054
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,060
And if you look at our recognition portal,

1055
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,070
I'm sure a lot of companies
have these sorts of things,

1056
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,710
you see loads and loads of recognitions

1057
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,850
around care and commitment.

1058
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:40,740
Those are the easy things to identify.

1059
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,030
But it's sort of more difficult

1060
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,670
to identify what courage means.

1061
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,335
And for me, I think like
courage is taking action,

1062
00:45:48,335 --> 00:45:49,890
just moving forward.

1063
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,560
And we did this, we did an offsite

1064
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,293
at the AWS office pretty early on,

1065
00:45:55,293 --> 00:45:58,620
like 100, 120 people in the room.

1066
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:59,790
And I think this is sort of pivotal

1067
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,860
to the transformation of our culture,

1068
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,480
'cause we sort of sat everyone there

1069
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,000
and talked about what this
means, like laid out the vision,

1070
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,100
and not just what it
means to the organization,

1071
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:08,970
but what it means

1072
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,830
to all of the people
involved for their careers.

1073
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,060
A lot of them have worked in this space

1074
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,650
for quite a long time.

1075
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,140
But we did this exercise
where we picked some

1076
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,510
of the Amazon leadership principles

1077
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,310
that I thought were
particularly relevant for this.

1078
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:26,550
And the one that I really
liked was bias for action.

1079
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:27,690
And everyone sort of said

1080
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,110
what they think a bias
for action looks like.

1081
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:34,530
And to me, that's courage.

1082
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:39,530
And it sort of reminds me of,
we talked about Kevin Smith,

1083
00:46:41,325 --> 00:46:44,360
there's this quote from Kevin
Smith that I really like.

1084
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,570
Do you know Kevin Smith?

1085
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,240
Who's 40 in this audience?

1086
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,947
He is the director of like, "Clerks,"

1087
00:46:50,947 --> 00:46:53,250
"Chasing Amy," "Mallrats," et cetera.

1088
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,560
And he was talking about how
he succeeded in Hollywood

1089
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,520
sort of against the odds,

1090
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,510
'cause they're really low
budget productions initially.

1091
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,010
And he said that the secret was

1092
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,550
to have a reasonable
amount of unreasonableness.

1093
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,290
And I really like that because I think

1094
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,610
that's true of any hard thing,

1095
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:11,040
and certainly it's true
of like transformations

1096
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,540
at this kind of scale.

1097
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,273
And if I reflect on our journey,

1098
00:47:16,238 --> 00:47:19,890
we basically ran ambo the entire time.

1099
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,230
Everyone said, "There's no
way you're gonna hit the date,

1100
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,100
you're gonna run behind.

1101
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,900
There's so much schedule compression.

1102
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,420
There's a lot of external
dependencies," et cetera.

1103
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,527
So we ran ambo,

1104
00:47:28,527 --> 00:47:31,983
and it kind of led to a
bit of a mantra of mine.

1105
00:47:32,971 --> 00:47:34,740
Amber is a racing color.

1106
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:39,600
I was watching a lot of Formula
One during this program.

1107
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,360
And for those of you who are
familiar with Formula One,

1108
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,153
McLaren won the
Constructors Championships.

1109
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:50,100
They're orange, or
papaya, or amber, really.

1110
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,490
But it became sort of a bit
of a signal or a shorthand.

1111
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:56,580
Amber is like focused, and determined,

1112
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,710
and consistent under pressure.

1113
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:02,013
And that's how we behaved as a team.

1114
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,060
If this had gone, if we'd gone gone red,

1115
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,740
then I'd be telling a story about Ferrari,

1116
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,953
but I think Amber is probably
the best place to be.

1117
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,440
So I think yeah, that's it for me.

1118
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,190
I think it's culture, culture
is like pivotal to this.

1119
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:20,640
It's about being a
little bit unreasonable.

1120
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,180
It's about having courage
and always moving forward.

1121
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,430
- That's excellent. It's
not just about technology.

1122
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:29,370
I mean this really is a people
business. Keep me honest.

1123
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:32,250
I heard you say care,
commitment, and courage.

1124
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,140
- That's it.
- Principles that the company

1125
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,320
has found it that you guys
live by and work with.

1126
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:41,482
And the fact that the project
was amber with urgency

1127
00:48:41,482 --> 00:48:43,590
has helped you reach that finish line,

1128
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,600
and really create a
transformational experience

1129
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,480
for all banking customers in Australia.

1130
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,610
- It's also, like it lifted the standard

1131
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:51,810
of our whole bank, right,

1132
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:54,291
'cause it redefined what's possible

1133
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:58,590
and that bar for how you deliver

1134
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:00,390
and what excellence looks like.

1135
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,850
- Yeah, so I would say,
for the audience members,

1136
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,730
this is not a short journey.

1137
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,830
It's a transformational journey

1138
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:11,330
that you're gonna partner
with both your cloud provider,

1139
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:14,410
SAP, and your systems integrators

1140
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,700
to get you to your final state.

1141
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,830
And that final state is also evolving,

1142
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,930
with each of the panelists discussing

1143
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,390
how they're modernizing,
how they're automating,

1144
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:27,480
and leveraging AWS
services to help innovate

1145
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,300
and create a new experience
for their customers too.

1146
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,540
I'm honored to be here to
hear everyone's journey.

1147
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,090
Thank you to each of you
to share your perspectives,

1148
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:37,878
and to our audience for listening in.

1149
00:49:37,878 --> 00:49:39,600
Thank you to all of you.

1150
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,460
We'll wrap it up, and if
you have any questions,

1151
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,920
come on by tomorrow to Smith and Wollensky

1152
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,000
and we'll talk to you soon.

1153
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,106
Thank you, again.

1154
00:49:46,106 --> 00:49:48,377
(audience applauds)
