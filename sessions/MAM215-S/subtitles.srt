1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,020
- So today we're gonna talk

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,590
about building zero-CVE
container images at scale.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,480
My name is Dale Rodriguez.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,650
I'm a happiness engineer

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,950
and also a senior solutions
engineer at Chainguard.

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,893
So let me tell you a
little bit more about me.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,760
I'm a certified Vuln hustler.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,570
That means that we hustle
vulnerabilities at Chainguard.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,390
10 years focused on product management,

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,730
security and also solutions engineering

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,630
and another seven years focusing
on cloud native security.

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,932
You can find me on LinkedIn
at the URL at the bottom

13
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,160
if you're feeling lucky.

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,500
And let's go to the next slide.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,083
So what is Chainguard and why are we here?

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,670
First and foremost,
Chainguard's goal is to be

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,160
the secure source for open source.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,323
We believe in the open source community.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,170
We support the open source community,

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,870
but we wanted to enhance
the open source community

21
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,583
by securing containers, libraries

22
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:01,980
and also virtual machines
within the OSS community

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,314
so that you can run this cool stuff

24
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:05,340
in production environments

25
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,878
and your compliance and security people

26
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:08,970
won't bang you upside the head.

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,987
So we have over 1,818 images,

28
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:16,770
134,000 plus versions,

29
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,902
a whole lotta images and you
all can see the build number.

30
00:01:19,902 --> 00:01:21,813
I don't even feel like saying it.

31
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,220
And of course no one buys the Factory.

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,800
We sell images and a
couple of other things.

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,710
These are all of the tools that we use

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,840
to build software at Chainguard.

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,720
Melange is our package manager

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,930
that helps us to build APKO packages.

37
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,930
Octo-STS is a GitHub security
tool for security tokens.

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,550
Sigstore is for signing.

39
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,010
We have a whole bunch
of Terraform providers.

40
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,510
And last but not least,

41
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,723
Malcontent will check your
container images for malware.

42
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,570
So there is no magic to zero CVE's.

43
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,840
There's a lot of automation, debugging,

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,410
a whole bunch of cloud
compute costs, testing, joy

45
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,840
and a lot of questioning your own sanity,

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,343
'cause this shit is very hard.

47
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,960
So first of all, before
we talk about the Factory,

48
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,251
I wanna talk a little
bit about the philosophy

49
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:18,723
of building from source.

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,640
And also, have you ever
heard of open source malware?

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,563
So when you build from source,

52
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,180
first of all, it allows you
to trust the source, right?

53
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,270
So you want to provide
depth in your defense.

54
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,290
And what I mean by that,

55
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,693
if you look at the little small diagram

56
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:37,380
over there to the right,

57
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,800
you'll see that if you
have a very low visibility,

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,910
limited visibility into your
awareness blinds you from risk.

59
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,400
What we do at Chainguard
is we want to expand

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,987
that visibility and build all the way down

61
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:53,220
to the file system itself.

62
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,530
So depth will mitigate uncertainty

63
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,680
and most importantly,
when you have this depth,

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,130
you'll be able to trust
the stuff that you build.

65
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,606
Also, we're building software

66
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:06,150
with more safer compiler options.

67
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,730
When you look at a lot
of upstream projects,

68
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,730
a lot of the languages aren't
compiled using safe compilers.

69
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,950
So we do our best to
recompile all packages

70
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,700
and images and I'm sorry,
binaries with safer options

71
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,343
so we can reduce
vulnerabilities in the stack.

72
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,673
So what is the Chainguard Factory?

73
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,760
At a high level, we're gonna
download a OSS project.

74
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,520
We have some cool
automation in the background

75
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,680
that's gonna generate a package build,

76
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,130
then generate another CVE
remediation if necessary.

77
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,460
That stuff is gonna go
into a package repository.

78
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,650
Those two blue boxes at the bottom

79
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,930
represents building that
image and testing it.

80
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,540
And then we're gonna push
that out to an image repo.

81
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,070
The top boxes that you see there,

82
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,750
the package and image boxes,

83
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,910
those are just some
examples of how we do it.

84
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,610
So let's dive in a little further.

85
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,930
The assembly line.

86
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,500
So essentially the Chainguard
Factory assembly line

87
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,660
runs right through the
middle of the Factory.

88
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,850
Everything touches the assembly line

89
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,560
and we have to keep it moving.

90
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,080
We're building a lot of stuff daily.

91
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,080
So all 1,818 of those projects
are rebuilt on a daily basis.

92
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,120
That's to cover for zero day CVEs

93
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,335
and also to maintain updates

94
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:26,460
in line with projects
from an automated fashion.

95
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,477
So most importantly, we
have a lot of GitHub PRs

96
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:33,090
and I'm gonna dive into those in a second.

97
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,210
Also, our package building
system is running on Kubernetes

98
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,040
and then also in that background,

99
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,740
we're executing our package
build tool called melange.

100
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,710
So as I mentioned, we really,
really have tons of PRs.

101
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,120
This is just a screenshot of
some version request updates.

102
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,080
As you can see, we have six
in this particular screenshot.

103
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,370
We got about 65,000k closed, 407 open.

104
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,203
When these are generated,

105
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,860
there's a new upstream release.

106
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,352
We have some automation that matches

107
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:08,430
the version differences.

108
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,370
We have GitHub commit expects.

109
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,570
And so essentially what we're doing

110
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,370
is making sure it's the right image.

111
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,980
Then we're gonna run build.

112
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,590
We're gonna do build and test
results on each of those,

113
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,180
and we're gonna do that twice,

114
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,280
because we wanna make sure that the image

115
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,093
is proper, functional and
most importantly, performing.

116
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,450
This is a sense of scale.

117
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,180
So in this particular slide,

118
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,970
we rebuild every package from source.

119
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,140
So in this graph, these
are the numbers of CPUs

120
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,130
that we spin up as we're
building these images.

121
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,713
So this is our all world builder.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,150
One of the challenges about
this is when you're spinning up

123
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,820
this many Kubernetes nodes,

124
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,790
you can really have a lot of
degradation on performance

125
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,960
with our packaging system,

126
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,030
so we had to kind of bring this in-house

127
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,830
to make this a little bit better.

128
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,510
So essentially, we
spinned up about 1000 CPUs

129
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,180
to process this and then
we spin them back down

130
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,013
once the build process is completed.

131
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,420
So we wanna automate all the things.

132
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,080
We wanna monitor upstream
projects and ingest new releases.

133
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,630
That's why we're releasing daily.

134
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,952
Most importantly, we're gonna monitor

135
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:27,120
multiple version streams
of upstream projects.

136
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,370
So we don't just provide latest,

137
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,273
we provide every single tag
that's supported by the project.

138
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,940
And the reason why we do that

139
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,890
is everybody doesn't use latest.

140
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,000
You should not pin the latest.

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
God bless you if you do.

142
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,329
And most importantly, pinning
the multiple stream versions

143
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:49,329
allows us to maintain an EOL
upstream for up to six months.

144
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,230
So in the event that a
project goes into life,

145
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,110
we could support that project
for you after six months.

146
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,110
And most importantly, we're
gonna monitor the CVEs

147
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,037
and we're gonna scan for those CVEs

148
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:02,220
and at Chainguard, we resolve CVEs,

149
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,840
criticals are seven days, high, medium

150
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,520
and lows are resolved within 14.

151
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,670
And the robots do most of
the work, I don't do it.

152
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:16,670
So can't have a talk at
AWS re:Invent without AI.

153
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,160
So we use AI to diagnose
and fix our build errors.

154
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,870
It improves our tests.

155
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,890
It has made my life very,
very easy with submitting PRs

156
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,020
and it processes a lot
of good stuff for us.

157
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,570
But the biggest thing is that our AIs

158
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,020
are generating a lot of telemetry
from our build scan tests

159
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,370
and our test logs.

160
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,700
So this information allows
us to improve our Factory,

161
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,320
making sure that we're
making the right decisions

162
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,970
when we're building our software.

163
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,830
So this is an example of
AI kind of doing its thing.

164
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,780
The main thing I want to point out though

165
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,050
is that when this AI PR is generated,

166
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,980
it is also assigned to
an engineering group.

167
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,390
So a human does verify the
work before it's submitted.

168
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,990
We don't trust AI yet, we
do not wanna become Skynet.

169
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,178
So essentially, we're gonna make sure

170
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:08,940
that the errors and the
build logs are highlighted.

171
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,790
We're gonna do some
suggested fixes as well.

172
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,520
And then we're gonna also
triage and remediate that.

173
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,420
That at the moment is done by a human.

174
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,910
So testing, testing is also important.

175
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,270
Our images do not get tagged
until they pass tests.

176
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,030
Just because we download
and rebuild a package

177
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,320
and package it up into an image

178
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,820
doesn't mean that that's complete.

179
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,040
We wanna make sure that
it's fully functional

180
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,050
and so a lot of times what that means is,

181
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,200
is spinning up an actual
Kubernetes cluster,

182
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,170
running a real world test
of that particular project

183
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,760
to make sure that it's functional.

184
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,456
We do a little bit more
than just hello world

185
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:46,503
when we're testing these projects.

186
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,280
So this is kind of an example

187
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,104
of where when the image
comes into the PR system

188
00:08:52,104 --> 00:08:56,310
or the Factory, it's gonna
spin up that test harness,

189
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,930
it's gonna be deployed.

190
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,450
Those probes will provide
the functional testing.

191
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,400
We'll leverage Helm, Docker

192
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,510
or whatever tool we use to
deploy for that particular test.

193
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,780
Once that runs and that's certified,

194
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,253
then that image is released.

195
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,260
So the Factory is the scale

196
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,353
and how we've built a
functional, scalable Factory.

197
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,570
So our images are always
signed with Sigstore

198
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,850
and pushed through our
customers' private repos.

199
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,410
When you become a customer of Chainguard,

200
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,450
you get your own pretty repository

201
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,613
with your domain and your images.

202
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,793
We release those typically within an hour.

203
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,050
You can clone your images
from our repository to yours.

204
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,090
And most importantly, we have a LDAP

205
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,380
and other features that allow
you to customize those images

206
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,187
so you can have your own
code and image program

207
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:53,130
leveraging Chainguard images.

208
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,690
That way we build those for you

209
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,730
so you don't have to manage that in-house.

210
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,100
And as you can see in the green,

211
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,980
that's essentially an
example of your name here

212
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,930
with a particular image type.

213
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,730
And then on the tag history,

214
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,620
you can even time travel essentially

215
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,173
and look up previous builds if you like.

216
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,380
So we also have free images.

217
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,730
We have about 54 of those.

218
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,070
Those images are latest only.

219
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,740
We have some base images, Python, JRE,

220
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,560
Ruby, Node and PHP.

221
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,864
And then we also have
some application images

222
00:10:26,864 --> 00:10:28,080
that you can use for free,

223
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,430
Postgres, MariaDB,,
MongoDB, Redis and Valkey.

224
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,860
So we got about 54 of those and counting.

225
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,850
All of these free images
always have zero CVEs,

226
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,320
they have SBOMs.

227
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,264
It's essentially a free version
of our enterprise product

228
00:10:43,264 --> 00:10:44,790
and you're welcome to use it.

229
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,390
We'd love to see what you build.

230
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,560
And also, enterprises,
commercials or whomever you are,

231
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,270
are not one size fits all.

232
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,340
So we build custom assembly.

233
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,963
Custom assembly allows you to customize

234
00:10:57,963 --> 00:11:01,590
the golden images that we built
and then make them your own.

235
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,870
So you can add your own packages,

236
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,349
create your own entry points
and what this does is,

237
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:10,830
is this allows you to make our
workflows fit within yours.

238
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,840
The idea of building these images

239
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,480
is not for you to change
how you do things,

240
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,400
but it's more so to add a compliment

241
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,770
to the way that you're
currently doing business.

242
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,680
So you could add packages,
you can do all updates

243
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,410
and also they all come, they're
all signed with Sigstore,

244
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,510
they have SBOMs, providence and et cetera.

245
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,370
This last particular slide is,

246
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,430
we want you to Chainguard your
open source software stack.

247
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,590
So at the bottom, the
foundation of all of this

248
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,260
is all of this is the Chainguard Factory.

249
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,660
On top of that is the Chainguard OS.

250
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,990
We make and distribute
our own operating system.

251
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,590
This allows us to have that
seven day critical SLA,

252
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,830
14 day high, medium and
low for system packages,

253
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,070
because not at the mercy of
a third party distribution.

254
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,040
Most importantly, this
operating system is minimal,

255
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,100
has a small footprint
and believe it or not,

256
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,470
it was actually inspired by Alpine.

257
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,880
We used to have mutual support

258
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,290
and we got tired of being confused,

259
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,153
so we dropped it a few years ago.

260
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,970
After the Chainguard OS,

261
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,240
the next product is
Chainguard Virtual Machines.

262
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,893
Chainguard Virtual Machines are the same

263
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:18,960
as the hardened container images,

264
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,030
except it's a VM effort for it.

265
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,190
So instead of having an Nginx container,

266
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,220
you could have an Nginx VM with zero CVEs.

267
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,940
All of our images and VMs also come

268
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,650
in compliance flavors as well.

269
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,800
We have FIPS versions
of a lot of our images.

270
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,970
Over 700 FIPs images and those FIPS images

271
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,940
can also be made into Chainguard VMs.

272
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,640
We talked about Chainguard containers.

273
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,490
You see Toolchain, we
protect the Toolchain,

274
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,430
runtime and most importantly,
we also have Helm charts.

275
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,950
They are called Chainguard
IAMGuarded charts.

276
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,710
When Bitnami put their
stuff behind a paywall,

277
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,972
we decided to step up and make charts

278
00:12:57,972 --> 00:12:59,700
to serve the community.

279
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,980
So we have about roughly
about 40 to 50 charts

280
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,820
that you can use with
Chainguard Helm charts.

281
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,420
And then last but not
least, Chainguard Libraries.

282
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,310
So Chainguard Libraries
is one of our newer,

283
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,890
more exciting features of where instead

284
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,040
of using PyPI for example,
for your Python packages,

285
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,540
you would use Chainguard.

286
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,930
Those packages will come
with malware protection,

287
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,020
provenance and also CVE remediation.

288
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,170
Currently we have Python
and Java available.

289
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,930
JavaScript is in early access

290
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,360
and the goal of Libraries

291
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,040
is to try to secure every open
source library that we can.

292
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,523
Up on the roadmap, we'll more
than likely be going RUST

293
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:45,090
followed by a few others over
the next couple of quarters.

294
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,320
And again, the idea is to
secure the entire stack.

295
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,320
So one main thing I want to
note on Chainguard Libraries,

296
00:13:55,277 --> 00:13:57,900
one of the nice things
about Chainguard Libraries

297
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,930
is that you still can use
third party library providers.

298
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,070
We don't try to lock you in
into our Libraries product,

299
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,960
our container product or VMs.

300
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,670
They're all customizable.

301
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,900
Another thing on Libraries,
especially with Python,

302
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,650
y'all know Python got about
700,000 plus packages.

303
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,170
We're trying to work towards some balance.

304
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,610
We haven't gotten that far yet,

305
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,890
but we got about 20 to 30,000.

306
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,060
We're still growing.

307
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,850
Java, we have over 50,000 packages.

308
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,620
JavaScript, I can't
tell y'all the numbers,

309
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,220
'cause y'all didn't sign an NDA.

310
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,010
So that's the Factory.

311
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,840
Couple of key points.

312
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,910
The packages are built from source.

313
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,190
They really, really
are hardened by default

314
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,540
by expert humans.

315
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,060
I promise, we don't use AI for everything.

316
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,920
They're updated and patched quickly.

317
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,270
That's mostly automated.

318
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,580
That's what helps us to build at scale.

319
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,460
They're minimal container
images built from packages,

320
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,440
they're reproducible, they're secure

321
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,570
and they're tested on real clusters.

322
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,360
They're rebuilt consistently
to pick up package updates

323
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,310
and most importantly, they're
delivered hot and fresh

324
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,930
to your door like a pizza.

325
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,540
The VM images are at the exact same

326
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,820
and then the libraries
are a bit different.

327
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,190
They're built from a
verified upstream source.

328
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,190
They're malware scan and they
also have CVE backporting.

329
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,890
One distinct difference with Libraries

330
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,260
than our images and our container product,

331
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,040
is that we essentially backport
about three years back.

332
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,030
So with images and VMs,

333
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,550
we're not trying to support
3-year-old versions,

334
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,840
but from a package's perspective,

335
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,520
we know that some dev houses

336
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,720
are still using their favorite
Java package from like 1995.

337
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,600
So we want to have an
ability for those customers

338
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,630
to be able to migrate to
a secure form of a package

339
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,780
and kind of not leave
them out in the dust.

340
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,000
Thank y'all for coming to my talk.

341
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,047
I appreciate y'all.

342
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:51,797
(crowd cheering)
