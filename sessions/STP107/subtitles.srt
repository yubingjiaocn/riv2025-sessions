1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,863
- Hi, I'm Ocha.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,920
It's amazing to be here at re:Invent.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,300
In the past three days,

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,120
I've learned a lot from
the sessions, mixers,

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,180
and fellow startups on
how they're developing AI.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,090
So in this session, it's
time for me to contribute

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,280
on our learnings in scaling Gen AI

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,753
in the real-world healthcare.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,740
So this is the agenda for today.

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,620
First of all, I would like
to introduce you to Heidi,

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,010
our journey on becoming one
of the biggest AI scribe

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,100
in the world and how we
are navigating through

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,260
the healthcare system with AI.

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,820
And at the end of this lightning talk,

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,340
I hope you can get some valuable takeaways

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,840
to contribute back to the
product you're building.

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,170
So before we start, hands up
who has been to the doctor

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,330
and then felt like you felt rushed

19
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,330
or like you couldn't get
your doctor's attention

20
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,650
because staring at the computer.

21
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,560
Yeah, looks like everyone. (laughs)

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,290
It's unfortunate because
oftentimes it's at this moment

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,140
we felt frustrated,

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,430
but it's actually not
the doctor's intention

25
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,350
because they had to deal
with administrative tasks

26
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,940
of writing notes.

27
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,850
So Heidi is here to solve that problem.

28
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,700
At Heidi, we want clinicians
to enjoy what they do

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,710
without the hassle of the admin,

30
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,210
giving time back to the doctors,

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,210
and provide better patient experience.

32
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,870
And that is just one of our
initiatives on our mission

33
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,510
to double the world's healthcare capacity

34
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,673
by providing an AI care partner.

35
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,600
So here's Heidi in action.

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,610
So imagine you're a doctor

37
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,250
and you're currently
having consultation session

38
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,450
with a patient.

39
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,610
Once you start transcribing,

40
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,000
Heidi will generate clinical
notes without any modification

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,560
or further action needed,

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,320
and that's not the only
thing Heidi can do.

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,600
Based on the templates that they created.

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,320
doctors can now use the
notes as their reference

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,500
to create patient explain a little.

46
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,980
Doctors can then ask AI after this,

47
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,710
ask AI to do clinical research.

48
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,060
And even Heidi after this can
give suggestions to doctors

49
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,800
on the task that they need to do

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,990
as a follow up of the consultation.

51
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,290
This is exciting because
doctors can now focus on patient

52
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,693
and get Heidi to do
all of the admin stuff.

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,440
So a little about our journey.

54
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,650
Our founder, Tom Kelly,
who was practicing doctor,

55
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,410
started build chatbot tool named Oscer

56
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,700
to help medical students

57
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,460
in mastering their clinical examination

58
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,770
using early transformers model.

59
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,040
Seeing some success, we
jumped to full healthcare

60
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,280
where we created like a care
platform to support doctors

61
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,200
and enhance patient care.

62
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,440
This works for a while until Gen AI emerge

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,150
where we can leverage the capability

64
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,430
of non-deterministic outputs

65
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,330
with focus on one workflow,
clinical note generation,

66
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,180
and landed on Heidi, an ambient AI scribe

67
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,013
that eases documentation burden.

68
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,260
We've grown out of a small
company in Australia,

69
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,750
now we're recognized as global player.

70
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,130
Looking at the numbers,

71
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,847
Heidi is the most used AI scribe globally.

72
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:18,600
370,000 plus clinicians on Heidi,

73
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,730
10 million consults per month,

74
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,400
number one AI scribe by adoption in Canada

75
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,560
and backed by well-known investors.

76
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,033
And this is just a start.

77
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,820
And that's me.

78
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,060
So been with Heidi with
about four years now.

79
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,580
One of the founding engineers of Heidi,

80
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,290
used to solo developing like software,

81
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,300
infra observability, security compliance

82
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,680
and all that fun stuff.

83
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,650
And now that we're growing
at lightning speed,

84
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,750
I'm focusing on platform engineering,

85
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,910
giving engineers the tools
and experience they need

86
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,163
to develop securely and efficiently.

87
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,520
So, and let's get to the first lesson,

88
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,280
which is a challenge of AI in healthcare,

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,203
which is building confidence in AI.

90
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,113
So when we start developing Heidi,

91
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,140
we immediately think of
how we can personalize

92
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,370
and customize notes

93
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,400
so that it can write
the same as clinicians.

94
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,350
Our custom template
has been a huge success

95
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,180
and doctors loved it,

96
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,970
but as an engineer we keep thinking on

97
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,480
how we can make it more
efficient, thinking about latency,

98
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,880
thinking about contact windows of LLM.

99
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,580
But as more clinicians use Heidi,

100
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,810
we encounter more unique cases
related to their specialty.

101
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,120
For example, how do we get the tone,

102
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,330
the specific of our note
summary, correct for each doctor

103
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,150
so they feel confident
and they can rely on him?

104
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,450
This is where we realize that
truth is where that matter.

105
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,640
Healthcare requires clinical accuracy

106
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,370
and we were trying to
validate non-deterministic

107
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,990
outputs at scale.

108
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,630
You can't just write unit
tests for clinical empathy

109
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,633
or diagnostic nuance, we needed doctors.

110
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,750
So what this meant at the start,

111
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,200
so back then we only like
have a couple of doctors.

112
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,990
This meant we start giving like
doctors a Jupyter Notebook.

113
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,170
Each Jupyter Notebook is a
tool used by data scientists

114
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,910
to write code and experiment

115
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,150
and doctors can start
experiments connecting with LLM,

116
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,100
answer their prompts, the transcription,

117
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,930
change of temperature, and so on.

118
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,050
But the problem is that doctors
in the end have to aggregate

119
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,560
the results to summarize
all of the testing.

120
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,030
So to address that problem,

121
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,850
we started to provide
JupyterHub hosted on EC2

122
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,730
as collaboration tool so that
the doctors doesn't have to

123
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,920
consolidate everything in the end.

124
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,700
Clearly this is not going
to work for at scale.

125
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,120
So not every clinicians
or doctors is going

126
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,990
to be a coder, work okay
for like scrappy testing

127
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,420
with a small numbers of doctors.

128
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,490
So how do we scale it then?

129
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,810
So picture this.

130
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,290
How does a typical clinician
workflow look like in Heidi

131
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,960
for transcription and note generation?

132
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,560
So at first we needed
data points we can base

133
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,870
like when doing evaluation,

134
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,030
but how we're going to do
that in testing environment

135
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,193
because we can't use any user's data.

136
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,740
So one of the ways that the doctors do

137
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,110
is we can do some mock consultation

138
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,320
and have case studies with Heidi users.

139
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,870
But most importantly, the
most recent techniques

140
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,290
that we use is using LLM to
try to create synthetic data

141
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,443
to generate consultation both
in audio form and text form.

142
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,300
With enough data, clinicians
can start to do more evaluation

143
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,970
on word error rate,
template adherence check,

144
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,710
basically making sure that the templates

145
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,613
that clinicians made is
safe, medically safe,

146
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,720
hallucination rate check, and
this process is what we call

147
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,120
like clinicians in the loop.

148
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,480
As Heidi started to hire
and hire more clinicians,

149
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,120
the evaluation process
needs to be scalable.

150
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,330
At this stage, engineers started
to introduce more tooling

151
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,030
that can help clinicians
such as internal tooling

152
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,770
for evaluating flag sessions

153
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,530
to be reviewed than in
testing environment,

154
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,690
building connections between the sessions

155
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,480
and the LLM context to
gain better understanding

156
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,513
and also LLM as a judge
tool to do it at scale.

157
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,820
All of these processes can
be used as a feedback loop

158
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,060
to improve the model,
prompts, and medical safety.

159
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,880
It shape our product and
engineering decision hiring

160
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,843
and go to market.

161
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,370
So speaking about scaling,
scaling clinical experts,

162
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,720
it's one challenge.

163
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,993
The next is how we scale
Heidi outside of Australia.

164
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,640
When we set to expand Heidi
globally, we quickly realized

165
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,950
that healthcare isn't a single standard.

166
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,500
Like we encountered like
four distinct layers

167
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,780
that I can think of, of
complexity that we have

168
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,420
to solve simultaneously.

169
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,793
So first it's data sovereignty.

170
00:07:45,658 --> 00:07:48,660
Wait, okay, first it's data sovereignty.

171
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,590
This isn't just about
storage or like about strict,

172
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,130
it's about strict data locality
and network architecture.

173
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,750
For example, in Australia,

174
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,120
we must strictly use ap-southeast-2

175
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,450
or ap-southeast-4, the
newest region in Melbourne,

176
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,080
whereas in the US, we
might utilize us-east-1

177
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,090
or us-west-2.

178
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,610
It's not just where the data is stored,

179
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,740
but it's also how it moves.

180
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,370
We need to ensure that data,
that workloads, stay private

181
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,740
using a well-architectured PPC network

182
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,630
to control exactly how system communicates

183
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,213
with each other within
those specific borders.

184
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,390
And the second is model availability.

185
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,960
If you're building solely
for US, it's lot of easy

186
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,490
because models are available everywhere.

187
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,100
Here in the US you can
pick almost every provider,

188
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,130
but the moment you try
to expand to new regions,

189
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,810
that luxury disappears.

190
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,240
We suddenly had to think
about other options

191
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,270
because the models we wanted
simply just not available

192
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,733
or not compliant in those local zones.

193
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,570
And third is medical reality itself.

194
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,200
A GP appointment in
Australia look very different

195
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,690
from primary care visit in New York.

196
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,930
It's not just about the
accent, it's training,

197
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,350
consultation flow, and
the medical terminology.

198
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,990
Heidi has to adapt to these nuances

199
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,543
to capture the consultation accurately.

200
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,700
And finally, we are
building on a shifting sand.

201
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,460
Gen AI is a new frontier

202
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,970
that is actively influencing
the regulatory space.

203
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,120
Navigating different regions
means managing different

204
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,330
compliance requirements simultaneously.

205
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,100
This isn't just a legal headache,

206
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,620
it directly affect our product roadmap,

207
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,710
our engineering decisions,
every single day.

208
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,770
So facing these four massive hurdles,

209
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,243
we had to architect a solution
that could handle them all.

210
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,130
So how did we actually
meet these challenges

211
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,840
from a technical perspective?

212
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,970
The answer lies in standardization.

213
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,960
So we need to make sure all
of our infrastructure in AWS

214
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,990
is standardized across
every single region.

215
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,230
We utilize infrastructure
as a code to ensure

216
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,510
that our deployment is consistent.

217
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,990
This gives us a flexible
architecture that allows us

218
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,480
to easily deploy into new region

219
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,340
without reinventing the wheel.

220
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,080
Essentially, we treat new regions

221
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,423
as plug-and-play templates.

222
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,220
You'll notice that there
is a EKS classic diagram.

223
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,270
It's a bit small, so I'm gonna
make it quite big over there.

224
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,693
This is central to our strategy
for model availability.

225
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,152
When when we're talking
about immediate availability,

226
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:33,060
we're entering new regions.

227
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,250
We use LM providers that
are already available

228
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,180
and compliant in that designated
region like Amazon Bedrock.

229
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,730
This solves immediate coldstar problem.

230
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,220
However, in the long term,
it is imperative for us

231
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,970
to have infrastructure that
can support self-hosted models.

232
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,980
This is where EKS shines since AWS EKS

233
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,380
supports most of the global regions,

234
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,600
once we have our
infrastructure template ready,

235
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,840
we can serve our own
inference models everywhere.

236
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,500
This hybrid approach, Bedrock
for speed and EKS for control,

237
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,473
solved the model availability globally.

238
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:08,160
But as I mentioned earlier,

239
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,070
healthcare isn't just
code, right, it's people.

240
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,003
Once the technical pipes has been laid,

241
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,870
we still face the massive
non-technical hurdle,

242
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,520
which is building trust.

243
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,280
Trust starts with speaking the language.

244
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,360
And I don't just mean French,
Spanish, I mean medicine.

245
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,560
We hire clinician ambassadors
in every region we operate in.

246
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,500
These are doctors who
believe in Heidi Mission

247
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
and provide specific
on the ground support.

248
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,300
These aren't just consultants.

249
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,920
They provide specific support

250
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,520
to ensure Heidi can speak
local medical dialect.

251
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,050
They validate that Heidi
doesn't just translate words,

252
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,660
but also understand
local practice patterns

253
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,240
ensuring the output feels
natural to GP in New York

254
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,743
or a specialist in Sydney.

255
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:01,050
Finally, we tackle the complex
regulatory requirements

256
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,230
through a rigorous compliance network.

257
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,800
All of these compliance
network like we establish

258
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,665
a dedicated internal
legal and compliance team

259
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:16,665
that manage the shifting
landscape to international laws.

260
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,040
We also work with external partners,

261
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,070
especially focusing on medical safety.

262
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,160
This ensures that we move
fast on infrastructure,

263
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,203
but we never compromise on safety.

264
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,390
By combining this plug-and-play,
technical architecture

265
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,000
with human in the loop trust strategy

266
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,063
we're able to scale globally
while staying local.

267
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,070
So if there is one thing
that I want you to walk away

268
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,031
with today is that technology
alone isn't the product.

269
00:12:48,031 --> 00:12:50,520
What made Heidi successful was the release

270
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,870
of foundational model,

271
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,320
but what made us successful was the pivot.

272
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,260
We moved from the broad
care platform that tried

273
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,140
to do everything to focusing
on a single workflow

274
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,830
that brings immediate,
tangible value to doctors.

275
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,270
Don't try to boil the ocean,

276
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,840
just solve one painful problem perfectly.

277
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,710
And second, in a world of generative AI,

278
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,156
the human is more important than ever.

279
00:13:17,156 --> 00:13:21,780
Doctors and clinicians are
the core part of the product.

280
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,750
We learn to treat our
subject matter experts,

281
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,410
not just as testers, but
also as our biggest asset.

282
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,210
They're the guardian of the quality.

283
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,100
And finally, for the builders in the room,

284
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,100
build a flexible
architecture from day one.

285
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,020
This isn't just about code quality,

286
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,660
it's about business survival.

287
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,600
It is this flexibility
that allows us to respond

288
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,060
to changing regulatory environments

289
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,190
and expand into new regions

290
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,620
with completely different requirements.

291
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,560
Your architecture should
be an enabler of expansion,

292
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,613
not a bottleneck.

293
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,540
And that's about it.

294
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,290
I hope you learn one or two
things from our journey.

295
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,180
And if you're interested
in building the future

296
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,030
of healthcare or have any
questions about Heidi,

297
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,960
I'd love to chat.

302
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:21,892
(audience clapping)
