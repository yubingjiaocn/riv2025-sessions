  "title_cn": "AWS re:Invent 2025 - Heidi Health 如何利用生成式人工智能改变全球医疗保健行业",
  "abstract": "Heidi Health started building generative AI for healthcare when most regulators were still grappling with what that meant. After pivoting from appointment prep to AI medical scribing with the explosion of Gen AI, the team confronted challenges unique to gen AI startups: validating non-deterministic outputs at scale, selling probabilistic technology to risk-averse hospitals, and navigating compliance frameworks designed for rule-based software. The biggest bottleneck wasn’t engineering, it was finding expert clinicians to evaluate AI-generated clinical notes. This is the story of finding product-market fit, surviving enterprise sales cycles, building scalable AI evaluation, and adapting language models across four continents.",
