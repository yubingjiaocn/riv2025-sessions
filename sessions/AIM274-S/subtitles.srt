1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,493
- Hey, everyone. Welcome.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,840
We're excited to have you join
us for a conversation today

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,530
that sits at the
intersection of technology,

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,083
finance, and the future of mobility.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,450
Today, we're joined by leaders

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,720
who are helping redefine
what it means to run finance

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,783
inside of technology-driven EV company.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,050
I'll let the panel introduce themselves,

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,390
but we're excited to have Aditya and Wil

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,450
from Lucid Motors join
us here on the stage.

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,310
Lucid is a company

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,070
that's not just building
electric vehicles,

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,070
but reimagining what a digital
first auto manufacturer

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,903
looks like.

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,310
Lucid and PwC have been
leveraging AWS services

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,110
to establish proof of concepts

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,210
across the finance organization

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,990
with solutions targeting all
levels of the organization.

19
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,680
From the board of directors
and C-suites to the analysts,

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,770
they're moving fast and
pushing their organization

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,303
to move at Sapphire speed.

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,020
For those of you who aren't
familiar with Sapphire speed,

23
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,470
Sapphire is the premium level
of the successful Lucid Air,

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,290
and it's known for its
acceleration from zero to 60

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,490
in under two seconds, which
I need to experience that.

26
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,960
It's my ask.

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,430
Today, we're gonna talk
through the journey

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,420
that they're on adopting AI
in their finance organization.

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,593
So, let's just jump in.

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,930
Let's start with a round of introductions.

31
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,910
If we can start closest
to me with you, Aditya,

32
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,900
and go on down.

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,430
- Sure. Thanks, and thanks for having us.

34
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,690
And we're very excited to be
here and share our experiences.

35
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,220
My name is Aditya Baheti.

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,910
I head the business finance team at Lucid,

37
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,220
which spans across
corporate finance functions,

38
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,720
systems finance, which is where
much of the agentic AI work

39
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,413
is being done along with
other finance functions.

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,930
- Hello, I'm Wil Velez.

41
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,750
I work with Aditya at Lucid,

42
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,330
and I focus on developing
our finance systems,

43
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,730
and that's how I got
involved with this project.

44
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,890
- And you have not mentioned

45
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,251
that you just got back from India, right?

46
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:08,084
- I did.

47
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:09,540
- I think it's important. (laughs)

48
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,910
- I did get back from India last night,

49
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,710
and I'm still recovering from my jet lag,

50
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,184
so please excuse me if
I'm a little bit slow.

51
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:18,017
(Lori laughs)

52
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:19,110
- So, I'm Lori Driscoll.

53
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,090
I run our PwC's tech media and
telecom consulting business,

54
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,780
which essentially is anything
that we do with our customers

55
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,430
from IPO readiness through
to the agentic journey

56
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,703
across a number of different
functions, including finance.

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,720
- And Brad Donaldson with PwC.

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,050
I'm the practice leader for
our finance solutions offering,

59
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,670
which the fun part of my role

60
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,620
is that we get to oversee
all these different programs

61
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,863
we have at different
clients that are ongoing.

62
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,650
- Awesome. Excited to
have everybody with us.

63
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,120
For the audience, my name is Adam Hood.

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,290
I help lead our data and AI
capability focused on AWS.

65
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,170
Excited to be here with you
today with its great audience.

66
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,073
Aditya, I wanna start with you.

67
00:03:03,073 --> 00:03:04,800
I think everybody's familiar with Lucid.

68
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,360
You guys make exceptional cars

69
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,380
that are truly in a category
of one, but for our audience,

70
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,140
do you mind sharing a
little bit more about Lucid,

71
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,390
like share a little bit
about your journey, perhaps,

72
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,280
you know, the new SUV,

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,720
and then maybe anything you wanna share

74
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,083
about a future mid-size
SUV that might be coming?

75
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,080
- Absolutely, absolutely.

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,143
Well, Sapphire, as you mentioned,
is less than, you know,

77
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,010
two seconds from zero to 60.

78
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,630
If you're still in the
market for a sedan, you know,

79
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,520
you can do touring and grand touring,

80
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,560
which is less than three seconds.

81
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,240
Having said that, Lucid
is a software EV company,

82
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,250
software-defined EV company,

83
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,250
and it's been selling
Lucid Air sedan since 2021.

84
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,640
And it's rated one of
the best luxury EV cars

85
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,780
in the industry.

86
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,080
In fact, it's received many of,

87
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,140
post of the accolades and the rewards

88
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,863
and recognitions from
the automotive industry.

89
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,810
We introduced Gravity earlier this year,

90
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,650
which has also received
incredible reviews and feedback

91
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,543
and many more accolades and
recognitions to follow through.

92
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,470
Now, what we are doing is, you know,

93
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,810
we're culminating all our technology

94
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,810
and performance into a soon
to be available next year,

95
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,230
introducing mid-size platform

96
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,510
at much more affordable prices,

97
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,660
which will unleash a whole
lot of massive growth

98
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,683
for the company.

99
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,820
I think in addition to
just developing cars,

100
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,580
pride itself also in developing, you know,

101
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,640
having competitive edge technology,

102
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,470
not just in terms of like
performance, range, drive,

103
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,150
or you know, the space,

104
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,930
but also in terms of defining
the future of mobility

105
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,043
or transportation.

106
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,260
By that, I mean enabling or giving sort

107
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,260
of autonomous driving
cars directly to consumers

108
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,083
in partnership with NVIDIA that
we just recently announced.

109
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,160
Additionally, we're also
doing Robotaxi fleets

110
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,160
in partnership with Nuro and
Uber, which will, you know,

111
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,280
we've announced Bay Area

112
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,193
to be the first launch city
by the end of next year.

113
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,900
I would also mention that every car

114
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,500
that is sold in USA is made in USA,

115
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,220
so it's a made in US company as well.

116
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,970
So there's a lot of excitement at Lucid,

117
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,160
and we're really looking forward to it.

118
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,830
- That's fantastic. Thank
you for the context.

119
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,930
Maybe just to keep moving on,

120
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,900
I think you talked about
the growth and the scale.

121
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,460
You talked about what
you're doing here in the US,

122
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,730
but you guys are scaling globally, right?

123
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,151
You know, you've taken on a lot

124
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:09,240
of really important impactful
initiatives around AI,

125
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,820
specifically within finance.

126
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,060
What made now the right time
to dig into those initiatives

127
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,210
and take on so many of them at once?

128
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,210
- No, that's a good question. Why now?

129
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,890
Of course, I think one,

130
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,477
we're preparing ourself
for the massive growth

131
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:29,310
or the growth that is gonna
unfold or unleash, you know,

132
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,690
with launch of mid-size cars
and finance organization

133
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,030
as a function needs to scale

134
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,730
to support that growth in
a more sustainable way.

135
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,820
So that's sort of the main driver.

136
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,170
But in addition to that,

137
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:48,170
we also have a CFO's
vision transforming finance

138
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,590
into much more of a competitive edge

139
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,760
and provide more real time
analytics, business insights,

140
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,650
to be driving more
data-driven decision making

141
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,990
in a very fast-paced environment

142
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,580
and in uncertain environment,

143
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,430
especially this year where
we've experienced tariffs

144
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,409
and trade impacts and
other sort of unforeseen,

145
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:14,009
unplanned events and activities.

146
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,683
- That's fantastic.

147
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:18,330
I think you've started to
touch on, one thing I wanted,

148
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,750
maybe Lori, you or Brad can jump in here,

149
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,860
provide a perspective.

150
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,770
I think you just started
to touch on the vision

151
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,290
that drives these decisions,

152
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,160
especially around finance
transformation and AI.

153
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,290
Like, what do you see more broadly

154
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,810
around what's driving the impact,

155
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,970
what's driving the excitement around AI

156
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,070
at the intersection of finance?

157
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,990
And maybe we'll come back
and talk about specifically

158
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,230
how that vision is driving at Lucid.

159
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,460
- Yeah, and I think a couple of things.

160
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,220
One, you know, finance
organizations are constantly

161
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,900
under cost pressures like many

162
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,280
of the other back office functions.

163
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,010
So, you know, you've
got the responsibility

164
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,920
of closing the books
and reporting results,

165
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,170
but at the same time,
you're trying to make sure

166
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,790
that you're a good business partner

167
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,970
and providing decision support
to the operations teams.

168
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,600
And so when you think about
that ever-evolving pressure,

169
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,300
you know, it's how do I
start to leverage better,

170
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,940
smarter ways to go about doing this?

171
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,170
And also as I'm doing it,
increase the amount of insights

172
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,780
that I'm able to provide to the business.

173
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,060
So it's kind of that inflection point here

174
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,730
where you can get a kind of a double win

175
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,550
where you can help grow
scale without scaling

176
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,780
from a headcount basis,

177
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,740
but at the same time,
scale with capabilities.

178
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,680
The other thing I would
add is that, you know,

179
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,110
I spend a lot of time
meeting with different CFOs

180
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,140
and it's really at a board level right now

181
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,530
where a lot of the boards
are requesting the CFOs of,

182
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,900
you know, how are you
thinking about AI, right?

183
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,660
There's the AI from the
perspective of governance, right?

184
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,720
When you talk about financials,
and we've got, you know,

185
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,670
regulated numbers are getting put out,

186
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,950
how do we control
anything that's AI-driven

187
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,320
that's gonna be put inside
the financial systems?

188
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,150
And so there's the control perspective

189
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,190
that they're looking at, but
then they're also looking

190
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,410
at how are we leveraging it to give

191
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,760
that competitive advantage, you know,

192
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,140
what are the opportunities there?

193
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,960
And so a lot of the conversations
with CFOs around starting

194
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,090
to go down that path of
how do they get started,

195
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,790
how do they embed that,
what's the path going forward?

196
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,640
- Really good stuff.

197
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,473
Aditya,

198
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:24,360
like, when you and Wil embark
on this journey, right?

199
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,590
Like, how did you imagine the
future of finance at Lucid,

200
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,480
like, what drove some of those,

201
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,700
like, what was that process like for you?

202
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,990
What was the vision behind it?

203
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,340
What do you hope that
looks like in the future?

204
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,050
- Yeah, I mean, and, you know,

205
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,430
he touched on that in terms
of being a competitive edge,

206
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,310
you know, finance can be
a catalyst for growth.

207
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,650
I think that's the sort of vision we have,

208
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,650
and I think by that, you break
it down into sort of smaller,

209
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,860
you know, bite-size tactical
things such as, you know,

210
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,850
the amount of data that finance
sees and acts has access to,

211
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,410
not just within the finance domain,

212
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,303
but also outside of finance domain,

213
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,230
there is a huge potential
to unlock the capability

214
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,640
of providing real time
predictive analytics

215
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,170
leveraging the AI tools,

216
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,340
and there's so much value to
be unlocked, just, you know,

217
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,220
having better decision making capability.

218
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,220
Second, I would also
say the ability to adapt

219
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,140
and adjust very quickly.

220
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,860
You know, we have multiple sort
of ways of doing, you know,

221
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,040
scenario planning, with
so much uncertainty,

222
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,320
so much sort of unplanned
activity, you know,

223
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,680
we're always trying to assess
our risk profile, you know,

224
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,610
and multiple scenario
planning gives us the ability

225
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,030
not only just plan, but also
quantify the level of risk,

226
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,320
and therefore we can
proactively manage those risks

227
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,340
to be able to execute to our
sort of vision and strategy.

228
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,560
So I think that's the sort
of vision that we have

229
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,440
on the finance side, to be
more of a competitive edge,

230
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,183
but also be a catalyst for growth.

231
00:11:04,193 --> 00:11:05,530
- And I would add one more thing on,

232
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,810
like, on a broader agenda,
we mentioned the board,

233
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,670
when you take a look at the F500,

234
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,123
the Fortune 500 companies
over the last three years,

235
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,380
any company that has
invested more than 0.5%

236
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,580
in AI has had a 21% or more
total shareholder value return.

237
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,430
That's a phenomenal return on investment.

238
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,560
Now, a lot of us are piloting

239
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,930
and experimenting over
the last several years.

240
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,660
2025, I think has been
a turning point in terms

241
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,660
of more purposeful investments
in agents and workflows

242
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,950
that make a difference for
functions like finance.

243
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,300
But the returns are there.

244
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,700
So we've got the proof in the pudding,

245
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,230
and that's why boards are asking

246
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,990
for more dollars to be spent.

247
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,460
- Absolutely. I agree with that.

248
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,940
And we're seeing the early
results such with the work

249
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,470
that we've been doing with
PwC and AWS. (indistinct)

250
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,260
- I'll just add, when the
PwC brought this project idea

251
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,090
to us, our first meeting
with our C-suite, Taoufiq,

252
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,830
our CFO, ended the meeting with,

253
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,390
sometimes you have to
take a leap of faith,

254
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,190
and that's exactly what
he allowed us to do,

255
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,450
he enabled us to do.

256
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,083
And the success that we're
seeing now is powerful.

257
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,000
- No, and I would just say,

258
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,650
by no means I think we're experts,

259
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,520
we're just sharing experiences
over here, so don't,

260
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,353
you know,

261
00:12:36,353 --> 00:12:39,270
I think everybody's experience
can be very different,

262
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,680
but this space is evolving
at a very rapid pace.

263
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,150
So I would say like, you know,

264
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,150
what's relevant for us may
not be relevant tomorrow,

265
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,313
but we're just sharing experiences.

266
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,950
- One thing I'll add is,

267
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,140
when I first got involved with the team,

268
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,530
I was looking at, and they're
just breakneck speed, right?

269
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,150
The rate at which they were going,

270
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,710
it made me a little nervous at first.

271
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:06,210
And what I found was is that
they're able to do that,

272
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,730
because he touched on one
of the very critical points,

273
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,700
which is they had executive alignment

274
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,010
at the top level to go.

275
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,170
And so we would be in meetings

276
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,480
and there'd be a discussion
of something we needed,

277
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,630
and, you know, their CIO
would be on his phone.

278
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,790
Yep, by the time we
get back to the office,

279
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,770
there was getting access to that data set

280
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,700
or what we're looking for.

281
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,490
So it really enabled the team to do that.

282
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,050
But I think it's really
critical when we talk

283
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,780
about the story is, is that
to do something like this,

284
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,183
you do have to have that top-down buy-in.

285
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,783
- Yeah, fantastic.

286
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:43,650
I mean, I think everyone
associates an engineering-led kind

287
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:48,150
of software-defined automaker
mentality with Lucid, right?

288
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,180
And you're describing
what I would consider some

289
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,800
of the obvious traits of an organization

290
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,330
that describes themselves as such.

291
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,610
Like, maybe you can talk just a little bit

292
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,030
about how that culture, that identity,

293
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,190
like, connects with this work.

294
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,090
Like, how does this
vision around an agentic

295
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,000
enabled finance team align

296
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,283
with your broader organization strategy?

297
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,840
- Yeah, I would say innovation is at sort

298
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,290
of the core central theme at Lucid.

299
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,740
You know, you see it in the
cars in being the best cars

300
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,250
and you know, with
excellent sort of features

301
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,180
and capabilities, it has
the competitive edge.

302
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,540
And I think from a technology standpoint,

303
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,490
it's pushing itself, you know,

304
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,737
it's always pushing its
boundaries in terms of like,

305
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:40,470
you know, now looking at
the future of mobility

306
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,690
and transportation by providing, you know,

307
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,840
autonomous cars directly to the consumers,

308
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,040
not just the Robotaxis and the
fleets through Uber and Nuro,

309
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,120
but also, you know, hands
off, minds off, eyes off,

310
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,750
kind of like a, you know,
L4 autonomous experience,

311
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,460
driving experience.

312
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,330
I think with, if you carry
that same sort of philosophy,

313
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:07,020
finance organization is sort
of in the same boat in terms

314
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,140
of pushing its boundaries,
in terms of innovation,

315
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,980
and you leveraging, you know,
the technologies of the tools

316
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,980
that are available to us in
a more cost efficient way.

317
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,783
We're planning for growth and you know,

318
00:15:21,783 --> 00:15:24,990
we're investing in growth,

319
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,023
but in a more sustainable and
a more cost efficient way.

320
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,050
- Yeah, Brad, I would just ask,

321
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,670
I think that culture of innovation,

322
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,190
even within the finance organization,

323
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,443
like, not every organization
has that, right?

324
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,640
But what are we seeing more
broadly? Is this a trend?

325
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,451
Is this the start of
something across finance?

326
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:46,320
- I mean, I think, I mean,
Lucid is in a little bit

327
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,480
of a unique situation in
the fact that, you know,

328
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,300
relatively new company, tech focused.

329
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,150
And so the adoption was
much, much higher, right?

330
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:58,620
I think it's all culture
specific to each company.

331
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,380
And as we think about it and
we start to go down that path

332
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,940
to get the adoption and buy-in,

333
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,320
there's different ways
we have to think through,

334
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,277
how are we going to do that?

335
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:06,990
And I mean, I've worked with clients

336
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,970
where we've developed some amazing tools

337
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,970
to help them drive profitability
and predict profitability,

338
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,060
and then finance would
solve the problem they had,

339
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,130
and then operations would
take it going forward.

340
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,660
Like, well, that's a great
tool, we'll use it now.

341
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,030
And then finance didn't because
they were used to going,

342
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,000
I gotta close the books and
then I do my reports and then I,

343
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,520
so it really is driving a cultural change,

344
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,450
and it has to be thinking
through, you know, in their space,

345
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,090
very fortunate to be able to do that.

346
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,800
But other companies, we
have to think through,

347
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,863
like, how are we gonna drive
that change and drive adoption?

348
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,600
- Real quick, let's move
into some of the discussion

349
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,930
about maybe some of the
use cases specifically,

350
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,630
like, you're taking on a
lot of prototypes early.

351
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,000
I think there's 14 different
use cases you're starting

352
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,833
with out of the gate.

353
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,130
A lot of our clients may think

354
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,560
about starting with one or two.

355
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,750
Lucid is not an organization
that moves slow.

356
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,040
So you're taking on 14.

357
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,450
I'm really curious about,

358
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,900
have you taken on these
early prototypes and demos?

359
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,610
Has there been any of 'em in particular

360
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,490
that have generated kinda
the strongest excitement

361
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,503
internally and why is that?

362
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,730
- Sure. We didn't plan for 14,
it just so happened to be 14.

363
00:17:23,162 --> 00:17:24,090
(laughs)

364
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,340
We actually started with our pain points,

365
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,310
and pain points in terms
of what's stopping us from,

366
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,230
you know, delivering that growth,

367
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,650
supporting that growth or
scaling the finance organization

368
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,480
to deliver that growth.

369
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,080
And, you know, there
were very critical areas

370
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,073
that we could clearly identify
and needed to be addressed.

371
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:50,450
You know, some of those,
the use cases that you're,

372
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:52,295
you know, you mentioned about, you know,

373
00:17:52,295 --> 00:17:55,440
there are actually few of them
that are worth mentioning,

374
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,790
one of them being demand-

375
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,848
- They're all worth mentioning by the way.

376
00:17:58,848 --> 00:18:00,570
(audience laughing)

377
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,530
- You're right, because they
all address the pain points.

378
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,420
But demand forecasting, actually,

379
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,800
all of them are super important.

380
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,870
Demand forecasting, I'll
talk a little bit about that,

381
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,870
because I've had experience
with building an AI model even,

382
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,480
you know, almost like a decade
ago with Berkeley students

383
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,600
and we used some random
forest sort of algorithms

384
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,770
and you know, the compute and
the resources were so limited

385
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,260
that you could only use finite files,

386
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,210
finite attributes, and finite files,

387
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,243
and it would take like days
to just refresh the model.

388
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,920
Fast forward like 15
years, especially 2025,

389
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,920
I think the resources are
now changing and available

390
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,530
at a much more sort of
larger, you know, speeds,

391
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,890
so that the turnaround, the
speed has become very critical

392
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,860
for us, which helps
faster decision making.

393
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,430
So demand forecasting is one
that I would talk about more

394
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,430
in detail as we, you know,
go through this session.

395
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,000
The other one is investor, you know,

396
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
analyst, dashboard, if you will.

397
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,340
What it does is it not
only talks about, you know,

398
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,250
the investing, the investor holdings,

399
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,670
but also the positions that
some of the investors are taking

400
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:25,260
in terms of sell or put options against,

401
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,550
and what it demonstrates,
it, you know, there are some,

402
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,500
let's say groups that are investing

403
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,630
against their own sister companies,

404
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,190
and why would one do that?

405
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,610
And that is bringing, that
is reducing the volatility

406
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,190
of our stock prices that can be leveraged

407
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,190
for a lot more sort of,
you know, proof points.

408
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,120
And I think that has been
a significant use case.

409
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,850
I mean, Wil, there's more, I
know all of them are important.

410
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,440
You wanna talk a little bit about-

411
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,200
- Not specifically, but
we've worked on these cons,

412
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,290
these POCs across treasury, accounting,

413
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,123
finance, internal audit.

414
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,590
There are a number of examples

415
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,720
where we're gonna drive efficiencies,

416
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,820
improve accuracy, and speed things up.

417
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,030
I think those are the
important talking points.

418
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,040
We will continue to
leverage this technology

419
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,710
and as Aditya pointed out
earlier, we're not experts.

420
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,380
We're learning as we
go. This is a journey.

421
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,380
And the fortunate thing is
our, like you mentioned,

422
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,230
our C-suite is onboard and
empowering us to do this,

423
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,180
which is important.

424
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,550
- I would also add the
orchestration layer, right?

425
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,810
So we just put that in
place last week for Lucid.

426
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,190
So it's early stages,

427
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,300
but the goal is it's never
about the agents themselves,

428
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,790
it's about the outcomes
that the agents deliver.

429
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,130
And in a multi-agent environment,

430
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,670
you need a common
orchestration layer to be able

431
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:58,350
to provide safeguard,
guardrails, policy adherence,

432
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,650
agent to agent, you know,

433
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,740
lanes for them to work
together across workflows,

434
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,600
and be able to produce results.

435
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,080
So one of the things
like, we're at re:Invent,

436
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,840
the great news, what we
put in place is agent OS,

437
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,660
which is built and provided by PwC,

438
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,660
but it's native to AWS,
embedded with Bedrock.

439
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,460
It works with all the
integration points that you need.

440
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,390
And as we bring agents online,
they work with one another.

441
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,530
And that's the goal, right?

442
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,820
You're not gonna have 10 agents,

443
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,183
you're gonna have hundreds
of agents every time.

444
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,770
- That's a great point.

445
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,610
Thanks for,

446
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,590
we're gonna continue to
unpack that a little bit more,

447
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,230
so let's talk about that one.

448
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,720
You shared a travel story.

449
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,730
We're all passionate travelers up here.

450
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,700
We were able to align on that.

451
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,380
You shared a story about
using ChatGPT around travel.

452
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,065
It was really good 'cause we
were talking about, you know,

453
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,930
how this journey, like,
there's things on this journey

454
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,480
that have surprised you
about how it's reshaping

455
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,330
the day-to-day impact on finance.

456
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,250
And I thought you shared a great example.

457
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,013
Do you mind kind of
unpacking that for us again?

458
00:22:07,013 --> 00:22:09,150
- Sure, sure, sure.

459
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,040
So I just came back from India

460
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,610
and I was sharing a story
this morning with Adam,

461
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,490
but, so I went to India,

462
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,170
I went to Jaipur and I asked ChatGPT,

463
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,650
hey, give me an itinerary
for three days as a tourist.

464
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,130
It, you know, very nicely
gave me a three, you know,

465
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,460
page itenerary for three
days and say, hit this spot,

466
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,170
hit this spot, hit this spot.

467
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,000
Say, okay, great.

468
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,550
Then I said, well, I'm
traveling with all the parents,

469
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,580
so give me a revised version of the chat.

470
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,907
It just said, just go slow.

471
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:45,480
(audience laughing)

472
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,180
I said, okay, great, that's helpful.

473
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,091
What it didn't do was when I
spoke and when I got there,

474
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:53,460
you know, I met the locals over there

475
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,020
and they actually told me
exactly what to do and you know,

476
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,840
which shops to hit, what
to do from one location

477
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,630
to another location, take
like the three-wheeler

478
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,760
or the two-wheeler or
what have you, right?

479
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,770
Do not go to these restaurants.

480
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,760
So there's a lot of things
that were there that needed

481
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,360
to be, you know, that I
learned from the locals.

482
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,840
This is the parallel
I draw from, you know,

483
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,393
the work we are doing
on the agentic AI side.

484
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,250
I think a lot of the work gets leveraged

485
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,280
through an automated way
the machine can learn,

486
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,550
but there will always be, at
least in my experience so far

487
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,840
using these models has been

488
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,820
that there will be a human touch,

489
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,570
which almost is similar
to the locals in a city

490
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,520
to provide that business context.

491
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,340
We know our business the
very, you know, best,

492
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,690
and it's very unique for us.

493
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,080
So we have to provide
that relevant experience

494
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,497
or data points for those models to work.

495
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:56,220
And the efficiencies of those
models will only improve

496
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,750
over time, just like,

497
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,470
way more took 10 years to
build an autonomous cut

498
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,217
while we just started
the journey right now.

499
00:24:05,217 --> 00:24:07,290
And I'm not saying it'll take 10 years,

500
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,438
but at least you know,

501
00:24:08,438 --> 00:24:11,940
it's gonna take time for it to be perfect.

502
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,430
But we see a world as you said, like,

503
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,170
hey, what are some of
the learnings over here?

504
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:20,790
We see a world that where AI is augmenting

505
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,800
the work that finance team is doing

506
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,320
and not replacing them completely.

507
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,670
Second, I think the finance
team now has much more speed

508
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,240
and bandwidth to focus
on business insights

509
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,240
to be truly a leader as well
as strategic business partner,

510
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:46,130
and then drive more data
based decision making.

511
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,300
So I would say that, you know,
this is where I feel like,

512
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,550
the learnings have been immense.

513
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,370
We're constantly improving our models,

514
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,917
the accuracy of the models, and you know,

515
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:01,950
and that's a journey as I
think we'll call it out.

516
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,240
- I mean, we talked about it earlier,

517
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,980
the more we enable technology
to any degree automation,

518
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,993
the agentic journey orchestration,

519
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,110
the more human we need
to be as leaders, right?

520
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:18,110
So it's not just the freeing
our time up for strategy,

521
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,220
it's the reasonableness.

522
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,430
You still have hallucinations
in a lot of the models

523
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,340
that cannot be relied on
for every business decision

524
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,173
out there.

525
00:25:27,173 --> 00:25:29,070
It's more than just a starting point

526
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,070
because even the progress
that we've made in the last,

527
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,610
I feel like the last 12
months has changed all

528
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,400
of the functions across
most of our companies.

529
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,690
But that means that us as leaders have to,

530
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,430
the empathy that we need to show up with,

531
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,940
we talked a little bit earlier,
the people part of this,

532
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,800
I've never seen a moment,

533
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,400
and I've been doing this now
for too long, I think 33 years.

534
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,310
I've never seen a moment
where the uncertainty,

535
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,470
because of the potential impact on jobs,

536
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:03,300
because of the potential impact
on your children's ability

537
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,090
to pursue careers that exist today,

538
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:10,860
that uncertainty has led
to just a lot of angst.

539
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,450
One of the things that we're rolling out,

540
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,380
I wasn't gonna mention this,

541
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,760
but now that I'm thinking about it,

542
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,630
we've invested a lot to
roll out a program in 2026,

543
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,240
where we're doing all the upskilling

544
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,260
that everybody else is doing,

545
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,570
and I think we're actually ahead in terms

546
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,190
of disrupting our own business,

547
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,680
but we're putting a lot of money toward,

548
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,700
I think it's 15 points around
a human-centered, you know,

549
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,160
circle in terms of, and
it's not just empathy,

550
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,650
it's coaching through uncertainty,

551
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,950
it's coaching when
technology changes workflows

552
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,660
on a very real time basis.

553
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,700
So the skills that we
have are a lot of things

554
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,910
that we were taught kind of
early on in terms of being kind

555
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,750
and helping bring people
along for the journey.

556
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,180
I think it's more important than ever.

557
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,110
- No, absolutely.

558
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,330
And I would add to that, like, I mean,

559
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,103
it will require us to rescale.

560
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,723
I mean, at least in the
finance organization,

561
00:27:01,723 --> 00:27:03,640
I can talk about that.

562
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,760
You know, it's not just gonna
be about reporting numbers

563
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,350
and doing the reconciliations.

564
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,910
It's gonna be about, you know,

565
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,800
how do we leverage the
tool we have and you know,

566
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,820
be more strategic about it.

567
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,480
And I think it's the right way.

568
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,160
I draw, you know, analogy
from like when we used

569
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,850
to do mental math and then
calculators were introduced,

570
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,430
everybody thought, oh my
god, my job's gonna be gone.

571
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,730
Well, it just enhanced your productivity.

572
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,460
Well, AI is going to
take that to, you know,

573
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,870
maybe 10x or you know, 50x fold in terms

574
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,190
of enhancing productivity,

575
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,160
but you will need, you
know, some level of touch,

576
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,700
human touch in there, and humans
and the workforce will have

577
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,240
to be retrained knowing how
to leverage this technology.

578
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,670
And, you know, maybe I'll also mention

579
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,750
about the demand forecasting
tool that we are, I mean,

580
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,400
I'll dive a little bit deeper into that,

581
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,030
because in my experience when we,

582
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,630
demand forecasting generally
is, I've seen at least in three

583
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,480
of my sort of experiences is
one of the most popular ways,

584
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,120
because very often, the CFOs,

585
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,940
the CEOs want to know what
their revenue is gonna be,

586
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,340
either for next month,
next quarter, next year,

587
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,843
or next five years, you know,

588
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:21,720
and the trigger for
revenue is for them to know

589
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,850
what the demand is gonna
look like and you know,

590
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,960
you can build price elasticity,
demand curves, and whatnot.

591
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,030
So far, you know, up until now,

592
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,400
we were able to take internal factors.

593
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,070
We could do some sort of
basic trend level analysis

594
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,740
and look at a, we have
these existing products,

595
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,870
this is gonna scale this
way and this, you know,

596
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,770
expect this kind of sort
of, GDP is growing X,

597
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:46,590
inflation going Y, you
know, assume sort of,

598
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,440
and some level of growth over there.

599
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,530
What we've done, I think with
this sort of agentic model is,

600
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,710
to be able to combine and
correlate both the external

601
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,420
and the internal factors
in one sort of platform.

602
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,978
And, you know, the external
factors are also not just about,

603
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:07,350
you know, you can take CPI, GDP growth,

604
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,150
for us, it's gas prices.

605
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,040
Some are lagging indicators,

606
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,870
but some are leading indicators.

607
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,870
So you know, drop in gas
prices negatively impacts EV,

608
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,390
increase in gas prices,
positively impacts.

609
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,520
So those are sort of leading
indicators, you know,

610
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,830
interest rate drops
that sort of, you know,

611
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,360
those are correlations you can make

612
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,560
through leading and lagging.

613
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,970
You match that against, you
know, incentives and discounts

614
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,000
and pricing offers that
we're giving in addition

615
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,240
to the order taker rate,
the pipeline that we have.

616
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,040
And you build multiple
sort of statistical models,

617
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,790
layer on top of that and
be able to, you know,

618
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:51,660
run those scenarios in
a fraction of a second.

619
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,450
I think that's breakthrough technology.

620
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,380
That's what I think will
give us the competitive edge.

621
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,000
To give you an example,

622
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,960
I think you mentioned about
hallucination, you know,

623
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,260
the EV credits were taken
away in September 30th.

624
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,380
The models assumed

625
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,040
that this event happens
every September 30th.

626
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,190
Well, this is where the
humans come into play.

627
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,710
They say, no, no, no,
this is a one-time event,

628
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,300
one-time activity.

629
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,780
Maybe the demand has accelerated,
maybe, you know, October,

630
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,290
November, December is gonna
go look very different.

631
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,750
So those are the things,
this is exactly like, I mean,

632
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,000
similar to COVID period,
right out of COVID,

633
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,220
nobody knew how the
demand is gonna shape out,

634
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,730
and everybody planned for the worst,

635
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,880
and we ended up being
in supply chain crisis.

636
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,790
So I would say there's that element

637
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,143
that will always be there.

638
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,180
- That makes a ton of sense.

639
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,720
But for the record, zero
to 60 in under two seconds

640
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,120
and 400 plus miles of range, like,

641
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,610
that's the only indicator I needed.

642
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,900
Like, I'm in.

643
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,520
- We compromise nothing.

644
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,500
- That's right. Well done.

645
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,730
Maybe let's pivot a little bit

646
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,040
to the technology discussion
a little bit more.

647
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,390
Lori, you started to take us there.

648
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,820
Maybe we spent a few more minutes on that.

649
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,550
Wil, I'd love to get you to
weigh in a little bit as well.

650
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,790
Like, there's a lot of
organizations that we work with,

651
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,420
that maybe they adopt
packaged finance solutions.

652
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,740
There's a lot of solutions out there

653
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,900
for finance professionals.

654
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,180
We've talked about RPA and
the role that it can play

655
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,330
in accelerating value
creation for finance teams,

656
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,390
but you guys have chose
to be on the leading edge.

657
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,150
So what was it that convinced you

658
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:37,260
that an agentic approach powered by AWS

659
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,903
was a compelling path to go on?

660
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,040
- For us, it boiled down to
we knew we had access to data.

661
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,530
We learned that after engaging PwC

662
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,440
and they showed us that
as a finance organization,

663
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,560
you have so much more data
than you are familiar with.

664
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,720
Yes, of course we run on SAP,

665
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,580
and so we're intimately
familiar with that,

666
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,280
but there was a ton of wealth on Redshift

667
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,140
that the PwC brought to our attention

668
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,640
that unlocked a lot of value for us.

669
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,090
And as that conversation grew,

670
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,570
we became more interested
in agentic, and now,

671
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,360
the solutions that we've
developed have really proven

672
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,020
that if you can unlock that data

673
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,360
that is captured all
throughout the company,

674
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,770
not just within finance,

675
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,750
we're leveraging data from Salesforce

676
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,500
and other platforms that's
really empowering us

677
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,253
to build solutions that add
a lot of value for finance.

678
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,943
- Fantastic.

679
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:37,863
Lori or Brad, anything you
wanna jump in on there?

680
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,470
- I always go broader.

681
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,630
Like, I look at it as a, like,

682
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:47,630
when the wave of
investments came for cloud

683
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:51,973
and cloud infrastructure, you
know, at that moment in time,

684
00:32:51,973 --> 00:32:54,060
you're spending a lot of time

685
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,520
on your technology
architecture to make sure

686
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,040
that the pipes work, to make
sure you're thinking about it

687
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,250
in a way where the total
cost of ownership makes sense

688
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,420
for the company.

689
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,240
The shift now oftentimes has been,

690
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,240
I think in 2023 and 2024
definitely had a lot of companies

691
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,620
that were experimenting.

692
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,490
There were a lot of pilots

693
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,220
that were going on even through '25.

694
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,200
I think the word purposeful

695
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,440
and disciplined I think
become really important

696
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,030
when you talk about agentic

697
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,970
because it's not just the use cases,

698
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,460
the use cases are really
important because they're the one,

699
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,580
they're your path to drive an outcome.

700
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,770
But what's equally
important is making sure

701
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,290
that the new architecture makes sense

702
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,880
so that you're gaining access,

703
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,730
the integration points are there to data

704
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,850
across the business,
potentially in most cases data

705
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:48,210
that far exceeds anything that
you've ever had access to.

706
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,430
But you also have the scalability

707
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,800
and the performance long term.

708
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,890
I always look at the
economics associated with it.

709
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,540
So if you think about GPUs,

710
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,600
and it's hard to look at the
news without a conversation

711
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,780
in terms of semiconductor industry

712
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,360
and supply chain challenges and the like.

713
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,740
You've gotta be really smart in terms

714
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,780
of how you build the journey

715
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,970
because there's only so much capacity

716
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:15,060
that's gonna be available,
at least in the near term.

717
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,300
And so for that, one of the
things that we've been doing

718
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,240
with clients is what needs to
run on a large language model

719
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,570
versus what might be able
to run on an edge solution,

720
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:28,770
and starting to architect
different technologies

721
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,590
or different solutions
depending upon the workflow.

722
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,240
I think that's gonna be really important

723
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,210
in the coming months and years

724
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,470
because we will have capacity
challenges based on the energy

725
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,850
that's gonna be required in order

726
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,600
to run what we think is gonna be a, yeah,

727
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,690
a massive change for all of the companies

728
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,493
that are represented in this realm.

729
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,663
- Fantastic.

730
00:34:53,663 --> 00:34:57,630
I think again, moving at the
speed that you're moving,

731
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,280
I think it's important
maybe for the audience

732
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,960
like this wasn't,

733
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,540
this project that we're
discussing out of the gate,

734
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,220
like, this wasn't a two-year project

735
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,230
to enable edge into capabilities, right?

736
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,400
Like, this was 10 weeks,
something like that, right?

737
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,800
Like, what is it that allows
you to move that fast?

738
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,420
Is it a particular technology?

739
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,010
Is it your organization is,

740
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,240
I'd love to think it was your partners,

741
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,190
but what is it gonna help?

742
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,080
- It's also our partners. It's our org.

743
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,913
It's our culture.

744
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:26,850
We run, we move at a
really quick fast pace.

745
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,030
And I always joke with people

746
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,220
when I'm interviewing them is
they have to be comfortable

747
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,050
with not knowing what
they're gonna do tomorrow.

748
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,270
As an example, I did not
know I'd be on this stage

749
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:40,020
when I woke up this morning,
but that's the pace we work at.

750
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,530
And I've been with EV
startups for eight years.

751
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,780
It's been like that every single year.

752
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,700
It's constantly changing.

753
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,920
We're developing, we're
trying to disrupt a very old

754
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,620
industry and we're using
cutting edge technology.

755
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,740
And so the pace, I
cannot emphasize enough,

756
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,060
it's extremely fast,

757
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,610
and you have to be able to
adapt with that quickly.

758
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:03,273
And if you can, you'll catch
on to things like this.

759
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,070
- I think the other thing
just to add though is,

760
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,250
when we're talking about the
technology is that, you know,

761
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,680
finance professionals
have been doing their role

762
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,760
for a long time

763
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,430
and they don't really
understand the capabilities

764
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,570
that are being unlocked.

765
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:23,520
And so the battle that I
always run into with clients

766
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,560
is getting them to think differently.

767
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,290
Like, how do I, like for instance,

768
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,440
if we think about I close
the books on a monthly basis.

769
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,240
I do my (indistinct) on a monthly basis.

770
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,660
I do, why, I mean we could automate

771
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,250
and do a lot of that stuff daily.

772
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,200
We can start to go to a continuous close.

773
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,880
We can start, there's all these things

774
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,070
that we've just gotta make the edge,

775
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,890
I'd say one is educate
the finance professionals

776
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,830
around what is the capabilities today.

777
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,520
And then two, encourage them
and support them in thinking

778
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,770
of about what are the other
things I can dream of,

779
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,510
what are the things that we can try to do?

780
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,020
And then a culture that supports
it such that when he said,

781
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,173
hey, we take a leap of
faith, that's so critical.

782
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,760
- Yeah, and I would just add
to that, I think as Wil said,

783
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,150
like, I think the speed is important,

784
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,320
but I think the exec
sponsorship alignment,

785
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,150
leadership sort of, you know,
support is super critical

786
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,240
for any such projects to be successful.

787
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,470
And once you get that, I think
you have to move very quickly

788
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,600
and you have to iterate fast.

789
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,750
You have to fail fast if you will.

790
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,290
And learn and adapt and tweak models.

791
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,810
It'll never be perfect 'cause you know,

792
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:44,810
that will just take time
and I would say, you know,

793
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,620
adjust those models and make it, you know,

794
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,170
if it's 80% there, I
think it's a good start,

795
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,973
and you keep iterating on that.

796
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,570
- In order to keep moving at that speed,

797
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,270
we often talk about the
importance of governance,

798
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,700
specifically in the
finance function, right?

799
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,410
And governance takes many forms,

800
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,170
whether it's the organizational structure,

801
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,370
the people governance,

802
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,400
or whether it's what the
technology enables us to do.

803
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,250
We've talked a lot at this
at the re:Invent this year,

804
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,220
talking about automated
reasoning as part of agent core

805
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,120
and things like that.

806
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,020
We're excited,

807
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,000
you guys are implementing
some of those things.

808
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,650
Maybe give us some thoughts

809
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,970
on just the governance
controls responsible portion

810
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,620
of the discussion specifically,

811
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,120
'cause we're talking about
finance, it's critical.

812
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,380
- It's not just finance.

813
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,700
It really is a collaboration
across so many teams.

814
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,343
I can tell you, being on this project,

815
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,550
I've worked with and have now become very,

816
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,280
very close to a number of different teams

817
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,220
that I did not know existed
prior to this project,

818
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,360
cybersecurity, infrastructures,
internal audit, you name it.

819
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,340
Everyone had to get involved
and align on what needs

820
00:39:01,334 --> 00:39:02,670
to happen in order to enable this.

821
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,520
And so once you get that
cross-functional alignment,

822
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,713
I think it's much more feasible.

823
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,147
- And I think, you know, IT,

824
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:15,870
and we have a dedicated AI
team understanding, you know,

825
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,090
laying out the architecture

826
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:22,023
and the cost sort of economics
of it as Lori mentioned,

827
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:27,030
but weekly check-ins,
making sure that, you know,

828
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:31,475
you unblock all your barriers,
you know, very sort of,

829
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:33,711
you know, methodical and timely way.

830
00:39:33,711 --> 00:39:34,680
And of course, cybersecurity,

831
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,360
security is super important over here.

832
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,850
I mean we're talking about AI,

833
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,710
but we also wanna make sure we, you know,

834
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,910
our models are safe and,
you know, good for use.

835
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,680
- He's joking. He said weekly check-ins.

836
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,570
There were 8:00 AM calls every day.

837
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,793
So it was not weekly, it was daily.

838
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,670
- There was only so many weeks. (laughs)

839
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,950
I mean, you guys are moving so quickly,

840
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,120
daily seems appropriate.

841
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,680
Lori, how does this line up with-

842
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,930
- Yeah, I also see, like,
sometimes I'm surprised,

843
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,840
like, I'll get on a call
and see a demo of something

844
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,540
that we've built with customers.

845
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,610
It's interesting 'cause
it's different dependent

846
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:12,900
upon what a company
wants to spend money on.

847
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,300
And so I'd love to think we shape that,

848
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,310
but oftentimes we're on the receiving end

849
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,650
of what a company is willing to do

850
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,640
and when they're willing to do it

851
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,230
and how fast they're willing to do it.

852
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,510
In this particular case,
it's been fun for everybody

853
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,630
because of the pace, may
not always feel that way,

854
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:31,320
but the outcome has been there,
because you're seeing things

855
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,390
in action faster than we ever have.

856
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,430
But I was on a call a couple weeks ago

857
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,950
and one of my teams was walking me

858
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,830
through what I would consider
if there's internal auditors

859
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,840
in the room, then forgive me,

860
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,230
but what I would consider
to be kind of mundane work

861
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,120
in terms of controls testing that you have

862
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,030
to do on a regular basis and it's rotating

863
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,660
and still sample sizes
and all that good stuff.

864
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,660
We took something that used to
take 20 days to test down to,

865
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,920
they were telling me it was
two minutes and they said,

866
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,620
our goal is that it's gonna
be less than 20 seconds.

867
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,390
And that's what we're working on right now

868
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,690
with the right kind of
guardrails and you know,

869
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,630
and making sure the reasonableness
checks are there as well.

870
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,300
You get to do a larger
population in a very short amount

871
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,630
of time, which frees up
internal auditors to think

872
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,760
about where the risks are in the business

873
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,420
and help the company protect
against malicious intent

874
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,570
of which unfortunately
that's going up as well.

875
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,100
- Maybe if you can just
continue that thought,

876
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,840
think about the next, you
know, 12 months, two years,

877
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,880
what kind, like, what
are our clients expecting

878
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,690
in their finance organization
and more broadly?

879
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,670
And then I'd love to hear
like specifically to Lucid,

880
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,930
like, what are you guys thinking about?

881
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,030
You did this so quickly.

882
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,033
12 months seems like an
eternity at the speed you move.

883
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,733
- I mean, on most days,

884
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:51,030
I don't think we're moving fast enough.

885
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:56,030
So I think every single
function needs a backlog

886
00:41:56,070 --> 00:42:01,070
and what you did in 10 weeks,
to me, that's the new model.

887
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,430
You're gonna be running sprints

888
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,290
and you're gonna be working
through that backlog

889
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,150
and you're going to iterate on solutions

890
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,640
that you may have built
in the first 10 weeks

891
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,330
are gonna seem archaic, you
know, 18 months from now,

892
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,610
not even 18 months from now.

893
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:18,150
I think, you know, one,
we try and avoid lock-in.

894
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,920
So most enterprises have multiple
models that are available

895
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,550
to them, some of which are for economics,

896
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,770
others are for kind of purposeful intent

897
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,870
in terms of the outcome that
you're trying to deliver.

898
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,600
I think that's gonna be
important. It is a race.

899
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,990
So it depends on the technology
providers as well in terms

900
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:41,760
of, you know, who continues
to evolve the fastest in a way

901
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,680
that is gonna be meaningful

902
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,100
for your business across
certain functions.

903
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,590
The technology's moving
quickly and I think, you know,

904
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,530
just as much, we've gotta think through.

905
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,270
I love the discussion on growth

906
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:58,770
because oftentimes AI is
talked about as a cost lever.

907
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,150
So how do you drive more efficiency?

908
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,010
How do you potentially reduce head count?

909
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,210
That's not what it's about.

910
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,800
It's unlocking capacity and
it's unlocking a growth strategy

911
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,440
that's not available
today for most companies

912
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,940
because they do have a cap on headcount

913
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,710
and they do have a cap on capacity.

914
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,610
That's the part that's exciting to me.

915
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:21,330
- Yeah, and I think for Lucid,
as you, you know, call out,

916
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:24,750
it's pretty much in line
with that in terms of like,

917
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,870
you know, speed is
gonna be super critical,

918
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:32,790
and understanding, you
know, the ability to adapt

919
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,160
to market conditions,
changing market conditions

920
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,750
and providing real time analytics
and predictive analytics

921
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,563
or insights with, you know,
database decision making.

922
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,890
In terms of, you know, finance,

923
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,130
I believe will become
a catalyst for growth

924
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,380
because as I mentioned earlier,

925
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,220
like, it will unlock a lot
of data that, you know,

926
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,410
generally is connected
when everything flows

927
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,160
into a financial system, it is
flowing from multiple systems

928
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,130
and there's a, you know,
potential to unlock a lot

929
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:09,330
of value in terms of providing
valuable business insight.

930
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:14,330
Third, I think it also will
lay down the foundation for us

931
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,596
for finance organization to
be a competitive edge in,

932
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:21,030
you know, in the things
that I talked about.

933
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,827
And lastly I would say like, you know,

934
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:27,827
the finance organization will
truly be a strategic business

935
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:33,770
partner in, they would think
of them more as like the locals

936
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,700
in that story that I just mentioned.

937
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:40,170
They would be considered as
locals knowing their domain,

938
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,380
their expertise, their sort of area,

939
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,990
and be able to provide
that business context,

940
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:49,140
valuable business context
to those stakeholders,

941
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,973
important and critical for
decision making at every level.

942
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,440
- I mean, you're setting
the pace with finance,

943
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,290
which I don't get to say that very often.

944
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,390
Usually, I can't say
in most organizations,

945
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:07,560
finance is setting a pace around
AI, so kudos there, right?

946
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,480
But with that in mind, like,

947
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,130
where do you see the next
transformation taking place?

948
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,580
Like, is this gonna spill
over into factory ops

949
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,630
and supply chain?

950
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,793
Like, where is this headed?

951
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:25,230
- For Lucid, specifically, you know,

952
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:28,950
we've just started on
this journey and you know,

953
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:33,840
we have as I think Lori mentioned,

954
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,240
there's a backlog of items that, you know,

955
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,550
once you see the art of possible,

956
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,070
every team raises their
hand and they'll say like,

957
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,650
oh, I should be doing this,
I should be doing that.

958
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,170
I see factory operations
in terms of like, you know,

959
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:50,340
factory production, we manufacture
our own cars, you know,

960
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:55,140
in United States, and so
constraints around that,

961
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,970
supply chain constraints, you know,

962
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:00,450
we ran into a lot of like
critical parts like magnets

963
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,280
and things like that where, you know,

964
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,320
supplier health and things like that,

965
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,533
where that's another wave
of sort of, you know,

966
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,180
complexity that we will navigate through.

967
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,750
And above all, I also think,

968
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:20,250
I don't know what voice we'll
do in terms of AI capability,

969
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,470
you know, that's another
transformational sort

970
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:25,380
of cross point that
I'm looking forward to,

971
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,300
which might even further disrupt some

972
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,000
of the work we're doing over here.

973
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,880
- Yeah, I think we're seeing
speech to speech models

974
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,790
in particular becoming very
powerful and transformative.

975
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,383
So that's a good call out.

976
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,510
Maybe I'll throw this one out to anybody.

977
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,440
We touched on it a little bit,

978
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,360
but this is the human plus AI
element to the conversation.

979
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,630
Lori, I think you started to
unpack, this is about more,

980
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,320
not shaving down through efficiency,

981
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,060
particularly with the steep growth

982
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,580
that's projected for the Lucid team.

983
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,690
Like, how are we seeing

984
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:04,443
that come together both maybe
at Lucid or even more broadly?

985
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:11,550
- I mean, I think about
it from a perspective

986
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:16,550
of what is gonna differentiate
finance people going forward,

987
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:20,100
is their ability to
integrate with the technology

988
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,330
and the AI.

989
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,700
And I've said it a few times,

990
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,440
I just feel really strongly about it.

991
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,930
And that's where really
around thinking differently

992
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,880
around how they do their jobs.

993
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,860
And so it's how can, you know,
how can I be more impactful?

994
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:38,250
How can I identify more
value for the company?

995
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:41,100
How can I send better
signals to operations?

996
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,410
How can, all of these things,
which today, you know,

997
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:46,350
a lot of times old school
finance organizations

998
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:50,640
are really looking at,
they're reporting backward.

999
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,470
Like, how did we do last quarter?

1000
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:55,890
How are we going against
plan? What is the difference?

1001
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:57,960
But they're not saying,
what are those levers

1002
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,900
that are driving the changes
and figure out how I change it.

1003
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,170
So I look and I go, oh, I
gave you an EPS estimate of X,

1004
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:06,300
I'm gonna be 7% lower.

1005
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,420
How do I use AI to model
out different scenarios

1006
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,160
of different behaviors to be able to see,

1007
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,360
can I close that gap?

1008
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,030
What levers can I pull?
What things can I do?

1009
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,680
And it's the combination of the two,

1010
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,600
which is really gonna drive value.

1011
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,570
And so when folks think about, you know,

1012
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:24,810
oh, there's the risk of efficiencies

1013
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,610
that could impact my role.

1014
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,650
I think about it a little
differently in the fact

1015
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,450
that it's the combination of the two

1016
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,520
that can really provide the value

1017
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,680
for the financial
professional going forward.

1018
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,200
And they can bring that insight

1019
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,570
that just technology can't, right?

1020
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:41,580
They know how to put those things together

1021
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,343
and really differentiate themselves.

1022
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,800
- The other element,

1023
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,820
and we're saying that we just
did a benchmarking exercise

1024
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,520
for a few of our clients.

1025
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,480
You wanna look at the past,

1026
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,600
you wanna be able to
scenario plan for the future.

1027
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,950
You wanna look at your peer set,

1028
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,050
you wanna look at best in class.

1029
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:03,900
Oftentimes that took a long time to do.

1030
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,600
And I think that it goes back to speed.

1031
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,980
If you can ask a large
language model very quickly

1032
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,620
to take a look through the Ks and the Qs,

1033
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,620
and the analyst reports and the like,

1034
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,450
in terms of what are the growth levers

1035
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:21,810
that are out there that may
impact my business faster,

1036
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:25,320
and am I missing something on
my cost structure associated

1037
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,350
with, and the formulas that
I use in terms of the mix

1038
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:31,560
of CapEx and opex and the like,

1039
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,410
I think that's where the
creativity gets unlocked.

1040
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:39,240
Like, for too long, there's a
lot of jobs that have become,

1041
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,590
it's not that they're transactional,

1042
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:44,400
but there's a lot of time
spent on the workflow itself

1043
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,030
and it doesn't allow for,
you know, that's why when,

1044
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,890
if you've slept eight
hours a night or seven

1045
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:52,020
or eight hours a night,
which we should be doing,

1046
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,730
and you wake up, they say,

1047
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,920
do your hardest task first, right?

1048
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,850
We're all tired when we're
trying to unlock that creativity,

1049
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:02,610
oftentimes we're on the
other end of being very tired

1050
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:04,650
with everything that's
going on in our lives.

1051
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:08,190
If we can simplify how we get
the information in our hands

1052
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:10,740
and the right information
to actually unlock

1053
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,980
how the business should be
performing, that's what,

1054
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,410
to your point in terms of
being a strategic partner

1055
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:19,210
to the business, I think
that's gonna be the difference.

1056
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,870
- Yeah, I mean at Lucid,
we do see a world with AI

1057
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:28,470
as sort of augmenting the
finance team and especially,

1058
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,900
you know, to drive the
growth in a more sustainable

1059
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,283
and a cost efficient way.

1060
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,793
Yeah.

1061
00:50:34,793 --> 00:50:36,450
- Yeah, makes a ton of sense.

1062
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,117
I know we're getting close
on time, so I just want to-

1063
00:50:39,117 --> 00:50:39,950
- I think it's happy
hour for a lot of people.

1064
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,564
- Is it? It's happy hour for me, always.

1065
00:50:42,564 --> 00:50:45,540
Let's talk about, one last good question.

1066
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,710
I'd like to just go down,

1067
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,810
and let you guys give some quick thoughts.

1068
00:50:49,742 --> 00:50:52,350
A lot of people may be
in the room or elsewhere,

1069
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,810
are thinking about how
they get on the journey

1070
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:57,810
or what this journey
might look like for them.

1071
00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:00,540
All of you have practical
experience doing this

1072
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,840
in sometimes many forms,
in an accelerated form,

1073
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,605
particularly at Lucid, you know,

1074
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,590
you gotta have some practical advice

1075
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:10,560
based on the lessons learned
even out of the gate.

1076
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,270
If you can think of just one thing

1077
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,680
that you might wanna share with people

1078
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,850
who are considering going
down a similar journey,

1079
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:20,640
what would that one thing that
you might share with them?

1080
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,690
I don't think there's a wrong answer here.

1081
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:22,713
So, no pressure.

1082
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,070
- You wanna start?

1083
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:30,300
- I would say move quickly, move fast,

1084
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,573
but this space is changing,

1085
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:39,273
but first, get the executive
sponsorship and alignment ASAP,

1086
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:44,520
and then prioritize, I mean
identify your pain points

1087
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,440
and make sure you're prioritized,

1088
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,360
'cause you won't be able to
address every single sort

1089
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,340
of use case over there.

1090
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:55,143
So based on your sort of, you
know, priority, move quickly.

1091
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,613
- I would just add, make it personal.

1092
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,793
One of the key learnings I have is,

1093
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,190
everyone's afraid of change.

1094
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,680
And when we're talking about data,

1095
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,170
there's a lot of security concerns.

1096
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:13,650
But when I would set up
meetings or talk with the people

1097
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:18,030
who were hesitant to
allow this or enable it,

1098
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,350
they were on board.

1099
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:20,700
We just had to make that human connection

1100
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,950
and make sure that everyone
was on the same page.

1101
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:23,880
And once they were,

1102
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,980
whether it be internal audit
or anyone else, they were like,

1103
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,780
oh, oh, okay, sure, no problem.

1104
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,653
I understand now.

1105
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,950
And so just make sure you check that box

1106
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,710
and not just try to pass it

1107
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:37,140
because it's a little, it
takes time, it does, you know,

1108
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,848
require conversation and what have you,

1109
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:42,510
but once you unlock that,
it really will help.

1110
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:43,890
- And Wil, you mentioned it earlier,

1111
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:45,930
I think you've gotta be
comfortable waking up tomorrow

1112
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,640
that your job is changing.

1113
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,420
I always look at the, it's
an interesting moment,

1114
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:55,200
and I was talking to my adult kids.

1115
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,700
Like, you gotta lean in, right?

1116
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,320
Like, the people that are not lean,

1117
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,600
if you are in a white-collar job

1118
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,260
and you are not leaning
into AI, that's a mistake.

1119
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,840
Your job will not exist as it does today.

1120
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,090
So one of the things
as leaders in the room,

1121
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:12,960
as individuals and as
mentors to the people

1122
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,290
that are around us, we have no
choice but to be a role model

1123
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,720
in terms of understanding the technology,

1124
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,190
thinking through use cases,

1125
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,560
thinking through how fast
can I disrupt the business?

1126
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,810
And thinking about how
to unlock creativity

1127
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:28,410
that can improve the
growth strategy associated

1128
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:29,640
with the companies.

1129
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,060
- I have a really quick
story to add on that note.

1130
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,580
At the very beginning of the
project, I took a flight,

1131
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,550
I was in the ILC and I
could see the gentleman,

1132
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,770
his laptop screen across from me.

1133
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,570
And I knew it from 30 seconds in,

1134
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:45,270
I knew he was in finance
because he has this spreadsheet

1135
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:48,240
with tables and the tables
have like red and green

1136
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,520
and he's capturing it on
a, you know, snapshot.

1137
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,080
And then he flips over to PowerPoint,

1138
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,960
pastes it on the slide, expands it,

1139
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,090
and then starts writing bullet points

1140
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,950
to accompany the tables.

1141
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:01,080
And I just thought to myself,

1142
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,813
and I went back and the
team knows I said this,

1143
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,530
I know that guy's gonna be a dinosaur

1144
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,330
if he doesn't change the way he works.

1145
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,800
I knew exactly what he was doing.

1146
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,200
He didn't have to say anything.
I just saw his screen.

1147
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,270
I was familiar with that.
I've done it for decades.

1148
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:18,270
And knowing that he's
still operating like that,

1149
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:21,120
it has to change or he's
gonna get passed by.

1150
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:21,953
- Right.

1151
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,800
- Last thing I would add is,

1152
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,930
is finding those people
in the organization

1153
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:30,870
that can help be the change
agents and think big.

1154
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,610
You know, I think about,

1155
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,360
I've done a lot of work
with airlines and you know,

1156
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,950
one of the issues that this airline

1157
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:41,250
had was that they were way
over on budget, on crew labor.

1158
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,590
And so it was a finance issue

1159
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:46,620
and we started deconstructing
it, working through it.

1160
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,990
I spoke to the head of
flight ops the other day

1161
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:52,410
and they'll save $200 million this year

1162
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:56,430
based upon developing a tool
to figure out the forecast,

1163
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:59,310
which then led to, oh, we
can schedule different,

1164
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:02,580
we can align crew different,
we can, and no, no, no.

1165
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,680
They just start taking
it forward and forward,

1166
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,420
and you need those people
in the organization

1167
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,000
that are willing to challenge those norms

1168
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,460
'cause that's where the
real value is going to be,

1169
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,584
not just in the efficiencies,
it's what different,

1170
00:55:14,584 --> 00:55:15,930
what can we do operationally different,

1171
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:17,733
what insights can we get, et cetera.

1172
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:21,930
- I was just gonna add to Wil's comment.

1173
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:24,390
Like, I think that the,

1174
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:28,080
one of the use cases we have
is exactly to leverage some

1175
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,710
of our board decks and
our sort of slidewares

1176
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:34,350
to be able to populate
exactly not just the data,

1177
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,210
but also the commentary.

1178
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:39,300
There is an executive dashboard
that has been, you know,

1179
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,570
as a use case been created,
which will, you know,

1180
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:46,260
based on the users, whether
it's a CEO, it's a different,

1181
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,220
you know, use case,

1182
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,960
and whether it's a CFO
at different use case,

1183
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,270
whether it's a, you know, finance leader,

1184
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:52,260
it's a different use case,

1185
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,620
but they get sort of the
commentary on a daily basis,

1186
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,940
not like a Tableau dashboard,

1187
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,670
but they get all the
metrics with the commentary

1188
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:02,850
and it allows them to sort of navigate

1189
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:06,330
and have almost conversational analytics.

1190
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:09,330
Okay, here are your red areas,
here are your, you know,

1191
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,760
pain points, tell me
what's going on over there,

1192
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,020
which, why is it this way?

1193
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,800
Why has the ASP gone down or
what, you know, which area,

1194
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,800
what triggered that sort of,
you know, headwind and whatnot?

1195
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,410
So I mean, back to your
point, as you said,

1196
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,840
like, we're already doing that.

1197
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,303
So, it's a good call out.

1198
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:33,240
- The context that it
provides is critical, right?

1199
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,450
Like, we could spend a whole
nother session on context.

1200
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:38,730
I just wanna say thank
you to the panelists.

1201
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:40,650
A refreshing conversation
is a little bit different

1202
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:43,410
than a lot of the conversations
that we have at re:Invent.

1203
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:45,240
So thank you for just investing the time,

1204
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,980
sharing your expertise.

1205
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,740
I wanna say thank you
for just the opportunity

1206
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,750
to be your partner on this journey.

1207
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,910
We're truly honored.

1208
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,000
And then for everyone,
audience, and up here,

1209
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,910
just wishing you a fantastic
remainder of your re:Invent.

1210
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,710
Thank you for spending time with us.
