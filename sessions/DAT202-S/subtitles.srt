1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,220
- Hopefully everyone's not hungry, right?

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,540
Like let's get started.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,100
Maybe a lot of you are listening to a lot

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,423
of pitches about Gen AI.

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,210
So I'm here to talk about Gen AI as well,

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,450
but how to make it simpler
to build applications

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,920
with Gen AI, right?

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,180
So firstly, quick intro about gigabyte DB.

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,030
Gigabyte is a distributed
Postgres database

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,210
and we are simplifying
building applications,

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,750
whether it be Gen AI or not,
like databases should, right?

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,120
So fully Postgres for the developer,

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,760
truly cloud native and making it simpler.

14
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,960
Let's see how.

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,580
So firstly, right?

16
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,970
We are not yet at the great explosion

17
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,430
that's going to be powered by Gen AI.

18
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,680
We are in 2025.

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,630
The effects of Gen AI are projected

20
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,760
to happen in the next three years.

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,140
We are there, right?

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,290
So whatever you're doing now,
it's not much different from

23
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,540
what you were doing last
year or the year before,

24
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,820
compared to what you will be
doing three years from now.

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,960
It's going to be three

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,230
to 10 times more often
build and ship, right?

27
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,670
So, okay, everyone's investing in AI.

28
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,970
Any which way you look at it
like these are our own users

29
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,370
and customers on the right
showing you, you know,

30
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,260
charts of where their investments

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,600
on the left different data points, right?

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,790
Obviously not gonna go
through them, but it's real.

33
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,943
The investment is real, okay?

34
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,030
The expectations are huge, okay?

35
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,060
People are building apparently
the entire app in three days,

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,860
in four days, in an hour.

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,200
You know, vibe coding
their way out of things.

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,440
Gen AI solving problems,
agents talking to agents,

39
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,060
talking to agents, solving problems,

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,680
so on and so forth, right?

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,290
That's the era of the
expectations we have built

42
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,480
for ourselves, okay?

43
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,420
But that's reality, okay?

44
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,090
It's not living up to
where it needs to be.

45
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,660
Most of the people are doing
AI, they're working for AI,

46
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,370
but is AI working for them?

47
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,600
Have they unlocked business
value? Not so much, right?

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,960
And you know, as database builder,

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,790
we try to make building applications

50
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,560
and unlocking value simpler.

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,120
So you know, that's one of the
things we look at. Why, okay?

52
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,400
This is the fundamental difference.

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,830
AI makes the software build

54
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,803
and deploy loop so fast, it's exponential.

55
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,060
And as humans, we cannot
imagine exponential.

56
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,400
We're not good at it.
We're not built for it.

57
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,030
So we often, you know, I don't
know if everybody's like me,

58
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,700
but I often think I can get a
lot done today and this week

59
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,860
and I kind of have no idea what I will be,

60
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,960
how much I can get done in a year.

61
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,734
You know, I usually end
up doing more in the year

62
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:38,250
in less today or the week, right?

63
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,480
That's just human nature.

64
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,470
So how do you build
something you cannot imagine?

65
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,570
You don't know where you're
going, but you know it's big.

66
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,373
It's huge. How do you get there?

67
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,760
There's one principle to change.
The principle is iterate.

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,360
Iterate every day, right?
Don't visualize the end state.

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,760
Just iterate your way into it, right?

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,890
So I don't know about you guys.

71
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,350
I've been in the software
industry for more than 20 years.

72
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,790
Started out as a developer.

73
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,980
There was one rule I was told.

74
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,090
Build to last.

75
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,010
If you build it, it's gotta be around

76
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,230
for two to three years,
minimum, maybe more.

77
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,720
The longer it stays,
the better you built it.

78
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,850
Well guess what? All
that's outta the window.

79
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,070
We are building to change.

80
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,140
You know, six months ago, no MCP,

81
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,270
six months before that,
rag was a buzzword.

82
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,217
Six months before that, I don't
know, Gen AI was happening.

83
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:27,330
Who the hell knew?

84
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,820
Every six months,
everything's out the window.

85
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,140
So how do you build when
you have to iterate,

86
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,460
how do you build...

87
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,290
And obviously the solution's
not every six months.

88
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,430
Let's build something from scratch.

89
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,840
You're not gonna go anywhere that way.

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,740
So these are the challenges that we see

91
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,290
from building a stateful
application, right?

92
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,000
What are the challenges?

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,990
First one,

94
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,990
the tech stack is changing all the time.

95
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,780
Open standards, super important.

96
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,790
Go for something that you know,

97
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,580
AI will not magically
solve the problem for you.

98
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,940
AI will make you faster
at something, you know?

99
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,060
So pick an open standard
in the database world.

100
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,630
Pick the Postgres API, it's
really thriving and happening.

101
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,840
Make sure it's well connected
to the entire ecosystem.

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,910
It lets you iterate.

103
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,280
For us, for Gigabyte, what are we doing?

104
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,590
We pick up on top of Postgres,

105
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,740
we build innovation on top
to make your lives easier

106
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,080
and to make you go faster
on top of something

107
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,880
that's already familiar to you.

108
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,050
We bring standards across
clouds purposefully, right?

109
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,940
So different clouds are
building different kinds

110
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,980
of power ups for AI.

111
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,060
Postgres is an open standard,

112
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,520
but you get those power
ups only in those clouds,

113
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,260
like the vector search capabilities.

114
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,403
We democratize it.

115
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,240
Okay. Second challenge.

116
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,403
How do you accommodate data diversity?

117
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,630
Today's applications put data together

118
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,180
that have no business being together.

119
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,970
For example, we're talking to a bank,

120
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,190
they want to do an MCP server.

121
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,790
What should the user be
able to ask the MCP server?

122
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,120
How do I open a checking
account that goes,

123
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,150
can you transfer $10 from my
account to my friend's account

124
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,460
and here's his name and
email and identification.

125
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,760
Can you go do this for me?

126
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,240
Well that wasn't covered in the docs.

127
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,860
Well that's something
else you gotta talk to.

128
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,870
Do you even have authorization for that?

129
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,280
Well, you're not gonna build two chatbots,

130
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,660
you're gonna build one, right?

131
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,230
So everything has to be
integrated into a single offering,

132
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,500
which means more locations, more formats.

133
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,020
Your checking account
balance now needs to work

134
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,870
with the documentation on how
to open a checking account.

135
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,220
How do you make that happen?

136
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,930
And quickly, right?

137
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,210
So one of the things we're doing here,

138
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,460
and here's the beauty of Postgres, again,

139
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,430
lots of innovation in connecting data

140
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,370
of different types in
storing transactional data,

141
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,190
operational data, data
living in S3 buckets,

142
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,320
like images, like something else, right?

143
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,300
Like I know like you guys
would be listening to many

144
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,270
of the vector store guys,
more power to them coming

145
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,620
and saying, how can we make it better?

146
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,580
Make it better. Remember, you've
got to be able to iterate.

147
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,560
Iterate comes from simplicity.

148
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,740
Once you determine what
you need to make better,

149
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,940
go make that better.

150
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,770
But make sure you have to build it to last

151
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,150
before you build it to last.

152
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,370
Because building it to last will be all

153
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,320
that we will accomplish if we don't think

154
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,520
about flexibility, right?

155
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,750
So this really helps bring data
that are of disparate types

156
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,763
and locations together.

157
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,133
Third problem.

158
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,010
If you're building a
pipeline every time you

159
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,080
have a new data source or a new LLM

160
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,320
or a new type of data like,
oh gee, I added an image,

161
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,780
now I need to go figure out
how to make images work.

162
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,210
Okay, videos, okay,
let's go figure that out.

163
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,070
How about we throw in some documentation?

164
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,600
Okay, let's go figure that out.

165
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,450
Each thing is a two to four week sprint

166
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,040
and the sprint is done in order

167
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,230
to figure out if the product is viable.

168
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,420
So at the end of it, you get two things.

169
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,670
You fail by the number of effort,

170
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,150
the amount of effort you take
to make it viable to test it.

171
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,220
And finally you have
a hodgepodge of things

172
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,066
that's very difficult to productionize.

173
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:03,180
So you had to throw it all
away and start from scratch.

174
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,270
So what is it that we're doing here?

175
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,270
We're trying to simplify
how you manage a pipeline,

176
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,450
a rag pipeline as a secondary
index in the database.

177
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,720
Just tell the database,
look, there's the data.

178
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,000
That's the way I want you
to parse it. It's an image.

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,250
I want you to parse it using that parser.

180
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,550
Go to that LLM and vectorize
it and store the results.

181
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,530
And it may take you two hours to do.

182
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,200
Just give me a progress
report every time I check

183
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,960
and when it's ready, just
make it ready to serve.

184
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,080
If I want to re-index the
data, change my index type,

185
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,090
well just create a new index.

186
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,100
AB test against indexes.

187
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,770
Don't AB test by building
rag pipelines, right?

188
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,593
Make your development
iterations speeds faster.

189
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
The way we're doing that is a lot

190
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,860
of cool things in this slide.

191
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,240
The main thing you have to look at

192
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,490
is the thing in the center, right?

193
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,750
Insert for the rag extension

194
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,030
into a rag source table, right?

195
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,340
Just give the extension the source

196
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,560
and it'll go build the pipeline for you.

197
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,830
You can tweak parameters, how
to chunk, how to partition,

198
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,320
how many chunks are
processed, all of that stuff.

199
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,250
Simplify.

200
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,940
Just use a single line of
SQL and get the job done.

201
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,330
Make sure it works before you
invest in specialized stuff.

202
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,163
Great.

203
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,610
Okay, you got it done.
You got the MVP done.

204
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,080
How do you go to production?

205
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,550
It's all running on my laptop

206
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,150
and I need to run in a
multi-zone, highly available,

207
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,940
maybe AWS, maybe GCP, maybe Kubernetes.

208
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,560
How do you make this work?

209
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,660
Well, that's one of the things we do.

210
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,060
Gigabyte DB is fully open source.

211
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,150
Build it on your laptop and
take it to production, right?

212
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,040
And so we help you with the management

213
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,760
with an API based end-to-end
lifecycle management, right?

214
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,790
And the thing about rag, it
will take a lot of management

215
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,250
for the data side once
it goes into production.

216
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,440
Because if it takes off,
it really takes off.

217
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,273
It goes quickly.

218
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,600
You have to scale it quickly,

219
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,620
scale it back quickly,

220
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,893
build a new index test on
the fly, so on and so forth.

221
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,030
The way we do this is you can
go from your laptop to any

222
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,090
of these deployments,
multi-zone, multi-region,

223
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,710
multi-cloud, hybrid.

224
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,510
And these are no longer buzzwords.

225
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,100
These are really happening

226
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,400
because as your application
gets more and more critical,

227
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,530
you have to make it
more and more resilient.

228
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,800
And there's a price to pay
and an effort to invest.

229
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,360
You don't want to invest that effort.

230
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,770
You want it to be turnkey.

231
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,410
You don't want to say to
your user, yeah, great,

232
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,550
I'm gonna come back and scale

233
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,020
and make this multi-region,

234
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,520
just gimme six to nine months, right?

235
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,353
They're not gonna wait,

236
00:09:36,353 --> 00:09:37,980
they're gonna go to the
next service, right?

237
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,040
So you need infrastructure
that's not only pay as you go,

238
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,600
that's make it more resilient

239
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,370
as you become more relevant, right?

240
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,720
That is an important thing.

241
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,350
Okay. There is no free lunch.

242
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,870
So the thing you have to think about is

243
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,120
how will you traverse this curve?

244
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,780
Are you willing to pay more to
make your app more resilient

245
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,200
or do you need to pay less
and make it less resilient?

246
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,880
And ideally, without putting
effort into it, you know,

247
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,580
teams of the old, when they
were dealing with a lot of data,

248
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,740
I actually talked to a team, right?

249
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,440
This team had thousands
of databases deployed

250
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,850
because they were supporting thousands

251
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,010
of microservices and applications.

252
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,430
And they'd say every time
they finished one sweep

253
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,670
of database upgrades,
security, patching, et cetera,

254
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,410
et cetera, it was almost six months

255
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,450
and it's now time to do
the second sweep, right?

256
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,490
I can only imagine how
much fun that job would be,

257
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,730
but you know, let the software
do the job for you, right?

258
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,860
Just express the level of resilience

259
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,110
and let somebody else
deal with that for you.

260
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,503
Okay?

261
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:42,000
So what we do is work with a lot

262
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,240
of the largest enterprises
in telling them exactly

263
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,340
the different stages of resilience

264
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,670
and what is the cost and
architecture associated with it.

265
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,140
We call it ultra resilience

266
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,930
because when I say resilience,

267
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,080
I'm guessing most of you guys
are thinking a machine fails,

268
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,030
let's get it to work somewhere else.

269
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,210
That's a part of it. But
there's a lot of other things.

270
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,480
What happens if you get
a total cloud outage?

271
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,660
What happens if you have like for example,

272
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,110
an upgrade request or a security
patch that has to happen?

273
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,320
What happens if hardware
doesn't function well?

274
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,870
Like it doesn't fail but it
doesn't work well either.

275
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,250
It's a gray failure.

276
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,080
What do you do if a developer

277
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,750
actually accidentally
drops a production table?

278
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,310
So I used to work at Meta

279
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,680
and way back in the day
we had this real incident.

280
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,127
An intern came and told us,

281
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:32,460
"Gee guys really sorry I dropped a table.

282
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,350
It was 300 terabytes, it's in production.

283
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,120
Can you do anything to help?"

284
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,010
Well if you hadn't put ultra resilience,

285
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,260
which fortunately we had,
it was a 10 minute fix

286
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,350
to say restore the old
table, if it wasn't that,

287
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,150
that would've been a nightmare of a week

288
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,590
for everybody, right?

289
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,270
And it wasn't done intentionally.

290
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,940
When you're moving fast,
mistakes will happen.

291
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,700
And it is important to build
in that resilience, right?

292
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,230
And the same thing with
peak and freak events.

293
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,050
Like we have like one of our, you know,

294
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,000
users is you know, paramount plus.

295
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,420
And when they go and release
one of these new things,

296
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,210
like for example a Super Bowl
final or a Champions league

297
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,060
or you know an Oscar or a Grammys,

298
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,090
they really don't know how
many people are gonna sign up.

299
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,390
They have no idea the hour
leading up to the events,

300
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,090
they have no idea what kind of a peak

301
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,260
and freak show it's going to be.

302
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,550
'cause you just don't know.

303
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,050
Somebody slaps somebody on a show,

304
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,390
everybody's on that show
watching it instantly.

305
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,090
Few tweets go out and
everyone's logging in, right?

306
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,070
And so we're the authentication

307
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,500
and authorization service,
the profile service.

308
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,380
And you need that ability
to scale on a dime, right?

309
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,580
And that is the nature

310
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,563
of digital business in the modern days.

311
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,080
Okay?

312
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,923
Compliance.

313
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,130
I mean, I don't know if
you guys have noticed,

314
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,380
there are a lot of fights
that used to happen.

315
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,270
If a person, a company runs
a software that's consumed

316
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,150
by a citizen of another company

317
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,060
with their data center in a third country.

318
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,990
So country one's company
serves citizens of country two

319
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,300
with data centers and country three,

320
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,700
who does the data belong to?

321
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,080
That's a tough one, right?

322
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,190
Well that's what everybody thought.

323
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,120
And they said screw this.

324
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,160
Everybody's keeping
the data in my country.

325
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,410
If it's my citizen, keep it in my country.

326
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,240
And that's happening across the board.

327
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,370
And that's happening with LLMs too.

328
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,020
If it's my country, use my LLM,

329
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,430
I don't want to deal with something else.

330
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,620
So there's a lot of regulation going on

331
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,840
in how you deal with personal data.

332
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,280
And you gotta make that simple.

333
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,320
It cannot be another nine
months to build the app

334
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,030
to come back to serve the user.

335
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,240
So these are places where we
make it transparent and simple

336
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,373
and we supercharge Postgres.

337
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,733
Okay?

338
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,820
So what do we do to go from
prototype to production, right?

339
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,630
We give you insane
operational simplicity, right?

340
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,330
Distributed architectures and a, you know,

341
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,880
control plane and a built-in
managed services offering.

342
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,350
It's built for the cloud.

343
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,650
It's built to withstand
failures, architecturally,

344
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,420
auto sharding, auto rebalancing.

345
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,650
So when the scale hits you,

346
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,650
you don't have to worry about
how to do it self-healing.

347
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,075
So failures, et cetera are
automatically taken care of.

348
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:07,260
Multi API, which is a
very interesting one.

349
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,140
We support not just
Postgres, Apache, Cassandra,

350
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,040
and now Mongo because the
industry is building other APIs

351
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,390
on top of Postgres.

352
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,740
So there's a trend going on

353
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,580
where people are impersonating
databases on top of Postgres

354
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,280
to simplify your database sprawl, right?

355
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,988
And so it's consistent Postgres,

356
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:27,450
it's the 100% standard Postgres,

357
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,540
which is fully open source
cloud and Kubernetes native

358
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,800
and you can deploy it anywhere.

359
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,870
Multi-cloud, multi-region, et cetera.

360
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,520
And with zero downtime, right?

361
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,790
You know, why do you go to
no SQL zero schema changes.

362
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,220
You can be online all the
time while you can do that

363
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,280
with you buy TV now by
going SQL or no SQL.

364
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,650
And why do you go Postgres?

365
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,950
Well you get relational
capabilities, ecosystem attached.

366
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,600
And a lot of people, a lot of systems,

367
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,700
a lot of software already knows Postgres.

368
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,470
Well you can retain that too, right?

369
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,070
So, okay, so this is kind

370
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,150
of like a high level diagram
of what it is we do to help.

371
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,870
The top is a bunch of
emulations, extensions,

372
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,550
ecosystem, et cetera,

373
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,880
happening through the
Postgres ecosystem itself.

374
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,500
The middle is,

375
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,650
and so we reuse the Postgres
query processing engine.

376
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:21,650
The middle is our architecture
that does cloud native stuff.

377
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,860
Replication fault tolerance,
rebalancing, auto sharding,

378
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,500
and the ability to run on any cloud

379
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,010
or infrastructure, public,
private, multi-cloud,

380
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,750
hybrid cloud, et cetera, right?

381
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,080
So, and if you think about
how Postgres is happening,

382
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,330
we are building on top of Postgres

383
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,793
to make sure your AI
pipelines get simpler.

384
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,243
Okay?

385
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,590
So the five things here.

386
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,080
Evolving your tech stack,
you know, stick to standards.

387
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,690
It's not just about Postgres,
although I'm talking about it.

388
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,070
Remember, it's much easier

389
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,190
to iterate if you have
standard shapes and components.

390
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,110
If you build something that's custom,

391
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,640
it's gonna be very tough to iterate.

392
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,990
So put the framework in place,

393
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,240
make sure you can measure
your improvements.

394
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,000
Iterate your way to exponential growth.

395
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,240
Second thing is data
diversity. What has changed?

396
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,830
Data that has no business belonging

397
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,750
to each other now belongs to each other.

398
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,130
They sit next to each other.

399
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,410
Sometimes you have to move a lot of data.

400
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,600
Other times you don't
want to move the data.

401
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,280
Don't do handcrafted stuff.

402
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,340
Try to make it more
standard in the framework.

403
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,580
Third thing, don't
build pipelines by hand.

404
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,410
Every experiment will become

405
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,620
a handcrafting pipeline like work, right?

406
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,440
Don't do the work for
experiments, experiment,

407
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,750
go to production, learn the real lessons

408
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,570
and then do do whatever
it is you have to do

409
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,620
after you know your return on investment.

410
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,740
The fourth thing is remember
if you cannot go to production

411
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,780
and if you cannot boldly experiment

412
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,980
after you're in production,

413
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,690
you really haven't solved anything.

414
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,780
'cause you kind got it working
on the laptop. But then what?

415
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,850
And okay, you put it in
production for the first time

416
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,500
with a lot of pain, but then what?

417
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,200
You have to be able to
do this all the time,

418
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,610
every single time.

419
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,810
'cause remember, we don't know

420
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,210
what it'll look like a year from now.

421
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,740
And lastly,

422
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,260
make sure that the operational
stuff is out of the way.

423
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,150
You don't want to build an awesome thing

424
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,280
that you're iterating with
and suddenly, you know,

425
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,620
a security hard bleed bug hits you.

426
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,850
You have to do always patching

427
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,160
or you want a new
feature you got now stuck

428
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,420
with upgrading a lot of stuff.

429
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,830
Or you know there's a failure

430
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,140
and now you're dealing
with picking up the pieces.

431
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,570
Make sure that you get
the basics outta the way,

432
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,700
your infrastructure is ready to go

433
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,920
prime time when you start right?

434
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,080
You obviously shouldn't pay excess for it,

435
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,910
you shouldn't engineer around it,

436
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,290
but it should be ready to take you

437
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,783
where you need to go with relative ease.

438
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,510
Okay?

439
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,080
Once again, our approach
here is keep the data secure

440
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,850
by design right from the start.

441
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,090
And you can amp up your, even
in the world of you know,

442
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,670
Gen AI, et cetera, you still
have to deal with security.

443
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,860
You have to be able to have observability.

444
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,130
You should be able to say
where does the data come from?

445
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,580
Is a particular role able
to authorize the data?

446
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,950
Like you have all this secure data

447
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,830
and you've put all the rollback
role-based access controls

448
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,840
into your database, into your application.

449
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,950
But if I accessed your
rag, your MCP server

450
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,440
and asked very nicely,
please can you summarize,

451
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,180
it'll give you a very clean summary

452
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,620
of all the sensitive data.

453
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,270
You don't wanna be in
that situation, right?

454
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,790
So these are things that
we have to think upfront

455
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,190
and these are the problems
that we work on with people

456
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,950
that are building, whether
it's gen AI or not.

457
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,900
Built in encryption, audit logging,

458
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,980
these are some of the basics.

459
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,420
You have to get them outta the way.

460
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,810
You have to keep turning up
the dial when you need it.

461
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,940
Agent tick, database operations.

462
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,670
What does an agent do when
it connects your database?

463
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,400
I'll give you the database
guys version of it.

464
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,160
Hammers the hell out of the
database asking the same thing

465
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,710
over and over again until
the database is dead

466
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,870
and until all your tokens
are burned up, right?

467
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,830
You don't want that to happen.

468
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,600
So you want the database

469
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,790
to understand agent intake operation.

470
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,740
So those are some of
the things we work on.

471
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,620
And lastly, the fine-grained
access control is getting

472
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,220
a whole rebirth because
there's a human acting

473
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,550
through a service account,
which is the MCP server,

474
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,110
which is now operating on the database.

475
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,050
So there's multiple
levels of service accesses

476
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,060
and controls that you have to deal with.

477
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,920
And Postgres does a great job.

478
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,870
And you know what we're
doing is just take it

479
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,770
to the next level by helping
you interface with it easily.

480
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,980
Okay? So these are some of our use cases.

481
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,640
Again, all it's pretty
horizontal like so rag use cases,

482
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,700
recommendation systems,
you know, knowledge bases,

483
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,500
agents that are doing operations

484
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,650
and transactional systems,
so on and so forth.

485
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,450
If you're interested in learning more,

486
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,560
you know, reach out to us.

487
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,280
We are in booth 1436, I think 1436.

488
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,740
If not, just remember you
go by, look us up, you know,

489
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,000
we are online all over the place.

490
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,860
Or look for people in the purple shirts

491
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,810
and I'll connect with you guys backstage

492
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,720
right behind out there if
you guys have questions.

493
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,110
Thank you.
(audience applauds)

494
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,960
All right, keep it going for Karthik.
