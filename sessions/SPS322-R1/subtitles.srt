1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
- [Heitor] Hello, thank you
for joining us in this session.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,020
My name is Heitor, and I'm here with Stan.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,370
We are both from the AWS
Professional Service team,

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,010
and we are here today to
talk about our experience

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,170
helping the AWS Professional
Service organization

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,910
adopt coding agent

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,363
and lessons learned that
we accumulated so far.

8
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:27,030
So you're gonna see
that we are gonna start

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,940
with this problem statement
to help set the stage,

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,920
understand the common trap that we have,

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,670
this blindfolded coding agent, a problem.

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,720
Then we are gonna go

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,610
and talk about how can we mitigate

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,933
and avoid this problem.

15
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:43,530
And to start like,

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,810
have you ever experienced this situation

17
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,570
like you are assigned to a project,

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,730
and now that coding agent, it's available,

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,630
everyone expecting to deploy
things in lightning speed,

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,720
and now you have the experience saying,

21
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,180
can this coding agent generate
an authentication system

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,310
from my e-commerce platform?

23
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,290
And right after a few minutes,

24
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,693
you're gonna get an output.

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,450
First time it looks okay,

26
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,130
like everything is using the latest

27
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,270
and greatest spec or documentation.

28
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,790
And when you look deeper
the documentation is there,

29
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,250
so it's pretty well structured and so on,

30
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,790
but then reality hits the ground.

31
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,940
So you're gonna dive deeper

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,420
and see that the agent's not
following the session manager

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,630
that you have in your
front-end environment.

34
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,510
Basically all those requirements

35
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,780
that you have for single
sign-on in your enterprise,

36
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,400
and finally just to keep it simple

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,270
like it's volunteer itself
to generate more features

38
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,220
that you didn't ask.

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,500
And this is exactly what we mean

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,300
by fast code isn't necessary good code,

41
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,710
and even good code is eventually
not the right code for you.

42
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,190
So 'cause there are many
ways to implement things,

43
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,080
but you need to implement things

44
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,020
following the compliance or the rules

45
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,210
that you have in your organization.

46
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,010
Just to put this into a
different perspective,

47
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,540
to illustrate this,

48
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,580
if you think on your right-hand side,

49
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,280
you have the target like
your desired solution,

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,600
and you're using the code agent

51
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,660
to implement that feature for you.

52
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,250
If you don't provide enough context

53
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,160
about how you're gonna build this system

54
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,040
and give the guidance how to do that,

55
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,420
eventually it's basically using

56
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,670
the coding agent blindfolded,

57
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,730
and it's trying to guess
navigating through this ambiguity

58
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,980
to get to the target.

59
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,503
It may or may not deliver what you need.

60
00:02:42,717 --> 00:02:44,130
And this session that is gonna be

61
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,930
about how can we prevent that?

62
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,840
The good news is, Kiro
has a lot of features,

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,940
built-in features that can help you

64
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,800
minimize the possibility of going

65
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,790
off of your target.

66
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,640
So one example is spec,
different development

67
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,260
that we talked so much.

68
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,000
It's basically how can you break down

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,560
large complex problem into
define the success criteria,

70
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,150
the requirements that you have,

71
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,060
how you design this solution
break down into tasks.

72
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,400
So you can think if
you're planning to drive

73
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,870
to a specific location,

74
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,780
how you plan your route to get there.

75
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,120
Then we have hooks,

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,380
the analogy that I put
here is like using a GPS

77
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,740
'cause eventually you
may get a wrong turn,

78
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,620
and the GPS in your car
basically is rerouting

79
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,080
to help you go back to the ideal course.

80
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,850
So you can do this in your environment

81
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,410
to define non-negotiable
requirements that you have.

82
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,200
And if something is going off the plan,

83
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,793
you can use this event to go
back to the original design.

84
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,120
Eventually you have the steering docs,

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,580
and this is one feature that
you can leverage in Kiro

86
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,280
to define what are intrinsic knowledge

87
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,750
or design principles that
you have in your organization

88
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,050
to basically teach Kiro to behave

89
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,000
like best in class the
different consultant.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,640
So in this component,

91
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,440
we are trying to define to Kiro,

92
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,800
share our lessons learned
how to do tradeoff analysis

93
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,920
and how to behave when we
need to make a decision.

94
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,440
And finally the most common one is MCP,

95
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,620
so if you have a tool
that you need to access

96
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,460
to execute a task, it's
available there for you.

97
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,710
The main difference between steering docs

98
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,910
and MCP is how frequent
those things change.

99
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,860
So what I would say is,

100
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,080
steering docs is more design principle.

101
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,560
So if you think about what
(indistinct) framework

102
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,300
that we have, that's true
over time and persistent.

103
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,310
Most likely this knowledge
should be represented

104
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,530
as steering doc 'cause
you use this to understand

105
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,380
what good looks like in your environment.

106
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,390
And MCP is more for dynamic data,

107
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,390
so you don't need to throw
all AWS documentation

108
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,960
inside the session window

109
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,500
and flood the context window of the Kiro

110
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,620
to understand what the service
feature set is available.

111
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,233
You can access those things
on demand when needed.

112
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,340
But the main question that we have

113
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,110
when we are working in
ProServe specifically is,

114
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,570
how can we get to this level of precision?

115
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,547
Like I can't afford to
have this margin of errors,

116
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,870
or the coding agent going
rogue in different direction.

117
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,250
I need to be exactly grounded
on the customer requirements.

118
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,530
And that's when we
start this conversation,

119
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,170
so because most of the time

120
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,440
we are trying to rush into code phase

121
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,050
and asking the coding agent to go fast,

122
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,207
even if we don't know what
we are trying to build first,

123
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:50,640
and what are the possible path.

124
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,370
So if you want to get
this level of precision,

125
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,270
you need to go way back
to the notes that you have

126
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,070
about what you're trying to build,

127
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,310
translate the context from window,

128
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,410
the human context into a context

129
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,030
that I can share with the agent.

130
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,033
So agent can be more
effective executing the task.

131
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,940
So as you're gonna see,

132
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,880
this is all about how
can we find a balance

133
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,620
between what we should
put in the context window

134
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,063
'cause if we put too little,

135
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,170
the agent's gonna need to
navigate through the ambiguity,

136
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,650
and probably this when they
can make the wrong call.

137
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,080
If you put too much, it's gonna flood,

138
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,740
and they basically can
ignore some important notes

139
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,510
that you have about the project.

140
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,230
And worse than that, if you
have conflicting requirements,

141
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,140
like one specific document
is saying something

142
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,150
and another is saying the opposite,

143
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,020
how the coding agent is gonna
decide which one to pursue?

144
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,520
So let's do a thing like,

145
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,460
we are gonna start seeing
how we implement those things

146
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,090
inside Professional
Service to give you a sense

147
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,183
how to avoid those problems
that we are discussing so far.

148
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,370
I know these are 300 sessions,

149
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,820
so I'm going to use just a few minutes

150
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,990
to level set everyone.

151
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,700
Like I don't know if how many of you

152
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,410
have been using Kiro so far,

153
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,430
but just to level set
and show those components

154
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,050
that we discussed before.

155
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,143
So I just opened my environment here,

156
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,550
and on the left-hand
side I have my project,

157
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,380
and right-hand side I can start a session

158
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,840
using Kiro to help me do things.

159
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,560
So if you open the Kiro tab,

160
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,980
you're gonna see that we
have all those components

161
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,360
that I was discussing before.

162
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,987
So spec, the routing plan,

163
00:07:44,987 --> 00:07:47,223
hooks, the GPS,

164
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,490
adjustment, then we
have the steering docs,

165
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,620
the design principle,
like I mentioned before,

166
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,080
and MCP, the tools that are available.

167
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,810
Just to give you a sense
what those things means,

168
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,190
I'm gonna open here

169
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,360
and ask Kiro to describe
those things for me.

170
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,853
So first question that I would ask is,

171
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,250
what can you do for me?

172
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,590
So what Kiro is available,

173
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,170
how can they help us build project?

174
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,610
And you can basically chat

175
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,970
with the agent right in the session,

176
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,803
and it's gonna say

177
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:21,510
that I'm here to assist
you code development,

178
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,573
I can create CLI command,
and so on and so forth.

179
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,400
As I mentioned before,
we have a few specs,

180
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,930
so if you don't want to
dive too deep what spec is,

181
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,790
I can basically ask Kiro to say,

182
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:40,790
can you explain to me, what's
inside this spec document?

183
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,860
And it's gonna try to make sense of

184
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,653
what you define in this spec document,

185
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:51,873
and define for you what's in there.

186
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,870
So let me see if I can,

187
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,940
I need to do this

188
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,403
spec design agent.

189
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,450
So it's thinking, analyzing

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,880
what's inside this design document,

191
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,830
but as we wait I can show
you actually this in the...

192
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,580
Okay, so it's explaining
to me exactly the problem

193
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,470
that I was describing at the beginning,

194
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,210
like how can we translate
human context into context

195
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,900
that's defined for our coding
agent to execute the plan.

196
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,480
So everything that I'm describing here

197
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,730
is trying to go through raw notes,

198
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,950
distill this information in a way

199
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,990
that I can hand over to our agents.

200
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,850
So if I go and expand this to
see how a spec is structured,

201
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,980
we have three main tabs here,

202
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,590
requirements just describing why,

203
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,990
what we are trying to build in these spec,

204
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,300
like this task list, if you will.

205
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,550
In this case I'm trying to say,

206
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,540
I want to navigate through raw data

207
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,390
and create what I'm calling spec package.

208
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,120
That's this context for agents.

209
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,160
Then this is how we're gonna do that.

210
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,130
So I've created those many stages,

211
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,140
but if I go to the task list,

212
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,350
you're gonna see that basically
I'm instructing to Kiro.

213
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,660
Just one second, I'm
gonna get to the list.

214
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,040
I'm instructing to Kiro say,

215
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,680
this is how you're gonna
navigate through this,

216
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,427
execute the task, and so on.

217
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,827
And we are gonna see this
in action in a minute.

218
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,030
The other concept that
we have here is hooks.

219
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,000
So the easiest way to see this,

220
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,330
how it works is actually
trying to create one.

221
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,810
So I can open Kiro here,

222
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,520
and as you create a new hook,

223
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,790
the one that I like that
resonate a lot with users

224
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,590
that are using this for the first time

225
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,110
is update my documentation.

226
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,660
So basically what I'm describing here is,

227
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,493
if I'm trying to build something,

228
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,480
and as soon as I save a code base,

229
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,210
a new file in my repo,

230
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,680
it's gonna go to my project
README file and update.

231
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,690
So the README file is always reflecting

232
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,180
what's actually implemented.

233
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,970
So if I do this Kiro behind-the-scenes

234
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,340
is evaluating my prompt here,

235
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,370
and wanna create this rule for hooks

236
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,187
defining what's the event that's
gonna trigger this action,

237
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,950
and then what we gonna do since

238
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,580
whenever we get this
action being triggered.

239
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,990
So as you're gonna see here,

240
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,480
this is documentation
sync, the descriptions,

241
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,320
every time I'm saving a
file with this extension,

242
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,810
we're gonna prompt the code to say,

243
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,650
is there any change or
significant change in my repo now

244
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,050
that I need to represent
in the README file?

245
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,490
If yes, make the relevant
change in the README file,

246
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,590
and keep this updated.

247
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,230
All right, spec, how we decompose

248
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,750
complex problems into task list;

249
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,880
hooks, how can we keep these

250
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,840
following non-negotiable
criteria that we have;

251
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,220
steering docs, I think the
easiest way is again ask Kiro.

252
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,650
So I have a lot of knowledge

253
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,940
that we put here in the
steering doc folder,

254
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,670
but one that resonate a lot with users

255
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,740
is this collaboration workflow.

256
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,903
And just to give an
example how this works,

257
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,013
I'm gonna ask Kiro to
describe what's in there.

258
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,850
And this is basically telling Kiro

259
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,223
how I want the code agent to behave.

260
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:45,510
So at the very top I'm saying,

261
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,160
we are working on this together.

262
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,590
If you'll see that I'm
asking you to do something

263
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,660
that's not aligned with best practice,

264
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,610
I prefer you to push back

265
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,520
and see why this is not a good idea

266
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,140
and keep me honest when
I should execute things.

267
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,660
If we are trying to do a problem solving,

268
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,190
I don't want to try to
get the quickest solution,

269
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,000
I need to go deeper and see
the root cause on those things.

270
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,060
And another thing in our situation is,

271
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,800
every time we are building stuff,

272
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,010
I don't want the agent
to take critical actions.

273
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,263
And this is things that
I'm describing here.

274
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,680
Please don't automatically do

275
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,320
Git commit, Git push, and so on.

276
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,730
Ask me, if you want to do
this, take those actions.

277
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,780
And if I ask you to do so,
confirm before executing.

278
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,610
So this is just an an example of things

279
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,790
that we describe how
I want Kiro to behave.

280
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,800
We have many other objects here

281
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,290
that we usually load as needed,

282
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,480
but this one specifically,

283
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,060
if you see at the very top,

284
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,310
Kiro has this option to define

285
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,520
the inclusion mode that we want.

286
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,150
So when we say always, every
single session that we load,

287
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,010
and one example is the very top,

288
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,870
everything that I put is always,

289
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,930
it's gonna be loaded for
every single session.

290
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,600
And if I put manual, let's say,

291
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,010
I think this one is manual.

292
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,740
So if I open this one,

293
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,073
I'm only loading this
steering doc when needed.

294
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,900
And MCP is the most popular one,

295
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,163
so let me see if I can
quickly show one example here.

296
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,920
I'm gonna ask Kiro to describe

297
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,913
what's available in this
knowledge MCP server.

298
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,250
And as you're gonna see,

299
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,280
it's gonna go through the
definition of the tools

300
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,290
that's inside this MCP,

301
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,900
and give me a sense
what's available there.

302
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,240
And by the way, this MCP
is available to everyone.

303
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,910
So if you want to leverage
these in your project,

304
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,553
you can include in our
development environment.

305
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,593
And the idea is,

306
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,570
I can search updated documentation of AWS,

307
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:05,570
it's gonna list the repos
that we usually consume.

308
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,990
So it's AWS documentation,
blogs, GitHub sample, constructs,

309
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,830
and all those things.

310
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,500
And I can basically interact with this MCP

311
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,533
when I need to get access to latest data.

312
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,910
All right, now that I know spec,

313
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,030
hooks, agent, steering docs, and MCP,

314
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,690
how can I make sense in a real scenario?

315
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,780
So I'm gonna close everything.

316
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,603
I'm gonna start with this simple project.

317
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,870
In this situation here,

318
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,293
I'm trying to simulate what
usually happen in projects.

319
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,620
Imagine a situation that
a person went through a

320
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,310
re:Invent summit or AWS summit,

321
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,600
and they have an idea like,

322
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,880
always that I go to those summits,

323
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,840
I have these notes that I
never consolidate well enough

324
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,580
when I go back to my company,

325
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,880
and I need to do this knowledge transfer,

326
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,550
I always struggle to remember
what I took notes, and so on.

327
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,200
So what if we have a system

328
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,660
that I basically take a screenshot,

329
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,290
add notes in my TXT

330
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,120
or markdown file, and so on,

331
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,070
and I shared this with agent,

332
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,900
and agent gonna make sense of this.

333
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,770
If I'm asking open questions,
not answering my notes,

334
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,160
the agent gonna be responsible
for searching for the answer,

335
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,040
and help me consolidate this,
so I can go back to my company

336
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,250
and do a knowledge transfer effectively.

337
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,610
The problem is, it's never
where we structure like

338
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,610
that person describing
what is needed to be done,

339
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,920
and how we're gonna execute.

340
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,390
Start with someone

341
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,670
having this idea via email,

342
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,840
then this move to Slack thread

343
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,350
that people are brainstorming
about what we should do.

344
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,590
Then someone else replied to
the original email saying,

345
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,440
what if we use the
knowledge MCP that we saw,

346
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,057
to answer those unanswered questions

347
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:08,190
that we have in our notes.

348
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,690
And then they have a meeting,

349
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,460
they transcribe this meeting,

350
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,830
then they have another session,

351
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,800
is like the whiteboard solution.

352
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,490
And now I have no clue
what I'm trying to build.

353
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,010
If I just ask Kiro to do that

354
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,070
and implement this software for me,

355
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,220
most likely it's gonna
try to help me somehow,

356
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,590
but if I don't structure this context

357
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,060
in a way that's gonna be effective

358
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,220
for coding agent to execute the plan,

359
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,960
most likely you don't have
what you are expecting.

360
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,840
So how can we

361
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,890
do about that?

362
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,610
Like how can we save,
improve this process?

363
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,440
Remember that I mentioned in the diagram

364
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,710
that we have this design agent.

365
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,080
Design agent is this spec doc

366
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,780
that I created in my
Kiro environment here.

367
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,800
And the way that I can call
it is basically saying,

368
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,950
can you execute

369
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,740
the tasks that I defined in design agent?

370
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,250
And when I go to a new session and say,

371
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,903
I'm gonna start this process,

372
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,480
it's gonna understand
that I put all those notes

373
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,810
about this project in that input folder.

374
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,510
It's gonna read all those
things and execute the task

375
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,700
that I defined in this workflow.

376
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,120
So first thing is, I need
to read all the input data.

377
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,290
So all those files that
in our input folder,

378
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,360
try to understand what
are the requirements,

379
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,520
non-functional requirements, risk,

380
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,610
and anything that we capture from there.

381
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,370
And then share this back with the human,

382
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,530
so they can validate if this is

383
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,540
exactly what you're trying to build.

384
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,330
So when you go to the build phase,

385
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,550
you are most likely gonna be successful

386
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,190
'cause you know exactly
what are the requirements,

387
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,500
successful criteria, and so on.

388
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,560
So instead of waiting this
to the end to complete,

389
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,610
I'm gonna skip ahead,

390
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,400
I have another one here that I executed,

391
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,310
and the output of these,

392
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,600
processing these input data
is in this generated folder.

393
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,500
So if I open here and go
to functional requirements,

394
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,970
for example, I'm
consolidating this in a way

395
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,920
that I know exactly

396
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,290
what I'm trying to build
in a consolidated way.

397
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,920
So I'm trying to create a
content upload interface.

398
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,530
I need to have the content storage,

399
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,847
I have AI power summarization
feature, and so on.

400
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:40,620
And every single requirements
that I'm listing here,

401
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,250
I'm trying to put clarity for Kiro,

402
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,230
understand what I'm actually trying,

403
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,820
or how I'm gonna assess the
completeness of this task.

404
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,070
So for this one specifically,

405
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,740
I'm saying this is a must
have based on the context,

406
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,280
and I'm showing where I
got this information from,

407
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,160
from the original email
in the meeting notes

408
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,380
that I got originally.

409
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,640
And this is how I captured

410
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,327
the successful criteria of this task.

411
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:12,450
And this is not only for
the functional requirements,

412
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,370
we have for non-functional
requirements as well.

413
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:19,192
So we have, I captured the response time,

414
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:21,060
the scalability criteria,

415
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,600
how we're gonna evaluate

416
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,740
the storage requirements.

417
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,900
And then finally,

418
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,870
one thing that I would
like to highlight here is,

419
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,310
when I was reading all this
context from the raw notes,

420
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,340
I'm trying to break it down in two levels.

421
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,010
One is business objective,

422
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,950
like what are the goals that my leadership

423
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,950
or whoever has started this
project shared at the beginning.

424
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,360
So as you can tell here,

425
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,500
we have six main
objective of this project.

426
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,290
So I'm trying to organize
conference learning,

427
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,380
improve knowledge, answer a
question that I don't have,

428
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,820
and help me like create,

429
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,563
link any post when I go back
to my company, and so on.

430
00:21:05,563 --> 00:21:08,037
I can make sense of my notes,

431
00:21:08,037 --> 00:21:11,250
and this is how I broke down
these into requirements.

432
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,020
And if I'm trying to think

433
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,350
about this from the project
management perspective,

434
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:21,300
I also instructed in my
workflow to create user stories,

435
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,760
so we know how can we
break down these into

436
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,310
small modules or work stream.

437
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,200
And in the end of the day,

438
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,250
what I'm trying to do here is

439
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,310
understand the what, like
what we are trying to build.

440
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,820
And one thing that I have
here just to consolidate

441
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,953
all those notes that we described so far,

442
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,720
we have many ways to represent
knowledge to a coding agent

443
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,753
to leverage those things when
we're executing a project.

444
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,900
During our experience

445
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,150
and to understand how you can select

446
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,130
which bucket you're gonna use,

447
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,270
I would use this approach.

448
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,460
Like if you're trying
to represent a workflow

449
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,490
like I was describing saying,
you need to read the files,

450
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,380
you need to extract the requirements,

451
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,630
you need to understand that
you need to map those things.

452
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,440
So if it's a very
structured workflow spec,

453
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,630
maybe the answer for that.

454
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,820
And important to understand is,

455
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,300
you need to to guarantee
that you are tracing

456
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,030
the criteria to the requirements.

457
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,690
And then when you create
a complex workflow,

458
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,930
you need to keep these handoff material.

459
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,590
So when you go to the
next step or next session,

460
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,320
the next step in your workflow,

461
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,060
they're gonna know what to execute next

462
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,353
or what you did before.

463
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,130
So this is basically the routing planning

464
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,730
that you have in your metaphor.

465
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,220
But if I'm trying to do
event driven automation,

466
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,250
like when I save something,
hooks is important,

467
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,100
highlight here, and
based on our experience

468
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,550
try to match these in a timing needed,

469
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,250
so when you save a file,
when you create a file.

470
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,220
Another important thing
is to avoid this loop,

471
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,590
if you're trying to edit the same file

472
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,830
that generated or triggered the event,

473
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,820
try to just list what you
should do instead of editing

474
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,140
and saving to avoid these
infinite loop in your environment

475
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,030
'cause this is your GPS routing.

476
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,700
So if you're making the wrong turn,

477
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,973
it's gonna help you go
back to the original plan.

478
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,005
Then when should I understand

479
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:35,283
if it's a steering doc or MCP?

480
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,160
One thing that I would highlight to you

481
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,890
is steering docs more
for design principles.

482
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,400
So if I need to understand
what good looks like

483
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,990
to make a decision between tradeoff,

484
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,650
this is when steering
docs, it's a good approach.

485
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,020
And the steering docs, the
most important part is,

486
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,620
this is basically when
you're trying to drive

487
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,170
what are the minimum amount
of information that you keep,

488
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,230
so the traffic laws that
you need to memorize,

489
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,870
to understand how to drive in a street.

490
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,630
So this is what you put in streering doc.

491
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,770
It's important to remember
the proper inclusion pattern

492
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,200
to avoid flooding the context.

493
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,380
So if you are saving everything
for always, be loaded,

494
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,470
probably you're gonna waste
tokens in your environment.

495
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,000
And finally MCPs is for dynamic content.

496
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,080
So if you have tools

497
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,120
that you need to interact to take action,

498
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,420
this is actually the
real-time traffic information.

499
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,560
So if you need to remember
something as needed,

500
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,150
like the real traffic information,

501
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:43,473
this is the bucket that you use
to represent this knowledge.

502
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,820
All right, so this is just to level set

503
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,573
that now we understand what
we are trying to build,

504
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,040
translating the human context to a context

505
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,750
that the coordination can behave.

506
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,460
But before we go to the execute,

507
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,010
there is another important
part to understand

508
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,660
among all the possible paths

509
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,430
that we have to execute the plan,

510
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,470
how can we pick the right one?

511
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:12,210
And for that I'm gonna invite
Stan to join the stage.

512
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,200
Oops, to share this next session,

513
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,553
next part of the session.

514
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,523
Thank you.

515
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,490
- [Stan] Good afternoon everyone.

516
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,983
I'm Stan and I will take it from here.

517
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,130
So now we have our agent

518
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,740
equipped with steering doc specifications,

519
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,420
hooks, and MCPs.

520
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,730
But is it enough for our agent

521
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,340
to be truly useful in real work?

522
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,320
Will this agent be able to write the code,

523
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,173
which is not only good, but
the code which is right?

524
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,410
Imagine this situation.

525
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,810
You have your advanced agent

526
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,270
who is capable to write
a sophisticated code

527
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,640
and solve complex technical problems,

528
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,770
and one day you are asking your agent

529
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,630
to provide recommendation

530
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,653
for your containerized application
authentication mechanism.

531
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,120
And your agent just
returns to your generic

532
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,610
of (indistinct) authentication

533
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:21,960
instead of referencing you to
approved integration patterns

534
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,033
for your IdP provider.

535
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,980
Or you are asking for a recent
AWS pricing information,

536
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,870
and the agent just apologizes,

537
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,360
but doesn't have this information.

538
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,710
It doesn't sounds familiar?

539
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,450
This is intelligence gap problem

540
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:42,273
that can affect even the
most sophisticated AI agents.

541
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,080
Development team often reports

542
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,650
that the agent can provide
technically correct,

543
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,140
but contextually relevant recommendation

544
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,753
due to lack of access to
organizational knowledge.

545
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,510
And it's not just a minor problem,

546
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,810
it's significant barrier in AI adoption

547
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,100
in enterprise environments

548
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,683
where context matters
as much as capabilities.

549
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,130
When developers first deploy their agents

550
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,660
in production environment,

551
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,480
we quickly realized these limitations.

552
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,650
The agent may be excellent

553
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,070
in general problem solving skills,

554
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,370
but it lacks a significant context,

555
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,253
which makes it really useful in real work.

556
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,133
Let's take a look into
this problem closer.

557
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,620
Most of organization have
available information

558
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:42,240
stored in the system, which
are locked from AI agents.

559
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,620
With the information such as
architecture decision records,

560
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,503
internal wiki pages, team standards.

561
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,110
Without accessing this information,

562
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,200
agents just use general knowledge

563
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,223
and cannot build on top of
experience of your organization.

564
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,740
From another side of this problem,

565
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,343
we have external knowledge problem.

566
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,460
Knowledge of your agents is limited

567
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,920
by training data cutoff time.

568
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,560
And it means that we don't
have access to information

569
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,440
about recent serious capabilities,

570
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,130
new function, such as functions

571
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,303
and services announced at re:Invent.

572
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,030
We might not have access to
recent pricing information,

573
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,750
which is important for cost
estimation and valuation,

574
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,430
and we don't have access
to security vulnerabilities

575
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,363
and purchase information

576
00:28:36,363 --> 00:28:39,810
that can affect selection
of technical stacks

577
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,403
and technologies in new system.

578
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,060
And in order to solve this problem,

579
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,490
we need to find structured approach

580
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,370
which will convert your AI agents from

581
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,650
static knowledge repositories

582
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:56,940
into intelligent system,

583
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,343
which can collect, process,

584
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,600
and apply information from
both, internal knowledge

585
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,123
and external current information.

586
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,020
How we address this issue

587
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,783
in our intelligent AI agent architecture?

588
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,510
On the left-hand side of the diagram,

589
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,670
you may see components responsible

590
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,593
for internal knowledge processing,

591
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,380
and on the right-hand side
there is a part of architecture,

592
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,093
which processes external data.

593
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:32,433
Let's start from internal
knowledge processing.

594
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,320
And the first component
of our architecture

595
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,063
is layer of data agents.

596
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,070
You may think about data
agents as a specialized agents

597
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,770
that has tools that allows them

598
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,810
to connect to your internal systems,

599
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:52,680
and we have very detailed
prompt, system prompts,

600
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,530
which explains how this
agent should use these tools

601
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,180
to effectively extract information

602
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,983
from your internal systems.

603
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,720
This agent might be connected to a system,

604
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,853
which source reusable artifacts,

605
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,140
various code repositories with blueprints

606
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,073
and reusable components

607
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:13,893
that you can use in your architectures.

608
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,330
Or we can have access
to internal wiki pages

609
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,040
and documentation,
which stores information

610
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,270
about services capabilities
and limitations

611
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,340
and various best practices

612
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,323
and industry approved use cases.

613
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,200
When that agent extracted this information

614
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,000
from your internal system,

615
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
we can post this set of reusable
assets into the next layer.

616
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,960
On the next layer, we have
a panel of expert agents.

617
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,103
You may think about these
agents as specialized experts,

618
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,490
each of them is specialized

619
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,163
in a certain aspect of architecture.

620
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,573
We can have functional fit expert,

621
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,970
which determines if a component

622
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,653
solves core business problem,

623
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,450
or implements all the required features.

624
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,310
We can have architecture fit expert,

625
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,300
which determines if the component

626
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,530
follows the established best practices,

627
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,780
such as well-architected framework,

628
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,400
and how well it's integrated

629
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,000
with your internal applications.

630
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,550
We can have security
experts who can evaluate

631
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,970
if this component follows
your security best practices.

632
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,611
For example, does it have
proper authentication,

633
00:31:32,611 --> 00:31:34,380
(indistinct) implemented,

634
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,640
and how it stores the data?

635
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,780
Does it has encryption at rest?

636
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,420
Or we can have operational
experts who can determine

637
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,263
if the specific component
is production-ready.

638
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,480
Each of the experts of this
panel review the components

639
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,530
and produce the score from zero to 100

640
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:58,563
on how well this component
fits with target architecture.

641
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,810
A part of a score,

642
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,600
each agent also produces a summary

643
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,930
of where this component fits
with target architecture

644
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,153
and where the gaps are identified.

645
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,950
After all the components are
evaluated by expert panels,

646
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,500
we can move to the next
stage of this process

647
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,223
where we perform ranking
and scoring of assets.

648
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,590
We aggregate this scores based
on each individual component,

649
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,630
and using this segregated score

650
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,240
to form a shortlist of components

651
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,590
we are going to use in
our target architecture.

652
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,740
Now let's take a look into
a part of architecture,

653
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,626
which is responsible for

654
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:54,980
external knowledge
aggregation and processing.

655
00:32:58,717 --> 00:33:02,640
In order to collect and
process external data,

656
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,793
we are using implementation
of deep research framework.

657
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,240
If we will search over internet

658
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,640
for deep research
framework implementation,

659
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,610
most likely we'll find
whitepapers from companies

660
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:18,003
such as Anthropic,
LangChain, or Mirrorflow.

661
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,960
All these whitepapers
are different in details,

662
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,473
however, the core idea of all this work,

663
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,050
systems is pretty similar.

664
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,360
All of them are using
multi-agent architectures

665
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,180
to implement deep research functionality

666
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,280
over three major steps.

667
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,630
First we do job planning
when execute subtasks,

668
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:42,723
and finally we produce segregated result.

669
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,420
Let's take a look into this
architecture in more details.

670
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,310
So the core component of this architecture

671
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,173
is a coordinator or main agent.

672
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,030
The role of this agent is
to get complex user query

673
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:01,053
and split it into a list
of individual tasks.

674
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,910
Often coordinator is using
special tools, a reasoning tool,

675
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:10,910
which helps coordinator
to plan the activities

676
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,100
and perform the split of complex tasks

677
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,267
into sequence of independent subtasks.

678
00:34:19,147 --> 00:34:22,158
And once coordinator
split this complex task

679
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:24,390
into a set of individual subtasks,

680
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,880
it spins up multiple sub agents,

681
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,970
and passes this individual subtasks

682
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:32,193
into each of sub agents.

683
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,740
Sub agents are responsible

684
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,083
for processing of the subtasks.

685
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,680
And in order to process this information,

686
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,990
agents are equipped with a set of tools

687
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:46,713
we are using to execute with our subtasks.

688
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,910
Once each sub agent finished
their part of a job,

689
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:54,180
we form intermediate result,

690
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,933
and these results are
headed back to coordinator.

691
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,240
Coordinator aggregates results
from multiple sub agents,

692
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,623
performs clean aggregations,
and produces a final result.

693
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,350
Let's briefly talk about this tools

694
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,033
we are using in our architecture.

695
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,030
First of all, we are
dealing with external data,

696
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,240
so we need instrument to
search data over internet,

697
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,313
so we have internet search tool.

698
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,210
Once we identified sources of information

699
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,630
and we know where exactly
this information is located,

700
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,390
we need to provide functionality

701
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,370
for our agents to read this information,

702
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,950
so we need some type of browser.

703
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,770
You may use one of open-source
implementation of browsers,

704
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:45,770
such as Chromium, headless or Playwright,

705
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,620
or you may choose one of
specialized components,

706
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,153
such as AgentCore Browser.

707
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,630
Our agents also have access to file system

708
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,490
and read and write operation,

709
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,320
and usually we use this operation

710
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,080
for intermediate results processing

711
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,733
and state management.

712
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,980
Often deep research requires accessing

713
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,930
specialized sources of data,

714
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,360
such as code repository on GitHub.

715
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,880
And if this is the case,

716
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,920
you may put MCP server,

717
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,243
and for example,

718
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,270
transitions provide the functionality

719
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,110
to wrap any MCP server into a tool,

720
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,003
which you can use in your agents.

721
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,860
What are lessons learned

722
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,260
when we built with deep
research implementation?

723
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,600
First of all, deep research framework

724
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,710
is quite a complex system

725
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,560
with a lot of moving parts and components,

726
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,660
and observability is a key component

727
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,640
for successful implementation

728
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,100
of deep research functionality.

729
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,690
Using proper observability,

730
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,480
you can quickly answer the questions,

731
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,930
what exactly each sub agents is doing,

732
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,720
what tools are available for sub agents,

733
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,010
how we use these tools,

734
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,073
and which results every
sub agent produces.

735
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,193
Another lesson learned for us was,

736
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,560
we need to understand which exact tools

737
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,480
are available for each sub agents,

738
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,793
and how sub agents are using these tools.

739
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,700
We found that sometimes
agents are using tools

740
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,510
in completely different
way from what we expected,

741
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,389
so it's important to make sure

742
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,733
that agents are using the tools
the way you are expecting.

743
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,530
And the final lessons learned was

744
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:51,300
that optimization of
deep research framework

745
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,070
is about finding proper balance

746
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,380
between resources you're going to spend

747
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,990
for your deep research analysis

748
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,113
and quality of output.

749
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,630
It means that you can
technically spend hours

750
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,130
and millions of tokens

751
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,410
without significant improvement of

752
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,990
quality of output results.

753
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,620
So it's really important to
have in place configuration,

754
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,230
which you can quickly where
you can quickly define

755
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,190
depth and breadth of a deep
research functionality.

756
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,210
And you can flexibly
configure this balance

757
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,930
to find proper balance between resources

758
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,310
you're going to spend,

759
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,493
and quality of ongoing result.

760
00:38:44,244 --> 00:38:47,823
Okay, with that we will switch to a demo.

761
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,770
Okay, I will start at the same stage

762
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,470
where Heitor showed before.

763
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,393
So we have our demo project,

764
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,920
and we passed first two
stages of this project.

765
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,580
Just a reminder, in stage one

766
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,980
we analyzed input documents

767
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,140
and we extracted information,

768
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,520
what is the scope of a project

769
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,470
and if this project is POC

770
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,110
or it's fully functional application.

771
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,130
So all these details that we can derive

772
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,400
from project documentation.

773
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,880
And on stage two, we generated functional

774
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,830
and non-functional requirements

775
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:48,112
as well as traceability
metrics and user stories.

776
00:39:48,112 --> 00:39:51,842
So now we can continue to the next stage,

777
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:53,973
soil type continue.

778
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:04,670
Our agent maintains the
state of the process,

779
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,350
so it knows exactly
where we are right now,

780
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,710
and it'll continue with the first task

781
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,573
over the next stage three.

782
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,803
The next stage in our process

783
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:20,760
is the generation of system
architecture documents.

784
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,240
And to begin of this process,

785
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,723
our agent checks if we
have access to our backend.

786
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:32,220
Our backend that we discussed before

787
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,853
is available to our
agent through MCP server.

788
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,790
So this one, intelligence hubs here

789
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:43,110
provides access for our
Kiro agent to our backend,

790
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,133
which takes care of both,

791
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:47,163
with internal and external information.

792
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,010
When this MCP server is available,

793
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,810
agents submits functional

794
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:57,390
and non-functional
requirements to our backend

795
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:02,080
and backend produces outgoing results.

796
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,150
So it'll take some time,

797
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,240
so I'll switch forward to show

798
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,590
how it looks like.

799
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:16,680
So when agent submitted the
information to our backend,

800
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,122
it receives a job ID that agent can use

801
00:41:20,122 --> 00:41:23,460
to first of all check the status of a job;

802
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,130
and the second, it can use this job ID

803
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,410
to get the results of the processing.

804
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,270
You can see that agent is instructed

805
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,180
to check status periodically time to time,

806
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:38,180
and it keeps iterating until it see

807
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,960
that the status of job is
changed to complete it.

808
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,620
It means that backend finished
the processing of a job,

809
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,740
and our agent can receive the results

810
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,933
using the separate get results call.

811
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,710
Let's fast forward

812
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,403
and see what did we get from our backend.

813
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:15,360
So our backend intelligence
hub produces the result,

814
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,550
which consists of two main parts.

815
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,230
As we discussed before,

816
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,150
we have two different workflows

817
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,580
for internal and internal data.

818
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,000
So our outgoing documents
are structured the same way.

819
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,670
We have a first part of the document,

820
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:33,360
which list all the components
our experts evaluated,

821
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,270
and produced a shortlist.

822
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:40,637
We can see that top asset identified is

823
00:42:40,637 --> 00:42:42,570
AgentCore Runtime Blueprint,

824
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:44,220
which is our internal blueprint,

825
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,250
which guides agent on how to build

826
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,073
and deploy agents on AgentCore.

827
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,280
Our sample project is
involving development of agent,

828
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,950
and that's why this
blueprint is determined

829
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:02,793
as a strong fit for this application.

830
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,750
If I scroll down, I can see...

831
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,700
Sorry, where is it?

832
00:43:09,202 --> 00:43:12,930
We can see the whole
shortlist of the components,

833
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:16,150
and for each component we can see

834
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,680
break down of expert evaluations

835
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,560
as well as summaries of all the experts

836
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,773
where certain components fits
with target architecture.

837
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,340
And at the end of this document,

838
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,640
we have a block of data

839
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,230
associated with deep research analysis,

840
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,960
so once deep research
analysis is completed,

841
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,070
it adds the results
into the same document.

842
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:47,430
So now our agent have following documents

843
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,540
and it has access to

844
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,460
functional requirements documents

845
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,110
to non-functional requirement documents

846
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:59,760
and the results of our
intelligence hub evaluation.

847
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,440
And on the next stage,

848
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,233
agent will generate system architecture.

849
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:10,020
I forwarded to the end of stage three,

850
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,960
so now I have system
architecture generated.

851
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,540
So we can see it's
quite detailed document,

852
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,720
which describes all the
layer of architecture

853
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,167
with recommended services.

854
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,260
In our sample project,

855
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:30,260
we asked to generate
serverless applications.

856
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,930
So most of the services are represented

857
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,753
by serverless AWS components.

858
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,500
When we have our architecture generated,

859
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,650
our next step

860
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,433
is to check what is the quality
of architecture generated?

861
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,160
We have quality assurance step

862
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:03,600
where our agent instructed to perform

863
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,780
quality analysis of package
of the documents to determine

864
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,480
if we can consider this
package is finalized,

865
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,830
or we need to do one more
iteration over this package.

866
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,650
So our agent evaluates the package

867
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,080
across five weighted categories,

868
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,790
like requirements, architecture,

869
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:23,730
security, implementation, and so on,

870
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:27,300
and finally produces a final score.

871
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,530
If the score of a package

872
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,050
is below the bar that we predefined,

873
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:33,750
it means that the agent will need to do

874
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:37,950
one more iteration of
requirements refinement

875
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,963
and regenerate the requirements.

876
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:44,310
If the package exceeds the
bar in terms of quality,

877
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,970
we can consider that architecture
is successfully generated,

878
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:50,043
and we can move to the next stage.

879
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:56,270
Next and final stage of our
process is security assessment.

880
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,280
You may ask, why we are
doing security assessment

881
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,500
after architecture generation?

882
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,350
With security assessment produces

883
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:08,100
package of the documents for
our delivery security review,

884
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,650
which is a step in project delivery

885
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,100
when AWS Professional Services

886
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,420
provides this set of documents
for security assessment

887
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,410
by our application security specialists.

888
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:26,050
And our agent generates
this package of documents

889
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,690
that it significantly simplify us

890
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,143
work for our consultants.

891
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:37,860
So you can see that we have generated

892
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,423
threat analysis document,

893
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,780
which identifiers risks
associated with certain components

894
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,390
we identified for implementation.

895
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:51,540
We have security controls
as a set of controls

896
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,760
we need to implement in order to make sure

897
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,700
that application is secured,

898
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,040
and the set of tests

899
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,770
that are required to implement,

900
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,960
to make sure that security controls

901
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,133
are properly configured and applied.

902
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:15,950
That's pretty much it for this agent.

903
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,451
Today we are demonstrating

904
00:47:17,451 --> 00:47:20,730
first agent from a group of agents

905
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,130
we are building for Professional Services.

906
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:26,440
This one is a design agent that processes

907
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:32,070
project requirements and
generates specification package.

908
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,260
The next stage in this process could be,

909
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,380
first of all, this
package can be handed over

910
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,330
to delivery team to
implement the functionality

911
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,380
or this package can be a source

912
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,340
of the data for the next
agent, the build agent,

913
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,320
which can use this information

914
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,123
to automatically build a solution.

915
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,440
If you're interested to see
this built agent in action,

916
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,540
please join us at AWS
Professional Services kiosk

917
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,850
where we have demonstrations
for this agent

918
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,623
and other agents.

919
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,940
And with that I will hand
it over back to Heitor.

920
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:18,360
- [Heitor] A few final comments is,

921
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,193
as you're gonna see,

922
00:48:19,193 --> 00:48:22,200
like those coding agent
is helping us build things

923
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,040
at lightning speed, and
it's changing the dynamics.

924
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,440
It's not a driving exercise anymore,

925
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,210
it's a launch experience

926
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,910
'cause if you don't plan this properly,

927
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,800
most likely you're gonna go very fast

928
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,210
to the wrong direction.

929
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:40,680
And it's that's why now it's
more important than never

930
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,260
that you plan your project properly.

931
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,450
So when you launch with vision,

932
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:47,670
like the agent gonna land

933
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:50,070
where you need like with precision.

934
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,590
With that, we're gonna open for questions.

935
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:55,410
Please fill out the form at the end,

936
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:58,140
and if you need to dive
deeper on the topics

937
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,160
that we discussed here,

938
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,790
this is the QR code that you
have some learning there.

939
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:05,040
But we gonna, we have some,

940
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,640
around 10 minutes for questions.
