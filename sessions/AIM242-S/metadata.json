  "abstract": "Your AI-powered cloud is humming with activity, running advanced AI applications, but so are your adversaries. Last year we introduced the security for AI blueprint; now it is time to step into the role of operative. Hidden in the layers of data and code are covert risks, adversarial models, poisoned pipelines, and stealthy attacks. In this session, we will decode the enemy’s playbook and arm you with actionable intelligence to stay ahead. Learn how to expose blind spots, neutralize threats, and carry out your mission of keeping your AI-driven cloud secure, no matter how advanced the opposition becomes. This presentation is brought to you by Trend Micro, an AWS Partner.",
