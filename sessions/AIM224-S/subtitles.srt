1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:00,708
Hello.

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:03,649
Hi, uh, very nice to meet you all. Uh,

3
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:06,049
my name is Patrick Gritzka. I am a senior

4
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:08,169
solutions architect at Cloudflare, specifically

5
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:08,909
covering our,

6
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:10,489
uh, developer platform.

7
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:11,470
Um,

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,569
our developer platform is essentially

9
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:16,600
focused around offerings like workers.

10
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,239
It is a

11
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,239
serverless edge-based, um,

12
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,949
basically compute offering that, that gives you both

13
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,469
storage as well as, uh,

14
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:29,289
workflow and compute primitives. Um.

15
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,219
What I'll be presenting to you today is

16
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,560
essentially a session around

17
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,259
building MCP servers.

18
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:36,118
Um,

19
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,500
we have worked with a lot of companies to help them

20
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,819
bring their first production MCP servers,

21
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,139
uh, live this year. Um,

22
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:45,478
we did, we worked with a large batch of companies

23
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,899
earlier in about April or March

24
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:48,899
of this year to,

25
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:52,039
to push things forward in a nice wave. Um,

26
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:55,459
we'll, we'll start, I guess, at the very

27
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:56,520
start in terms of

28
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,219
what is MCP.

29
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,829
Uh, MCP was defined late last

30
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:01,908
year by Anthropic.

31
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,299
Uh, MCP is model context

32
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:04,930
protocol.

33
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:05,918
Um,

34
00:01:06,838 --> 00:01:08,870
MCP servers essentially are

35
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,659
acting as almost like a

36
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,819
similar to, to what you might have

37
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:16,239
looked at for APIs in the past

38
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,299
as a means of

39
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:20,379
allowing interoperability between

40
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,698
siloed data among different

41
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:24,838
applications. Um, what MCPs

42
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:25,750
now serve as

43
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,799
are essentially an interface that allows

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,459
for

45
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,900
your LLM based agents

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,299
to interact with.

47
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,638
That otherwise siloed data.

48
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:37,948
So, if you want to have an agent

49
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:38,969
be able to

50
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,028
update a Slack message,

51
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:42,308
update a Jira ticket,

52
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:44,709
update uh any of this content that's

53
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:45,829
available across

54
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,379
specific services,

55
00:01:47,668 --> 00:01:49,790
an MCP server can act as

56
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,489
essentially

57
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,010
that interface

58
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,299
for providing tools,

59
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,349
and a tool will be,

60
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:58,739
um, depending on the complexity of it,

61
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,260
it can be something as simple as surfacing

62
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,849
up again.

63
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:03,528
An existing API,

64
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:05,948
but it can also be more complex. It can have

65
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:08,028
more custom logic, and it can also

66
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,069
have more flexibility because you can still

67
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:11,729
rely on an LLM to

68
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:12,729
not only

69
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,129
call an individual.

70
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,520
You know, an individual API,

71
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,979
but to actually make plans and to

72
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:22,860
to really execute more complex tasks.

73
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:25,849
So

74
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,588
We believe that

75
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:29,939
we have a pretty compelling offering and way for

76
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,990
you to launch MCP servers

77
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,460
that allow you to both move quickly,

78
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:37,528
maintain maintain developer velocity,

79
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,360
while minimalizing operational overhead.

80
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:42,710
Um, I think there are some varying

81
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,969
opinions in terms of

82
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,588
what the future looks like in terms of how many MCP

83
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:49,429
servers organizations may run.

84
00:02:49,758 --> 00:02:51,149
Um, we.

85
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,258
Uh, just of, of our own kind of cloud flare,

86
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,588
uh, remote MCP offerings have,

87
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:58,710
I think, about 13 of them that run, run the

88
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,649
gamut from

89
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:01,949
observability MCPs that surface up your

90
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,469
logs to your coding agents to documentation

91
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,169
ones, to ones that even offer up,

92
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:08,550
um, some of our services like radar as

93
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,889
availability. And

94
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,210
I think there will be an aspect where

95
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:14,368
giving customers the ability to make.

96
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:17,308
Granular choices in terms of what features

97
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:19,538
and functionality they want to incorporate into their

98
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:21,649
workloads is probably going to be

99
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,288
a bit of a winning strategy there.

100
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:25,149
Um.

101
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,199
Touching back on our initial demo day earlier

102
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,758
this year, uh, companies like PayPal,

103
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,639
Stripe, Webflow, Block, Atlassian,

104
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,169
uh, all worked with us to launch their first MCP

105
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:37,528
servers. Um,

106
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,860
it's also why

107
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:41,439
we feel very confident saying that we're one of the

108
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,479
fastest places where you can build an MCP

109
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,558
server. Um, PayPal worked with us

110
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,929
to within 3 days go from a concept

111
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:50,080
of what can they deliver

112
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,360
to essentially having a production ready MCP

113
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,099
server for their invoicing scenarios.

114
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:59,050
Um, in terms of

115
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:02,409
what you get with an MCP server on our platform,

116
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,719
uh, you can use our agents SDK.

117
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,538
An MCP server is not a

118
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:09,990
kind of packaged product. It is built on

119
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,649
top of our primitives. So

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,528
you'll

121
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:15,028
essentially your MCP server will be an abstraction

122
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:15,939
on top of,

123
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,470
uh, services like our durable objects.

124
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,329
Our durable objects offer Serverless

125
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,449
compute tied with stateful storage.

126
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:26,127
So that allows you to have both scale

127
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:27,668
to zero compute for

128
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:28,627
the actual,

129
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:29,449
um,

130
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:32,228
the actual calls that are made to your, to your server,

131
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:34,519
while still maintaining a state full back end

132
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,988
that is able to maintain

133
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:38,408
both your short-term and long-term memory for

134
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,269
your ongoing conversations.

135
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:41,389
Um,

136
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,098
this also runs on our distributed architecture,

137
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:45,548
so you get the benefit of,

138
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:48,220
uh, Having a single global

139
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,220
data plane. So regardless of if you have

140
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,949
users coming in from

141
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,379
the United States,

142
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,298
Europe, Asia, um,

143
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,230
without having to manage separate control clusters,

144
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,850
uh, manage separate updates across regions

145
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,019
or availability zones, uh, you get the benefit

146
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:05,019
of having localized compute for each of them

147
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:07,358
and localized as well as storage for their

148
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,798
conversations, uh, without,

149
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:10,778
again, operational overhead.

150
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:15,858
Um MCP

151
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:16,619
is,

152
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,139
well, many of you probably already

153
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,379
have, have many conversations around MCP,

154
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,699
but part of the reason for the excitement

155
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,059
is that this feels like a new channel. This

156
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,759
feels like a means of now making

157
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,939
services available through essentially

158
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:34,399
agentic interactions. It feels like

159
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:36,980
if companies, if, you

160
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,059
know, whether those are public services

161
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:39,600
like

162
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:40,738
um,

163
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,608
Like, you know, even public sector,

164
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:46,579
uh, interfaces, or even if those are, uh,

165
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:48,790
more like e-commerce, uh, interactions,

166
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:49,608
it feels like

167
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,088
if companies aren't surfacing up

168
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:54,548
their products, their offerings,

169
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,769
their means of

170
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:58,189
completing conversions and completing transactions

171
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:00,230
and surfacing up information through an MCP

172
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,309
server, they may be passed

173
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:04,548
by because to a degree, this is, this

174
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:05,769
feels like.

175
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:09,809
How information is going to be surfaced up through this

176
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:11,670
interface that seems to be

177
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:14,750
kind of encroaching on what search has traditionally,

178
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,470
um,

179
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:17,619
search has traditionally covered.

180
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:20,189
OK.

181
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,209
You know. OK.

182
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,678
So, here, uh, I have just a simple

183
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:31,949
chat interface that plugs into one of our MCP

184
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:32,579
servers.

185
00:06:32,838 --> 00:06:33,459
Um,

186
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:36,160
what this MCP server is doing is

187
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,949
it is interacting with,

188
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:38,879
um,

189
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:41,389
within the durable object. It has access to

190
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:42,470
all of our services.

191
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:45,000
So it is able to make use of services

192
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,319
like our

193
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:47,879
Um,

194
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:51,838
Like our browser rendering services,

195
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,088
in order to actually interact with web pages.

196
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,329
So, um, your agents

197
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,689
may not always have clearly defined APIs

198
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,528
that they can call and interact with,

199
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,509
um,

200
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:04,028
but using options like

201
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:06,850
essentially browser rendering, which gives you

202
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,689
a headless browser and allows you to then

203
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,199
Uh, both scrape content from

204
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,238
it in HTML, Markdown,

205
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:14,309
JSON format,

206
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,720
but also have puppeteer-style interactions

207
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,540
in terms of

208
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:20,379
clicking buttons, entering text

209
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,480
content. Um, you're able to, to

210
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,519
actually, again, interface with pages and

211
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,899
allow your agent to plan interactions

212
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:28,449
without needing to

213
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:29,358
beforehand.

214
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:31,528
Fully, fully,

215
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:33,949
essentially have, have API key

216
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,980
access to, to the system you're interacting with.

217
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:38,439
Um, here,

218
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:41,220
uh, specifically, I'm just going to go ahead and ask

219
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,238
it to

220
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,778
make a booking for me for a

221
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,079
given time slot.

222
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,540
So this, uh, this interface is just meant to be

223
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,199
a little

224
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:52,338
showcase of, uh, court availabilities

225
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:52,920
across

226
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:55,759
courts, let's say 123456

227
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,678
for a given park.

228
00:07:57,689 --> 00:07:59,889
I'm just going to go ahead and ask it

229
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:00,608
to.

230
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:20,500
OK.

231
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,819
I don't know what

232
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:28,059
Uh And

233
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:30,170
I can do a little bit of a showcase here,

234
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:32,940
so. Here,

235
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:35,070
uh, we can see that it's, it's passing in

236
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,369
the information that's available.

237
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,149
Um, I can also,

238
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:40,269
uh,

239
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:42,168
uh.

240
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,779
I. Um

241
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,129
There. OK,

242
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,269
so that should finally come through,

243
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:04,048
um.

244
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,259
In terms of like,

245
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,899
interesting bits, that largely just

246
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:11,899
is meant to showcase that you can

247
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,259
have these interactions, not just go through

248
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,038
tailored paths, like a path that's well defined

249
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:17,759
through an API

250
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,739
but you can actually have your agents

251
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,859
dynamically kind of pull in

252
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,658
what is the structure of a page

253
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:24,619
and

254
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,359
make it, make it actually interact with a, with a

255
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,440
given UI interface. Um,

256
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,580
in terms of,

257
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:33,320
like, Underlying value

258
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,700
that you get from the solution.

259
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,219
Um,

260
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,320
it really does in my mind, come down to

261
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
the fact that like a durable object is going to be able

262
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,259
to offer you

263
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,769
Remarkable horizontal scalability to where

264
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:48,190
each uh each session, so each,

265
00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:49,009
sorry,

266
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:51,048
each of those like little

267
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,729
Each of those interfaces that come up for

268
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:56,979
a chat is tied to a single durable

269
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:57,769
object instance.

270
00:09:58,048 --> 00:10:00,048
A durable object can instantiate

271
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:01,080
across IDs,

272
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:02,590
so programmatically,

273
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:04,428
every conversation that we're having

274
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:06,928
gets its own sharded compute, sharded

275
00:10:06,928 --> 00:10:07,599
storage,

276
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,928
so you don't have to worry about

277
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:11,928
suddenly scaling that out when there's more traffic

278
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:14,369
coming in. You don't have to worry about scaling

279
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:16,210
out your, you know,

280
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:17,908
memory and storage when.

281
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:20,509
The millionth conversation has started to

282
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:22,899
become because that is automatically kind of horizontally

283
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:25,469
scaling across your newly instantiated

284
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:25,989
resources.

285
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,428
Um, it also gives you a decent bit of flexibility

286
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,629
where that memory is still tied to that individual

287
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,989
durable object instance.

288
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:34,979
So if you're looking to have

289
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:36,859
conversations tied to a single user,

290
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:39,349
you can, you can have that easily implemented

291
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:41,009
by having them tied to a single ID,

292
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:43,428
but you can also have multiple individuals

293
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:45,489
interacting with a single agent conversation

294
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,090
just by tying their.

295
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,859
Essentially a conversation back to the same ID

296
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:52,580
so you get the the ability and flexibility

297
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,239
to have

298
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:55,038
various interaction patterns,

299
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:57,538
while also having an easy

300
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:59,538
kind of routing method if you do decide

301
00:10:59,538 --> 00:11:01,580
to make multi-agenttic kind

302
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,759
of interfaces for

303
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:05,288
having them interact with, with separate

304
00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:06,918
instances. Um,

305
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,558
yeah, if there are any questions that kind of

306
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,279
come up throughout, like,

307
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,418
uh, um, I don't know, implementation

308
00:11:14,418 --> 00:11:16,820
or, or approach, um,

309
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:19,769
There's quite a bit of content that we have

310
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:22,288
regarding um various SDKs

311
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:24,960
and various tooling that we have to improve uh agent,

312
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,629
agent workloads. So, uh,

313
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,009
beyond just browser rendering, we now have also dynamic

314
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:30,989
worker loaders.

315
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,250
Uh, dynamic worker loaders allow you

316
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,450
to dynamically provide, whether it's

317
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,269
JavaScript or TypeScript code,

318
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:38,109
um,

319
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,710
that It is ideal for scenarios

320
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,830
where you may be actually generating code that you want

321
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,308
to execute yourselves,

322
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,109
um,

323
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:47,538
that can be provided to a a dynamic worker

324
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:48,058
loader,

325
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:49,739
have an execution with,

326
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,830
again, the same performance you get from a worker. So

327
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,989
near zero millisecond cold start

328
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:56,590
times, um,

329
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:59,330
to the millisecond, uh, uh,

330
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,750
compute billing,

331
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,168
um, so very attractive for

332
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:06,099
Both sandboxing use cases, but really that

333
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,969
execution of untrusted, um,

334
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,960
agentically generated code.

335
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:11,090
Um,

336
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:13,808
yeah, thank you so much for your time and, uh,

337
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,058
let me know if, if there are any questions about our

338
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:16,599
offerings.
