1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,400
- So it's great to be here.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,440
Thanks all for coming
to our presentation here

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,180
to talk a little bit about LocalStack

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,873
and developing service
applications on your local machine.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,960
So maybe just a quick show of hands

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,400
before we dive into the agenda,

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,020
can we just get a quick
show of hands who has heard

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,290
about LocalStack before,
maybe even used it?

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,390
Okay, so there's about half of
the people here in the room,

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,250
so that's great.

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,720
So we're gonna keep it
relatively high level

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,150
and also wanna talk a bit
about the AWS partnerships

13
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,590
that we've been doing recently,

14
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,810
which is really exciting
to share with you all.

15
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,280
So this is the agenda we wanna go through.

16
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,420
I'm not gonna spend too much time here.

17
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,890
Let's dive right in.

18
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,780
So generally speaking, what is LocalStack?

19
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,120
We are a...

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,820
Imagine you have like
local AWS sandboxes, right?

21
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,670
Giving you the ability to develop
and test your applications

22
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,650
on the local machine
without being connected

23
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,990
to the cloud environment or
before connected to the cloud.

24
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,540
So what you see here is kind
of a traditional workflow.

25
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,130
You start with some
local environment, right?

26
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,500
Do some local testing,
maybe IDE integration,

27
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,840
then you run some tests
in the CI/CD environment,

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,150
and then finally you push
changes up to the real cloud

29
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,790
once you're happy with the
application you're developing.

30
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,233
So some of the benefits here you see is

31
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,510
that you get these instant feedback loops

32
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,620
by running things locally,

33
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,840
not having to push every
change into the cloud.

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,030
You have fully isolated test sandboxes

35
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,530
that run in your CI/CD process,

36
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,050
so no overriding of changes of each other.

37
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,140
And again, you ship to
production with confidence

38
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,870
once you're happy with the
changes you've made locally.

39
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,180
So there's more than
a hundred AWS services

40
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,040
that we have in our stack today.

41
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,720
So I think it's 120 at this point.

42
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,720
Everything from Lambda, SQS,
DynamoDB, IAM, you name it.

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,020
And we also integrate with most

44
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,060
of the existing
infrastructures, code tools,

45
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,280
you know, Terraform, CDK, you name it.

46
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,680
So we really try to meet the
developers where they are,

47
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,890
make sure that you can just
run new applications locally.

48
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,780
So how does it generally work, right?

49
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,480
So it's basically a docker
image if you spin up

50
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,500
as a container, right?

51
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,480
So you just basically install the CLI,

52
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,650
you say LocalStack start,

53
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,200
it spins up, you can see the
banner here in the terminal.

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,060
And then the second thing is
you just interact with it,

55
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,000
which basically just means
setting the AWS endpoint URL

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,190
to local host and then
you're off to the races.

57
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,780
You can just use the AWS CLI

58
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,480
and all your native tooling there.

59
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,420
So one of the questions
we often get is, okay,

60
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,130
how do we actually keep up with, you know,

61
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,890
the amazing pace of AWS and
all the great innovation

62
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,760
that's coming out there.

63
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,630
We heard many announcements at
re:Invent already this year,

64
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,840
so almost everybody visiting
our booth has this question.

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,390
So basically it boils down
to, you know, a couple of,

66
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,650
a combination of factors.

67
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,170
So first of all, we've built
a lot of internal tooling.

68
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,190
One of them is called ASF,
the AWS server framework.

69
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,380
So we do a lot of automated scraping

70
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,300
of the API specifications.

71
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,670
We always detect when there's
a new change coming out

72
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,530
with AWS services.

73
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,870
The second part is we
have a enormously talented

74
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,700
engineering community in-house

75
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,620
and also, you know, the
open source community.

76
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,090
So there's a lot of people just rambling

77
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,230
behind building these emulators,

78
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,270
which is a phenomenal effort really.

79
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,060
And then thirdly, what we're
gonna talk about today also is

80
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,280
there's more and more
partnerships going on specifically

81
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,804
with AWS, so we can do same day launches

82
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,450
and make sure that you actually get all

83
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,410
these great new features

84
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,300
in the local developer experience

85
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,983
once they're released by AWS.

86
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,830
So with that, I'm gonna
hand it over to Shridhar

87
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,260
and he's gonna share a little
bit from AWS perspective,

88
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,860
the serverless staff challenges.

89
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,810
- Thank you, Waldemar.

90
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,210
As we have discussed
LocalStack capabilities

91
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,820
and how it keeps pace with AWS services,

92
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,010
I want to shift our focus to...

93
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,540
There's some loud music
playing back there,

94
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,363
so if you hear any feedback,
just know it's not me.

95
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,880
We should shift our focus

96
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,220
to serverless developer challenges

97
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,010
serverless developers
face when they're building

98
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,600
serverless applications.

99
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,940
Now these challenges
represent the pain points

100
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,520
we are collaboratively addressing, right?

101
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,180
The AWS serverless team has been at work,

102
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,490
and particularly focused on improving

103
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,320
the developer experience,

104
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,570
which is why this
partnership is so valuable.

105
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,660
Let's start with the challenges.

106
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,740
Let's break it down into,

107
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,810
we break it down into four key areas

108
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,660
that affect serverless
developers on a daily basis.

109
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,500
The challenges significantly
impact productivity,

110
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,130
code quality, developer satisfaction,

111
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,450
and just the way the quality
of your overall application

112
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,030
when it comes to even things
like operational efficiency

113
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,080
and so on, right?

114
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,090
So we'll explore each of them in detail

115
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,413
in the upcoming slides.

116
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,010
The first is testing in the cloud.

117
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,610
You know, cloud-based
validation slows things down.

118
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,280
It slows down your duration cycles.

119
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,490
AWS research shows that developers
spend considerable amount

120
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,390
of time on their local devices
where they're, you know,

121
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,870
testing and writing code
rather than in, you know,

122
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,510
so what that means is it is critical

123
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,250
to get them going fast as soon
as possible to their stage

124
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,230
where they're able to see
what they're after building

125
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,280
what it looks like.

126
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,820
Now, each code change
requires a full cycle

127
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,410
if you're deploying to production,

128
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,260
so you have to go through
validation, testing, deployment,

129
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,300
and the feedback loops
could stretch anywhere

130
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,220
from minutes to hours.

131
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,130
This dramatically reduces
the developer productivity

132
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,300
and innovation velocity,

133
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,220
which is obviously not a good thing.

134
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,600
So what should be a quick
test usually becomes a cycle,

135
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,130
a lengthy process,

136
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,700
and this forces developers
to batch changes

137
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,400
or, you know, make educated guesses

138
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,440
rather than actually
relying on real validations.

139
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:29,100
The second challenge is context
switching between tools.

140
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,460
It comes with a significant
cognitive overhead

141
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,800
of constantly switching
between different tools.

142
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,700
Developers routinely
shift between IDEs, CLIs,

143
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,560
and resource emulators.

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,650
What this does is it creates
fragmented workflows,

145
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,810
and each context switch disrupts

146
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,920
what you're trying to build.

147
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,800
It interrupts your flow,
it reduces productivity.

148
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,920
Managing multiple tools increases
the likelihood of errors

149
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,980
and creates significant
mental overload as well.

150
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,170
Now this is particularly noticeable

151
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,430
in serverless development

152
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,070
where you're working
with multiple services,

153
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,947
for example, the likes of
Lambda, SQS, EventBridge,

154
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,120
API gateway, you name it.

155
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,410
There's always a myriad of services

156
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,790
that you are working together with,

157
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,553
and there this challenge
is the most pronounced.

158
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,920
The next is configuration
complexity, port mapping,

159
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,860
and code edit for local
service integration tests.

160
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,540
They introduce inconsistencies

161
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,990
between local and cloud environments.

162
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,410
Developers must maintain
separate copies of configuration

163
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,356
for local versus cloud, cloud
computing or cloud testing.

164
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:33,847
And this leads to the classic, you know,

165
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:35,190
"works on my machine" problem

166
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,740
that you've all run into at some point.

167
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,130
These manual configurations
are not only error prone,

168
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,840
they can be time consuming,

169
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,050
and it requires a
constant maintenance cycle

170
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,543
as applications evolve
and get bigger and bigger.

171
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,093
And the last one is,

172
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,170
and this one I want to
stress is super important

173
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,780
for serverless developers is integrations.

174
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,750
I touched upon multiple services earlier.

175
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,360
Integration testing is difficult, period.

176
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,820
Now, troubleshooting Lambda
functions in the context

177
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,140
of AWS service integrations
with DynamoDB, S3, SQS,

178
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,330
this requires complex setup.

179
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,940
And event driven architectures
can be particularly

180
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,590
challenging to test locally,

181
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,107
and what ends up happening
is developers resort to

182
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,380
"test in production" approaches,

183
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,350
and we all know that we
shouldn't rely on that.

184
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,230
So the hidden complexity
of service integrations

185
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,680
is much larger than the
function code itself,

186
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,893
and this creates a
significant testing gap.

187
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,670
So now that we understand the challenges,

188
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,020
let's look at the solutions LocalStack

189
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,973
and AWS develop together.

190
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,470
The collaboration between
AWS and LocalStack

191
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,330
addresses all these challenges

192
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,580
through a seamless
integration that brings best

193
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,573
of the both worlds.

194
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:55,440
In the next slide I'll talk
about how this simplifies

195
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,603
the experience of working on a local IDE,

196
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,280
and scan the QR code if you
want to read more about offline.

197
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,280
So the AWS toolkit for VS
code now integrates directly

198
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,240
with LocalStack.

199
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,880
We launched this integration
back in September.

200
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,310
This creates a unified
development experience.

201
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,520
The integration enables local
testing of Lambda functions

202
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,670
with full AWS service integrations.

203
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,320
It provides consistent behavior

204
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,450
between cloud and local environments,

205
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,390
and it eliminates the manual
configuration of service,

206
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,720
various service integrations
and service connections.

207
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,210
This results in accelerated
development cycles.

208
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,160
It reduces context switching

209
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,150
and it simplifies the
integration testing cycle,

210
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,240
and it also helps you
ascertain the code quality,

211
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,190
meaning that the code is of high quality

212
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,270
before you actually send it

213
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,220
to production integration testing,

214
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,693
or even staging environments.

215
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,430
And let's get more specific
first on what are the benefits.

216
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,343
I know that I talked about
addressing these challenges,

217
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,580
so let's talk about them.

218
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,910
So you get one-click
LocalStack setup directly

219
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,793
in your visual studio code IDE.

220
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,360
That means no more complex docker commands

221
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,310
or configuration file.

222
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,410
It's all handled for you.

223
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,960
The second thing is that you can access

224
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,993
all your emulated resources
directly from your VS code IDE.

225
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,770
This means that you get to stay

226
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,720
in your development
environment without having

227
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,573
to switch context between
multiple tools and interfaces.

228
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,960
You can also easily switch

229
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,040
between local and cloud
resources with a simple click,

230
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,290
making it seamless to test locally

231
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,260
and then deploy to the
cloud rather than deploy

232
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,610
to the cloud and then test.

233
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,860
So we are kind of reversing
the paradigm here.

234
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,840
And most importantly,

235
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,950
you get a dramatically
faster local feedback loop.

236
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,470
Changes that would take
minutes to test in the cloud

237
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,900
can be validated in seconds locally,

238
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,580
and this significantly accelerates

239
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,143
your development velocity.

240
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,060
With that said, let's take a
quick look at the live demo

241
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,910
that Waldemar is going to talk about.

242
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,710
- Awesome, thanks so much, Shridhar.

243
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,900
I just wanted to emphasize
we couldn't be more excited

244
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,460
to stand up here on the booth

245
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,380
or at the stand as LocalStack together

246
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,780
with the AWS Lambda team,

247
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,340
so it's a really exciting integration

248
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,140
for us all here to talk about this.

249
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,360
And we would've loved to show
you like an actual live demo,

250
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,490
but this is a recorded video
that I'm gonna play here,

251
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,890
and I'm gonna speak to it, it's
about a three minute video,

252
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,500
and we'll see what's going on there.

253
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,170
So basically what we're showing here is

254
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,920
the VS code integration that
Shridhar was talking about,

255
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,100
and we're gonna deploy a
simple sample application,

256
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,100
fully run it on LocalStack
via the AWS toolkit,

257
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,320
and then at the end
also show how you can do

258
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,028
breakpoint debugging
directly from the IDE.

259
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:50,070
So I'm just gonna kick off this video here

260
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,630
and speak to it a little bit.

261
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,630
I know it's pretty fast,
but let's just dive in

262
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,680
and see what it does.

263
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,290
So what we see here, we're
creating a new project here

264
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,690
that's called "LocalStack HelloWorld."

265
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,586
This is actually a SAM
service application template,

266
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:05,700
so it basically, you know,

267
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,020
renders a cloud transformation template

268
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,603
that you can directly deploy via SAM.

269
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,480
And the nice thing is you
could just take the whole thing

270
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,930
and deploy it against AWS,
you know, totally works out.

271
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,550
But what we're gonna do
here is we're actually doing

272
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,660
a SAM deploy and specify
the profile LocalStack.

273
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,150
The profile LocalStack is
just a local AWS profile

274
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,140
like any other.

275
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,510
The only thing is that we
actually define the endpoint

276
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,680
to be local host, right?

277
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,810
That's literally the only
difference that you see there.

278
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,130
So we're doing the SAM deploy,

279
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,150
specify a couple of parameters
like region, stack name,

280
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,740
and just the basic information.

281
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,050
This is all standard
AWS deployment, right?

282
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,180
But again, the deployment
is actually happening

283
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,380
against LocalStack.

284
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,110
So we see the stack resources here,

285
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,150
it's pretty snappy, which
is in a couple of seconds

286
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,410
everything is deployed,

287
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,950
and we see now we have an API gateway

288
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,150
with a Lambda function deployed

289
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,440
that's running fully locally.

290
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,270
This is our application web app,

291
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,400
app.localstack.cloud, if
you wanna give it a try.

292
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,900
It's a bit like the AWS console

293
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,880
where you can browse
your resources locally.

294
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,310
And this is the Lambda
function, which is created here.

295
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,050
And now we are actually
doing an invocation.

296
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,750
So at the bottom of the screen
you can see a curl command.

297
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,550
We're just doing a curl,

298
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,060
which is removing, replacing aws.com

299
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,460
with localhost.localstack.clouds.

300
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,890
Otherwise it's exactly
the same kind of endpoint,

301
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,510
and we see the invocation was done.

302
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,990
So we just is a full round
trip of an API gateway,

303
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,300
Lambda invocation that
connects to DynamoDB.

304
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,760
Now we're making some
changes in the Lambda,

305
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,520
which is, you know, change
the messages coming back here,

306
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,890
do another SAM deploy.

307
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,600
So this is basically just
redeploying the changes

308
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,610
we just made in the IDE.

309
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,530
And again, it's just gonna
take a couple of seconds.

310
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,210
It's doing the cloud formation updates

311
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,430
and we should be done in a second.

312
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,070
And then we're gonna run the
curl command one more time

313
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,020
and it'll show the updated output.

314
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,480
So now this is fairly,
what you've seen so far

315
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,710
is pretty much table stakes.

316
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,780
This is just LocalStack basics in a sense,

317
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,870
but now the exciting part is gonna come

318
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,633
for all those of you
familiar with LocalStack.

319
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,260
So what we're gonna show here now

320
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,430
is the remote debugging
capability in the AWS toolkit.

321
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,580
So what the toolkit
provides is effectively

322
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,740
a remote debugging where
you can set a break point

323
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,330
directly in the Lambda code.

324
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,040
And on the right hand side you see

325
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,720
the remote debugging configuration.

326
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,910
You can use that against AWS as well,

327
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,700
and also natively the same
experience against LocalStack,

328
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,230
so it's just literally the same experience

329
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,310
that you get there.

330
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,620
So we have the local endpoints,

331
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,290
we do the remote invoke,
and it actually, you know,

332
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,940
hits the break point right there.

333
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,890
We can make changes, we
can step over the code,

334
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,290
just the regular debugging
experience that you all used to

335
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,583
in your day to day work.

336
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,923
So that is, and then we see
the updated output in the end.

337
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,290
So that was a quick walkthrough.

338
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,940
I know that the video was pretty fast,

339
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,130
but hopefully we were able to
give you a bit of a glimpse

340
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,120
into the experience that you
have with the AWS toolkit

341
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,470
together with LocalStack.

342
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,360
And it's worth mentioning,
as Shridhar said,

343
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,100
no more need to configure any, you know,

344
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,230
docker composed files or complex setup.

345
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,400
It's all fully integrated.

346
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,653
It's just a turnkey
solution in that sense.

347
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,410
So with that, I just
wanna sort of close out

348
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,390
with just mentioning
again the partnerships

349
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,060
and the collaborations that we
are doing together with AWS,

350
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,747
which again is super exciting for us

351
00:14:13,747 --> 00:14:16,080
as we're kind of growing
the open source community

352
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,300
and also our business.

353
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,250
So we have been launching in
the past already a couple of,

354
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,470
I think it was probably half a year ago,

355
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,370
also step functions testing
integration with LocalStack.

356
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,320
So there's actually a couple of features

357
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,011
that we're coming out in
step functions recently.

358
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:37,020
TestState API, JSONata
support, and Variables.

359
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,110
So for those of you using
step functions once in a while

360
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,220
or on a regular basis,

361
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,400
those are some really killer
features that AWS put out,

362
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,660
you know, some time ago.

363
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,330
And we basically were able
to do same day launches

364
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,380
together with AWS, right?

365
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,448
So we're partnering up very closely

366
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:53,700
with the folks over there to make sure

367
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,350
that all the good stuff that's coming out

368
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,753
is available to you like
in an instant, right?

369
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:00,750
TestState API I think is
actually that's something

370
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,540
very recent at re:Invent,
if I'm not mistaken.

371
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,373
- [Shridhar] A couple weeks ago.

372
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:05,760
- A couple weeks ago, yeah.

373
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,990
So that's just another example

374
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,330
even besides the toolkit
of the partnership

375
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,230
that's now taking shape more and more.

376
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,190
And there's more to come.

377
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,920
There was actually literally
at re:Invent a launch

378
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,230
around Lambda Managed Instances,

379
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,370
if you haven't seen the announcement

380
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,570
maybe you can check it out.

381
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,400
We also put out a blog post there.

382
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,470
And again, it was like a same day launch

383
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,450
we were able to do as we were very closely

384
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,040
partnering up with AWS.

385
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,950
The second part that we're
of course focusing on

386
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,150
on an ongoing basis is
just improved parity.

387
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,850
So we wanna make sure
that any stack you deploy

388
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,070
really has the high fidelity
that you would expect

389
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,810
from a local emulator.

390
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,700
And we're working very hard
together with our team,

391
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,080
with the community to
make sure that this is

392
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,630
a high fidelity, a digital twin

393
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,820
of your cloud environment, if you will.

394
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,590
And then the third one
is around, of course,

395
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,720
developer experience is
becoming a big, big topic.

396
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,210
Also, AI, it plays into
our day-to-day lives

397
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,310
of how we're building cloud applications.

398
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,630
So we are building sort of on top

399
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,910
of the emulator developer
experience features

400
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,650
to give you more debugging capabilities,

401
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,390
more insights into your stack,

402
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,150
debug your IM policies for
example, and much more.

403
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,940
And AI is also coming as a new means

404
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,050
of developing applications,

405
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,170
and we have a secure local
sandbox that you can, you know,

406
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,870
use for your agent decoding there.

407
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,010
So with that, wanna close out the session.

408
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,690
We have a couple minutes left,

409
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,670
but definitely wanna give a shout out.

410
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,000
Please visit us at our booth, 1626.

411
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,500
It's right over there.

412
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,540
Just literally behind the Redis booth,

413
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,580
you'll find the LocalStack booth.

414
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,870
We're gonna show you some live demo,

415
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,450
show you the AWS toolkit integration.

416
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,283
The team's gonna be there

417
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:39,480
to answer any questions you might have.

418
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,730
Again, we'd love to, you
know, get your feedback,

419
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,969
and see what's coming
out next at LocalStack.

420
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:48,510
Also, please do give us
feedback, that would be great.

421
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,560
So in the app you have a way

422
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,060
to provide feedback for the session.

423
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,910
If there is anything we can
improve or learn from it,

424
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,220
we always appreciate any
feedback you can share with us.

425
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,840
So with that, I'm gonna close.

426
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,750
And again, thank you so much
for your attention being here,

427
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,730
and very much looking
forward to everything

428
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,860
that's coming next in
local cloud development.

429
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,693
Thank you all.
