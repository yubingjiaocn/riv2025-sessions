1
00:00:00,207 --> 00:00:04,560
- [GOPAL] All right, so
I'm gonna talk about,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,390
I'm gonna talk about this,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,850
this big challenge that we've seen

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,560
over the last year that you've read about.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,430
I dunno how many of you saw

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,320
the MIT 95% pilots failed report.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,730
If people come across that report,

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,763
there was like all the
news a few, few months ago.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,800
And, and one of, one of our
kind of takes on the problem

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,500
is that the big issue is that,

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,420
that we're not really solving for

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,600
is this problem of AI being
confidently wrong, right?

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,003
And, and so what do I,
what do I mean by that?

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,370
AI has been around for
2, 2, 3 years now, right?

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,260
We've all been using it.

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,140
I, I don't think ever in the
history of any new technology,

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,210
it's gotten close to a billion users

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,060
in shut a, such a short period of time.

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,260
It's kind of insane.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,220
But, but if you think about

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,710
the kind of science fiction
reality of us as technologists,

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,260
going to our business people and saying,

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,910
here's AI, go, go use AI and,
and make decisions.

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,760
Ask, ask questions on your
data and say things like,

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,610
make, make decisions that will
improve the business, right?

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,930
Make better staffing decisions,

27
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,673
make better pricing decisions,

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,040
make decisions that will
improve the business

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,910
in a meaningful way,

30
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,620
in a way that you
couldn't have done before.

31
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,480
And that's what AI can give you.

32
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,210
It's, it's finally,
it's finally accessible.

33
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,320
There's the big challenge there is that

34
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,060
you're still not able to use
AI connected to your data

35
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,800
in a way that you can trust, right?

36
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,320
So almost all of us would've tried

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,330
some kind of AI on data project, right?

38
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,670
You take an LLM, you
connect it to database,

39
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,420
MCP, whatever, whatever
connectivity technology you use,

40
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,310
and you can make it work.

41
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,700
But, but when you are on the business side

42
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,720
and you ask a question that is loaded,

43
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,390
the impact of that
question is pretty serious.

44
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,980
You, you know for a fact

45
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,760
that you're not going
to trust what it says.

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,780
And, and the reason is because

47
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,710
you know that it's gonna be hard

48
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,080
for even a human to
answer those questions,

49
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,410
but at least the human would
tell you that they don't know.

50
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,110
And if an AI tells you something

51
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,340
it's just extremely confident
and you have no idea

52
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,533
whether you trust that confidence or not.

53
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,830
If, if you think about
this ability that AI has

54
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,310
of just being confident all the time

55
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,470
and it's impact on
being confidently wrong,

56
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,370
that, that is kind of what
really hurts adaption as,

57
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,540
as you start to use it, right?

58
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,660
It goes from like a fun project to,

59
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,310
I, I can't actually trust
this to do anything useful.

60
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,420
Is this a, is this a better models problem

61
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,230
or is this something that we
can, we can do something about?

62
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,880
Can we solve this problem ourselves?

63
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,540
So I'm gonna share with
you our learnings as,

64
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,120
as we've kind of built an AI product

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,530
on how we tackle this problem.

66
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,120
And hopefully some of those learnings

67
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,880
are useful to you as you folks
think about your projects

68
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,570
and, and that gives you some ideas on,

69
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,670
on how you can tackle this problem, right?

70
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,380
How many of you listen to
the Dwarkesh Patel's podcast?

71
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,120
Do? Alright, cool.
Alright.

72
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,920
No, for those of you don't,

73
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,070
you guys should listen to
the Dwarkesh Patel's podcast.

74
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,370
It's got a bunch of bunch
of really fun stuff.

75
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,560
I think the most recent
one is by Andrej Karpathy,

76
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,710
and then by Ilya who was
the co-founder at OpenAI,

77
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,320
talking about a bunch of
topics around learning

78
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,033
and continuous learning
and utility of AI, right?

79
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,890
And, and this is,
this is something

80
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,870
that came up from his
blog post a while ago,

81
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,610
and I really, really
like this quote, right?

82
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,840
Which is that the,

83
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,290
the reason why a human being
is useful in your business

84
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,240
is not because they have 500 points of IQ,

85
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,390
because they win the IMO gold medal

86
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,500
every time you talk to them, right?

87
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,300
It's not that raw intelligence.

88
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,250
The, the raw intelligence kind of

89
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,420
was passed by LLMs a while ago, right?

90
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,740
So it's not the raw intelligence
that makes them useful,

91
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,510
it's, it's somehow this
ability that they have

92
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,450
of picking up context on the fly.

93
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,450
Of, of looking at a failure,
thinking about it and,

94
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,920
and fixing that failure, right?

95
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,450
It's, it's this ability of
like incrementally improving

96
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,720
that you can trust the human to do,

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,720
even though the human is not as "smart"

98
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,800
as DeepSeek V3 which just
won the IMO gold, but,

99
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,140
but somehow the human is
still more trustworthy, right?

100
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,600
And so this ability to continuously

101
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,163
absorb tribal knowledge and
improve is critical, right?

102
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,400
But, but this is,
this is obvious.

103
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,550
Like we all know that we want
AI to continuously improve,

104
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,680
learn tribal knowledge
and do whatever, right?

105
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Our key, the key point
that I wanna share is

106
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,203
you can only teach something
when it says it doesn't know.

107
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,980
And that's kind of the critical thing

108
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,350
that's missing in AI products.

109
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,920
That confidence,
confidently wrong hurts you.

110
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,500
Even if AI got really good
at learning continuously,

111
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,030
the confidently wrong problem hurts you,

112
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,520
because if AI doesn't
tell you when it's wrong,

113
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,200
you can't teach it.

114
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,213
And if you can't teach it,
you can't use it.

115
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:18,960
And, and that's kind of
this core product loop

116
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,770
that's missing with AI products, right?

117
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,950
So let, let me, let me talk
about what we do at PromptQL

118
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,960
and show you a demonstration of

119
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,160
how we kind of approach
this problem, right?

120
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,650
Broadly, we're yet another
chat with your data product.

121
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,620
So, it's fascinatingly amazing and new

122
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,950
and differentiated with
everybody else here.

123
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,170
But the idea is to say that if users

124
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,490
are interacting with data,

125
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,100
they typically talk to multiple people

126
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,660
to get some kind of insight, right?

127
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,430
When you wanna solve a problem,
you wanna make a decision,

128
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,440
you're a business user,
you talk to an analyst,

129
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,600
you talk to a scientist,
you talk to an engineer,

130
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,370
they talk to each other,
they talk to data,

131
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,070
something happens,
some spaghettiness happens

132
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,100
and you get the result
at the end of the day.

133
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,570
Most often when you ask a question

134
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,310
you'll probably get the
result like two weeks later

135
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,590
by which time the question
is not very important, right?

136
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,510
And the promise of AI is

137
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,990
we'll have this cool AI
thing that sits in the middle

138
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,930
that users will use,
users will use that AI,

139
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,940
the AI will do everything
that the human does.

140
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,410
The AI will do data engineering

141
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,080
and it'll do data analysis
and it'll do data science

142
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,180
and it'll compose all of it magically

143
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,013
and give you an answer.

144
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:28,846
And by the way,

145
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,440
this might have sounded like
rocket science like a year ago,

146
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,030
but today you can see very clearly

147
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,440
that it's already possible.

148
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,240
You can take cloud code

149
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,890
and make it write a pipeline for you,

150
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,290
and then you can make it
write a SQL thing for you,

151
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,220
and then you can make it write

152
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,510
a data science program for you, right?

153
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,863
It's already in the realm of
reach, it's already possible.

154
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,230
The thing that's missing though

155
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,510
is that you can't actually
expose it to end users

156
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,160
in a way that they can trust it.

157
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,770
If you look at all of these
chat with data products,

158
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,770
ultimately they all turn out
to be text to SQL products

159
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,290
where you need the technical person

160
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,180
to look at the SQL to verify it.

161
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,090
So you can never give it
to a non-technical person

162
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,000
because a non-technical
person can't read SQL.

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,833
How do you trust it?

164
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,120
You, you can't trust
this AI system, right?

165
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,580
And so our operating model

166
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,140
is to get AI to admit that it doesn't know

167
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,600
so that experts who are
the red boxes can teach it

168
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,740
so that the AI gets better.

169
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,760
But most importantly,

170
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,040
because the AI can tell
you that it doesn't know,

171
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,190
even on day zero when
it's only 50% accurate,

172
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,530
it's fine, users can trust it.

173
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,820
Because if I can ask you a question

174
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,160
and you tell me that you
don't know, that's great.

175
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,090
I'll ask you two questions

176
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,440
and you tell me half the
times you don't know,

177
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,850
that's totally fine.

178
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,970
I can still use your product, right?

179
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,383
So I'm gonna demo kind of how
we do this in, in product.

180
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,023
This is the,

181
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,050
this is the core loop that

182
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,970
I'd like you folks to watch out for.

183
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,510
The first part is to tell you

184
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,530
what it knows and what it doesn't know.

185
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,110
That's kind of where this
cycle begins in the product.

186
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,570
The second piece of the
cycle that's critical is

187
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,220
that you can, once it tells
you that it doesn't know,

188
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,920
you can ask it to fix its stuff.

189
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,710
And then once you do, it learns.

190
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,390
That, these are kinda the three pieces

191
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,410
that I'd like you to
kinda anchor on, right?

192
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,383
Alright, so,

193
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,060
I'll do a recorded demo and
then I'll do a live demo

194
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,140
because like live demos
are fun and dangerous

195
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,810
and who knows if they'll work.

196
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,500
But let's say for example,
you ask a question on

197
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,270
what was GM broken down by
region yesterday, right?

198
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,673
What our system does is it,

199
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,680
first it, it does a plan
to solve the problem,

200
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,410
but you notice that it highlights

201
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,570
in blue links what it knows

202
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,300
and where that knowledge
comes from, right?

203
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,460
Internally, if you as a user
go click on that blue link

204
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,810
that is actually a wiki that
powers the AI internally.

205
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,290
This wiki contains
concepts like gross margin

206
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,083
that are pretty flexible.

207
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,560
Let me roll that up for you.

208
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,690
So the gross margin concept, for example,

209
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,280
says this is what gross margin is,

210
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,750
this is how you calculate it,

211
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,483
these are what our targets
are for this quarter.

212
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,780
These are what expected range of values

213
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,130
could look like, right?

214
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,297
And this is how you calculate it.

215
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:42,033
And so that's kind of a
wiki entry that backs this.

216
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,090
And, and you know, it's like,

217
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,430
just like a wiki,
there's multiple concepts

218
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,840
that are connected to each other,

219
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,090
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
fun, fun, fun.

220
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,510
And, and that's kind of the core

221
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,340
piece of how it works, right?

222
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,900
But what, and,
and so this is fine,

223
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,340
we all have this today.

224
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,080
Like you have some kind of knowledge base,

225
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,270
you refer citation on the knowledge base

226
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,740
and you make it work, right?

227
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,600
What happens and what is interesting

228
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,770
is when it doesn't work,

229
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,000
so you say, what was GM last FY, right?

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,150
And here, the first thing
that the AI does is tell you,

231
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,840
well, FY it's this new thing.

232
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,990
It's a new thing that
I think in this domain

233
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,973
is a concept that is not known.

234
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,430
And that's, that's a red link

235
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,100
that it will make an assumption about.

236
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,390
And so it makes an assumption,

237
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,290
tells the user what the assumption is,

238
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,070
and then the user kind of goes on,

239
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,923
sees what the plan is,
looks at the answer, right?

240
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,410
And now as a user,

241
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,120
when I look at this answer
and I look at the value,

242
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,070
I'm like, this is fine,

243
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,510
but I also don't really know
what the fiscal year is.

244
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,040
This is the most common
thing you'll notice,

245
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,050
your business users will use the product

246
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,883
and they'll be like,

247
00:10:52,883 --> 00:10:54,510
thank you for telling me that
you don't know something.

248
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,660
But true facts,
even I don't know.

249
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,010
Like I know we have a fiscal year,

250
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,740
I don't actually know
what the exact period is

251
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,750
because we are a global MNC and like,

252
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,890
is it different in different regions?

253
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,570
I, I have no idea, right?

254
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,220
And so this is kind of critical

255
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,030
where you now kind of bring in

256
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,763
another person into this conversation,

257
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,210
an expert or a group of experts to say,

258
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,483
can you, can you clarify
what fiscal year means?

259
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,813
This person kind of
joins our conversation.

260
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:26,733
This is an actual human being.

261
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,860
The human is an expert,

262
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,460
joins the conversation
and says, well PromptQL,

263
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,580
our fiscal year is whatever,
whatever, whatever.

264
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,300
And PromptQL is like,
cool, that fills my gap,

265
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,950
that fills the assumption that I had.

266
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,370
And it redoes the plan and
gives you an answer, right?

267
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,190
This was really important for two reasons.

268
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,890
One, the user is actually happy.

269
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,490
The user is happy that they
got an answer that was right.

270
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,770
Because they did something,
it was not accurate,

271
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,510
I brought in an expert and
I got the right answer.

272
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,300
This is what I would've
done even without AI.

273
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,480
I'm not, it's not surprising,
it's, it's natural to me.

274
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,720
But what is really nice is
that this entire conversation

275
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,383
has so much tribal knowledge
that just got captured.

276
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,240
This conversation is the seed of learning.

277
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,180
So now there's kind of another agent loop

278
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,950
that goes and helps
you create a wiki entry

279
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,640
and updates the Wiki

280
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,250
based on what just happened
in this conversation.

281
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,090
And because it's a wiki,

282
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,090
it's literally a wiki like a Wikipedia,

283
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,543
AI and humans can collaboratively
maintain that wiki,

284
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,470
and that wiki can kind
of keep getting better

285
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,450
overtime so that you can use it, right?

286
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,950
And then in the future,
let's say for example,

287
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,500
you ask a question and you say,

288
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,360
whatever Wiki, et cetera goes live,

289
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,453
what was the GM last
fiscal quarter, right?

290
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,150
That's kinda the key capability

291
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,370
where you also can
reference these advanced

292
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,810
kind of concepts in the wiki

293
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,760
despite what users are saying, right?

294
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,310
And this is kind of how you surface it up.

295
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,610
I'll take another example

296
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:06,960
to kind of show you

297
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,970
how we think about what
goes in the Wiki, right?

298
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,723
So this is another example of,

299
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,440
of a finance kind of data set, right?

300
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,440
Where I can say true north revenue for Q3.

301
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,767
Also for forecast Q4, right?

302
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,240
And, and you can literally

303
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,710
imagine what it's doing in the background

304
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,720
is it's kind of going here,

305
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,070
it's going to True North Revenue,

306
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,440
the Wiki article,
it's reading that,

307
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,500
and the Wiki article is
like literally just a wiki.

308
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,710
So it says, you know,
go to this table,

309
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,630
this thing is in Google Drive, it's a PDF,

310
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,990
you have to extract from a
PDF, like subtract adjustments.

311
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,190
What is an adjustment?

312
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,570
Go read up about an adjustment,

313
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,220
learn what an adjustment is.

314
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,893
Read up, read up about all
of these things, right?

315
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,050
And that's kind of what it's doing

316
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,110
for this first step of the plan, right?

317
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,000
In the next, in the next step of it,

318
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,410
what it'll do is it'll

319
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,080
try to read what forecast is, right?

320
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,180
And forecast is a wiki entry that says

321
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,770
do this data sciency thing.

322
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,610
These are the outliers

323
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,380
that you need to think about, whatever.

324
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,690
And these are kind of
progressively maintained.

325
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,880
You can imagine that these are sparse

326
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,350
and they get more and more structured,

327
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,670
they get better and better

328
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,160
as the knowledge accumulates, right?

329
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,240
Whereas initially it's just

330
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,340
basic revenue forecast use this model,

331
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,660
then later somebody used it and said,

332
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,940
Nope, black Friday, bad outlier,

333
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,500
please factor that in.

334
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,270
Maybe a data science expert comes in

335
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,560
and teaches that to you, right?

336
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,290
But that kind of powers the ability

337
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,303
to create an accurate plan, right?

338
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,200
There's kind of another
really important piece here

339
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,470
because the kind of uncertainty
and lack of accuracy

340
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,890
is not just semantics
and business concepts,

341
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,050
but it's also in the details of

342
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,690
fairly specific technical problems, right?

343
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,370
And so what we do is we also surface

344
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,260
the fact that the forecasting methodology

345
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,710
assumes that something
should be consistent, right?

346
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,300
It should assume that there's no refunds.

347
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,190
It is gonna assume that
there's no refunds.

348
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,560
Now, whether or not
that is important to you

349
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,690
is something that you can discuss,

350
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,700
think about, bring in an expert,

351
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,630
and they can say, yeah, you know what?

352
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,640
This assumption was good
or this assumption was bad.

353
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,170
Like, let's not do this again.

354
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,850
And so you teach it, fix it,

355
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,070
and again, kind of the
learning loop improves, right?

356
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,810
The way we think about our product

357
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,170
is that for non-technical
users we surface the wiki.

358
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,410
And for technical experts we
surface it in what we call

359
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,273
the confidence analysis
of the confidence score.

360
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,510
And, and, and users are expected
to think about the wiki,

361
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,940
and experts are expected to
look at the confidence score.

362
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,103
And that creates,
that creates the loop.

363
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,790
So that's, that's kind of a quick look at

364
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,990
at what this looks like.

365
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,103
The, what we've kind of observed,

366
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:01,650
and, and this is kind of our core pitch,

367
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,633
is whatever AI you're using today is,

368
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:08,280
is doomed for failure,
it will fail.

369
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,950
And the reason why it'll fail is because,

370
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,510
a you've, you've probably
not managed to get

371
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,770
a hundred percent of the tribal knowledge

372
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,680
into your AI anyway,
because how can you.

373
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,900
it's not possible if you are a business

374
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,400
of any respectable size,

375
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,510
it's not even possible to try

376
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,860
to embed that tribal knowledge.

377
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,540
And so you're doomed for failure because

378
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,390
not only do you have,
do you not have knowledge,

379
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,250
but you also don't have a system

380
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,920
where people can trust
what your AI is doing.

381
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,390
And, and what we kind of want to get you

382
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,920
on the path for is to say,

383
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,870
it'll always be inaccurate,

384
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,760
can we tell you that it's inaccurate

385
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,380
and then can we learn, right?

386
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,320
And so kind of put you on
this path of actual adaption

387
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,610
and that's kind of what's allowed us

388
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,490
to scale massively, right?

389
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,800
And it's allowed us to focus on solving

390
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,030
interesting technical problems.

391
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,910
Like, for example, the
fact that our AI system

392
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,670
is not restricted by
the size of the schema.

393
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,280
If you look at things like DataBricks,

394
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,160
Genie or Snowflake and Cortex,

395
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,800
they have, you know, 20,
25 tables AI on data,

396
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,310
who has 25 tables dude?
Like who's?

397
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,610
What enterprise has 25
tables that you work on?

398
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,220
It's, it's not, that's not even a problem.

399
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,040
Like that's not even real, right?

400
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,000
And of course it's a problem

401
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,010
because you can't squeeze
that much in context.

402
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,530
So we've kind of focused
on solving problems saying

403
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,560
a hundred thousand tables, 10,000 metrics,

404
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,330
how do you solve for that?

405
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,640
But you can only start to solve for that

406
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,920
once you fix the product loop of saying

407
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,330
whatever the size of your schema is

408
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,760
or whatever the size of the context is,

409
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,243
unless you have that
improvement wrong loop,

410
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:41,130
you, you can't even get to
those interesting problems.

411
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,960
But that's allowed us to scale

412
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,870
since we started early this year across,

413
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:50,250
across a bunch of really
interesting use cases

414
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,360
where there's a lot of high velocity

415
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,010
decision making that's happening.

416
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,673
Come stop by at booth #1733
if you wanna learn more.

417
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,120
We've got a bunch of tech folks,

418
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,620
we've got a bunch of sales folks.

419
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,630
If you wanna buy this and use this,

420
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,740
I will never say no.

421
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,850
But also if you just wanna stop by

422
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,720
exchange notes and learn,

423
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,110
please pop by and,
and we can chat more.

424
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,033
