00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,370
- [Derek] So, hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,370
Welcome to "Accelerate
Multi-step SDLC with Kiro."

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,420
Glad to have you here.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,450
My name's Derek and with me is Kiran,

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,560
and we both work on

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,133
the Developer Agents and
Experiences Team at AWS.

7
00:00:18,562 --> 00:00:20,687
We've both been on the team
for the last year or so.

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,570
It's a really exciting
time to be in the space.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,110
We work with our agentic
software development products,

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,710
including Kiro, and then
customers all around the world

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,263
who are using these products
to develop software.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,650
Our team is former software developers

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,170
that are now engaged with
other software developers

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,440
around the world that are
adopting these products.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,700
I'm curious, show of hands,

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,123
who in the room is a software
developer by profession?

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,073
Okay, yeah, at least maybe half, okay.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,958
Who's vibe coded?

19
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,453
Who's vibe coded before?

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,593
Okay, some of the same
hands, some other hands.

21
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,190
Vibe coding is obviously a hot topic,

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,140
using AI to generate code.

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,350
These tools are getting better
and better all the time.

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,120
And I think vibe coding is a great start,

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,710
but the conversation we're
having a lot with customers is

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,620
beyond using AI to do the build step,

27
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,660
how do I use AI at every step

28
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,190
in the software development lifecycle,

29
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,870
and not just the build step.

30
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,930
So that's the purpose of the talk today.

31
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,400
And this is a coding session,

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,560
so I'm gonna do a little
bit of talking up front.

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,360
Try not to do too much.

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,010
But I just wanna set the
stage for a few things here.

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,260
So we'll talk about the
software development workflow

36
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,370
that we're gonna use,
with agentic tooling.

37
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,900
And then we're gonna
talk a little bit about

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,330
how we compose agents,
what they're made up of,

39
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,220
how the agentic loop works,

40
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,463
and how we can configure them in Kiro CLI.

41
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,440
Very important step, before
we go into actually using AI

42
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,930
for software development workflow.

43
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,410
So we'll do that up front,
and then as quickly as I can,

44
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,780
I'll hand over to Kiran who's gonna do

45
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,757
a bunch of live coding today.

46
00:02:08,757 --> 00:02:10,140
But we're not just gonna write code,

47
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,680
we're gonna start at the
beginning of the SDLC.

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,640
We're gonna do requirements,
we're gonna do system design,

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,260
we're gonna make some decisions,

50
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,580
and eventually we'll write some code

51
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,460
and hopefully we'll have
a working game to play

52
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,200
by the end of the session here.

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,063
Live coding, live AI codings,
always gonna be a fun time.

54
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,700
So just to level set, I think
any of us could draw a picture

55
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,410
of the software development lifecycle,

56
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,617
and there's lots of different
ways we could express it.

57
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,130
And if you ask different folks,

58
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,660
they'll have different opinions about

59
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,310
which steps there should be

60
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,600
and which order they should be in,

61
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,630
and how fast you iterate
on the different steps.

62
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,630
But broadly speaking, we
need to have requirements.

63
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,360
We need to do a system
design, we need to plan,

64
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,780
we need to build, we need
to test, we need to package,

65
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,990
and then we need to deploy and operate.

66
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,690
And when we talk about
vibe coding, in my opinion,

67
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,630
we're really talking about
skipping to the right code step.

68
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,420
Which can be great for prototyping

69
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,590
or for trying something out,

70
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,690
or maybe just scratching
a itch in a language

71
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,430
that you don't know or something.

72
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,480
But when it's time to actually do

73
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,130
professional software development,

74
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,660
we don't wanna skip steps.

75
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,270
And so the question
becomes, how can we use AI

76
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,983
for all of these steps?

77
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,000
There are a few approaches for this.

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,170
We've got two Kiro products
now, we've got the Kiro IDE,

79
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,200
which just went into GA
in the last month or so.

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,510
And then we also have the Kiro CLI,

81
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,520
which we'll be using today.

82
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,140
The approach that we're gonna use

83
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,570
for the live coding session,

84
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,333
you could use in Kiro IDE or Kiro CLI.

85
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,340
This is really a preference thing

86
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,280
in terms of the user
experience that you like.

87
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,020
Kiran and I are both
a bit of console geeks

88
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,090
and so we're gonna invite you all to be

89
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,573
console geeks with us for Kiro CLI today.

90
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,200
So the framework we're
gonna use is called AI-DLC,

91
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,110
and we wanna show one way
that you can approach this.

92
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,520
This is not the only way.

93
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,340
Kiro IDE has spec-driven
development built into it,

94
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,190
and so that's another
way that you can approach

95
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,650
using AI-powered requirements

96
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,900
and system design and planning.

97
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,730
AI-DLC is another way.

98
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,370
It's a little bit more granular

99
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,670
than what you would see in the Kiro IDE.

100
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,880
And this is something that
we've actually open-sourced,

101
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,240
and released on GitHub
in the last week or two.

102
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,780
So we won't go too much
into the details of AI-DLC,

103
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,210
it's gonna be in the background
sort of guiding us along

104
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,800
as we go through the steps.

105
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,690
But we have a slide at the end

106
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,940
that has a QR code and a link.

107
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,990
So if you like what you see

108
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,900
and you'd like to try
out AI-DLC for yourself,

109
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,120
and some of these prompts,
you're welcome to do so,

110
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,073
and we'd love to hear your feedback.

111
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,720
So AI-DLC, roughly speaking,
has this concept of

112
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,370
an inception phase where
we're going through

113
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,800
the requirements and the
design and the planning.

114
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,330
A construction phase,

115
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,640
where we're doing the
building and the packaging.

116
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,140
And then an operation phase.

117
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,360
We're gonna go through the inception

118
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,090
and the construction phase today,

119
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,236
and get hopefully to a working game

120
00:05:14,236 --> 00:05:15,843
by the end of the hour here.

121
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,690
So I wanna spend a few
minutes on agent composition

122
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,763
before we jump into the coding.

123
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,190
So this I think is a
commonly accepted definition

124
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,328
of an agent.

125
00:05:33,328 --> 00:05:35,167
This is Simon Willison's definition.

126
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:39,057
"An LLM agent runs tools in
a loop to achieve a goal."

127
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,070
Very simple.

128
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,320
The simplicity is what we like.

129
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,653
For today's purposes, I'm
gonna modify that a little bit.

130
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,790
And I'm gonna say, an LLM
agent runs tools in a loop,

131
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,570
while building context, to achieve a goal.

132
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,100
And I'll elaborate on
that in a minute here,

133
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,320
but what we're finding is,

134
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,130
managing the context and the
tools are critically important

135
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,810
to getting the results that we want,

136
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,130
out of this agentic software
development process.

137
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,100
If we skip this step, or
if we don't get it right,

138
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,260
we're not gonna get the
results that we want.

139
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,440
So this becomes an important
step in the workflow

140
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,473
to making sure that our agent
is configured correctly.

141
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,450
So here's a diagram, again,

142
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,900
an agentic loop is nice and simple.

143
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,770
The user, in this case
we're using the Kiro CLI,

144
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,140
we're gonna ask it to
do something as input.

145
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,300
It's gonna take that into its context.

146
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,650
We're gonna pass it to the LLM

147
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,230
to decide what to do about our goal.

148
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,977
The LLM is gonna come back and say,

149
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:44,640
"I want to take some action using a tool."

150
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,520
We're gonna go call that
tool, whatever it is.

151
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,290
The tool is gonna return a result,

152
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,120
that goes back into the context,

153
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,017
and we go back to the
agent again and we say,

154
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:54,480
"Okay, we ran the tool.

155
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,010
What would you like to do next?"

156
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,180
We'll keep iterating until
the LLM decides we're done,

157
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,780
and we're ready to give a
response back to the user.

158
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,160
So let's talk about each
of these parts briefly,

159
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,453
starting with LLM.

160
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,860
So for today's purposes,

161
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,190
we are gonna care about applied AI,

162
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,600
and not the gory details
about how LLM works.

163
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,850
So for our purposes today,

164
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,670
I'm not going to try and talk about

165
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,610
the semantic relationships
that are in the model weights,

166
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,400
and n-dimensional vector
space and all that stuff.

167
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,720
I'm sure some of the folks in the room

168
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,570
are experts at this stuff.

169
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,513
What we're gonna say is,
an LLM gives us reasoning.

170
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,200
We could debate the how
it gives us reasoning

171
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,320
or the details, but if we ask
it to reason about something,

172
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,300
it will do that and it will come back,

173
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,450
and come up with an
approach for a problem.

174
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,760
We're also not gonna talk
about auto regression

175
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,950
and multi-head attention
and all that stuff.

176
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,720
What we're gonna say is,

177
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,170
the model has knowledge
embedded into the model weights.

178
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,910
What we would call latent knowledge,

179
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,170
that's been trained into the model

180
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,820
during the pre-training step.

181
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,623
It knows stuff, right?

182
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,180
How it does the recall, we'll
leave for a different session,

183
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,610
but our LLM is gonna give
us the ability to reason,

184
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,620
and it's gonna have latent knowledge.

185
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,423
Facts that it knows about the world.

186
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,480
So that's great, but next
we need working memory,

187
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,670
for the model to be able to
understand what it's doing

188
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,490
and keep track of where we're going.

189
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,990
And that's the context window.

190
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,570
So here's a very simplified
sort of mental model

191
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,440
of the context window.

192
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,320
It's everything that's in the
model's working memory, right?

193
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,960
So starting with system prompts
that are behind the scenes,

194
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,090
guiding the agent's behavior.

195
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,610
Any context files that we've loaded,

196
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,830
we're gonna see example
of that here in a minute.

197
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,450
The history of our chat so far.

198
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,100
So we've opened up our chat window,

199
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,450
we're going back and forth,

200
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,130
working on a problem with the agent.

201
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,170
That's all in the context window.

202
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,465
Any source code that it's
pulled up and looked at,

203
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:03,180
if we're working on an existing project.

204
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,660
The output of all the tools
that we've called so far.

205
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,610
And then hopefully some free space

206
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,990
so that we can keep going.

207
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,450
And so managing this context window

208
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,980
is extremely important for us

209
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,480
to get the results that we want.

210
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,350
If I'm asking the agent to
work with some custom library

211
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,183
that I've developed,

212
00:09:20,183 --> 00:09:22,530
and it doesn't know anything
about that custom library,

213
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,750
we're gonna get a very different result

214
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,630
than if I were to load up the
documentation for that library

215
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,190
into the context window.

216
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,840
So we wanna make sure that
we get this right upfront.

217
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,650
And then finally for this section,

218
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,693
tool selection and tool execution.

219
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,650
MCP has taken over in
the last six months or so

220
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,073
as the defacto standard
for tool use with agents.

221
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,040
For those of you who aren't familiar,

222
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,550
I think of MCP as the
USB protocol for agents.

223
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,550
I can take a plug, it'll
plug into any agent

224
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,550
and it'll let me plug
skills into the agent

225
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,500
so that it learns how to do something new.

226
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,650
It'll let me give it
access to reading resources

227
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,260
from another location that it needs.

228
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,990
And possibly give it the
ability to take action.

229
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,020
So almost like an API
where it can do a mutative

230
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,243
or make a change on another system.

231
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,360
And so getting the MCP tools right, again,

232
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,790
is another critical piece
of getting ready for us

233
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,030
to go do our agentic software development.

234
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,710
If we need access to Jira,

235
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,020
if we need access to our internal wiki,

236
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,840
if we need access to
go search the internet,

237
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,780
we need to make sure that any
of these tools that we need

238
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,253
are plugged in.

239
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,010
So we talked about the agentic loop

240
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,900
and how having the right
LLM model to do reasoning,

241
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,930
the right context window, content,

242
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,820
in order for it to have
that in its working memory,

243
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,730
what it needs to know.

244
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,380
And we talked about having
the right tools plugged in.

245
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,000
These are all the ingredients

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,730
to having the configuration that we need.

247
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,070
So today we're gonna be using Kiro CLI

248
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,100
to do our live coding session.

249
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,430
And in Kiro CLI we have this
concept of a custom agent.

250
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,890
And the custom agent is really a bundle of

251
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,650
all of those things that we can store,

252
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,590
we can share with our teammates,
we can publish internally

253
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,870
if we want other teams
to be able to use it.

254
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,790
We could just save it for ourselves.

255
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,483
But it gives us the ability to
combine our model selection,

256
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,740
what context we want
in the context window.

257
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,360
So system prompt, static
resource files, hooks,

258
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,093
which give us the ability
to do some dynamic context.

259
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,610
And then tools.

260
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,983
Which MCP servers do I want to be using?

261
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,470
Within each MCP server

262
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,720
that could be exposing multiple tools,

263
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,120
which ones do I wanna
allow the agent to use?

264
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,710
Maybe not all of them.

265
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,830
I can alias them if I want
to give them different names.

266
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,810
So all of this goes into one file,

267
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,670
which Kiran will show us here in a minute,

268
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,830
that lets us build our custom agent.

269
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,420
So we're gonna do that first.

270
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,300
Kiran's gonna walk us through
building our custom agent

271
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,010
and then we'll come back briefly

272
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,473
and talk about what we're gonna go build.

273
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,753
So with that.

274
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,080
Kiran, over to you.

275
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,153
- [Kiran] Thanks everyone.

276
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:27,517
Not sure that's worked yet.

277
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,350
- The joys of a live demo.
- Yeah.

278
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,183
Good fun

279
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:41,070
Demo.

280
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,380
- I saw a flicker.
- Yeah.

281
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,630
Worked two seconds before
we started as well.

282
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,800
Do you want me to unplug
and plug it again?

283
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,633
Yeah.

284
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:55,800
There we go.
- Hey, there we go!

285
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,650
- [Kiran] Reboot.

286
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,673
Okay.

287
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,130
All right, so the first
thing, hi everyone.

288
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,050
So the first thing we're gonna do today is

289
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,340
configure the custom agent.

290
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,710
And so you can see exactly
what Derek was talking about

291
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,090
on those slides.

292
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,483
So diving right in, I'm just
gonna go straight into Kiro,

293
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:15,660
there we go, into the Kiro CLI.

294
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,740
And as Derek mentioned,

295
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,410
we have an IDE that you could use as well,

296
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,283
but for the purposes of this,
we're gonna use the Kiro CLI.

297
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,920
So the first thing we're gonna do, I was,

298
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,480
we're gonna configure our custom agent

299
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,820
before we actually go
ahead and build a game.

300
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,393
So in order to do that,
I'm gonna go agent.

301
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,530
List out the agents that we've got.

302
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,030
So when you first start off,

303
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,270
you have a Kiro default agent
you can see there in green.

304
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,280
And then I've got a Flappy Kiro agent here

305
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,640
that I've built
specifically for this demo.

306
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,193
But if you wanna build your
own, you just go agent, oops.

307
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,403
So it's agent and then it's create.

308
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,270
Give it a name and we're
gonna call this demo agent 1.

309
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,860
Now this is your agent configuration file.

310
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,740
This one's empty, I'll
show you the populated one

311
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,850
in just a second.

312
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,890
But this is where you'll
configure all those things

313
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,350
Derek told you about, your MCP servers,

314
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,740
the tools that your MCP
servers have access to.

315
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,870
And we should have called
out the acronym on first use,

316
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,220
I don't think we did, a
model context protocol.

317
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,240
The tool aliases, as Derek mentioned,

318
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,540
in case you want to give
those a differentiating name.

319
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,240
The tools that your
agents are allowed to use,

320
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,920
and the different resources.

321
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,250
So what we'll do is we'll
quit out of here and show you

322
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,917
what that looks like.

323
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,706
Oops.

324
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:47,873
Got the prompt saved here.

325
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:50,962
Thought I had.

326
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:51,962
There we go.

327
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:53,884
Wrong one.

328
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,630
There we go, sorry about that.

329
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,390
So for this particular agent,

330
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,000
we've got a couple of
MCP servers configured.

331
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,740
So I've got a Mermaid MCP server,

332
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,007
so that's gonna help us build
diagrams for the requirements

333
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:16,020
and the business requirements
that we're gonna do,

334
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,300
as well as the implementation plan.

335
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,010
I have a fetch MCP server

336
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,050
to go and fetch things
off the internet for us.

337
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,020
And that's 'cause when we
build the Flappy Kiro game,

338
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,330
I want it to be able to
go and fetch AWS services

339
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,163
from the internet,

340
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:32,430
and use that instead of a
normal Flappy Bird game,

341
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,500
and make that a little
bit more interesting.

342
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,710
Maybe use a Halloween
and a Vegas type theme.

343
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,760
So I've got some tools that
I've got loaded here as well.

344
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,220
Some faster, some read
and write tools as well.

345
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,460
And the reason for not putting all tools

346
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,970
that the MCP server has access
to is, as Derek mentioned,

347
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,130
you've only got a certain amount of space

348
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,540
in your contacts window.

349
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,580
So you don't wanna overwhelm the agent

350
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,590
with tools that it doesn't need.

351
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,990
So I've locked it down
just for specific tools,

352
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,760
for it to do that with.

353
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,360
And then I've got under the
resources, the AI-DLC workflow.

354
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,030
And as we mentioned, we'll
link that in a QR code

355
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,940
towards the end of the presentation.

356
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,360
But it'll give you a list of
all the different components

357
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,900
of the AI-DLC, all the
different questions and answers

358
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,970
and how it all works throughout there.

359
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,820
So I've told the agent to be
able to access that as well

360
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,000
for the purposes of building this out.

361
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,950
And then hooks, as we mentioned earlier,

362
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,600
that's something for you to,

363
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,730
for the agent to take action on.

364
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,520
So really good for sort of
CI/CD pipeline type things

365
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,900
that you might be doing.

366
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,670
We're not gonna do
anything for that in here.

367
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,120
We're just going to focus
on using the MCP servers

368
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,303
and the AI-DLC and the
resources configured with that.

369
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,843
So with that, I'm gonna
switch to my agent.

370
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,780
And we're gonna select that one

371
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,390
and that's gonna give us the
agent that we're gonna use

372
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,640
to actually build out the game.

373
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,780
So.

374
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,150
- [Derek] Yep, thanks Kiran and, you know,

375
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,830
just to emphasize,

376
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,590
this is a relatively
simple thing to configure,

377
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,270
but by pulling in those resource files,

378
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,810
we're gonna dramatically alter
the behavior of the agent,

379
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,920
as you'll see in a minute here,

380
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,630
from what we would get by default.

381
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,520
And so there's a lot
of power under the hood

382
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,300
that we can have here, by
developing custom workflows,

383
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,030
specific ways that we
want the agent to work.

384
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,940
And that's something that
teams can work together on

385
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,350
and refine over time.

386
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,320
And we're seeing libraries of
these emerge within customers,

387
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,820
as the different teams kind of

388
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,610
maybe build their own repo internally,

389
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,500
just to refine these files,

390
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,390
get these better and better over time.

391
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,680
So there's a lot that you can do here

392
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,953
by just loading in a few
context files and a few tools.

393
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,540
So we're gonna spend the rest
of the time here building,

394
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,170
and the goal here is to build
a game called Flappy Kiro,

395
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,700
by the end of the session.

396
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,080
We'll see how it goes, it's live,

397
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,950
so we have some backup
plans in case things,

398
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,000
we have some kind of problem,

399
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,073
but I'll try not to jinx us here.

400
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:14,030
Flappy Kiro is a game where Kiro the,

401
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,560
or I think his name is
Ghostie actually, we decided.

402
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,985
- Yeah, Flappy Ghostie.
- Okay.

403
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:20,610
So Ghostie is going to
be able to scroll through

404
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,980
a side scrolling game, and
when we push space bar,

405
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,330
he'll flap up in the air.

406
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,250
When we let go of the
space bar he'll drop down.

407
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,743
And he's gotta avoid
obstacles and get a score.

408
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,120
The point here is less about
the implementation details

409
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,740
that we pick, or what language,

410
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,800
or hopefully the game actually works,

411
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,360
and whether it's good or not.

412
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,080
What we really want to do
is focus on the workflow,

413
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,380
and focus on how we can use
AI from the very beginning

414
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,350
to help us get our
requirements and our design,

415
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,380
and our thinking about
our plan and our testing

416
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,880
and everything that we need to do,

417
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,090
in order to build
production grade software.

418
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,727
So while we're not building
production grade software today,

419
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:03,720
and we're gonna sort of speed
through some of the steps,

420
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,950
I hope that you walk away today
maybe inspired a little bit

421
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,380
to go try some of these
techniques yourselves,

422
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,940
and try doing an end-to-end, you know,

423
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,940
task or story from your
backlog, using this process

424
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,853
and using AI from the very
beginning of your project.

425
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:30,300
So anything else I should do
to tee up Flappy Kiro here?

426
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,370
I think it's a pretty straightforward game

427
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,773
and we'll get into some
of the details here.

428
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,606
- [Kiran] Yeah, yeah.

429
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:35,670
We're gonna try and get it to work on here

430
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,840
as well as on mobile phone.

431
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,850
So we'll switch to the development tools

432
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,440
and see if it works on a mobile.

433
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,240
But I'll try and get it to work first

434
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,073
and then we'll go from there.

435
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:44,933
- [Derek] All right,
let's see how we get on.

436
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,630
- Okay.
- Let's see if this works.

437
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,560
Oh great.
- Yeah, it did.

438
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,420
Okay, so to build this, we're
gonna just use one prompt.

439
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,860
So this is the prompt I'm gonna use.

440
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,140
I'm gonna walk, spend a little
bit of time going through it.

441
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,360
So the goal is not to do
any prompt engineering

442
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,460
or have any secret sauce baked into this.

443
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,200
We're gonna have one clear prompt

444
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,660
and then we're gonna go
through the AI-DLC process,

445
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,470
which has been shortened to
fit into the session today.

446
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,380
So the first thing we're
gonna do is we're gonna use,

447
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,910
Derek mentioned in the presentation,

448
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,430
a lot of the LLM's trained, you know,

449
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,130
latent knowledge that it's
got when it was trained.

450
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,930
So a lot of this it's aware of,

451
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,510
and it can actually make a lot
of assumptions based on this,

452
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,820
but we still want to guide
it with proper requirements,

453
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,520
business requirements, you
know, functional requirements,

454
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,970
non-functional requirements,
and then implementation plans.

455
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,200
So the first thing is,

456
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,180
I'm gonna say I wanna
build a browser based game

457
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,210
called Flappy Kiro, for a
live demo at AWS re:Invent.

458
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,930
We're gonna follow the AI-DLC
methodology and workflow

459
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,950
and we're gonna ask the LLM
to ask us clarifying questions

460
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,220
so that it can then provide
the answers as inputs

461
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,303
for each phase.

462
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,480
I want to show you some Mermaid diagrams

463
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,610
so when it actually builds
out the file structure

464
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,840
and the implementation plan,

465
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,310
you can see what that looks like.

466
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,050
And if you look in the IDE,

467
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,660
it actually gives you a
really good visual of that.

468
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,190
Because we're doing this in the CLI,

469
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,790
I'm just gonna use a Mermaid
webpage that we've got,

470
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,680
and we'll show you all
the architecture diagrams

471
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,480
that it does.

472
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,280
So we've streamlined the process,

473
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,050
obviously to fit into the session today.

474
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,340
When we run this with our customers,

475
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,820
it's usually a one-day
workshop, sometimes two.

476
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,760
But we're gonna get this
to work in 45 minutes.

477
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,660
And then we're gonna maintain

478
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,630
interactive questions and
answering throughout the process.

479
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,630
And we wanna save the files
in the working directory

480
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,190
so it doesn't put it everywhere.

481
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,690
So I'm being quite specific with it,

482
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,570
but we still have to, we're still gonna do

483
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,310
quite a bit of guidance and give it themes

484
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,272
and everything like that.

485
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:41,324
- [Audience Member] Are
you taking questions

486
00:21:41,324 --> 00:21:42,741
as you go or not?

487
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,580
- [Derek] The question was,

488
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,230
are we using questions as you go?

489
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,752
- [Audience Member] Are you
gonna take questions or not?

490
00:21:47,752 --> 00:21:49,260
- [Derek] Take questions as we go.

491
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,580
I think while the agent is thinking,

492
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,080
I think we'll have some time.

493
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,310
Yeah.

494
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,450
- [Kiran] Especially
through the build phase,

495
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,100
it takes a good five, seven minutes.

496
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,933
- Yeah.
- So we can

497
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:00,766
take some time then.

498
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:01,599
Okay.

499
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,810
So we're gonna go ahead and execute this,

500
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,393
and fingers crossed.

501
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,330
So the first stage is gonna
be the analysis phase,

502
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,640
or we're gonna gather
all the requirements.

503
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,600
In the real world,

504
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,700
this will be your business
requirements that you might have

505
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,680
within your organization.

506
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,530
Give this agent permission to do that.

507
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,260
So it'll be things like, you know,

508
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,690
what sort of third-party
systems do you need to use,

509
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,770
what sort of logging or anything like that

510
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,603
that you might have,

511
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:35,010
if you have any security
postures that you need to follow,

512
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:35,843
things like that.

513
00:22:35,843 --> 00:22:38,280
That will be part of your
business requirements.

514
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,743
So here we go, it's gone and created a,

515
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,610
and I will make this bigger.

516
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,570
And if anyone has any suggestions
we can take them as well,

517
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,670
as we go through this,
otherwise it'll just be me

518
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,041
filling these out as we go along.

519
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,200
And as Derek mentioned,
each time we run this,

520
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,243
we get a slightly different result,

521
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:00,630
so it's not always the same.

522
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,850
The questions do come
back a bit different.

523
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,640
But when you use the full
AI-DLC, you get very specific

524
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,150
and then you tend to get
the correct response.

525
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,356
- [Derek] Just to
elaborate, if I can, Kiran.

526
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,360
- [Kiran] Yeah.

527
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,530
- [Derek] I think what we find
is that the frontier models,

528
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,777
the LLMs, they're eager to please, right?

529
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:22,800
And so if we're vibe coding,
often the model will sort of

530
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,840
take what you've asked it to
do and start running with it,

531
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,610
and start building stuff,

532
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,890
rather than sort of stepping
back and thinking critically,

533
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,140
like, you know, maybe a senior
engineer might step back

534
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,700
and say, "Hey, before we build this,

535
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,070
I've got like 15 questions about,

536
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,150
what did you think about security?

537
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,080
Did you think about this?"

538
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,520
You know, "What about
this edge case, right?"

539
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,380
And that's kind of the conversation

540
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,490
that we want to be having.

541
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,660
And so really what we've got
loaded into the context here

542
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,557
is a lot of specific instructions saying,

543
00:23:47,557 --> 00:23:49,830
"Hey, don't skip any of these steps."

544
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,270
If we don't know the answer yet,

545
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,700
let's get the answer
before we keep moving.

546
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,517
And so the first step here
where we've told Kiro,

547
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:59,580
"Hey, I wanna build this thing."

548
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,740
Is, okay, I've got a bunch of questions,

549
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,440
please answer those for
me before we continue.

550
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,330
So we'll fill those out here,

551
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,930
but it should keep asking
us until it's clear.

552
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,310
- [Kiran] Yeah, exactly, yeah.

553
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,760
And these questions are predefined ones.

554
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,470
This isn't like a final list.

555
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,150
If you have something
when you're doing this

556
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,140
for an enterprise app,

557
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,580
you can go and actually
put those in there.

558
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,590
So if there's a question
you feel that your,

559
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,930
hasn't, you know, met
your organization's needs,

560
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,270
that's something that you
can just insert in there too.

561
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,760
It doesn't have to be, it won't freak out.

562
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,110
And I'll show you an example of that.

563
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,300
So the way I answer these questions,

564
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,280
I'm supposed to fill them in down here.

565
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,600
I'm just gonna say yes no,

566
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,790
and then for this one I'll fill
them out all then down here

567
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,250
for question two, and we'll
go through it like that

568
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,560
and see how the agent deals with that.

569
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,660
So for the first question,

570
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,230
we want it to continuously
fly and, or it says,

571
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:53,520
or only when clicking, when
pressing the space bar.

572
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,903
So I'll say, yeah.

573
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,193
Press, I'll just say a button.

574
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,990
Press a button to fly.

575
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,980
And then for the easy,
difficult, easy, medium or hard,

576
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,980
I'm gonna say, easy has larger, yeah,

577
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:18,170
I could say larger obstacle gaps.

578
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:24,260
Getting harder as the game progresses.

579
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,640
There we go.

580
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,160
And should the game
speed increase over time,

581
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,710
I'll just give that a flat yes.

582
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,300
This takes quite a bit of time

583
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,680
when you're building
out an enterprise app,

584
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,290
but hopefully we'll get
through this quite quickly.

585
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,290
So then we get to the
visual styles of this too.

586
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,080
So what I wanna do is, I'll
change this a little bit.

587
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,040
We're gonna use say maybe
some of the AWS colors.

588
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,130
I'll go with orange and black.

589
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,163
I'll go with a Halloween theme,
it was recently Halloween.

590
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:01,560
And say Las Vegas theme as well.

591
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,210
Let's see how it deals with that.

592
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:08,730
A lot of typos there.

593
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,863
Okay, do you want the Kiro character

594
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:12,900
to be a simple shape,
sprite, or custom design?

595
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,100
So Kiro is a ghost, so we
wanna use a, it's like purple,

596
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,903
purple ghost character.

597
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,520
Should the obstacles be
classic, you know, the classic,

598
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,900
obviously it's got that latent knowledge,

599
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,880
it knows exactly what that game is.

600
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,243
So let's go with AWS-themed,

601
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,120
and it's got that from
the prompt that we did

602
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,940
saying that we're doing an
AWS re:Invent presentation.

603
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,900
And then we wanna say use say AI

604
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,583
and coding services from AWS.

605
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,033
There we go.

606
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:55,260
And then scoring and leaderboard.

607
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,410
What kind of scoring
features would you like?

608
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,540
I'll take suggestions, if
you wanna shout 'em out,

609
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,030
otherwise I'll just fill these in.

610
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,430
So we'll, so simple score,

611
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,990
or do you want to use a leaderboard?

612
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,850
So we'll just go with simple for now.

613
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,260
And then here we're just
gonna use local storage,

614
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,360
'cause we don't have anything
like that configured.

615
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,993
And then in the real world,
obviously it's looking for,

616
00:27:17,993 --> 00:27:19,476
you know, if you're using an API gateway,

617
00:27:19,476 --> 00:27:21,050
you can use something like CloudFront.

618
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,490
If you want this game
to be globally available

619
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,770
closer to your customers
in different regions.

620
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,200
That's something you'd specify over here.

621
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,750
For the purposes of this,
we're gonna do this.

622
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,310
We'll say yes to that.

623
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,057
And then how long do you want it to be?

624
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:40,057
I'll just go one to two
minutes and say yes to that.

625
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:46,263
And on a mobile phone.

626
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,663
Test that towards the end.

627
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,190
- [Derek] I like the ambition level here.

628
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,023
- [Kiran] Yeah!

629
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:02,040
- [Derek] You're adding a lot of features.

630
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,170
- [Kiran] HTML and Java.

631
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,290
Let's use those two for
the purpose of this.

632
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,960
Single file, I think
we'll use multiple files,

633
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,470
'cause I wanna have
proper structure for this.

634
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,800
So in case we need to go
back and change something,

635
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,140
or we want to document any of
these decisions and come back

636
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,510
and ask why we did that,
it's all nicely documented.

637
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,390
So I'll go with multiple files for.

638
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,910
- [Audience Member]
You've got a typo of HTML.

639
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:25,200
- [Kiran] Yeah, yeah.

640
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,033
Good catch.

641
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:28,593
It's pretty good at picking
up all my bad typos, so.

642
00:28:30,152 --> 00:28:30,985
(indistinct)

643
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:31,818
Yeah.

644
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,430
I'll see how it deals with
that one, I'll leave it alone.

645
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,800
Any AWS services we wanna showcase?

646
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,960
Anything, should we do that, should we do,

647
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,310
I don't think it knows about Kiro yet.

648
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,590
Mind you, it's got that
MCP survey to go and fetch,

649
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,423
fetch, things like that.

650
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:47,504
- [Derek] I'm a proud WorkMail
user, but it's probably not.

651
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:49,350
- [Kiran] WorkMail.

652
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,183
So that's-
- Probably not

653
00:28:50,183 --> 00:28:51,510
appropriate here.
- Amplify.

654
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,948
- Sorry?
- Amplify.

655
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:53,936
- Amplify?
- Amplify.

656
00:28:53,936 --> 00:28:55,020
Okay.
- We can do that.

657
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,780
Let's see what it does there,
and I'll put maybe Bedrock,

658
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,580
since it's gonna be running on that.

659
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,353
Okay.

660
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:06,690
Let's try those and then
start screen instructions.

661
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,883
So we say, yes with.

662
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:17,700
- [Derek] I would just suggest, Kiran,

663
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,720
for Amplify and Bedrock,

664
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,500
maybe just make a note that
we need a way to test locally.

665
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,640
- [Kiran] Okay.

666
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,960
- [Derek] Since we're not gonna have time

667
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,060
to deploy to an AWS environment, so.

668
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,893
- [Kiran] Yeah.

669
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,840
- Cool.
- Okay.

670
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,490
Restart button.

671
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,280
Just say yes and then we'll
move on to the next phase.

672
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,273
Mobile support.

673
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:45,110
Sorry, support for
mobile browsers I think.

674
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,620
And then maybe wanna use
maybe Chrome and Firefox.

675
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,450
I think those are the two
commonly most used ones.

676
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,027
Chrome and Firefox.

677
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:54,927
Okay, great.

678
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:55,760
And that's it.

679
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,393
So we'll go ahead and save that.

680
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,257
Close that up and then we can say done.

681
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,120
And again, I'm still
using that single prompt

682
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,520
and it should now go
ahead, read those answers,

683
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,900
and come back and start
building out the design phase.

684
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,880
And the whole purpose of this is

685
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,160
we're bringing the agent and the LLM

686
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,900
into the decision-making process.

687
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,930
So yeah, saving, sorry about that.

688
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,103
Saving a lot of time.

689
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,030
- [Derek] And just to note
that we were just doing

690
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,210
a lot of what I would call
classic product manager work

691
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,880
and less software development.

692
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,440
But it's very important obviously,

693
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,200
and one thing that we're finding is that

694
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,840
getting together cross-functional teams

695
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,300
that maybe might not work
together next to each other

696
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,940
day by day, but getting
the product managers

697
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,270
and the stakeholders along
with the software developers,

698
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,310
maybe QA, Ops, right?

699
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,050
Getting that cross-functional team

700
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,090
that's gonna be
responsible for this thing,

701
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,150
sometimes physically together,
or at least on the same call,

702
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,180
and working together on
answering these questions,

703
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,750
can help teams get this right upfront

704
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,700
and skip a lot of back and forth

705
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,750
that we might traditionally do,

706
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,210
where we need to email or
cut a ticket to someone

707
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,227
to find out.

708
00:31:10,227 --> 00:31:13,560
And so if we're able to do
this collaboratively upfront,

709
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,990
we can dramatically cut down
on the time needed for us

710
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,493
to get all of this right.

711
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,050
And the agent in this
case is really our helper

712
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,690
to make sure that we're
documenting it properly.

713
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,980
- [Kiran] Yeah.

714
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,813
Yeah, thanks.

715
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:30,690
So now we're moving on from what to build

716
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,740
and now we're going on to

717
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,570
how we're actually gonna
go ahead and build that.

718
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,420
So it's taken some of the
suggestions of SageMaker, Amplify,

719
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,930
saw that there, and Bedrock,
and now it's gonna come through

720
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,120
and ask us, you know, "How
are we gonna do these?"

721
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,770
And if you think about,
these are now your more,

722
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,880
your technical requirements.

723
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,460
We've defined the business
requirements in the first phase.

724
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,190
We're moving on to more of
the technical stuff right now.

725
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,520
So earlier on in here, it's given us,

726
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,190
using that agent that we configured.

727
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,020
We told it to have the Mermaid MCP server.

728
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,430
It's gone in and actually built out

729
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,620
some Mermaid diagrams for us.

730
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,080
So I'll show you what that looks like.

731
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,550
Hopefully that looks good on the screen.

732
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,570
There we go.

733
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,930
So it's actually already
documented and drawn out

734
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,610
what it thinks this is gonna look like.

735
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,440
And do you remember that one prompt?

736
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,000
Did you want everything in a single file

737
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,110
or do you want it split up?

738
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,210
And it's gone ahead and
split that up for us as well,

739
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,280
with specific files for different things.

740
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,180
So we have JavaScript
files and HTML files,

741
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,493
so you can go in and make changes later.

742
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,960
So this is really useful
for things like that too.

743
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,093
So just, sorry.

744
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,190
I'll come back there.

745
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,530
Okay, and then if we look over here,

746
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,630
so let's have a look at this one here too.

747
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,010
It shows you the different components

748
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,260
that we've got over here.

749
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,890
Sorry, I left my mouse at home.

750
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,740
Would've been a bit easier with that.

751
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,953
There we go.

752
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:03,570
So it's showing you the
different, you know,

753
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,130
the different layers it's gonna build out

754
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,131
and how that's gonna look.

755
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:08,010
Does that look good on the screen?

756
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:08,843
Go a bit bigger.

757
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,860
So we found this really, really useful.

758
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,360
Our customers have told us that, you know,

759
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,030
this saves a lot of time
with the documentation and,

760
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,680
you know, and how that's gonna look.

761
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,513
And they can use that

762
00:33:23,513 --> 00:33:25,260
for all their different
change controls and, you know,

763
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,660
when they submitted tickets
to have this all built out.

764
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,640
So we're getting all of that.

765
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,260
Remember I said local storage only.

766
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,000
We're not gonna deploy
that to anything else.

767
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,620
So that's that over there.

768
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,900
We already talked about how
we're gonna do the obstacles,

769
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,970
it's gone and filled all
that in, the scoring.

770
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,460
I said do that as we pass the obstacles,

771
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,710
and the difficulty controller,

772
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,870
from the easy, medium and hard.

773
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,770
So all of that's all in there already.

774
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,743
Okay, so let's go back
in and fill out that,

775
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,823
fill out the rest of that for
the technical requirements.

776
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,020
Okay, so the first question it's got is,

777
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,050
which AI coding services
should appear as obstacles?

778
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:09,050
So I'm just gonna say, use
all and use them randomly.

779
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,590
How should the difficulty levels differ?

780
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,420
Now I've found, when I've
been building this out,

781
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:22,080
testing this, is it usually,
the gravity is way too strong.

782
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,030
So the bird just falls like a stone,

783
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,000
no matter how quickly
I press the space bar.

784
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,610
And the gaps are way too short,

785
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,250
so I can never get past the
first couple of hurdles.

786
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,830
So I might go in here
from my previous knowledge

787
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,430
and tell it to be a little
bit better with that.

788
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:43,430
So I'll say start slower,
larger gaps, and less gravity.

789
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,873
And then I wanna use it to
use 60 frames per second.

790
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,390
And then, now we've got the visuals.

791
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,660
So shall I generate a simple CSS canvas,

792
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,940
or do we have any image assets?

793
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,220
I start with a normal simple CSS canvas,

794
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,590
but then you can go back in,
download specific assets,

795
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:13,230
or any audio images that
you've got for the game,

796
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,190
and you can put that in.

797
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,350
But it does a pretty
good job of filling the,

798
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,360
just, you know, coming
up with stuff itself.

799
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,643
So we'll go with CSS.

800
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,970
And then ghost animation,

801
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,760
do you want a static,
bobbing, flapping wings?

802
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,160
Let's animate the ghost

803
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,443
when it's flying.

804
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,690
Let's use official AWS icons.

805
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,070
I don't think it's gonna
be able to do that,

806
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,210
unless we actually give it to them,

807
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,890
but it's gonna try and draw them up

808
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,773
and typically it uses emojis
or something like that too.

809
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,323
Sound effects.

810
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:58,370
I'll just say use all suggested effects,

811
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,830
just with interests of time.

812
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,493
Here we go.

813
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:06,540
And then this question here,
the Bedrock integration.

814
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,880
How should Amazon Bedrock be integrated?

815
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,080
Dynamically, AI-powered,
difficulty adjustments, generate.

816
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,370
What do you think?

817
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,449
This is quite interesting.

818
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:17,070
- [Derek] I think those are all future-

819
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,903
- [Kiran] Yeah.

820
00:36:17,903 --> 00:36:19,159
- enhancements, right?
- Yeah.

821
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,760
- [Derek] So it probably
doesn't matter for this demo.

822
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,593
- [Kiran] Yeah.

823
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,840
And then here's the file
structure that it's gonna go ahead

824
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,673
and create for you.

825
00:36:31,673 --> 00:36:33,630
So instead of creating that one big file,

826
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,470
you saw that diagram,

827
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,470
it's gonna go ahead and
break these down for you

828
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,310
in the different files
that you're gonna use.

829
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,050
And that means you can come back in

830
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,120
and put in your own
images and your own sounds

831
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,830
when you want it to do so.

832
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,763
I'll just say.

833
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,313
Okay.

834
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,060
And then let me just hit that.

835
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,160
- [Derek] So again,
we're almost kind of like

836
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,270
speed running through

837
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,103
these steps.
- Yeah.

838
00:37:22,103 --> 00:37:23,850
- [Derek] And almost vibe
coding in a way, right,

839
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,480
by not engaging more here and
doing a much richer discussion

840
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,410
in the interest of time.

841
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,650
But, you know, again, I
think you can imagine,

842
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,762
this is where I, in my opinion,

843
00:37:33,762 --> 00:37:36,210
the interesting work is gonna happen

844
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,670
is around these decisions
that we're making

845
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,050
around technology selection,

846
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,260
and what should we do first
and what can, you know,

847
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,050
what's a P0 versus a P1 feature and

848
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,573
what's our architecture gonna look like?

849
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:53,160
You know, this is where we, as humans,

850
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,690
should be spending our time.

851
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,030
And if we get this right up front,

852
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,060
the actual implementation
phase is almost the easy part,

853
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,680
hopefully, because we've already done

854
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,630
all of this hard work upfront.

855
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,630
And so if you're not already,
I would encourage you,

856
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,940
if you try out AI-DLC, you know,

857
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,880
spend a good amount of time
upfront in these phases.

858
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,890
Get this as refined as you can.

859
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,343
And then see how the implementation
step works out for you.

860
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:20,190
- [Audience Member] How
did you get to this phases

861
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,372
just by saying I wanted AI-DLC?

862
00:38:22,372 --> 00:38:25,500
- [Derek] Yeah, so we'll link
at the end to the GitHub repo,

863
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,320
but our teams have put
a good amount of work

864
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,550
over the last few months,

865
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,320
again working with lots
of different customers

866
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,970
to refine this.

867
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,060
We're using conditional context loading

868
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,510
because we have a finite
amount of context window space.

869
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,270
There's an initial context
file that we loaded

870
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,457
that kind of kicks off things
with the agent and tells it,

871
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:47,370
"Hey, you're using this workflow,

872
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,770
you're gonna use these
various specific steps."

873
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,300
And then depending on what you're doing,

874
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,070
if you're doing greenfield

875
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,530
or if you're extending
an existing application,

876
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,540
if you wanna do microservices,

877
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,640
there's a bunch of decision
trees that it'll make

878
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,380
and say, oh we're using,

879
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,660
we're going to extend
the legacy application.

880
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,660
It'll actually load in
additional instruction sets

881
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,620
to make sure that we're doing
things in an orderly way.

882
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,000
So there's a lot behind the scenes here

883
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,210
that's getting loaded in as needed.

884
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,440
- [Audience Member] Is that
markdown files referenced

885
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
in the agent?

886
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,400
- [Derek] Yep, yep.

887
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,280
There's just the one markdown
file is the entry point

888
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,740
and it has instructions that says

889
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,450
conditionally load these other files,

890
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,340
depending on what you're doing.

891
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:30,570
We found that approach works
well to keep the context window

892
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,923
not too busy.

893
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:34,724
- [Kiran] Yeah, and then to your point,

894
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:36,690
the other thing you can do is
you can have different agents

895
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,670
for different phases of
your development as well.

896
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,380
So, you know, if you're
doing front end development,

897
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,450
backend development, you
can have different agents

898
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,300
with different MCP servers,
different resources.

899
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,800
And that way you can do,

900
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,900
and they can just switch
between those agents

901
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,220
as easily as I showed you there.

902
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,480
And, yeah.

903
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,760
And that way that's a good way
of getting your project done

904
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,140
without loading everything up.

905
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,800
So, yeah.

906
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,830
Okay, so now this is
the part where we move

907
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,080
to the actual implementation phase.

908
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,330
Still haven't written any
code yet, but now we're gonna,

909
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,210
you know, this thing, you can
start having it cut, you know,

910
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,200
Jira tickets for you,

911
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,910
and you can have your
junior developers go ahead

912
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,490
and run this, based on
the architecture diagrams

913
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:15,180
that your senior developers
or Kiro has built for you.

914
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,140
So again, we are just gonna
go through these real quick

915
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,180
and see what we can get from all of it.

916
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,689
So approved to implement, yes,
we're just gonna go through

917
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:28,863
the resolution size, link
all the modules together.

918
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,130
And then here if you
have any specific styling

919
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,950
that your organization might
use, this is a, you know,

920
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,270
a good place where you can do that

921
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,220
if you're building an enterprise app.

922
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,350
So that's something you
can do there as well.

923
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,490
And if there's anything, you know,

924
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,650
you'd be sitting with different
teams across your business

925
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,330
going through all of this and figuring out

926
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:48,060
is this the right thing to do
if it's not captured in here.

927
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,290
You can obviously add it in there

928
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,243
and change some of those files as well.

929
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,180
And we'll go through that as well.

930
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,200
Yeah.

931
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,450
So we are gonna use JavaScript and HTML,

932
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,280
I think we decided that was
gonna be the best thing,

933
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,979
so we're just gonna go ahead with that.

934
00:41:00,979 --> 00:41:02,670
It's just asking for
that final verification

935
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,083
before we do anything.

936
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,920
- [Audience Member] Are there
any Jira MCPs or integrations?

937
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,733
- [Derek] Yep.

938
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:11,760
There is a Jira MCP,

939
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,770
and so I was just thinking
the same thing, like,

940
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,350
once you get to this
step, in the real world,

941
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,350
each of these might be more
complicated and take more time.

942
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,590
So you can imagine each
of these becoming a story

943
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,270
that goes onto the Jira board

944
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,707
and gets pulled down for sure.

945
00:41:25,707 --> 00:41:28,260
And that could be as simple
as us taking this file

946
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,620
and saying, hey, go create
Jira stories for each of these.

947
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,453
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

948
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,220
- [Kiran] I'll be
honest, this is different

949
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,690
from the other ones that I've done before.

950
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,190
Normally it's another bunch of questions,

951
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,720
but here it's just basically saying,

952
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,190
you've provided me enough,

953
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,990
and just give me the
verification for that.

954
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,003
So just answering, yes.

955
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,420
We'll have a look at this
diagram that it's given us.

956
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,520
This should be the implementation diagram.

957
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,573
It didn't grab everything
there, for some reason.

958
00:42:06,177 --> 00:42:07,090
I thought I had it all.

959
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,013
Yeah, I did.

960
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,000
Didn't like that.

961
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,503
Try it once more.

962
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,380
- [Derek] I suggest, Kiran,
in the interest of time,

963
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,370
that we-
- Yeah, we are

964
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,953
running short, okay.
- Keep going.

965
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,810
- [Kiran] Okay, and you can
see when it gets to this part,

966
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,160
the agent's already thinking about

967
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,690
how it's gonna generate the testing.

968
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,430
So it's gonna have functional testing

969
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,600
and any sort of unit testing

970
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,490
and stuff you might
wanna do for your code.

971
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,400
It'll generate that in the next phase too.

972
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,570
But it's already thinking ahead,

973
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,400
how am I gonna test this end to end?

974
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,480
You know, this is quite a, you know,

975
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,420
obviously the different, I've
said to it, use, you know,

976
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,230
Firefox and Chrome because
it's gonna go on mobile phones.

977
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:51,609
It figured that some people
are gonna have iPhones

978
00:42:51,609 --> 00:42:54,360
and it's put Safari in there
as well, which is great.

979
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,379
Chrome mobile, Chrome desktop.

980
00:42:56,379 --> 00:42:58,893
So yeah, so we'll go ahead and save that.

981
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:02,882
And.

982
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,770
Okay, now it's gonna go ahead and create

983
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,710
all the different files for us,

984
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,240
to actually build the project up.

985
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,577
And there we go, it's gonna
create the assets file,

986
00:43:26,577 --> 00:43:28,680
the CSS files, the JavaScript files,

987
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,050
and hopefully we'll get a working game.

988
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,790
So this is where it takes a few minutes,

989
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,830
five or seven minutes if it works, so.

990
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,100
- [Derek] And we spend a
lot of time on requirements,

991
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:42,210
design, technology
selection, not coding, right?

992
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,270
We've got 16 minutes left in the hour.

993
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,180
We'll see how we get on.

994
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,520
But again, this is sort of the,

995
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,990
almost the opposite of vibe
coding and starting with build.

996
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,640
And this was really the thing
that we wanted to impart is,

997
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,150
it's time well spent doing this upfront.

998
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,953
AI-DLC is one framework.

999
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,940
Again, there are other approaches.

1000
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,950
You could build something yourself,

1001
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,540
you might consider forking what we've got,

1002
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,890
if you're interested.

1003
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:15,330
In fact, send us a merge request

1004
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:19,200
if you find a way to
improve on the process.

1005
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,490
But the idea is to have a
plan going into the process.

1006
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:25,020
- Question.
- Yeah.

1007
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,820
- [Audience Member] So I'm
working in a similar way,

1008
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:30,039
similar process, but
my struggle with that,

1009
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:31,181
it's always very tedious.

1010
00:44:31,181 --> 00:44:33,636
We plan everything, all the details.

1011
00:44:33,636 --> 00:44:34,469
Some of the questions we have seen

1012
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:36,786
seem irrelevant at this point in time.

1013
00:44:36,786 --> 00:44:38,796
You don't really care.

1014
00:44:38,796 --> 00:44:40,770
And then when it starts
building, you realize,

1015
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,603
oh wait a second,

1016
00:44:41,603 --> 00:44:44,673
actually I wanna change my
mind and change (indistinct).

1017
00:44:44,673 --> 00:44:46,350
And so it's very difficult to go back

1018
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,810
because you're forcing
(indistinct) yourself

1019
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,540
with this linear process.

1020
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,680
- Yeah.
- Do you have any experience

1021
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,940
with that?

1022
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,043
Looking for like iterative development.

1023
00:44:56,043 --> 00:44:58,380
Like build a very simple
first version or whatever

1024
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,080
and then un-extend it when I've seen it?

1025
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,913
- [Derek] Yeah.

1026
00:45:01,913 --> 00:45:03,360
To summarize the question.

1027
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,110
This process, it's been linear, right,

1028
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,970
where we do all these steps in order.

1029
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,010
And in reality, in real life,

1030
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,117
we might start implementing
phase one and say,

1031
00:45:13,117 --> 00:45:14,280
"Actually I changed my mind,

1032
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,047
I wanna tweak the requirements."

1033
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,700
I think you certainly can go back to

1034
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,510
one of the previous stages,
edit the requirements,

1035
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:29,370
and then ask the tool to
update the design, for example.

1036
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:32,640
I don't think I have any
real shortcuts for that.

1037
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,540
I think we've gotta pay
the price at some point.

1038
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,933
If we wanna change the requirements,

1039
00:45:37,933 --> 00:45:40,770
we're gonna have to go
through those steps again.

1040
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,750
I think that the,

1041
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,450
by getting the right
people in the room upfront,

1042
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:48,600
we can hopefully minimize
that back and forth

1043
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,000
in terms of what the
requirements should be.

1044
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
In terms of iterating on the
design and the implementation,

1045
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,150
one of the benefits is, we
can move pretty quickly here.

1046
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:04,964
And so the iteration
step, whereas, you know,

1047
00:46:04,964 --> 00:46:06,930
in previous lives that
might be like a whole sprint

1048
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,030
that we just used to build something

1049
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,800
and we've gotta start over again.

1050
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,710
We could potentially make that cycle time

1051
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,420
quite a bit shorter.

1052
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,670
But I don't have a way around, you know,

1053
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,460
needing to go back and-

1054
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,600
- [Audience Member] No,
no, it's fine to go back.

1055
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,755
It's more like, like the
context is blown out, et cetera,

1056
00:46:25,755 --> 00:46:26,588
I don't wanna go back,

1057
00:46:26,588 --> 00:46:29,400
so I'd rather like
build the like MCP thing

1058
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,030
of this game, document what
you did, then I'll look at it,

1059
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,910
change my mind and then like, (indistinct)

1060
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:39,413
I have specified so far, and
change the specification again

1061
00:46:39,413 --> 00:46:41,490
so it's like a cycle process.

1062
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,320
- Yeah.
- You start with fresh context

1063
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,154
just with the key
learnings from cycle one,

1064
00:46:46,154 --> 00:46:48,960
going into cycle two with
more space in the context

1065
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,550
and starting from there.

1066
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,320
- [Derek] So the, just
to repeat the question,

1067
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:57,320
the question is about being
able to save the context

1068
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,480
and go back and edit it later,

1069
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,360
and be able to iterate based
on what we've learned so far.

1070
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,360
So we're writing all
of the design decisions

1071
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,290
into markdown files.

1072
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,740
All of the Q&A and all of the descriptions

1073
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,010
of the requirements and design and such.

1074
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,560
There's also an audit log that
automatically gets written

1075
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,890
of all the questions and
decisions that were made.

1076
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:25,980
One thing that we've seen is
just taking all of these files

1077
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,050
and attaching them back
into the Jira tickets.

1078
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,210
And so anybody that wants
to go back and understand

1079
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:33,360
why did we make this
decision, or, you know,

1080
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,730
what was used as input here,

1081
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,683
we can go back and reproduce it.

1082
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,030
We've also seen, you know, the
context window can get full,

1083
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,700
and so in between each of these steps,

1084
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,800
we've actually cleared the context

1085
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,300
and then started fresh again.

1086
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,950
And that kind of proves to ourselves

1087
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,700
that everything that's needed
to reproduce what we've got

1088
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,160
is stored in these markdown files,

1089
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,420
- [Audience Member] Basically
clear everything else,

1090
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,180
just signal what's in the files?

1091
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,970
- [Derek] Yep, and that's
in our custom agent, yep.

1092
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,830
And then, so in theory, we
should be able to go back

1093
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:09,180
to any step at any time, using
one of these as artifacts,

1094
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,123
make a tweak and move forward from there.

1095
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,680
- [Audience Member] How is this different

1096
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,033
from using the Kiro IDE?

1097
00:48:18,893 --> 00:48:22,920
Because I use it and it
follows very similar phases

1098
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,290
where like I really have
the design requirements

1099
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:27,600
and tasks, and here you have analysis,

1100
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,550
design and implementation.

1101
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:32,040
Do you think one is more
powerful than the other?

1102
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,730
Or depending, like if we, you
did your own customer agent,

1103
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:37,200
so it's like in that case

1104
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,220
would this be more powerful
than the spec on IDE?

1105
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,633
- [Derek] The question was,

1106
00:48:43,515 --> 00:48:46,620
which is sort of the better approach.

1107
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,930
Kiro IDE has spec-driven development.

1108
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:52,920
We're doing this AI-DLC
workflow in the CLI.

1109
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,323
They have similar bits of functionality.

1110
00:48:56,479 --> 00:49:00,693
We're moving fast in all of this.

1111
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:05,313
The IDE, I would say,
spec-driven development,

1112
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,850
is less customizable at this point, right?

1113
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,080
You're gonna kinda get what you get.

1114
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,640
And for a lot of customers,

1115
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,860
they really like it and they're using it.

1116
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,143
This is much more configurable.

1117
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,190
The AI-DLC approach, or
an approach like this,

1118
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,100
gives you the ability
to tailor this process

1119
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:26,130
with your development teams over time,

1120
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,670
and make it as granular and
specific, always do it this way,

1121
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,773
don't do it that way, as you want.

1122
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:37,050
In return, the process is
more complicated, right?

1123
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:37,980
It's gonna take more time.

1124
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,050
We're skipping a bunch of steps.

1125
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,400
If we were going through the full thing

1126
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,920
and we hadn't told it
we were doing a demo,

1127
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,890
it would be documenting
tons of user stories

1128
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:49,170
and asking what personas
should we be doing?

1129
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,420
And so it'll go a lot deeper than this.

1130
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:56,400
And so I would suggest that
maybe as a starting point,

1131
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,400
or for features that
are a little bit more,

1132
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,110
I don't wanna say straightforward.

1133
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:10,053
I would say Kiro IDE is
a good starting point.

1134
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:15,300
But if you're looking for
more ability to customize,

1135
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,820
or the ability to get a few levels deeper

1136
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,110
into the requirements,

1137
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,180
I would suggest that
this is a good approach.

1138
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,130
But I also think that you'll see over time

1139
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,370
we'll continue to build out
that spec-driven workflow

1140
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:29,793
in the IDE, and that'll get
more and more features as well.

1141
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:31,703
How are we doing, Kiran?

1142
00:50:31,703 --> 00:50:32,910
- [Kiran] It built actually quite quickly.

1143
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:35,220
There was no contention
on Bedrock, I think.

1144
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,060
I think we're good there.

1145
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,560
So, yeah.
- We'll have to see

1146
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,090
if it works.
- Yeah, well let's,

1147
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:44,090
yeah, so it did build us the
implementation plan and then,

1148
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,750
let me close that down and
bring up the other one.

1149
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,270
So yeah, we got all, you know,
all the coding was complete.

1150
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:51,480
You get a full report of
everything that was done,

1151
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,130
how much code was written,

1152
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,900
all the features that were implemented,

1153
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,600
the stuff that we walked
through in the beginning.

1154
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,020
And yeah, it tells you how to test it

1155
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,030
and it also gives you a
whole testing plan as well.

1156
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,500
This is quite a basic one obviously,

1157
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,840
but you can obviously
imagine what it'll produce

1158
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,523
when you do a proper document.

1159
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:12,660
So yeah, with that,
let's see what happens.

1160
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:16,380
So I think it's just
this file here we can go.

1161
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,213
So there we go.

1162
00:51:17,213 --> 00:51:18,363
We got the start screen.

1163
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,155
Looks all right so far.

1164
00:51:21,155 --> 00:51:22,560
This is the worst part!

1165
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,393
Easy.

1166
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,726
There we go.

1167
00:51:25,726 --> 00:51:26,559
Actually it wasn't too bad.

1168
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:27,392
Okay.
- Nice.

1169
00:51:27,392 --> 00:51:29,160
- [Kiran] The Bedrock
thing wasn't as impressive

1170
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:29,993
as I thought.

1171
00:51:29,993 --> 00:51:31,350
- [Derek] I think that's a Pac-Man ghost.

1172
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:32,183
- [Kiran] Yeah, yeah.

1173
00:51:32,183 --> 00:51:34,383
It doesn't actually look in there, but,

1174
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,876
it's picking up scores and,

1175
00:51:36,876 --> 00:51:38,790
I don't know if there's any sound on here.

1176
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:40,140
There's no sound.
- I think we said no sound.

1177
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,190
- [Kiran] Yeah, they said no sound.

1178
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:43,477
But there should have been,
I can unplug my mic in a sec.

1179
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:45,360
(indistinct)

1180
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,920
- [Derek] Oh no, I mean
when we set up the stage

1181
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,850
we said no sound.

1182
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:48,683
That was our mistake.

1183
00:51:48,683 --> 00:51:50,667
- [Kiran] That's actually
better than I thought.

1184
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:51,500
- Yeah.
- A lot of them

1185
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,190
just didn't work, it
just sunk like a stone.

1186
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,080
But, yeah.
- Cool, nice.

1187
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,823
We've got eight minutes.

1188
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:59,730
Happy to take more
questions and discussion

1189
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:00,960
about the process.

1190
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,990
Also happy to take modification
requests to the game,

1191
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:05,490
if we wanna try that.
- Yeah.

1192
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:07,830
(indistinct)

1193
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:09,390
Yes.

1194
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:12,663
- [Derek] Yes, I will put
that up right at the end here.

1195
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,430
I'll do some crowd work here.

1196
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,170
- [Audience Member] So our
team recently did a test

1197
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:23,520
where we went like full Kiro,

1198
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,060
and just had it kind of go
crazy and make a whole web app.

1199
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,420
My issue with it was that a
lot of it was like inaccessible

1200
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,253
and like had like,

1201
00:52:31,253 --> 00:52:32,817
there was like window to open
things and things like that.

1202
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,980
And I'm just wondering what
recommendations you have.

1203
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,550
Like is it like adding a
frontend MCP to the front of it?

1204
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:40,470
Like what would you
recommend to help make sure

1205
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,080
it kind of followed WCAG guidelines.

1206
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,280
- [Derek] So you're
talking about accessibility

1207
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,487
like A11, like?
- Yeah.

1208
00:52:46,487 --> 00:52:48,210
- [Derek] Okay.

1209
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:51,270
How specific were you at the beginning

1210
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,550
about your accessibility requirements,

1211
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,710
and what was must have, nice to have?

1212
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,690
- [Audience Member] I'm not
sure, I had delegated the-

1213
00:52:57,690 --> 00:52:59,100
- [Derek] Got it, got it!

1214
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,290
So I think that would be my answer, right?

1215
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:03,960
The more time we spend up front, again,

1216
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,480
if this is a web app,
talking to the UX folks,

1217
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,180
the stakeholders, the product managers,

1218
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,560
getting really into the weeds on

1219
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,170
what are the non-negotiables
for accessibility.

1220
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:16,170
And if we can get all of that,
you know, decided upfront,

1221
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,720
and documented into one
of these markdown files,

1222
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,760
I would expect that we
would get, you know,

1223
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,170
better results there.

1224
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,126
- [Audience Member] Is
there a way to, like,

1225
00:53:24,126 --> 00:53:24,990
there's like WCAG guidelines.

1226
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:27,090
Like is there a way to
like more easily integrate

1227
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,590
that even just as a base,

1228
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:30,960
'cause there's like
actual specs and whatnot.

1229
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,793
- Yep.
- Is there a way

1230
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:32,640
to do that?

1231
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,950
- [Derek] So, you know, one thing,

1232
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,350
as you're developing your, you know,

1233
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,540
version of this for your teams,

1234
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,970
again, you could imagine
having a repo of these

1235
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:44,700
context files and a custom
agent that you publish

1236
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,533
for the teams and say,

1237
00:53:45,533 --> 00:53:47,910
"Hey, use this when you're
building a web app."

1238
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:51,630
And in that custom agent in
the context you could say,

1239
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:53,670
the following are kind
of company standards

1240
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,080
for accessibilities like,

1241
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,320
thou shall make sure that
you hit these versions of,

1242
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,413
or these WCAG requirements.

1243
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:05,370
The model is gonna have a
pretty good understanding

1244
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:09,120
of those requirements baked
into its latent knowledge.

1245
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,490
But if you wanted to really
make sure that you nailed it,

1246
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:13,650
you could say, hey, in fact,

1247
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,740
I'm guessing I would be
willing to wager that there's a

1248
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,340
WCAG MCP server where you can go,

1249
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,010
where you can go and grab the actual spec.

1250
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,275
So that would come at
the cost of more context,

1251
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:26,820
that you'd have to load.

1252
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,717
But you could, I could imagine saying,

1253
00:54:28,717 --> 00:54:32,220
"Hey, as part of our verification,

1254
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:35,730
I want you to make sure that
you've built all of this in."

1255
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,560
And actually go test it.

1256
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,697
So I think you get as sophisticated
as you wanted to, and,

1257
00:54:39,697 --> 00:54:43,500
you know, I would suggest
starting by adding that up front

1258
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:47,250
into the context and
having it build that in.

1259
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,783
- Okay.
- Yeah, thanks.

1260
00:54:49,847 --> 00:54:51,183
I have one over here.

1261
00:54:53,013 --> 00:54:53,846
There you go.

1262
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,340
- [Audience Member] I work as a manager

1263
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,440
of a developer experience
team in our company,

1264
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,890
and we have like 300 engineers as a whole.

1265
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:04,770
And one of the difficulties
that we have is like

1266
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:09,240
how we standardize the AI knowledge.

1267
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,850
'Cause people like to use Kiro,

1268
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,330
some of those like to use
Cursor, Cloud Code, whatever.

1269
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:18,750
And when I look at
these, it's kind of like

1270
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,760
a little bit more concentrating on Kiro,

1271
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,580
or like how is the difference
with like Agents.md,

1272
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:26,692
for example, that's kind
of like a standardization

1273
00:55:26,692 --> 00:55:28,260
independent of the tools.

1274
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:31,200
Like that's a little bit
of my question here is like

1275
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,990
how can make that reusable,

1276
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,730
of the two that developer is choosing.

1277
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:38,403
So probably it'll make easier to adopt.

1278
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,280
- [Derek] Yeah.

1279
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,280
So we're seeing a lot of
innovation in all of the tools

1280
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:47,483
in this space.

1281
00:55:47,483 --> 00:55:49,050
So things are moving fast.

1282
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,490
Agents.md seems to be

1283
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:53,190
a defacto standard that's emerging.

1284
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,660
That's good.

1285
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,440
The different tools have
different ways for specifying,

1286
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,740
you know, this concept of custom agents.

1287
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,990
This workflow, the AI-DLC,

1288
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,400
is just a bunch of markdown files.

1289
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,730
So, you know, it would work
fine in Cloud Code or Cursor,

1290
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:09,563
what have you.

1291
00:56:09,563 --> 00:56:13,230
So this isn't meant to be
specifically tied to Kiro.

1292
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:16,590
We think that Kiro is a great
platform for doing this,

1293
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,450
but we're not trying
to sort of lock it down

1294
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:20,613
to one particular tool.

1295
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:26,130
But ideally you're able to
bundle together the AI-DLC

1296
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,020
or the context files that you have,

1297
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,150
that you wanna steer the
behavior of the model,

1298
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,510
as well as your list of
MCP servers together,

1299
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,670
and have a way to publish that out

1300
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:38,550
to other folks in your organization.

1301
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:41,910
So with Kiro CLI, that's just a JSON file.

1302
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:45,420
And so all that could be
is an internal repository

1303
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,670
where you say, "Hey, if
you're building web apps,

1304
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,020
use this custom agent.

1305
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:53,010
If you're extending this old
legacy app, go use this agent."

1306
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,110
And that combined kind
of collective wisdom

1307
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:57,600
of how to operate around
those different domains

1308
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,600
is baked into those agents.

1309
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,433
Yeah.

1310
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:03,690
I think I saw one more.

1311
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,460
Oh, come over to you next.

1312
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,183
- [Audience Member] First of all,

1313
00:57:09,183 --> 00:57:10,990
thank you for that great presentation.

1314
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,042
When you have these different
stages in the AI-DLC

1315
00:57:16,042 --> 00:57:21,042
and in the agent definition
there was this line model

1316
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,260
that was null.

1317
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:27,210
So you leave the selection
of the model to use

1318
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,650
to the automatic,

1319
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:31,200
or would you suggest
using different models

1320
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,220
for different tasks and
stages in the AI-DLC?

1321
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,053
- [Derek] Yep.

1322
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:37,890
Thanks for the question.

1323
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:42,600
So by default, we now
have an auto mode in Kiro,

1324
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,210
and that's gonna allow
us to select the model

1325
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:48,990
and give you a discount
in terms of credits.

1326
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:50,640
And our goal with the engineering team,

1327
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,040
and they're spending a
lot of energy on this,

1328
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,850
is making that auto mode work
great so that you, as a user,

1329
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:59,310
would never have a reason
to change the model.

1330
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,230
'Cause you're very happy with the outcome.

1331
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:02,880
So that would be our recommendation

1332
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,530
is start with the auto mode.

1333
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:06,480
Hopefully you get great.

1334
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,310
If you're not sure you're getting great

1335
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:11,070
and you wanna say no, I
definitely want Sonnet 4.5

1336
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:14,940
or whatever the latest
model of the day is,

1337
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:15,960
you could switch to that

1338
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,120
and see if you get different results.

1339
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,370
But our hope and our expectation is that

1340
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:23,460
you can start with just
not defining the model,

1341
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,710
use the default auto mode.

1342
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,543
Yep.

1343
00:58:26,543 --> 00:58:27,600
I'm gonna take one more here

1344
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,700
and I know we're just wrapping up on time.

1345
00:58:32,269 --> 00:58:33,102
- [Audience Member] So first of all,

1346
00:58:33,102 --> 00:58:34,800
thank you so much for the
presentation, the demo,

1347
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,610
and I just tried the Kiro
app and also the CLI as well.

1348
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:40,710
They both work really
fast, I really like it.

1349
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:41,543
- Great!
- Yeah.

1350
00:58:41,543 --> 00:58:42,376
I like the (indistinct).

1351
00:58:42,376 --> 00:58:43,209
But the things are, you know,

1352
00:58:43,209 --> 00:58:45,150
I know a lot of independent developers.

1353
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:49,440
They try so many like AI coding
agent, Cursor, Cloud Code.

1354
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,300
So actually I want to get more insight

1355
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:55,110
that how to differentiation
from Kiro and those,

1356
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:56,370
another coding agent.

1357
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,090
For example, are we going to
have more integration on AWS

1358
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:02,670
or, you know, do some more, you know,

1359
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:05,687
integration work on
enterprise integration.

1360
00:59:05,687 --> 00:59:06,987
- [Derek] Yeah, thank you.

1361
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:10,743
We're right at time, but I'll say,

1362
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:13,710
in terms of differentiation,

1363
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:15,540
we want Kiro to be a great product,

1364
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,860
regardless of where you're developing,

1365
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,600
even if it's not on AWS.

1366
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,090
And so our intention is to just focus on

1367
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,770
a great developer experience.

1368
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:26,970
Of course we want it to be
really good at AWS as well.

1369
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:28,590
So that's the thinking.

1370
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,960
You know, differentiators,
there's a lot of smart folks

1371
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,480
that are building other
cool tools in this space.

1372
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,790
I think it's a good time for end users,

1373
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:38,520
because that competition is having folks

1374
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,530
kind of leapfrog each
other in capabilities.

1375
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:42,750
I expect that's gonna continue to happen.

1376
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,810
I'd say one nice thing about
Kiro is, when you subscribe,

1377
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:48,840
you have access to both
the CLI and the IDE

1378
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,190
for one subscription.

1379
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:52,680
And we see a lot of folks that
like to switch back and forth

1380
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,560
between those modes, or
maybe even use both at once.

1381
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,752
So I think that's a nice thing.

1382
00:59:57,752 --> 01:00:00,570
I would say the spec-driven
development in the IDE,

1383
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:01,620
which we didn't look at today,

1384
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,510
but we've heard a lot of great feedback

1385
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:05,280
that that's a good way for developers

1386
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,330
to sort of structure their approach.

1387
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,950
So I would encourage you,
if you haven't, to try both.

1388
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:13,233
Try the spec-driven workflow in Kiro IDE.

1389
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:17,370
Try the AI-DLC, which
is a bit more in depth,

1390
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:19,560
and see which one suits you the best.

1391
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,210
So, very brief answer to your question,

1392
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:23,121
but I know we're right at time so.

1393
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:23,954
- [Audience Member] Okay, thank you.

1394
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,260
- [Derek] All right.

1395
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,710
Thank you all, thanks, Kiran.
