1
00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:02,528
Well, good afternoon, everyone. I'm Tatum Tummins, senior

2
00:00:02,528 --> 00:00:03,160
product manager at Kion.

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,828
If you're not familiar with Kon, we're

4
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:08,169
a FinOps and cloud ops enablement

5
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:10,640
tool focusing on automation and governance.

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,250
Uh, prior to coming over to the vendor side

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,028
of the space,

8
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:16,329
I spent over 7.5 years at a large

9
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,429
healthcare company doing FinOs.

10
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:20,489
I like to say I grew up in the industry in

11
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,763
a lot of ways. And I like to share that

12
00:00:22,763 --> 00:00:24,844
because I'm passionate about the subject.

13
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:27,443
I'm passionate about helping people get better in their practice,

14
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:29,763
and that's ultimately why I'm here today to

15
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,923
talk about FinOps Plus, uh, an

16
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:34,054
effort that I think will help organizations

17
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:35,064
be more successful.

18
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:37,865
So when we look at what we're gonna do today,

19
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:40,404
we're gonna start with a quick level set

20
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:42,435
of what has the FinOps industry looked like

21
00:00:42,435 --> 00:00:43,465
over the last year.

22
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:46,259
That will lead us into the 30,000

23
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:48,359
ft macro view of what FinOps Plus

24
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:50,539
is. And then I'll spend a few slides

25
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:52,569
getting into the more of the details of what that

26
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:54,810
looks like in action, some examples, uh,

27
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,658
and then we'll end with some next steps and takeaways.

28
00:00:57,908 --> 00:00:59,950
Uh, but to start, it's important

29
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,990
we reflect on what the last year has looked like

30
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,889
in the industry.

31
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,379
And for those of you that are familiar with the FinOps

32
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,510
Foundation, uh, every year they do a

33
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,588
state of the FinOps survey where they ask folks like

34
00:01:09,588 --> 00:01:10,138
you all,

35
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,668
what are your challenges, what are your priorities,

36
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:13,668
etc.

37
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:16,230
And in that survey, uh, at the

38
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,388
beginning of this year, folks came back and

39
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:20,549
said, hey, we got 3 main priorities

40
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,028
right now. It's reducing waste and optimizing

41
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:23,579
spend,

42
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:25,948
it's allocation of that cloud spend and

43
00:01:25,948 --> 00:01:27,650
trying to get a little bit better at forecasting.

44
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,500
But what I found really interesting is when folks

45
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
were asked, well, what are you going to care about over the next

46
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,588
12 months?

47
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,579
Two new things enter.

48
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,439
The first is FinOps governance and policy at scale,

49
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,698
and the third was managing costs

50
00:01:40,698 --> 00:01:41,799
beyond public cloud.

51
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:45,189
Those two things, along with

52
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,489
3 developments,

53
00:01:46,808 --> 00:01:49,168
those 3 developments, the first being the introduction

54
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:50,019
of scopes.

55
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:52,489
So the FinOps Foundation introduced this

56
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:54,558
topic, which is essentially outlining the

57
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:56,609
different areas of your technology investment

58
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,088
that you can and should practice FinOs

59
00:01:59,088 --> 00:02:01,168
on. The second is the

60
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:03,010
common billing schema of focus.

61
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,400
The 1.2 was released, and what we're

62
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,668
seeing is that practitioners

63
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:09,849
and vendors alike are starting to adopt

64
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:11,879
that schema or at least start to explore what that would

65
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,960
look like. And the last

66
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,080
piece, uh, and this should be obvious if you've

67
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,429
walked around anywhere this week, uh, AI

68
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,429
is everywhere, and the finOs

69
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:21,240
industry is no different.

70
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:23,349
So,

71
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,979
when I looked at that survey data,

72
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,649
and then I started to have conversations with prospects

73
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,889
and customers, I was starting to package,

74
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:33,050
you know, what are the areas that folks can start

75
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,199
to focus on of where FinOps is headed,

76
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,099
and.

77
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:38,319
Earlier this year,

78
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,778
uh, I met a gentleman, he's actually sitting right

79
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:41,379
back there,

80
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,319
uh, Matt Coffer from Insulate,

81
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,360
uh, and we met Matt, and

82
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,008
Matt came to us and said, hey,

83
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:50,379
you know, Insulate's looking for really two

84
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,000
things.

85
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,808
We want to get better vis visibility

86
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:55,819
into all of our technology spend. We

87
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:57,860
have all these SAS tools that we want to start bringing

88
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,520
in to have a single pane of glass.

89
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:00,939
And Matt also said, hey,

90
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,740
if we need to bring more governance and, and

91
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,740
more policy to our finOs practice.

92
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:08,524
And so, I thought about the survey data,

93
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:10,683
and I thought about what Matt was saying, and I

94
00:03:10,683 --> 00:03:11,844
started to put this together.

95
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,284
And what Matt ultimately said, and you can scan that

96
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:16,044
QR code for a full case study,

97
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:18,683
is he said, we didn't just need FinOps, we needed FinOps

98
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:20,724
Plus. And so like any good

99
00:03:20,724 --> 00:03:22,764
product manager, uh, I steal good ideas when

100
00:03:22,764 --> 00:03:23,403
I see them,

101
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:25,844
and I decided, uh, to call this framework

102
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:26,835
FinOps Plus.

103
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,354
And ultimately, it's three pillars.

104
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:31,633
It's automated governance, it's AI

105
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:33,683
driven, and it's beyond public cloud.

106
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:36,169
And in a few slides, we'll show some

107
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:38,308
examples of what these look like in practice,

108
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,649
but I want to stay high level for a moment and

109
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:42,830
talk about what FinOps Plus is and is not.

110
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:45,439
So, it's a modern approach, and it's

111
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,270
really focused on doing 3 things,

112
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,629
solving challenges a little bit more proactively.

113
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:51,669
Driving efficiency.

114
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,088
And enabling smarter decisions.

115
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,788
And what it's really trying to do is take the things

116
00:03:56,788 --> 00:03:59,028
that you all are doing today, the same challenges

117
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:01,149
and processes, and it's trying to make those

118
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:03,189
more successful right now, but what it's really

119
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:03,889
trying to do

120
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:06,439
is set you all up for success for where FinOps

121
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,740
is going over the next 12 to 18 months,

122
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,008
uh, as it evolves.

123
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:12,849
We think about what it's not.

124
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:15,558
It is by no means trying to redefine finops.

125
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,970
These three pillars are meant to apply to the same

126
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,209
processes that you're doing today.

127
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,129
It's also not trying to add more work to your plate.

128
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,329
If anything, it's trying to do the opposite by leaning

129
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,528
on automation, leaning on AI in the, in

130
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:28,608
strategic ways. It starts to give you more

131
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:29,730
time back in your day.

132
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:32,809
And then lastly, it's not just for certain maturity

133
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:33,439
levels.

134
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:35,970
There's gonna be some things in the next few slides that

135
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,079
for some of you may seem too mature or

136
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,209
too far-fetched, uh, but I promise,

137
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,449
and I'm confident that there's going to be something within

138
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,528
at least one of these pillars, uh, that

139
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:46,569
you can start to apply to your practice

140
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:47,209
leaving today.

141
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:49,949
And so with that,

142
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,269
let's talk about what these pillars look like in

143
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:52,939
action.

144
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:55,358
And so, the first we're gonna talk about

145
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:56,899
is automated governance.

146
00:04:57,278 --> 00:04:59,559
And I like to start by defining

147
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,019
that with 3 steps.

148
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:02,619
The first is policy.

149
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,278
Policy becomes automation, and automation

150
00:05:05,278 --> 00:05:06,338
becomes guardrails.

151
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:09,040
And when I talk about what policy means, I'll

152
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,399
throw some examples up that probably

153
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,639
apply to all of you.

154
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:14,850
Uh, policy looks like

155
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,750
how you want to define waste or what an orphaned

156
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,129
resource looks at your organization.

157
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,980
It looks like, what is your retention policy

158
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,678
for snapshots or storage?

159
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,639
It can be

160
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,178
what your lights off policy looks like for your

161
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:31,259
sandbox and dev environments. What time

162
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,379
do you shut those off? Are they off on the weekends? Things

163
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:34,199
of that nature.

164
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:37,048
And lastly, another simple example is tagging

165
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:39,100
your resources. Uh tagging is something

166
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,278
every FinOs practice does,

167
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,939
looks a little different everywhere, but the ability

168
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:44,980
to say these are the key value pairs we

169
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,319
look for, and then taking that policy

170
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,939
and using whether it's a homegrown solution

171
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:50,678
or a tool like Kion

172
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,980
and wrapping that up in automation.

173
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,250
When that happens, you start to have guardrails,

174
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,559
and those guardrails produce outcomes.

175
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:01,108
The first looks like preventing waste.

176
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,379
A simple example is waste is going

177
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:04,569
to exist at every organization,

178
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:07,980
but the time it takes for a human to intervene,

179
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:10,699
review those opportunities, and then take action

180
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,338
30, 60 days later,

181
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,988
you've had. Waste during that time period. So

182
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:17,069
the more that you can cut that off at the

183
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:17,649
very beginning,

184
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:20,459
you produce that waste or you reduce that waste,

185
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,850
and you also start to reduce manual work

186
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:25,410
because every time a human has to go

187
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,470
review an opportunity and then decide if they

188
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,709
can take action, that also takes away human

189
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:31,709
time and and the value that they could be providing

190
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:32,290
your organization.

191
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:35,819
And the last piece is really important. It

192
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:36,988
allows you to scale.

193
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:39,420
So as you scale in the cloud, it

194
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,509
gets more and more difficult to keep up with all

195
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,459
of these manual opportunities to remediate.

196
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,178
So by defining policy, putting automation

197
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:48,778
in place, you now start to have a scalable

198
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:51,399
process that as you grow, you can still maintain,

199
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:53,278
uh, and, and try to increase value.

200
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,970
The second pillar, AI driven, and this

201
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,290
is a fun topic, and I'm sure you guys are sick of AI

202
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,189
already this week, even on the first day.

203
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,028
Um,

204
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:05,619
there's a lot that we could get into here today,

205
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,889
and I, you know, there are some use cases in FinOs

206
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:09,108
that the AI we have today

207
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:11,528
may not be the perfect solution for, but what

208
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:13,608
I am confident is that in 3

209
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:15,928
areas, it's providing real

210
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:17,970
exciting value for folks, and those

211
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,309
are guidance, efficiency, and governance.

212
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,829
And so what I mean by guidance to start.

213
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:25,439
What you see on the screen here is Kon's

214
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,488
version of an in-app, uh, AI assistant,

215
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:29,850
and what I wanna draw your attention to is

216
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,869
that those are prompts on the screen.

217
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,369
And why I think that's so critically important

218
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:36,350
is that the cloud is complex,

219
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,889
fin-Os can be complex, and when you're

220
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:40,970
starting out and you just don't know where to go,

221
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:43,129
or maybe you're just a stakeholder and you're

222
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,399
in procurement or you're in finance or accounting,

223
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:47,889
and you need to find the data that you're looking for,

224
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,329
AI provides you a more usable way to find that

225
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:53,428
information. And then what's exciting is you click

226
00:07:53,428 --> 00:07:55,519
on one of these prompts and it starts

227
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,649
to provide you additional questions that you might

228
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,879
should be asking yourself or highlighting things

229
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,850
for next steps.

230
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:03,278
And I think the usability piece of AI

231
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:05,600
is gonna go a long way in making FinOs

232
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,879
a little bit more of a cultural activity at your

233
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,220
organizations and not just something that one or two folks,

234
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,100
uh, know what they're doing.

235
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,738
The second piece, and this is probably the most obvious

236
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:17,858
one, we've, we've all experienced this probably personal

237
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:20,009
and professionally. Um, I use

238
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,139
chat GPT for cooking recipes

239
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,259
and proofreading emails, and we've probably all

240
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,199
had somewhat of an experience like that.

241
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:29,160
But it's not just the getting the

242
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,488
information a little bit quicker, uh, that I want to highlight

243
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:33,529
here, it's also getting tasks done a

244
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:34,469
little bit faster.

245
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:36,849
Uh, a great example is, uh, we

246
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,739
had an organization

247
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,690
who, when they go to update their budgets

248
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,710
on a monthly cycle,

249
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,288
uh, that process used to take them

250
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:46,109
about 45 minutes to an hour.

251
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,808
Now, using AI, that process

252
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:50,889
takes them less than 5 minutes, because they

253
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:51,750
have it go out.

254
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:54,166
And where they have overruns, where they need to adjust their

255
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,325
forecast, and in a single prompt actually

256
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:58,625
has the tool go drive and update to that budget

257
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:01,004
automatically instead of doing that over

258
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:03,514
50, 100 different projects and cost centers.

259
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:05,966
And so there's a lot there, um,

260
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:08,605
if you're interested in more use cases, specifically on efficiency,

261
00:09:08,684 --> 00:09:09,966
I'd love to talk after this,

262
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:10,846
um,

263
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:13,445
but the next one is governance, and this is where

264
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:14,894
I'm most excited about,

265
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:17,285
because what I mean here is not governing

266
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:19,671
your. AI spend that is a piece of finops,

267
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:20,921
but that is not what this is.

268
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,442
This is actually using AI to

269
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:25,562
govern your cloud. And so what you

270
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:26,980
see on the screen over here

271
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:29,642
is, uh, I asked if

272
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:31,822
it could create a EBS

273
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,841
uh policy to help clean up my unattached

274
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,980
volumes. And what you see happening

275
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,741
is that in this particular use case,

276
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:40,241
um, it's writing this policy in cloud

277
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:42,400
custodian language, for those of you that are familiar with Cloud

278
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,001
Custodian.

279
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,298
And what it's done is without any

280
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,259
extra detail for me,

281
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,798
it's looking at any unattached volumes

282
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,149
for over 7 days. It's gonna take a snapshot

283
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:54,229
of those, and then it's going to delete those EBS

284
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:56,399
volumes. And in one prompt,

285
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,700
I now can use a tool

286
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
to go orchestrate that policy and

287
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,038
begin cleaning up EBS volumes, and

288
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:05,239
that's just one example, but when you think about.

289
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:07,469
What I was talking about prior with

290
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:09,658
automated governance, AI and automated

291
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:11,879
governance almost play off each other, um,

292
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,109
and there's a lot of power in this because

293
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:16,149
non-technical users who know

294
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,229
what they want to achieve, but don't know how to write those

295
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:19,649
policies or even where to begin,

296
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:22,340
can now start to lean in on AI to

297
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,168
do that for them.

298
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:25,450
If you saw the keynote this morning,

299
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,899
um, AWS announced. I'm, I'm gonna

300
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,979
blank on the name here, but they announced an

301
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,099
actual policy creator for their AI agents

302
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,460
and trying to actually prevent and provide guardrails

303
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,119
for that. And what they showed is the same concept

304
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,619
of asking AI

305
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,178
to make a prompt to govern your AI

306
00:10:41,178 --> 00:10:43,538
spend, um, and we've seen a lot of, uh,

307
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,808
great success here, and I'm really excited for

308
00:10:45,808 --> 00:10:47,859
where kind of this part of AI

309
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:48,918
and FinOps is going.

310
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:52,259
Then the third pillar,

311
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,849
beyond public cloud.

312
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,158
And so I talked about it a little bit under the

313
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:58,308
key developments, but FinOps is

314
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,558
expanding to all technology spend,

315
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,149
not just your public cloud.

316
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,440
And so it's the idea of the same

317
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,719
processes and the same practices that you're doing,

318
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,139
but applying them across

319
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,678
your SAS tool providers.

320
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:12,224
Your data center spend, your licensing spend,

321
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:14,125
or even your G AI spend.

322
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:16,244
And why that's important

323
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:17,445
is because

324
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,144
once you get that initial visibility,

325
00:11:20,224 --> 00:11:22,543
you now have this single pane of glass, where

326
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:24,585
you're not only looking at your cloud spend, you're

327
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:26,625
looking at your Mongo DB spin, your data brick

328
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,404
spend, all in one dashboard.

329
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:30,389
And when you have that visibility,

330
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:33,090
now you can start to govern that spend,

331
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,200
you can start to optimize that spend.

332
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,440
And the last one's critically important,

333
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,019
you now make better business decisions because

334
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:40,918
you're not looking at

335
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,769
the cost of what a product or an application costs

336
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,200
just in the cloud. You're looking at what that cost

337
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,719
holistically, so you have a total cost of ownership,

338
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,058
you start to make better decisions on what

339
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,399
my app's profitability is, and etc.

340
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:57,548
And so to summarize what FinOps

341
00:11:57,548 --> 00:11:58,308
Plus is,

342
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:00,879
it's trying to drive better outcomes,

343
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:03,149
and what it's trying to do is it's taking

344
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:05,308
those activities that you're already doing today,

345
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:08,428
your reporting, your budgeting, your optimization,

346
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:11,288
and it's doing those through these three pillars.

347
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:13,590
It's applying automated governance to

348
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,418
try to prevent waste before it exists.

349
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:18,190
It's using AI in strategic areas

350
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,210
to drive efficiency,

351
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:20,869
help you govern your cloud.

352
00:12:21,298 --> 00:12:23,408
And it's using Beyond Public cloud to

353
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:24,649
make better decisions,

354
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:27,739
understand your total tech investment, um,

355
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,178
and what it's ultimately trying to do is

356
00:12:30,178 --> 00:12:32,340
take that traditional finOs and bridge

357
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,460
it with operational excellence as

358
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,379
you scale and grow in the cloud.

359
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:39,918
So, for next steps,

360
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,349
uh, the first is

361
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:44,460
adopt FinOps Plus, and that's vague

362
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,460
on purpose, because it's gonna mean something different

363
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,840
to every single one of you, uh, here today.

364
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,099
Um, if you wanna talk more about your use

365
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,178
cases or what you found interesting, I'll be

366
00:12:53,178 --> 00:12:55,219
over here to the side, would love to chat more. I'll

367
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:57,219
be at the Kayon booth, um, the rest of the

368
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:57,899
week, but.

369
00:12:58,423 --> 00:13:00,465
My hope is whether it's uh a

370
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:03,144
SAS tool that you want to bring into your dashboard,

371
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:05,465
or it's an idea for a policy

372
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:07,585
that you really think would save a lot of money, if you could just

373
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:09,744
figure out a way to automate it, whatever it may

374
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:11,854
be, identify a next step, uh,

375
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:13,423
and I encourage you when you leave here today to,

376
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:15,705
to take action, uh, and try to

377
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:17,173
implement that at your organization.

378
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,029
The next, and I sincerely mean this, provide feedback

379
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:23,668
to me. So this is practitioner

380
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:25,710
customer driven content. This is

381
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,259
not from my brain, it's from the brain of people like Matt

382
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:30,308
back there, and it gets better

383
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:32,450
and more applicable to you all

384
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,830
when I hear your use cases. I, and if

385
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,908
those of you have any sort of uh disagreement

386
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:38,070
with something I shared today,

387
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,509
all of that's valuable in refining this

388
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:42,570
content and making it more usable, uh,

389
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,330
and accessible,

390
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,450
uh, to everyone.

391
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:47,840
And then lastly, if you found something here

392
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,928
interesting and you wanna really do a deep dive on any of those

393
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:51,928
use cases, uh, Kyon's booth is

394
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:54,399
just right over here, 1555,

395
00:13:54,558 --> 00:13:56,369
um, would love to talk about this more,

396
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,769
show you how it can impact your organization or talk

397
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:00,558
through use cases that are specific to you,

398
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,928
um, and so with that, uh.

399
00:14:03,349 --> 00:14:05,469
I know you guys could be anywhere this afternoon. You

400
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,629
might be headed to a happy hour or whatever it may be. I

401
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,769
genuinely appreciate you giving me 15 minutes,

402
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:11,460
hearing this content, uh,

403
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:13,979
myself, and then I think Matt, you're gonna come over there too

404
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,590
if anybody wanna ask questions and have further

405
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,629
conversations, but I really appreciate it and I hope you guys have

406
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:19,908
a great rest of the reinvent.
