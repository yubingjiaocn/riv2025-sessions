1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,880
- Good morning everybody.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,560
Hope can you hear me?

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,750
So thanks for being here today.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,130
My name is Christian Finelli,

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,073
I'm a senior solution architect at AWS,

6
00:00:10,073 --> 00:00:12,600
part of the Telco Business Unit.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,720
Today we'll be learning how Ericsson

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,720
are transforming their in
house development experience

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,670
with AI on AWS.

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll have Bastian and
Dag talking about that

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,800
in the next session.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,440
Now, Ibrahim and I will talk you through

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,010
on how Ericsson are
optimizing their customers

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,763
mobile network experience with AI on AWS.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,020
So AWS is working with CSP,

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,120
communication service providers,

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,430
to achieve their business objectives,

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,070
which are increase revenue,

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,343
optimize cost, and reduce customer churn.

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,140
CSPs are migrating and modernizing

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,723
complex BSS and OSS stacks on AWS.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,820
They do that to reduce time to market

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,533
and increase product agility.

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,773
At the same time,

25
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:15,750
they migrate complex IT workloads

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,963
to increase operational
efficiency through AI automation.

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,080
CSPs are also migrating
virtualizing network functions

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,670
on AWS.

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,670
They do that to increase
elasticity, scalability,

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,150
and also to increase business continuity

31
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,513
through disaster recovery options on AWS.

32
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,860
Also CSPs are transforming
their customer experience

33
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,380
to basically everything starts with data,

34
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,940
the way they model customers' behavior

35
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,830
and the way they can provide

36
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,463
a personalized customer
experience for their CSPs.

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,393
Lastly, AWS and CSPs are
working together tightly

38
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,870
to build and think beyond connectivity,

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,780
build new revenue streams,

40
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,163
and protecting and monetizing
existing network investment.

41
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,610
They explore new business models

42
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,490
and they, as part of that
software as a service,

43
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,410
for example, is something
that gives them the option

44
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,380
to explore new pricing structures

45
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,003
and build and increase
agility of their product line.

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,090
AI is a key component in all these areas,

47
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,360
and we are seeing that Ericsson

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,250
as a key AWS partner

49
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,680
is best positioned to
scale this initiative.

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,183
Some of these initiatives
we'll see at scale globally.

51
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,940
As a matter of fact,
Ericsson are transforming

52
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,360
their business and their
product lines with AI and ML.

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,700
So let me bring a few examples

54
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,400
on how they're achieving that.

55
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,450
So they're reducing the
product delivery time

56
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,090
by leveraging agents

57
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,693
to integrate complex
software stacks in the field.

58
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,140
They're optimizing mobile
natural performance

59
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,450
for their customers CSPs

60
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,420
by leveraging a combination
of traditional ML

61
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,793
and agentic AI solutions.

62
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,983
They're also reducing time to
bring new features to market,

63
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,650
features that are delivered

64
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,910
and they are implemented
by team, internal teams

65
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,540
by building a ML ops platform

66
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,080
to accelerate adoption of ML technologies.

67
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,070
And also they are empowering

68
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,470
their large base of software developers

69
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:03,213
to improve their efficiency
to build better products.

70
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,130
We are working closely with Ericsson,

71
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,470
we are at firsthand experience

72
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,583
what it means building a
successful agentic AI solution.

73
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,070
It's not just identifying
and picking a LLM

74
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,103
and or adopting an agentic SDK.

75
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:30,720
And everything that
they complete AI stacks

76
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,550
so the accuracy and the economical
viability of the AI stack

77
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,480
underpinning the agentic AI solution

78
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,403
is a critical factor for its success.

79
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,310
There are few areas we've identified.

80
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,650
We start off from the fact that

81
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,310
the business must be able to trust agents

82
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,140
and the output of these agents.

83
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,140
So this means access to data
and to knowledge authorized

84
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:01,800
at the lowest ground level.

85
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,200
At the same time, it's important to,

86
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,650
in a traditional ML training,

87
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,570
data lineage plays a key role

88
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,200
in keeping track of origin of data

89
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,153
for data sovereignty requirements.

90
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,820
Also, trust comes with explainability,

91
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,170
being able to determine, to dissect

92
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,880
how agents behave,

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,170
the turns they take,

94
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,940
the reasoning process,

95
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,620
and also the different tools they call

96
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,233
and the performance of this.

97
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,140
Also as a next step is the
fact that context is king.

98
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,100
So the way context,

99
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,640
the way knowledge and data are
delivered at the right time

100
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,700
to the right agent concisely,

101
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,073
because size means cost,

102
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,273
it's also another element for success.

103
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,730
We also see that in a
multi-agentic solution

104
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,620
where there are multiple
agents working in combination,

105
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,670
it's important to attribute
value to each agent.

106
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,440
And when we say value is that

107
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,340
the overall outcome of
the multi agentic solution

108
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,980
is the value is split
across different agents

109
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,190
and determining what
value each agents bring

110
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,140
along with the cost allows
determination of autonomic ROI

111
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,880
for each agent.

112
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,553
This goes into really explainability

113
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:38,490
Observability is the foundation
for operational excellence.

114
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,490
So being able to understand and monitor

115
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,790
end to end performance of
these agents, as we said,

116
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,050
and also being able to operate them.

117
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,200
But when we said agents is
also not just operations,

118
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,550
agent operations,

119
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,550
but also everything that falls
into the underlying AI stack,

120
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,463
so LLM operations, ML operations.

121
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,780
Last also being able to run
these operations efficiently

122
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,393
through AI SDSC capabilities.

123
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:19,410
Ibrahim, you might wanna talk to us

124
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,990
what importance for why explainability

125
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,780
is important for customers.

126
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,730
- Thank you very much, Christian.

127
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,130
One thing I think we understand,

128
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,950
people who work very
closely with agentic AI,

129
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,550
and agents are not just about
deployment of technology.

130
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,070
When a CSP, a service provider,

131
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,880
is basically sourcing
agents from Ericsson,

132
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,940
they trust an outcome that
comes out from this agent.

133
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,780
They are basically
outsourcing network operation

134
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,990
for a national infrastructure
to someone like Ericsson.

135
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,180
So for them, it's extremely important

136
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,520
that we have explainability
in the whole stack.

137
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,010
Why a decision by agent is like that,

138
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,440
why my workflow is designed this way,

139
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,970
and what are the tools

140
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,350
and why the tools that,

141
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,380
as I will explain in the coming slides,

142
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,723
why these tools are making
such kind of decisions

143
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,700
to implement changes

144
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,370
in a national infrastructure like telco.

145
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,860
So explainability is extremely important

146
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,330
and the stack that AWS provides

147
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,850
actually gives us the
tools and the capabilities

148
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,730
to have this explainability to CSPs.

149
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,420
Explainability and
observability, right, Christian?

150
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,670
- [Christian] Absolutely.

151
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,657
Thank you Ibrahim.
- Thank you.

152
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:37,380
- And the observability, as Ibrahim said,

153
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,260
is across not just, as I said,

154
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,080
not just across the agentic AI layer,

155
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,020
but across the whole AI stack.

156
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,990
Ericsson are leveraging different services

157
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,050
from the AWS AI stacks.

158
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,671
We will see both use cases how
they leverage these services,

159
00:08:56,671 --> 00:09:00,870
but the stacks cover
service multiple personas

160
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,670
for different business cases.

161
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,910
So we start off from the bottom layer

162
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,110
where data scientists use AI compute

163
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,540
to run training jobs

164
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,770
and host model for inference

165
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,563
from GPU to Amazon own chips.

166
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,480
Amazon SageMaker AI is
used by data scientists

167
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,480
to run the entire ML
ops for their ML models.

168
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,983
So preparing data, training the model,

169
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,633
evaluating models continuously
throughout their life cycle,

170
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,020
hosting models for inference,

171
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,233
and then monitoring
the model performances.

172
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,023
Moving up the stack,

173
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:53,023
engineers and developer use Amazon Bedrock

174
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,470
to run agents at scale
securely in production.

175
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,460
This gives them choice
of foundational models

176
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,720
and give them capabilities

177
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,633
to allow to run that
at scale and securely.

178
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,770
Also, agentic SDLC applications
are leveraged by developers

179
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,530
to increase their efficiency

180
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,390
in coding, in developing software,

181
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:26,073
but also in maintaining
throughout all the operations.

182
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,760
So today we have firsthand experience,

183
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,650
two teams from Ericsson coming on stage

184
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,420
to discuss these two use cases.

185
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,740
The first one is Cognitive
Natural Solutions, CNS.

186
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,790
So they're leveraging,

187
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,790
they're using a combination
of traditional ML inference

188
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,880
and a multi agentic
solution to optimize CSP's

189
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,830
mobile natural performance.

190
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,050
And then System Comprehension Lab,

191
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,313
they empower their Ericsson engineers

192
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,533
to build better products through AI.

193
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,030
I'll leave the stage to you, Ibrahim.

194
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,623
- Thank you again, Christian.

195
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,550
So let me take you through our journey

196
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,890
of partnership together with AWS

197
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,680
in building this agentic AI for CSPs.

198
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,750
But before I take you
through this journey,

199
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,870
I would like you to
understand a little bit

200
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,120
what we stand for for Ericsson.

201
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,160
What's our mission and what is the impact

202
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,060
that we're actually having on society?

203
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,090
5G networks today, there are around 340,

204
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:47,090
189 of them are actually running
using Ericsson innovation.

205
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,910
So that's more than 50%
of 5G networks worldwide.

206
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,410
And more than 50% of worldwide
5G traffic outside China

207
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,570
is running in our own equipment.

208
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,240
I can tell you that here you are in Vegas,

209
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,290
if you are having mobile
services from AT&T,

210
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,060
Verizon or T-Mobile,

211
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,160
it's a hundred percent the chance

212
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,743
that you are using Ericsson Innovate.

213
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:13,680
CSPs are using Ericsson innovation

214
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,450
to deliver the service to you.

215
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,490
This is the impact that
we are having on society.

216
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,240
This is the impact that we
are providing to the world.

217
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,850
And in order to make
sure that these services

218
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,790
are provided like best in class,

219
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,790
we have a heritage of innovation
that extends 150 years.

220
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,290
Most like, you know, the most
obvious thing that you see

221
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,250
is the number of patents

222
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,570
that we bring for mobile technology,

223
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,210
more than 60,000 patents.

224
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,120
What actually proves that
this kind of technology

225
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,220
or this kind of innovation
is providing value

226
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,240
is that more than 74% of worldwide CSPs,

227
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,150
they always come first
when they're benchmarked

228
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,830
against their competition in the market

229
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,170
when they're using Ericsson equipment.

230
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,583
So for us in Ericsson,

231
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,010
it's extremely important to make sure that

232
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,420
this impact on society,

233
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,820
what we bring to CSPs

234
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,840
when it comes to performance,
to innovation is top notch.

235
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,877
And that's why it's
important for us to partner

236
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:13,380
with someone like AWS to
provide such kind of value.

237
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,760
And AI is a cornerstone
of that transformation

238
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,010
that we provide to our customers.

239
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:25,010
So for us, we worked in
transforming our portfolio offering

240
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,310
on the different parts of the
stack in mobile technology

241
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,040
and also for network operation using AI.

242
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,530
So we leveraged on our own competence.

243
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:38,250
So we shifted our own competence
in order to make sure that

244
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,670
people inside are capable of delivering

245
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,700
such kind of new value
to customer using AI.

246
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,000
We also worked on shifting
the mindset of people

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,970
and understanding that
what it means to provide AI

248
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,590
in each and every offering,

249
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,090
making sure that we built our networks

250
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,550
for the such kind of AI
traffic that we see today

251
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,380
and we see growing in the future.

252
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,820
And we are also using AI
into the network operation,

253
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,170
and also across the stack,

254
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,650
as Dag is gonna explain
to us a little bit later.

255
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,188
So we provide this in the portfolio

256
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:18,090
of how this mobile innovation
is delivered to CSPs

257
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,580
and also the way that we
operate this networks.

258
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,200
And this is the framework
that we talk about

259
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,880
for autonomous networks.

260
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,830
So, and if I give a little bit of

261
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:32,850
a view on what we mean
by autonomous networks.

262
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,080
Autonomous networks is a
framework that is defined by TMF

263
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,360
on how we operate networks

264
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,980
for today and for the future.

265
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,200
And it is actually across
five different levels

266
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,750
that you see here on the slide.

267
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,320
One thing that I'd like to
bring to your attention is

268
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,538
the graph that you see below,

269
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:53,970
the percentage of CSPs today

270
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,180
who are barely like reaching level three,

271
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,370
or actually beyond level three,

272
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,010
is less than 10%.

273
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,130
And it's actually when you start to move,

274
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,530
when you start to have humans,

275
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,770
sorry, when you start to
have AI into these systems

276
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,540
and into network operation

277
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,300
is the level three plus
that we are talking about.

278
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,400
So you might hear and
around in the community,

279
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,560
or right here actually
in CSPs talking about

280
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,450
reaching higher level of network autonomy

281
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,890
and reaching level four.

282
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,050
We cannot reach level
four without making sure

283
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,850
that we are embedding AI

284
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,650
in the way that we operate networks

285
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,150
and that's why autonomous networks

286
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,203
is a very important framework
to bring this to our CSPs.

287
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,500
And the way that we realize that

288
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,500
in our portfolio for Telco
AI is what you see here,

289
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,970
what we refer to as the cognitive loop.

290
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,970
Five stage of actually the workflow

291
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,890
that we have for network operation.

292
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,180
Starting by measurement,

293
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,470
where we have measurement agents

294
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,787
that understand the network data

295
00:15:56,787 --> 00:15:58,530
and making sure that, you know,

296
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,690
we are capturing the information we want

297
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,420
in order to move the next
step, which is assurance.

298
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,560
And then assurance is where we
have agents like classifiers

299
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,750
and root cause analyzers

300
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,170
who can actually tell us what's
happening in the network,

301
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,730
what kind of anomalies are there,

302
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,000
and what are the root causes
of such kind of anomalies.

303
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,280
And then we move to the next
step, which is proposal,

304
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,350
where we have AI recommender systems

305
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,726
and AI agents equipped
with recommendation tools

306
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:29,310
in order to propose what
is the next best action.

307
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,890
But obviously we understand
networks are complex.

308
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,570
So in order for us to make sure

309
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,420
that the best decision is
the final one implemented

310
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,740
in a network,

311
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,360
which is again reminding everyone,

312
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,510
is a national infrastructure
for each country.

313
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,210
This is the evaluation step
that you can see there.

314
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,310
And after the evaluation is done,

315
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,740
this is where the execution
happens and the activation,

316
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,090
and the cycle continues.

317
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,190
This is what we call the cognitive loop.

318
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,647
And as you can see, agentic AI fabric

319
00:16:57,647 --> 00:17:02,580
is implemented in order to
have this cognitive loop

320
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,980
fully functioning from end to end.

321
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,020
And this is achieved
through different agents,

322
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,100
as you can see there.

323
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,990
So we have agents who are
specialized in certain workflows

324
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,310
who are getting runtime
context from the network

325
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,540
as the traffic shifts

326
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,640
and things are happening every day,

327
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,113
I would say also every hour.

328
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,260
And in order to achieve that,

329
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,880
we believe in openness

330
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,860
and we believe in horizontalization.

331
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,610
So the architecture that we
have built together with AWS

332
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,170
is basically encompassing
these two main objectives,

333
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,750
openness on how we get the data

334
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,000
and make sure that such
kind of data is exposed

335
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,730
to the upper layers

336
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,740
or like actually towards agents,

337
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,440
through the different services from AWS.

338
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,590
And these services, they'd
actually provide the agents

339
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,740
with different capabilities
as you see on the slide.

340
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,810
So leveraging, for example,

341
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,700
as I mentioned about the R apps,

342
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,712
which are tools for these agents.

343
00:18:02,712 --> 00:18:05,250
This is how we actually provide the agents

344
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,750
with the capability to understand

345
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,010
what's happening in the network

346
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,550
and also execute the
changes on these networks.

347
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,520
Maybe here, again, observability
is extremely important

348
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,867
and not only the observability,

349
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:17,490
but the different services in the stack

350
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,780
that we have from AWS.

351
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,392
If you can share with the audience

352
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,450
a little bit more about that.

353
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,100
- Absolutely, thank you, Ibrahim.

354
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,520
So it all starts by ingesting
large volume of data

355
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,290
from a radio access network.

356
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,880
And as you see at the bottom there,

357
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,100
there's the ETL layer,

358
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,880
which is run on AWS services,
serverless services,

359
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,730
containers and fully
managed service by AWS

360
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,730
like Athena and Glue,

361
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,280
and this is for processing,

362
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,490
as I said, data coming from
the radio access network

363
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,490
and prepare them to be
consumed by an ML pipeline.

364
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,840
SageMaker, Amazon SageMaker AI,

365
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,050
that's where the ML pipeline is built

366
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,180
where data are prepared,

367
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,950
the model are trained,

368
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,807
model gets evaluated,

369
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:10,920
and then they are hosted for inference.

370
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,725
End point inference are
then invoked on our app.

371
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:19,050
So our application, which are ML powered,

372
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,923
which consume predictions.

373
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:26,112
So they produce predictions
about network performance

374
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:31,112
and these R apps
contribute, as Ibrahim said,

375
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,720
to the context of the associated agents.

376
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,720
The agents themselves also
rely on other data sources,

377
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,450
other knowledge bases
through RAG techniques.

378
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,930
Data that are basically product guide,

379
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,934
network configuration,

380
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:54,480
network data structure and correlations

381
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,110
amongst different network parameters.

382
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,672
So an agent is then able
to invoke on our app

383
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:03,660
to consume the prediction

384
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,473
and to retrieve relevant knowledge.

385
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,330
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

386
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,090
then provides Ericsson with capabilities

387
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,337
like memory and observability

388
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,700
to offload these functions
on AWS managed services.

389
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,810
So in essence, the full stack
it plays a role SageMaker

390
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:35,520
for producing accurate
predictions through ML

391
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,520
and AgentCore to manage the
full life cycle of agents.

392
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,660
- Thank you very much Christian.

393
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,250
And if I go back again

394
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,830
to the tools that we
provide for these agents,

395
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,410
which basically the R apps,

396
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,410
the radio applications that can actually

397
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,570
provide such kind of prediction

398
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,930
and also understanding like
what's happening on the network.

399
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,800
One example of this is what
we call the cell shapers.

400
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,879
And cell shapers are
reinforcement learning agents

401
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:11,910
where we have a digital twin
representation of the network,

402
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,233
this is how we start.

403
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,510
For those of you who are familiar

404
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,980
with how networks are built
from a radio perspective,

405
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,290
the way that network has been designed

406
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,580
since the early times of
GSM is we have an antenna

407
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,550
and this antenna has a
certain coverage area.

408
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,640
And the very first problem
that engineers try to solve

409
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,580
is that how to optimize
coverage and quality.

410
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,980
This is a multi-generational problem

411
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,770
that started from 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G,

412
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,810
and we'll also see it in 6G

413
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,300
So how can we make sure that

414
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,880
we have the optimal coverage and capacity

415
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,520
and the quality in this network?

416
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,500
So the typical ways of working

417
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,670
that have been around in the
industry was to do simulations

418
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,680
before you even have a deployment

419
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,200
and before the signal is in there.

420
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,960
What we do with reinforcement
learning agents here,

421
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,590
which again, these are the
tools that we provide for agents

422
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,010
on AWS stack.

423
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,820
They reconstruct the radio
environment based on live traffic

424
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,330
and they always learn from
what's happening in the network.

425
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,380
This learning is happening

426
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,700
through a multi objective
reinforcement learning algorithms.

427
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,050
So in order to make sure that

428
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,080
we are always providing the best trade off

429
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,210
between coverage, capacity, and quality

430
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,800
for the different players,

431
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,920
and they are always
learning from the network.

432
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,690
So the traffic changes,

433
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,020
and there are different
aspects that impact that.

434
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,300
For example, introduction of new spectrum

435
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,580
or densification of sites

436
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,680
or maybe addition of new
technology, for example,

437
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,800
like Cloud RAN or like 6G on top of 5G.

438
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,410
So this kind of cell shapers,

439
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,780
they actually belong to what
we call the propose stage,

440
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,430
as I explained in the cognitive loop,

441
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,024
and they help us to realize
such kind of autonomy

442
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:03,960
on top of a stack like AWS.

443
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,310
And these are not the
only agents that we use.

444
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,429
So as you can see here,

445
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:14,880
I provided a little bit of more details

446
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,240
about what kind of agents
that we have developed

447
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,970
and we are now working together with AWS

448
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,680
to bring it on their stack.

449
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,650
So in different parts to
improve user experience,

450
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,930
to improve network operation,

451
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,740
and also to improve efficiency
in operating networks.

452
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,050
The numbers that you see
here are not lab results,

453
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,920
they're actually coming
from real field deployments

454
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,575
for these agents.

455
00:23:39,575 --> 00:23:42,480
Basically, we are able
to measure the impact

456
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,360
and we understand that
the impact that we bring

457
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,680
like through Ericsson technology,

458
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,480
as I explained at the very first slide,

459
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,093
is very profound for the
society and for CSPs.

460
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:56,160
And here I would like to hand
over to my colleague, Dag,

461
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,180
so to tell us,

462
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,010
I told you a little bit
about how we operate.

463
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,950
So Dag can tell us
about how we build that.

464
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,000
- Thank you Ibrahim, thank you everybody.

465
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,010
So let's maybe take a little
bit of a step back, right,

466
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,773
because we have a lot of
sort of AI applications

467
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:14,430
in the networks that Ibrahim talked about.

468
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:18,660
But where does the actual
like intelligence come from?

469
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,850
I mean it partly comes from
like observing the network

470
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,683
and applying, you know,

471
00:24:21,683 --> 00:24:23,010
controlled function theory and so on.

472
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,010
But it also comes from
the fact that we've built

473
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,650
mobile network infrastructure
for four decades, right?

474
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,320
So if we're talking about
intelligent networks,

475
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,870
lots of this is actually
about representing

476
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,210
the intelligence that
we have institutionally,

477
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,080
the people we have,

478
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,663
and the data assets that
we have in the company.

479
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,020
So this is why we created something called

480
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,790
the system comprehension lab,

481
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,929
which has a couple of different objectives

482
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:49,293
that I'll talk about.

483
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,800
But maybe the first thing to notice

484
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,550
is when we look out in the world,

485
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:59,280
like we look at our customers' networks,

486
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,380
we realize that like
a mobile network today

487
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,640
across a big country,

488
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,930
especially here in the US,

489
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,120
they're astoundingly complex,

490
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,150
they're very, very complicated
distributed systems

491
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,330
and they're complicated
both in deployment managing,

492
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,770
like Ibrahim talked about,

493
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,300
but they're also, you know,

494
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,830
quite complicated in design, right?

495
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,160
We have, you know, all the
different kind of radio products

496
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,940
we have, you know, 2G,
4G, 3G, 5G, 6G coexisting,

497
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,354
we have millions of configurations

498
00:25:25,354 --> 00:25:28,653
that are set to operate and
configure these networks.

499
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,810
So our AI journey back some years ago

500
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,640
when we started working with with AWS

501
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,290
started from this notion that

502
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,229
to really solve an
interesting problem with AI

503
00:25:39,229 --> 00:25:41,370
for Ericsson and for our customers,

504
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,080
it is about sort of realizing

505
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,360
that we have this massive,
massive system complexity

506
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,760
out there in the real world.

507
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,160
I mean, and I would say that
this is actually not like

508
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,080
a particularly Ericsson specific problem

509
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,820
and not even a telco
specific problem, right?

510
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,740
If you're designing air crafts

511
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,170
or if you're designing
nuclear power plants,

512
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,450
or if you're designing
something of that nature,

513
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,352
you are dealing with
massive system complexity,

514
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,653
and AI somehow has to help you.

515
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:10,173
So we basically get to this
fundamental question for us,

516
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,740
are we comprehension bound?

517
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,150
It's not even a question at this point,

518
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,230
we are comprehension bound

519
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,160
and when I say us here,
I mean Ericsson's R&D,

520
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,190
we are several tens of thousands of people

521
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,953
and we work in this space
of distributed systems.

522
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,900
And so when you think about sort of,

523
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,890
okay, building 6G

524
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,430
or building the next
generation of 5G sort of,

525
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,770
are we bounded by the
traditional sort of three pillars

526
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:35,820
of project execution,

527
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,610
of cost, and scope, and time?

528
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,750
Or can we actually say that we
are probably more limited by

529
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,128
the amount of, you know, comprehension

530
00:26:45,128 --> 00:26:48,030
that the humans involved
can actually apply

531
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,400
to these processes?

532
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,220
So I mean, I'm not gonna be
super self-critical about this,

533
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,150
as Abraham said,

534
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,520
half of the world's 5G traffic
goes through our product

535
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,540
so we're doing a good job.

536
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,650
But we can still say that, okay,

537
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,210
we're probably comprehension bound

538
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,183
as humans developing mobile
network infrastructure.

539
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,950
So then our AI mission is this notion of,

540
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,140
okay, how can we actually make AI work

541
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,770
in the limit of complex
systems engineering, right?

542
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,110
So again, it doesn't matter
if you think about telco,

543
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,000
you can think about nuclear power,

544
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,460
or aircraft, or whatever,

545
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,123
you know, cars, whatever you
want to think about, right?

546
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:26,070
So for us, the comprehension lab,

547
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,050
it starts from the point that,

548
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,190
okay, so we have

549
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,470
millions and millions
of documents in house.

550
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,360
I mean, we've been doing what we're doing

551
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,150
for three decades or
four decades without AI.

552
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,300
and sort of, okay, so
we have a first mission

553
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,320
to take all of our data,

554
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,520
our in-house data assets

555
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,560
and just make us better at, you know,

556
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,063
designing mobile networks.

557
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,000
And if we do that well,

558
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,340
and we do that with Amazon Web Services

559
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,360
with Bedrock and so on,

560
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,030
that I'll speak to in a little bit,

561
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,190
we sort of put down a foundation
of institutional knowledge

562
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,330
and sort of intelligence about
how mobile networks are built

563
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,090
that we can then layer
on top the kind of data

564
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,290
that Abraham was talking about,

565
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,620
which is when we actually see
these enormous data streams

566
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,540
of what's happening in the
live networks out there.

567
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,740
We can explain what that means,

568
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,580
we can act on that,

569
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,338
we can be sort of intelligently integrated

570
00:28:14,338 --> 00:28:16,443
into that data flow.

571
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,750
And then that lays, again,

572
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,420
the foundations for thinking
about sort of, okay,

573
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,150
how do we make our products
understand our human intents

574
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,040
in ways that like, you know,

575
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,080
again, derived from the
fact that we're sort of

576
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,280
consolidating our institutional knowledge

577
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,306
that makes us better at
designing our products,

578
00:28:34,306 --> 00:28:36,390
and then we are layering on top sort of

579
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:41,390
the real network telemetry
that's out there.

580
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,800
So, I mean, what I wanna
also mention here is that

581
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,200
there is a real disconnect
out there in the world.

582
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,410
I mean, I think we all are a
part of this information flow

583
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,800
where the frontier AI capabilities

584
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,480
that get a lot of
attention, like, you know,

585
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,890
competition level programming,

586
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,970
and competition physics,

587
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,250
and competition mathematics and so on,

588
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,999
they're opening up a very wide gap

589
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:08,054
towards the sort of reality of AI impact

590
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:10,650
in an industrial setting

591
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,191
or in a product development setting.

592
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:15,540
And this gap is actually much, much bigger

593
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,140
than what I think I try
to visualize here, right?

594
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,650
I mean the gap between how
much value we can generate

595
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,780
on our own with AI in product development

596
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,570
versus the state of the art, so to speak.

597
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,696
So we've been working a lot with AWS

598
00:29:29,696 --> 00:29:32,790
to sort of say, okay, what
does it take to close this gap

599
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,260
for a company of Ericsson's size?

600
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,560
I mean, again, we're a fairly
large R&D organization,

601
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,485
we need to close this gap,

602
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,280
so we actually can deliver the value

603
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,530
that Ibrahim spoke about.

604
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,290
And this is about the challenge that,

605
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,510
okay, every organization
has a lot of data,

606
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,770
but nobody has clean data, right?

607
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:50,910
So all of these, you know,

608
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,190
demos you see about competition
programming and so on,

609
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,550
underneath of that is an
enormous amount of data work.

610
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,810
So one has to do that,

611
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,190
and one has to combine, sort of,

612
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,230
different kinds of data assets

613
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,500
across this very complicated design space

614
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,823
that I'm gonna mention.

615
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,033
Then of course,

616
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:09,570
multi-step reasoning
makes this harder, right?

617
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,730
So we were used to saying,
okay, wow, super nice,

618
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,670
now there's a new multi-step reasoning LLM

619
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,070
capable of helping us, but you know,

620
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,720
the more steps you have in reasoning,

621
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,510
if you're applying this to
some complex technical problem,

622
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,090
every step has a chance
to take you off rails

623
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,340
and then you sort of diverge
into nothing very, very quickly

624
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,450
unless you can constrain that
reasoning as we move forward.

625
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,151
So these are some of the challenges

626
00:30:32,151 --> 00:30:34,440
that inspired us to work on AgentCore

627
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,080
and working with Bastian and AWS

628
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,580
over the last couple of years.

629
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,650
So what we basically mean is
information fusion, right?

630
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,170
I mean, we have, again, this is different

631
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,420
in a DevOps setting but we're,

632
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,060
from my standpoint, an embedded
systems company, right?

633
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,450
So we collect requirements,
we systemize, we develop,

634
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,283
we test and integrate,

635
00:30:55,283 --> 00:30:56,700
we release and deploy,

636
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,110
and then our products are out in the field

637
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,643
for a decade or more.

638
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,740
So it is about taking a vastly complicated

639
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,421
sort of set of data assets
throughout this flow

640
00:31:08,421 --> 00:31:10,440
and fusing them in a way

641
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,993
that we haven't been able to do before.

642
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,763
The key question then, I mean for us is,

643
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,460
what are the assumptions,

644
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,840
or what's the architecture that we need

645
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,260
to be able to do this at the
scale of our R&D organization,

646
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,473
which as I said is several tens
of thousands of developers.

647
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,140
The first thing we want to accomplish

648
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,300
is some kind of decoupling.

649
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,533
So you can say, okay,

650
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,150
we have tools like Amazon
Q Developer or Kiro

651
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,060
as a sort of user front end facing tool.

652
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,310
But that in itself doesn't know anything

653
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,280
about Ericsson's, you
know, internal R&D assets.

654
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,050
So through MCP, we sort of said,

655
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,110
okay, let's standardize on
MCP as that decoupling layer

656
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,730
between the front end tools

657
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,670
and whatever we design in-house.

658
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,020
And then we put a lot of effort

659
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,860
in not being sort of
end-to-end AI products,

660
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,990
but building sort of these
specialized AI agents,

661
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,720
the specialized AI
technology that is, you know,

662
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,490
somehow differentiating for Ericsson.

663
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,498
Specialized models,

664
00:32:09,498 --> 00:32:11,070
specialized developer tooling,

665
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,603
and specialized agents.

666
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,850
So I mean, especially in the
specialized agents category,

667
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,390
I would like to invite Bastian
to talk a little bit about

668
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,470
different aspects of this

669
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,050
and how this all came together for us.

670
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:25,883
Thank you.

671
00:32:25,883 --> 00:32:27,660
- Thank you so much, Dag.

672
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,021
Thank you.

673
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:31,050
All right, so thanks
Dag for talking about,

674
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,420
I think the concept of
being comprehension bound

675
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,880
is important to keep in mind here.

676
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,831
It's something that is
important for all enterprises

677
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,980
that have history, I would say, right?

678
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,550
And especially in R&D heavy enterprises.

679
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,460
So it's also great how we tackle that

680
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,290
with the System Comprehension Lab.

681
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,623
And for this, I'm gonna
talk a little bit about

682
00:32:51,623 --> 00:32:54,270
what are important factors

683
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,190
within the system comprehension lab.

684
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,565
What are the key pillars
that we had to work on

685
00:32:58,565 --> 00:33:01,710
to make this successful?

686
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,650
So on one hand, I mean we say
that the agents are the one

687
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,300
that interface with the humans,

688
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,500
but they need the right data,

689
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,259
and we already talked
about this quite a lot now,

690
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:10,920
that there's different data,

691
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,150
different data silos,

692
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,607
they have to be fused together.

693
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:14,975
So how do we do that?

694
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:18,690
One part of that is that
while multi-step reasoning

695
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,160
has its own problems,

696
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,570
multi-step reasoning is one of the things

697
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,800
that is really important for that

698
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,250
because we have to move
beyond the traditional,

699
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,200
or some people call it naive RAG,

700
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,660
where it's just, let me find similar text

701
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,820
in a tech space that you have,

702
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,740
it's just impossible to
get something sensible.

703
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,970
- Yeah.
- Or you get something,

704
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,200
but is it, right?

705
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,850
So it's important to have the system

706
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,401
where you actually
evaluate the user query,

707
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:45,001
where you query different user,

708
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:47,580
where we query different data sources,

709
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,410
combine this data and maybe, you know,

710
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,604
step back, think again,

711
00:33:50,604 --> 00:33:52,320
maybe interact with the user again

712
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,670
to get to the right data
that your agent needs.

713
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,820
So on top of that,

714
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,250
so this is getting the right data,

715
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,140
the concise data at the
right time for the agent.

716
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,170
The other thing that an agent
needs to act upon this right,

717
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,930
is sometimes you need
to go a step further,

718
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,330
and I'll talk about this in
a little bit more detail,

719
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,000
but yes, context depends on

720
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,830
traditional AI ML models at some point,

721
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,810
but it also might need that you need

722
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,370
a custom large language model,

723
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:20,285
and I'll go a little bit
into why that is important

724
00:34:20,285 --> 00:34:22,727
in the next step.

725
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,680
Multi model processing is also important.

726
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,785
I mean, the data that we see,

727
00:34:26,785 --> 00:34:29,970
it's not like we just ingest

728
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:32,739
a very well structured text documents,

729
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,430
there's a lot of different
modalities in the data,

730
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:38,130
and again, also there I'll
show a little bit more detail

731
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,870
in the following slide.

732
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,640
So now we are ready to see,

733
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,970
like the agent can get the right data now,

734
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,817
well even though this is
a simplified view of this,

735
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:49,140
the agent has the right data,

736
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,760
what else is important for it?

737
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,620
Well, it is important
that it can integrate

738
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,870
two downstream tools.

739
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,632
Dag, you didn't mention that now,

740
00:34:56,632 --> 00:34:59,670
but I mean there are these
agents they need to interact

741
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,680
with the physical or digital world, right?

742
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,960
I mean, this is supposed
to be for engineers

743
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,250
to build better products.

744
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,609
Engineers work with a
multitude of different tools

745
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,170
when they do their coding,

746
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,000
when they are engineering.

747
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,610
So maybe they need a connection

748
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,670
to the project planning
tool that they're using,

749
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,440
knowledge that they have there,

750
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,320
the source control tool
that they're using,

751
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,450
different kind of tools and
you need to have access to that

752
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,420
and you would like to remove
all of these paper cuts

753
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,940
for the user

754
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,830
so you hand that over to the agent.

755
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,890
So again, here, you said
this nicely earlier,

756
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,310
MCP is the layer here
that connects all of this.

757
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,800
How do you actually work
with this downstream system?

758
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,860
Well you make these tools
available through MCP

759
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,993
and the agent can use them

760
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:47,130
and they can use each
other through that as well.

761
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,960
So now we have downstream integration.

762
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,100
The other thing that you want to have,

763
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,910
well you want to surface
this information to the user,

764
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,430
and Ericsson follows a nice principle here

765
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:00,360
of making it available to the
user where they want to work.

766
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,000
So sometimes it may be the right thing

767
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,090
to work on a deep research
task within a browser,

768
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,670
so they have a dedicated
frontend for that.

769
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,500
And sometimes it may be
that you want to do that

770
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,498
directly on the IDE
where you do your coding

771
00:36:12,498 --> 00:36:13,980
for a specific project

772
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,620
and then you wanna utilize it
directly through, for example,

773
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,093
Amazon Q developer or Kiro.

774
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,300
So agent has the right tools,

775
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,800
agent has the right data,

776
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,210
but there's more to it

777
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,330
and maybe the more fluffy
the non-functional pieces

778
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,620
that are important.

779
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,490
So we've already talked about
observability quite a lot.

780
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,700
It is important to understand
what tools are called.

781
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,800
Did we select the right tools?

782
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,480
Are they relevant for the task?

783
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,400
Do they get the right output?

784
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,350
Do we get the right context?

785
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,680
Is the context that where we have created

786
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,970
through the multi-step reasoning

787
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,100
actually relevant for the
question that was asked

788
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,610
or for the task that the
agent is supposed to work on?

789
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,470
Observability also goes beyond that.

790
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,990
I mean these systems are not just agent

791
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,100
and maybe a model somewhere,

792
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,860
those are complex,

793
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,630
or at least complicated systems

794
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,000
with many moving pieces.

795
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,770
So you have your regular application,

796
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,210
you have your models,

797
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,130
but you also have data sources,

798
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,500
you have pipelines to
process data and all of that.

799
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,900
So there's a lot of things
that need to keep track on,

800
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,300
so observability is utmost of importance.

801
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,860
Then scalable architecture,

802
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm not gonna focus too much

803
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,860
on the technical piece of that,

804
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,210
also that's important, right?

805
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,662
And Ericsson is using AgentCore,

806
00:37:28,662 --> 00:37:29,760
so Bedrock AgentCore,

807
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,780
as one of the main core pieces
of that to make that easy

808
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,440
so you get this serverless experience

809
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,810
of running your agents,

810
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:42,750
but there is another part to scalability,

811
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,120
and that's the organizational scalability.

812
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,540
In essence, what you have here
is a two-sided marketplace

813
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,960
where you have teams that have
expertise in certain domains

814
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,790
and they want to make this available.

815
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,160
They wanna make this available
through these agents,

816
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,050
but they may not
necessarily want to become

817
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,960
experts in agentic AI,

818
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,360
or how to train models.

819
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,010
That's maybe not what they want to do.

820
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,020
So you need to be able
to onboard these teams

821
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,370
and their knowledge quickly,

822
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,200
and this is what Ericsson
is doing really nicely

823
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,190
with blueprints and actually
agents to help onboard teams

824
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,010
onto the system.

825
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,390
So two-sided marketplace,

826
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,470
well you have the producer side

827
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,090
and you have the consumer side.

828
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,180
The consumers also need
to be able to be onboard

829
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,070
and there's enablement,

830
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,790
there is making sure that
they're using the system

831
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,753
in a way that it makes sense

832
00:38:35,753 --> 00:38:38,700
from a limit perspective.

833
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,677
So are they overusing that?

834
00:38:39,677 --> 00:38:41,810
I mean there's cost involved with LLMs.

835
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,770
So is this working right?

836
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,639
You also need to be able to make sure

837
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:50,100
that these users can access
the tools that they should,

838
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,870
but probably not everything, right?

839
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,870
So there's a certain amount of
authentication authorization

840
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,890
involved here as well.

841
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,290
So that's the scalable architecture piece.

842
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,760
Lastly, but it's not the least,

843
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,340
it's actually something that
I personally talk about first

844
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,350
in every meeting when there
is agentic AI use case,

845
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,720
evaluation needs to come first.

846
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,063
The only constant that you
have in agentic AI projects

847
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:10,200
is change,

848
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,500
and it's a very high velocity
change that we see here.

849
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,590
So the only way that you
can actually keep up with

850
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,210
the latest model that you want to try,

851
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,550
the latest technique and
pattern that you want to try,

852
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,350
or simply update the data that you have,

853
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,810
is you need to be able to understand,

854
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,580
is this change that are introduced now

855
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,980
at least as good as yesterday?

856
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,420
And that only works if you build

857
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,883
a robust evaluation
framework from day one.

858
00:39:34,727 --> 00:39:37,620
All right, moving on into something.

859
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:42,620
I'll take some time to explain
certain parts of the system

860
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,420
if we want to talk about
this system in its entirety,

861
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,280
we have a couple of days in front of us,

862
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,020
so I'll focus on some things

863
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,790
that I think are really critical.

864
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:54,330
First one is the data processing piece.

865
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:57,030
Data processing is
complicated in this sense,

866
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,890
it's actually one of the
most complicated pieces

867
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,240
of the entire thing.

868
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,120
And this is highly simplified,

869
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,880
but I just wanna run through
the most important pieces.

870
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,110
So we basically have,

871
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,670
well, we have the data,

872
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,950
the raw data, and this
is the hardest part.

873
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,110
We have a pipeline that
makes sense of this data,

874
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,430
that processes this data

875
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,890
and then makes it
available in data storage

876
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,830
that is useful for the
specific task for the agents.

877
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,120
On the data side,

878
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,900
problem is, well this
is not homogeneous data.

879
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,700
You have data in many different formats,

880
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,980
whether that is your PDF, Word document,

881
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,950
a image of a napkin somewhere,

882
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,930
you have lots of different data.

883
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,700
On top of that, you also have data

884
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,410
that is super well structured

885
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,780
and that may come from
a relational database.

886
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,930
And on the other hand you
have super unstructured data

887
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,700
spread around your data lake.

888
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,870
How do you make sense of that?

889
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,850
And then the third dimension in data

890
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,670
is maturity or authority.

891
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,980
So what does it mean?

892
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,330
Is this something that I can trust?

893
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,460
Is this something that can give me

894
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,410
a definitive and authoritative answer?

895
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,150
So since in this data sources,

896
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,430
you have everything from specifications,

897
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:06,090
like maybe you have a
3GPP specification too,

898
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,380
coming back to the napkin,

899
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,580
some napkin of an idea

900
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,830
that some engineers drew during lunch.

901
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,780
It's different kind of data

902
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,030
that you need to evaluate
differently by the agent.

903
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,380
So now you have this pieces

904
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,650
moving over to the data processing part.

905
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,447
Ericsson uses AWS Batch

906
00:41:21,447 --> 00:41:24,034
and other services in here from AWS

907
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:27,450
to make the most out of this data.

908
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,910
Sometimes it's about
integration to the data sources,

909
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,280
but the more interesting parts are

910
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,380
how do I actually extract the metadata

911
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,300
'cause when you extract an image

912
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,470
from a document that you have,

913
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,530
you want to make sure that
where does it come from?

914
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,090
Does it fit to that document?

915
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,380
Where's this document coming from?

916
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,330
Can I resurface this later on?

917
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,730
But you may also have
more interesting tasks.

918
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,620
I mean obviously this is engineering,

919
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,200
so you'll have mathematical expressions,

920
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,250
you'll have tables of data
that you need to extract

921
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,268
and you need to do that well.

922
00:41:57,268 --> 00:41:58,530
It's not good enough

923
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,680
that you get close
enough in these systems.

924
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,600
So you have these different
processing pipelines.

925
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,120
In the end they make that
available to the agent

926
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,520
through, for example, Amazon
Bedrock Knowledge Bases.

927
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,910
If you need more of a like
the traditional RAG approach.

928
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,560
But again, this can be combined

929
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,350
with multi-step reasoning
later on in the agents.

930
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,650
On top of the, if you
need a structured search

931
00:42:19,979 --> 00:42:22,110
through semantic search,

932
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,120
you can use Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases

933
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,520
for example on OpenSearch Serverless.

934
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,710
If you need more information
about the entities,

935
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,910
how they relate to each other,

936
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,740
a graph database is a good choice

937
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,720
and that's also used in the system.

938
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,360
And lastly, you may want to
use some ad hoc analytics

939
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,480
or other structured queries

940
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,370
and you can use Amazon Redshift in there.

941
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,350
Also all of this can actually be behind

942
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,989
the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base,

943
00:42:44,989 --> 00:42:47,280
which can make it relatively easy

944
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,170
for you to get started with that.

945
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,060
But sometimes you need a
little bit more customization

946
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,653
as we've done in this case.

947
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,130
All right, next piece.

948
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,260
So we have the right
data where we need it.

949
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,872
There is other parts though, right?

950
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:03,000
I already hinted at there is
a custom large language model

951
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,050
that has to be trained.

952
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,520
Why does it has to be trained?

953
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,610
Well, Ericsson provides or
creates their own hardware,

954
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,570
their own silicon.

955
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,670
That silicon, well you have your own

956
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,280
proprietary frameworks and
language on top of that.

957
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,070
So helping your engineers

958
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,170
with off the shelf large language models

959
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,750
for coding related task

960
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,240
is just not gonna gonna do the trick.

961
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,270
You need to be able to
produce the right content

962
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,640
and in that case, Ericsson realized

963
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,307
it's important to train
our own model on that,

964
00:43:32,307 --> 00:43:34,410
and this is what we have on this slide.

965
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,300
I'm not gonna go into
super much detail here.

966
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,070
This is yet another two day session

967
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,480
if we want to go into detail.

968
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,795
But suffice to say,

969
00:43:40,795 --> 00:43:42,600
you need to source code,

970
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,040
you need system documentation

971
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,417
or code documentation for that.

972
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:48,420
You need to run it through
a pre-processing pipeline

973
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,743
to get high quality
data asset for training,

974
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,190
in this case, this is done
with continued pre-training,

975
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:57,570
instruct fine tuning,

976
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,950
and reinforcement learning

977
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,930
with human feedback on top of that

978
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:04,530
to get the best possible model
that you can then host on,

979
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:05,700
depending on the different models

980
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,990
'cause there's always a change

981
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,280
in what's the best model.

982
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:13,140
Sometimes that works well on
Bedrock Custom Model Import

983
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,097
and other times it's hosted on EC2.

984
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,090
And then of course evaluation is king,

985
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,640
so this is something

986
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,533
that you constantly evaluate and retrain.

987
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,420
Moving on to the last architecture slide

988
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,370
where I want to just bring the whole thing

989
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,203
a little bit together.

990
00:44:30,203 --> 00:44:31,520
How does it look at runtime?

991
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,140
Let's start with the engineer again.

992
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,480
The engineer, well again,
they want to use it

993
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,313
where it makes sense,

994
00:44:37,313 --> 00:44:38,460
where they work.

995
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,820
So either in a dedicated front end

996
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,780
or you use it through
Amazon Q Developer or Kiro.

997
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,270
The point of that is that, well,

998
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,350
how do you utilize that,

999
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,120
how do you actually integrate that?

1000
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,757
Or use the MCP gateway that
Ericsson has created for that,

1001
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:57,120
the MCP gateway can then surface tools

1002
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,900
for the assistance that we
have on the left side here

1003
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,340
for the network engineer.

1004
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:05,940
It can be agents and the
MCP gateway is actually

1005
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,940
the integration point where
agents can talk to tools,

1006
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,510
agents can talk to agents

1007
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,883
and even tools could well talk to agents.

1008
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,810
Both of the tools that we have there,

1009
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,370
sometimes it's a tool that already exists

1010
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,230
and you just want to make it available

1011
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,063
and you could do that

1012
00:45:23,063 --> 00:45:25,260
through AgentCore Gateway, for example,

1013
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,500
sometimes it may be an
original MCP server or a tool,

1014
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,500
and then you can run that
on the AgentCore Runtime.

1015
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,480
The AgentCore Runtime is
mainly used however now

1016
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,650
for running agents,

1017
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,660
and here's just a selection
of different agents

1018
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,590
that we have here.

1019
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,420
So maybe it is a 3G PP agent,

1020
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,880
maybe an agent that is more specialized

1021
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,170
in a specific feature.

1022
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,720
So you have LTE experts for example,

1023
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,800
that you're running there,

1024
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,530
plenty of other specialized agents.

1025
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,060
And then you have, for example,

1026
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,088
the code generation agent,

1027
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:53,280
which then in turn,

1028
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,050
and you look to the
right side of this slide,

1029
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,480
you'll see that we have integration

1030
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,470
with large language models,

1031
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,630
and agent obviously is
just a piece of code

1032
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,430
that needs to integrate
within large language model

1033
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,570
for orchestration.

1034
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,370
And here you can either fall back

1035
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:09,460
on the many models available on Bedrock

1036
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:12,870
as a model provider,

1037
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,280
or you can use your custom models.

1038
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,160
And again, AgentCore,
the beauty of that is

1039
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,060
it's super flexible,

1040
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,210
so if you do have a
on-prem model for example,

1041
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,370
you can integrate that
easily there as well.

1042
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:24,810
All right, last piece,

1043
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:26,220
agents needs knowledge

1044
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,090
and they can integrate

1045
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,280
with many of the different
knowledge layers here.

1046
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,750
It's relatively easy here,

1047
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,780
for example, if you use a
agent framework like Strands,

1048
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,700
you can relatively easy integrate directly

1049
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,450
into, for example, the
Bedrock Knowledge Bases.

1050
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:42,300
Right, this wraps up the main pieces

1051
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,590
of the architecture here,

1052
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,120
but then you have observability,

1053
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,473
again, that's important we
said a couple of times now.

1054
00:46:47,473 --> 00:46:49,830
AgentCore observability
makes this possible,

1055
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:51,720
it's compatible with OpenTelemetry,

1056
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,402
it's very easy to look at
the entire end-to-end stack

1057
00:46:54,402 --> 00:46:56,040
of your application

1058
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,900
and it makes a lot of
sense if you integrate it

1059
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,840
with other APM traces that you have

1060
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,100
maybe across the entire stack.

1061
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,510
And the entire stack means,

1062
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,700
well there's applications,
frontend applications,

1063
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,290
there's lambdas here and there,

1064
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,060
there's containers running there and there

1065
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,650
so you want to have an
entire picture of that,

1066
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,062
and that's why observability is important,

1067
00:47:13,062 --> 00:47:15,428
specifically for agent traceability,

1068
00:47:15,428 --> 00:47:19,053
you have AgentCore
Observability as a primitive.

1069
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,980
Then we also said identity is important,

1070
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,370
so you need to make sure

1071
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:26,133
that an agent can only do
what they're supposed to do.

1072
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,850
AgentCore Identity makes
it possible you to manage

1073
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:34,350
inbound and outbound
identities so you can make sure

1074
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:35,820
that the agents and the users

1075
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,320
can only get to what they need to

1076
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,000
and you can go all the way down

1077
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,660
to the role level
authorization of your data

1078
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,103
in your data sources.

1079
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:47,040
And last but not least, memory.

1080
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,090
Memory wraps it up.

1081
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:51,300
I mean, getting the right context

1082
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,320
for your agent is important

1083
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,870
and sometimes you want to
transport it over sessions

1084
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,487
so memory is one of
the pieces that is used

1085
00:47:56,487 --> 00:48:01,487
to transport preferences
and topics across sessions.

1086
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,010
So AgentCore was core, right?

1087
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:05,843
- So-
- Of course.

1088
00:48:05,843 --> 00:48:07,800
- I have a quote here,

1089
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,890
but I think it's better if you
just maybe narrate this one.

1090
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,350
- Right, so thank you Bastian.

1091
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:17,280
Great to see the work of
the lab kind of compressed.

1092
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,020
I mean we're quite serious.

1093
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,850
I mean this is quite a
big challenge to take,

1094
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,374
sort of the complexity that we face

1095
00:48:22,374 --> 00:48:25,920
when we look at mobile
network in deployment,

1096
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,120
or in engineering, right?

1097
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,200
And all of that complexity

1098
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,050
and sort of how do we actually, you know,

1099
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,370
pull together all these pieces

1100
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,773
so that we tackle the challenge
that I post there, right?

1101
00:48:34,773 --> 00:48:38,400
With the frontier of AI
advancing much faster

1102
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,470
than the out of the box
kind of industrial use cases

1103
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:41,303
of AI do.

1104
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,190
So we've been throwing requirements

1105
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,493
towards Bastian and the AWS team.

1106
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:49,500
I mean, I would say almost,

1107
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,450
I mean to test you maybe a little bit?

1108
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:54,360
No, not quite, but to really
push the collaboration

1109
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,620
to a new gear.

1110
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,997
And so that ended up being sort of

1111
00:48:57,997 --> 00:48:59,850
one of the drivers for AgentCore

1112
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,380
that for us is the foundation

1113
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,280
where we can sort of say,

1114
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,850
okay, let's get help at
this knowledge fusion layer

1115
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:09,000
and get, I mean, again, to kind
of drink our own champagne,

1116
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,680
to take complexity out, right?

1117
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,850
So we don't wanna be in the business

1118
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,350
of running Kubernetes clusters,

1119
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,680
much rather have that
offloaded to the Core platform

1120
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,370
and sort of AgentCore has been a key piece

1121
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:21,663
of how we we scale.

1122
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,003
Good.
- Thank you so much.
