00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,710
- Hello, good afternoon.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,660
Thank you for making time to come join me.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,120
Talk about, as you can
see from the title slide,

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,850
Reimagining Business
Processes with Joule Agents.

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,710
I'm Walter Sun and I lead

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,680
the AI product engineering team at SAP.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,470
So just to give you, put
everyone on the same page,

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,300
I just want to share a high level diagram

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,520
of what we do in business AI at SAP.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,810
I'll start bottoms up.

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,520
At the bottom is applications.

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,530
For those of you now that
are familiar with SAP,

13
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,140
we have products across
all lines of businesses

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,780
like human capital management,
we have success factors,

15
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,550
for travel, we have Concur,

16
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,440
for procurement, we have Ariba,

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,690
and then for ERP, we have S4,

18
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,960
which is used by most of
the Fortune 500 companies.

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,320
All this is supported
with embedded AI features.

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,620
And so we build features
that come out of the box.

21
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,260
If you get business OCR, you
get document understanding,

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,470
when you scan a receipt for
Concur, that comes from AI.

23
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,480
That's kind of embedded
in all the solutions.

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,340
What we've done is we've
gone a step beyond that

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,860
and I'll talk about that today with Joule.

26
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,780
Above that, first of all, the data layer,

27
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,360
we have a product called
the Business Data Cloud.

28
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,580
This product is to allow you

29
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,290
to bring all your data to one place

30
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,210
and by virtue of it being the same place

31
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,170
allows you to get insights

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,930
across all your lines of
businesses at one place.

33
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,570
And above that is all the
AI that we build on top.

34
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,240
So Joule, as I mentioned,
is our AI co-pilot,

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,560
if you're not familiar with that.

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,510
And the idea with Joule is that

37
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,540
it connects with natural language

38
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,410
to each of your business processes.

39
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,850
And the beauty of that is it makes it

40
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,530
quick and easy for new hires.

41
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,870
So if a new hire at your
company and you use SAP,

42
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,640
they can use natural language to execute

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,760
without needing to
understand the OS very well

44
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,347
or the UX very well.

45
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,590
And so for instance, if you say you joined

46
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,790
and you want to take a vacation

47
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,770
for the holidays, it's December now,

48
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,390
say, "Hey, I want to take
like three days of vacation

49
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,470
before Christmas."

50
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,270
You can do that with
natural language in Joule

51
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,650
and it goes into success factors

52
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,120
and makes that change for you

53
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,310
rather than you understanding
where you need to go.

54
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,680
So that actually is kind
of the first step of Joule.

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,300
natural language to processes, right?

56
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,198
And actions beyond that,
you know, is agents.

57
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:01,650
And agents is a big topic.

58
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,840
You heard Matt Garman talk
a lot about this morning.

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,100
We'll talk more about it today as well

60
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,350
and how we are using it at SAP.

61
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,657
But with that, each of
the lines of business,

62
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:11,790
as you see here, finance,
procurement, supply chain,

63
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,550
each of them have agents
that you can interact with.

64
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,410
The additional value is that these agents

65
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,470
can interact across different
lines of businesses.

66
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,570
And that's kind of the
value add of having SAP

67
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,640
having applications across all lines.

68
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,890
For instance, if you are,
let's say a business person

69
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,540
and you wanted to figure
out how to book a trip

70
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,890
to visit your top clients,

71
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,810
you would have to access your CRM tool,

72
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,640
which we have a product called CX.

73
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,990
And then once you find that information,

74
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,780
you actually go to a travel
tool, which would be Concur.

75
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,550
And so with multi-agent communication,

76
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,020
you can do all that in one place.

77
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,210
And I'll talk a little bit
about how all that works.

78
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,947
But I'll first kind of mention
like the motivation, right?

79
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:49,710
You know, we all talk about agents,

80
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,970
everyone talks about agents.

81
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,410
How do I motivate, how
do we motivate this,

82
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,680
this topic in case you're not
convinced this is valuable.

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,530
If you go 15 years ago or
maybe even 10 years ago,

84
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,910
you might go on a trip.

85
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,743
Let's say you're in LA,

86
00:03:00,743 --> 00:03:02,520
you want to come to "re:Invent" in Vegas,

87
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,170
you want to travel, you get a map,

88
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,630
or you might go to AAA
or a local travel company

89
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,210
and say, "Give me a map
and an itinerary for how

90
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,940
to go from LA to Las Vegas."

91
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,770
Then you go to Palm Springs or whatever

92
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,020
and you go through this detailed map

93
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,495
and then you get it all
figured out like a week before

94
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:20,790
and then you leave like say
Monday, come here, right?

95
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,500
Yesterday, you come here.

96
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,090
What you do also, this
is the same thing you do

97
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,710
with applications in the
past, as I mentioned,

98
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,210
if you want to book a...

99
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,560
I'll use this example again and again,

100
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,936
if you want to visit your top customers,

101
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:32,760
you actually would first
find out who they are.

102
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,400
So you go to your CRM tool,
you find out who they are

103
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,320
and then you say, okay, you
talk to your administrator

104
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,386
or somebody or a travel agency say

105
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:40,440
"I need to have book
trips to these locations,

106
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,910
how will I make it work?" Right?

107
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,050
So the idea is you plan ahead
and then you execute, right?

108
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,510
With agents, you can actually
do it basically real time

109
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,600
the same way you do travel
now with GPS, right?

110
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,187
So you go on, let's say
if you were from in LA

111
00:03:53,187 --> 00:03:55,410
and you wanted to come to Las Vegas,

112
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,580
you would probably not even need

113
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,840
to spend days and days planning.

114
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,120
You would just say, "I'll put in my GPS,

115
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,410
we'll see what happens."

116
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,520
And that's not actually even worse.

117
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,890
It's actually even better
than it was 10, 15 years ago

118
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,710
because 10, 15 years ago,
you plan it two weeks ago

119
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,800
and then let's say a road
closes like over Thanksgiving,

120
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,690
you don't know that and
you get stuck, right?

121
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,150
GPS gives you real time
traffic, real time conditions

122
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,550
and it can readjust you by the same way.

123
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,160
By the same token, this
example I gave you for agents

124
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,570
maybe two weeks ago, you figured out

125
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,550
who your top five customers are,

126
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,290
customers, A, B, C, and D.

127
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,123
And you also want to bring

128
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:29,610
a couple of your colleagues
along, Jane and John.

129
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,600
But by the time you travel,

130
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,910
maybe John's transferred
a different division,

131
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,800
maybe one of your top five
customers is out of town,

132
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,050
maybe customer A happens
to be at "re:Invent"

133
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,550
and they can't meet with you.

134
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,280
So you actually have the
ability to use agents

135
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,590
that dynamically also
adapt to the needs as well.

136
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,920
So it's a very analogy I
like is that basically you,

137
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,360
we all know how we used the maps before

138
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,680
and how we do maps now,

139
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,600
for many of you who haven't
started using agents,

140
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,670
you do a lot of things
manually now, piece by piece,

141
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,250
in the future you can use
agents to do them all together

142
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,960
and also dynamically
in a way that actually

143
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,073
is optimal as well.

144
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:03,000
And so the question is
why are agents special?

145
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,160
I think the first thing
is idea of reasoning.

146
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,540
A lot of people aren't super comfortable

147
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,240
with the idea that machines
or systems can reason, right?

148
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,370
But the reality is that, you know,

149
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,460
having this ability
brings a lot more power.

150
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,140
The same reason idea, if you hire,

151
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,390
I used the analogy that agents
are like junior assistants

152
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,260
that you hire,

153
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,060
you hire a college graduate,

154
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,250
the first few days or few
months they're on a job,

155
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,750
you don't want them to
think on their own too much

156
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,370
because it's risky and things can happen.

157
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,390
So you tell them what to do

158
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,980
and you follow them closely, right?

159
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,140
But after time you let
them do their own thing.

160
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,970
And so the idea is that
you let them reason later

161
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,410
initially you don't let
them reason at all, right?

162
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,970
And this is the same with machines,

163
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,230
you know, in the past we
don't let them reason,

164
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,900
we just say here's task A, task B, task C,

165
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,010
complete that, right?

166
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,830
A give me a list of top
customers, I have that,

167
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,030
B, given these customers,

168
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,370
find me flights to these locations, right?

169
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,460
Now you can say these agents
can actually reason and say

170
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,810
if you want to know who
your top customers are,

171
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,950
you want to visit them,

172
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,790
you can contact a travel
agent, which is Concur for us.

173
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,220
And beyond that, these
agents also can reason

174
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,900
about what's logical.

175
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,230
I'm not going to book four
trips to Chicago, New York,

176
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,770
Los Angeles, and San Francisco
and Miami the same day

177
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,360
because it's not logical, right?

178
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,330
These systems, I've learned
basic logic of mapping

179
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,220
and locations and these type of things

180
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,370
can help you apply logic
and get the right answer.

181
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,470
And this is just an easy
example of visually map,

182
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,370
you know, geo mapping.

183
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,330
But this actually works

184
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,370
in complex business processes as well.

185
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,020
These models are trained on so much data

186
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,103
and so much information

187
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:27,396
that you know what's logical.

188
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:32,396
If you want to, let's say buy
a ton of inventory from Asia

189
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,080
over Black Friday and shipping

190
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,310
and get it ready for the holidays,

191
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,660
the system will tell you, in the past,

192
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,070
other companies have tried this,

193
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,510
it's not worked out too well, right?

194
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,460
It takes much more longer

195
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,760
because weather conditions are
worse in the fall, late fall

196
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,340
people are all buying
inventory at that time.

197
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,010
So basically these systems
can help correct errors

198
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,843
that you don't know.

199
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,140
And the idea is that it can plan,

200
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,100
it can also take action as well.

201
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,770
And all of this is kind of the
new age of what's happening

202
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,198
and it makes it a lot easier
for us to get things done.

203
00:06:58,198 --> 00:06:59,850
And so I talked a little
bit about what we do,

204
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,920
but you know, the very first slide,

205
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,920
I gave a quick overview
of the application layer,

206
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,080
the data layer and the Joule agents.

207
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,880
But I think the point I guess
I want to talk about the top

208
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,730
is that these agents
iterated around themselves

209
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,560
and we also have analytics agents as well.

210
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,970
These analytics agents can analyze

211
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,440
how your agents are performing,

212
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,610
making sure you do better.

213
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,650
We have RPA agents that
help you automate as well.

214
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,470
We have also system trigger
agents that you can follow rules

215
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,750
so that these aren't reactive agents

216
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,830
but they're proactive as well.

217
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,663
Meaning that they can say,

218
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:29,580
"Hey, when I an email from
our CEO, do X, Y, and Z."

219
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,920
Versus like wait for you to use Joule

220
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,040
or use the chat window to make a request.

221
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,110
And so the idea also is,
I mentioned before that

222
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,060
because we have all lines of businesses,

223
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,130
you can actually build
agents across all lines.

224
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,870
You have data across
all lines of businesses,

225
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,610
so the systems understand all of that.

226
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,640
And by having that full context,
you get a lot more done.

227
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,100
And beyond that, suppose
you have your own,

228
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,570
let's say an old org chart app

229
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,520
that you built 25, 30 years ago.

230
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,172
We have Joule studio that lets you extend

231
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:57,630
and build up on top of
what's in our system.

232
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,060
So the idea is that you
can extend what's available

233
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,010
and still use Joule to access
more than just what's in SAP.

234
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,200
And all this happens, this
is just an example like

235
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,200
how you can apply questions that actually

236
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,990
can answer very specific
things in your company.

237
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,270
Show me my sales reps by revenue.

238
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,400
And so you get these top five sales reps.

239
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,140
Obviously if you ask a
large language model,

240
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,310
this public model,

241
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,360
you're not going to get
any information like this

242
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,220
because there's no information
about your company, right?

243
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,980
So all of this is carefully
grounded in your data

244
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,030
and that's an important part of me,

245
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,863
I think you understand the grounding is

246
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:29,880
but the idea that a language model

247
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,290
is trained on public data,

248
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,360
but not all data you have is public,

249
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,340
models aren't run real time

250
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,620
so you need grounding that
gives you real time data, right?

251
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,090
If you ask about what happened

252
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,770
in today's keynote from Matt Garmin,

253
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,230
you need a model that has
some grounding of news

254
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,400
that can get that information.

255
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,960
You also need for your company

256
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,773
run information that's private.

257
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:49,770
You know, you have your, let's
say the most common thing

258
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,800
I talk about is your vacation policy.

259
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
Every company has a different policy

260
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,130
and yours is even different
from your colleagues

261
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,150
based on how long you've
been there, right?

262
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,040
So basically it needs to be grounded in

263
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,540
what the company policies are

264
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,000
and also needs to be
grounded in your profile.

265
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,800
All that information is
provided automatically in Joule.

266
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,570
So now I'll talk about
basically our vision

267
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,950
and goals for agents.

268
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,810
It's basically three pronged.

269
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,920
The first thing is we want to make sure

270
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,590
that there are agents available
to you out of the box.

271
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,870
So we want to empower
you with prebuilt agents,

272
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,000
but as I mentioned, you
might not have everything

273
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,470
you need already out of the box.

274
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,060
You might have something
you want to use yourself.

275
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,710
So we're democratizing the ability for you

276
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,500
to develop your own agents
and plug them into the system.

277
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,670
That's the second mission.

278
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,900
And then third mission is that

279
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,888
we're also not restricting
you to the SAP ecosystem.

280
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:36,330
We know that you may have
other product providers

281
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,400
like we're here with AWS at "re:Invent",

282
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,730
you might use you know, Agent
Space or other technologies.

283
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,010
And so the idea is that
you would actually,

284
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,530
we have this technology we
apply with agent to agent,

285
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,990
it lets you work across
agent technologies.

286
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,420
And so I'll talk about as a third mission.

287
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,060
So starting with the first
mission, we have pre-built agents

288
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,180
and now 25 agents are
available already in production

289
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,550
and we have 15 more going to
production by end of the year,

290
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,540
end of this month.

291
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,740
And so you can sort of see a list of them

292
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,390
you have things like accounts receivable,

293
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,670
dispute resolution, and as I mentioned,

294
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,460
many of these are system
triggered dispute resolution.

295
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,660
You don't want to go to the machine

296
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,130
and say what disputes do I have?

297
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,040
Rather, if a dispute happens,
it comes in by email,

298
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,210
you want to be alerted by it, right?

299
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,610
So with these agents that
are system triggered as well,

300
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,613
that can act proactively
to you and your needs.

301
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,660
And here, I'll show two examples.

302
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,180
One is a catalog optimization agent.

303
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,530
A lot of people who are in retail

304
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,600
have a catalog of the inventory of items,

305
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,790
but these inventory items
update every day, right?

306
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,470
You might have a new version of a product,

307
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,580
you might sell out of a product,

308
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,070
you might want to transition
product A to product B,

309
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,210
you know, equivalent.

310
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,320
And the whole idea behind this is

311
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,330
that it's very difficult
to do this manually.

312
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,150
And so a catalog optimization agents

313
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,890
an agent that helps
you update in real time

314
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,560
what's happening based off
of your incoming orders

315
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,850
and outgoing sales.

316
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,260
And so we found that by using this agent,

317
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,493
people are reducing time to
translate catalog data by 70%.

318
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:57,600
And we also found that people are spending

319
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,910
65% less time maintaining assets.

320
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,650
And you can imagine that's
the case for a retail company

321
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,728
if any of you are in that business.

322
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:07,260
The other example is
basically accounting accruals.

323
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,060
Accruals is the idea
that there's something

324
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,497
that's kind of that's building up

325
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:13,213
but you haven't been billed yet.

326
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:15,270
Like you have a credit card
bill, you pay every month

327
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,890
during the month you
accrue charges, right?

328
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,600
Which you can see, but in some cases,

329
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,950
you can't see quite as readily.

330
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,260
For instance, an example that
you may see is electricity.

331
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,440
Your electricity bill, you use
electricity at home every day

332
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,390
and at the end of the
month or so you get billed

333
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,860
and typically you can assume it's linear,

334
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,020
but you know as the weather
gets colder in the fall

335
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,340
you might use more electricity.

336
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,723
And so basically having a agent

337
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:36,180
that helps you understand your policy,

338
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,950
understanding historical transactions

339
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,350
and using that to extrapolate
what your numbers are

340
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,183
quite valuable.

341
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,210
And I'll show you a
demonstration for this,

342
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,380
but just to show you,

343
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,110
customers have used this
on 80% time reduction

344
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,580
in calculating the accruals

345
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,950
and a 50% reduction time
to review the amounts

346
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,630
and posting entries.

347
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,860
So I'll show you an example.

348
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,720
This actually the
accruals agent in action.

349
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,900
And so there's two
unprocessed accruals here

350
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,160
and let me just show you the first one,

351
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,600
This one, you look into this video

352
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,400
and I'm trying to make,
keep it more interactive

353
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,410
by showing a few demos
right here you're saying

354
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,380
I have this one item that's
not paid, not accrued yet.

355
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,340
I want to know what it is.

356
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,050
And so you can sort of see the reasoning,

357
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,910
the reasoning tells
you what it's been told

358
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,560
in the system and I'll
show you in a minute,

359
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,200
the workflow says go to
your policy documents

360
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,730
and figure out how we do accruals.

361
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,230
And the way we do accruals is two things.

362
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,750
One is you extrapolate by
based on number of days,

363
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,210
but you also have a year
over year adjustment.

364
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,310
And so that basically this
accruals agent does that.

365
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,627
And you'll see the flow chart here

366
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:29,730
and you see the flow chart
here as you look below

367
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,060
is accounting policy
handbook at the very bottom,

368
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:33,893
the first thing.

369
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:36,630
And over here you have the
posted accruals as well.

370
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,990
So basically you have your
company policy as rounding,

371
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,060
you have your post-it actual accruals

372
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,120
and you take the actual accruals,
your policy and the rules

373
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,470
and come up with a a new number, right?

374
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,060
And this is kind of the recommendation

375
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,200
and if you're happy
with the recommendation,

376
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,850
you just say okay, and you're done.

377
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,620
Obviously you'll always
have human in the loop.

378
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,700
So if you're not happy with the number,

379
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,870
you can always adjust it.

380
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,730
But it tells you with transparency

381
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,743
how it came up with the 63.25 number.

382
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,800
Now that beyond just doing the math,

383
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,000
you can see this other case of like

384
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,500
looking and solving
more difficult problems.

385
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,380
This one has a error, you
see the red box on top.

386
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,210
And the problem is there's
no cost center applied

387
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,190
to this particular example.

388
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,040
So what you want to do is
say, okay, let me use Joule,

389
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,630
which is our AI copilot

390
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,030
and ask and find out
what is the cost center.

391
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,530
This happens to me a lot myself for real.

392
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,363
People say, Hey Walter,

393
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:22,410
can I use your cost center for something?

394
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,250
And I have a cost center,

395
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,810
but I don't know off the top of my head,

396
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,643
Joule knows what it is.

397
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:27,030
You say, "Hey, help me solve this problem,

398
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,610
this particular one doesn't
have a cost center."

399
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,637
And immediately Joule says,

400
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:32,850
"I recommend you use the
cost center for this value

401
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,920
and this value is potentially
your cost center."

402
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,660
And you say yes, do you
want to do this or no,

403
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,730
again, you're in charge.

404
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,760
And once you say yes, you
actually get it applied.

405
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,050
And then it says, okay,
now that I have it applied,

406
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,100
everything else is fine.

407
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,030
Should I post this accrual?

408
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,280
And you say yes, you go
ahead and you're done.

409
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,727
And so we saw two cases
we just talked about

410
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:50,970
of the accruals agent,

411
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,760
one is taking following company policy,

412
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,020
the other is actually fixing an error

413
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,250
that was in the system.

414
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,641
So that's kind of just two examples of

415
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:59,463
how you can use the accruals agent.

416
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,760
And so the value of this, as I mentioned,

417
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,960
is proactive alerting, right?

418
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,430
You are alerted in this example

419
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,630
and over a course of three minutes,

420
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,940
two or three minutes, we
just did this together,

421
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,710
we figured out how to
solve a couple of cases.

422
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,450
So you're proactively alerted of issues.

423
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,010
Maybe you have a thousand different cases,

424
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,540
only two at issue.

425
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,830
You can automate these tasks

426
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,140
as you can sort of see a lot
of this work is automated.

427
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,580
And finally, it augments

428
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,110
your business decision making, right?

429
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,750
It helps you decide and
fix problems quickly

430
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,790
rather than requiring you to read through

431
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,660
the case every time.

432
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,340
If you can imagine, as I mentioned,

433
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,173
I don't know if you have the same problem,

434
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:32,220
but if you asked to add
your cost center every time,

435
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,896
like one time a week,

436
00:14:33,896 --> 00:14:36,060
you can do that 50, look up
information 50 times a year,

437
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,260
a system can do that very quickly.

438
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,610
And this is one simple
example of how it works.

439
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,350
So basically that's
kind of using the agent

440
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,460
for business process.

441
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,170
You can also have to
mention earlier use agents

442
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,400
to improve your processes.

443
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,208
And so we have Signavio,
which lets you understand

444
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,960
how your businesses are running.

445
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,753
And so we have an agent
mining in Signavio,

446
00:14:54,753 --> 00:14:57,510
it's a tracing agent for
decisions and actions,

447
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,060
it flags, bottlenecks, determines
if you're not compliant

448
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,950
and it also monitors
and optimizes the value.

449
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,750
So this is basically a workflow

450
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,360
that lets you evaluate the processing

451
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,660
how your agents are doing.

452
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,040
So I think one thing I
was just going to say is

453
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,630
that we have five main processes

454
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,330
or principles for agent development.

455
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,950
One is you want to design
for business outcomes.

456
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,350
We don't want to design agents
that you never use, right?

457
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,360
We want to find agents
that you need the most.

458
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,987
And so we talk to customers
and you can also tell me

459
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:25,835
or anyone you know from SAP like

460
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:28,800
what agents do you need
built for our products?

461
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,320
And that helps you get,
helps us bring value to you.

462
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,400
Accelerating time to value.

463
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,960
This is the whole idea that we don't,

464
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,580
a lot of things are very arduous at work.

465
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,170
How do you make sure you get things done

466
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,640
more and more quickly?

467
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,980
Streamlining the engagement through Joule.

468
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,570
This is the point I showed
you earlier in this demo

469
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,400
where you actually are using Joule

470
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,220
and engaging very quickly with accruals

471
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,470
and other things without
having to go through the UX,

472
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,390
taking many, many steps.

473
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,490
Reinforcing human trust
and accountability.

474
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,323
This is important, right?

475
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:56,190
Responsible AI and AI
ethics are a big key part

476
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,060
of any kind of AI work and
it's the same with AI agents.

477
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,160
You saw in the process that
when we talked about accruals,

478
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,717
we gave rules as to how we decided

479
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:05,379
on the 63.25 euros, right?

480
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:09,090
It said hey, extrapolate number of days

481
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,030
but also take an increase
of x percent every year

482
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,850
because of inflation or
cost of goods, right?

483
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,120
And so we have full accountability

484
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,710
and you have full trust in
terms of how we're actually

485
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,260
providing the answers to
you through these systems.

486
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,570
And lastly, I mentioned the
word democratizing development.

487
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,770
This is kind of the second principle

488
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,450
and it kind of segues our fifth principle

489
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,210
is basically how do we
make it easy for you

490
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,200
to use access agents?

491
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,900
So the first part was accessing
out of the box agents.

492
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,850
That's hopefully easy and fast to use.

493
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,617
If you haven't tried
it, please try it out.

494
00:16:37,617 --> 00:16:38,557
The second thing is saying,

495
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:41,483
"Hey look, I actually
have my own needs but

496
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:44,100
you didn't satisfy them,
you showed me 40 agents,

497
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,420
but I don't really want to, you know,

498
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,560
I need something else."

499
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,787
And so we can let you extend and build

500
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:50,280
and also share that
information to other people.

501
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,950
And that's do both of this
product called Joule Studio.

502
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,380
In Joule Studio, and I'll
show you another demo here.

503
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,357
You actually are taking third box AI agent

504
00:16:57,357 --> 00:16:58,890
and Joule skills builder.

505
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,380
And so basically you use Joule
Studio to create a project

506
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,420
and you can sort of see
here, you want to actually,

507
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,500
and in a matter of two minutes

508
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,340
you can actually build this agent.

509
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,200
And so the idea is you say okay,

510
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,940
create an AI agent and then you type in

511
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,773
what you want it for.

512
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:11,760
Logistics agent is the
one I'm showing you here.

513
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,050
How do I create a logistics agent?

514
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,610
Well you give an explanation

515
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,870
and that's basically
the prompting you give

516
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,370
to the LLM on the left hand side

517
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,507
saying this is how you should do it.

518
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:19,980
And for logistics agents,

519
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,660
we need to actually collect information

520
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,860
about what packages you're looking for

521
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,930
and then you need to
give me details about,

522
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,763
we'll give them details about

523
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:27,240
what the status of the package.

524
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,470
And so you need to add documents

525
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,400
and this here it tells you,

526
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,250
shows you how you can add
the right information.

527
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,860
Let's say shippers, you need
to get the input from shippers

528
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,210
and then you create some skills.

529
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,640
And why have here basically
transportation skill

530
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,230
where you create, you
see a flow chart here

531
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,420
that's being built and in this flow chart

532
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,693
we need to add different
components, right?

533
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:45,870
And so for each component we talk about

534
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,770
what inputs do you have?

535
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,090
That was the first thing it did.

536
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,320
I know it's going kind of fast,

537
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,490
but the goal is basically this,

538
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,110
the short of it is you get the inputs,

539
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,030
basically the packages are coming in

540
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,320
and the outputs that you want.

541
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,790
And once you get the output,

542
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,260
you also want to figure out like

543
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,370
where do you get information from here?

544
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,020
And this is transportation processes.

545
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,960
This transportation
process looks up externally

546
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,190
the status of different packages.

547
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,680
Like if you go to your
shipper, FedEx, DHL, whatever,

548
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,170
look up the status and
after you fetch the status,

549
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,790
you also want to report it back.

550
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,460
So you create this confirmation message

551
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,890
and this message is
customizable by you as well.

552
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,990
And you type in the format you want

553
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,910
and now you have your flow.

554
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,260
Once the flow is completed

555
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,970
you can actually double
check and test it out,

556
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,870
which is what I'll show you here.

557
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,750
You do a test and you
can say using Joule again

558
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,610
and it says this is a test case,

559
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,730
this is looking at a
Joule test of logistics

560
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,710
and you ask, you know,
find the best carrier

561
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,770
for urgent product and it says
give me some more details.

562
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,620
So you say I'm going to ship
from Chicago to Pittsburgh.

563
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,900
And then tells you, okay,
given that what you want,

564
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,743
the recommended provider is DHL.

565
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:46,470
And so you can sort of see,

566
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,180
you can test the agent you built.

567
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,640
And over the course of about
three minutes of this video,

568
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,100
you actually built a new
agent to handle logistics.

569
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,050
And so you can sort of
see if you're at a company

570
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,580
and you want to add new
capabilities like this,

571
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,190
it's very easy to do and build you on top

572
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,360
of what we have already.

573
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,730
So now you have a 41st agent

574
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,230
on top of the 40 that we provide

575
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,940
and it's included in the library there.

576
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,200
So that's kind of an example.

577
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,280
Over the course of a few minutes,

578
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,330
you can build your own agents.

579
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,980
And so the goal behind this is that

580
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,123
you can actually extend easily
what you need to build here.

581
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,010
So on top of that though,

582
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,380
you say well, well let me
first show you how it works.

583
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,040
so basically by extending on this,

584
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,530
you have our applications in
the light blue to the bottom,

585
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,750
you actually go up to the
SAP building of Joule studio,

586
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,890
which is where we showed you

587
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,210
building your own custom agents.

588
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,260
And now your custom agents

589
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,177
can interact above into
the purple section.

590
00:19:30,177 --> 00:19:31,560
You see the arrows up,

591
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,010
you actually fully immersed
into the other agents

592
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,843
that Joule has.

593
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:37,560
So in the future, if you're
using one of the Joule agents,

594
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,930
the supply chain and you ask
a question about package,

595
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,190
it knows that you've created,

596
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,620
once you registered this logistics agent,

597
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,840
hey you're actually asking
about the status of a package.

598
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,150
This logistics agent has
the skills to find out

599
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,250
what the answer is, it'll call
it and give you the answer.

600
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,113
So this is just going to show you how

601
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:53,313
you can quickly integrate into our system.

602
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:56,583
So I mentioned extensibility,

603
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,310
what I showed you is the
third one, custom agents,

604
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,870
how you build additional agents.

605
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,040
You actually have different ways,

606
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,608
different levels of customization

607
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:05,645
from the least or most simple is basically

608
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:07,560
you can add configurations,

609
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,600
you may have specific
parameters you change

610
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,500
and you can do that.

611
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,850
The second one is using it to your studio

612
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,050
to add custom fields.

613
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,610
Field extensibility may be
like we have city, state, zip,

614
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,050
maybe you have county you
want to add to your system.

615
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,490
Doing that's pretty easy.

616
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,930
A little more difficult
is what we did here

617
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,960
where custom agents, which
still is pretty easy to build.

618
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,670
And finally the far right

619
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,680
is Joule Studio's third party agents

620
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,717
and this is kind of leveraging A2A

621
00:20:30,717 --> 00:20:32,010
and I'll talk about that in a bit

622
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,750
and how we connect there.

623
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,583
But before I do that,

624
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,110
I want to talk about how in
the process of building agents,

625
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,300
we can also have agents
also build agents as well.

626
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,920
And this is kind of an
interesting thought of like

627
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,013
how do you have your agents
assist you to build new agents?

628
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:46,980
And what you're seeing here is basically

629
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,723
the way it works is you
basically create a system

630
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:51,960
that you interview people
that are product experts.

631
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,010
So you ask the question and says,

632
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,730
Hey, what do you do to to order
new laptops or new machines?

633
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,460
This person says the process
starts with a laptop request.

634
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,730
Basically you manage your
performance checks sequentially

635
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,960
and then it's approved or not approved.

636
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,300
And so you can see after
you say natural language,

637
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,250
we can create a process
visualization of that.

638
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,650
There's a flow, right?
Person asks a question,

639
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,210
I check to see if they're eligible

640
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,380
and I check to see the budget

641
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,970
and then I check to
see if it's sustainable

642
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,803
and they're done.

643
00:21:15,803 --> 00:21:17,490
And so basically in natural language,

644
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,650
this person was able to,
John, here in this example,

645
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,630
was able to give you the process

646
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,710
and a way to order a
laptop from your company.

647
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,060
So that's the first step.

648
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,140
After you do interviews here,

649
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,990
we do two interviews with John
and another person named Max.

650
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,940
We can evaluate to see
how the process works.

651
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,080
So we interview multiple people

652
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,490
and there's a slight difference.

653
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,650
And this one you'll see
that in the sustainability,

654
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,970
Max didn't comment about it, right?

655
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,230
So we can actually
quickly could talk to Max

656
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,820
and say, what's your sustainability

657
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,913
policies at the same as John's.

658
00:21:42,913 --> 00:21:45,210
If it is, then we're done there.

659
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,710
After that you can go
to the tool mapping case

660
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,420
basically saying, okay,
now you have a flow,

661
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,730
but how do you know if someone's eligible?

662
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,560
So this eligibility check has a question,

663
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,970
I don't know what tool to use.

664
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,587
Well every company has
their own database, right?

665
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:58,260
And so here you can say, okay,
open this eligibility check

666
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,060
and pick the right tool necessary.

667
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,230
So here you have a tool called
asset master data verifier.

668
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,750
And with that tool, it can
check within the company

669
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,340
if you're eligible to buy a laptop,

670
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,480
whether it be a three year policy,

671
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,490
a two year policy,
whatever your company does.

672
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,540
So now you have this tool that says,

673
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,140
okay, now this tool processes
access this product.

674
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,993
This is where you go to
to determine eligibility.

675
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:20,843
And then when you finish this process,

676
00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:24,030
you go to the next step of
basically looking at these agents

677
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,220
and saying, this is now available for use.

678
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,530
So through interviews,
through cleaning up,

679
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,120
making sure all policies fit,

680
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,710
you can actually add this other agent

681
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,720
and it's added to this list
of other agents that exist.

682
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,480
So again, this is another
way to build agents.

683
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,211
You have agent out of the box,

684
00:22:38,211 --> 00:22:40,500
you have agents you can build
yourself with Joule studio

685
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,200
and you can also interview
and talk to people, personas

686
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,360
and get agents built
automatically this way as well.

687
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,890
So many different ways to do it.

688
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,330
And so in this example
what I just showed you

689
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,730
is basically this interview process

690
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,130
at leads to understanding of the process.

691
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,960
And then you need to actually
help map the tools, of course,

692
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,270
sometimes the systems don't
know which tools you use,

693
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,710
but once you have all that together,

694
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,780
your customized agent is done.

695
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,120
So this is just another way to do it.

696
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,770
Okay, so then as I mentioned,

697
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,399
these are ways you can build
with the SAP ecosystem,

698
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:09,090
but sometimes you may
want to use other systems.

699
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,610
You know, we know that
people use other agents,

700
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,860
other systems and we don't
want to force you to use SAP,

701
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,230
we want to make sure you're
as productive as possible

702
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,570
working together with
your partner companies.

703
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,090
And so this whole idea of
multi-agent collaborations

704
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,290
has evolved over time.

705
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,700
I think many of you know what MCP is.

706
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,930
Have you heard MCP?

707
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,774
Raise your hand if you have heard of it?

708
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:27,607
I think some of you heard of it.

709
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:28,530
Most of you heard of it.

710
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,990
It's basically a way to standardize

711
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,340
a protocol of access, right?

712
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,040
You can wrap up MCP server
around some of your APIs,

713
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,260
you get access, people
can access it quickly.

714
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,591
The next thing was a task handover, right?

715
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:41,460
Agents, instead of
agents providing actions,

716
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,450
they can be tools as well.

717
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,980
Meaning that if I'm asked,

718
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,710
let's say earlier in the CX
customer service example,

719
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,920
if I'm asked to book a
flight for my customers,

720
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,630
the CRM tool doesn't do that.

721
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,150
So CRM tool says, I actually
know another tool, Concur,

722
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,260
that actually can do it for you.

723
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,690
So these agents can
actually hand over tasks.

724
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,700
And then finally at last
point is the collaboration

725
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,320
where you actually, you
have a CRM agent talking to

726
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:05,190
a travel agent and they
can go back and forth

727
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,023
and you say, "Hey look, I need to go

728
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:08,580
to New York, Chicago, and LA."

729
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,190
And the travel agent says,
"Here are the flights."

730
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,210
And this person comes back
and says, "Oh, you know,

731
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,790
I actually checked, this
customer's not available that day.

732
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,930
Those customer's traveling."

733
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,100
And so it can be a back and forth.

734
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,480
It's not just a one shot process,

735
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,060
it's an iterative process
where you negotiate

736
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,893
agent to agent,

737
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,430
the same way humans would as well.

738
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,220
You can imagine, the way I tell
people is like 10 years ago,

739
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,050
as you can imagine, your CRM,

740
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,370
your sales specialist talking

741
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,930
to your one of your travel agents,

742
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,550
but the interaction in the email chain,

743
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,260
which could be four or
five different turns

744
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,640
can be done all automatically now.

745
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,960
And that's kind of the amazing power

746
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,010
of these technologies, right?

747
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,080
Basically instead of
being a single shot of

748
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,277
book me a flight to LAX comes back, says,

749
00:24:42,277 --> 00:24:44,280
"Hey, I can't do that,
there's no flights there."

750
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,230
Usually conversation's over, right?

751
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,767
But in real life with humans, you say,

752
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:48,780
"Oh, okay, I can't go to LAX,

753
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,360
I can go to Burbank or
somewhere else in LA."

754
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,250
And so basically this
whole iterative process

755
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,010
happens with agent to
agent communications.

756
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:56,880
And so how does this work

757
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,370
practically speaking and interoperability?

758
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,200
We have inbound agents and outbound agents

759
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,940
meaning that people can
use access our agents

760
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,470
from the outside

761
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,577
and we can actually have bring in agents

762
00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:06,600
the other way as well.

763
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,000
So in this diagram, you can
look at the full circle.

764
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,860
Let's look at the bottom portion first.

765
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,910
Basically if you have an agent

766
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,350
you built for yourself in your company

767
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,490
and you want to put in into Joule,

768
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,140
we talked a little bit
about how you do it, right?

769
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,030
You have created a server

770
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,650
and the Joule skill picks it up.

771
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,910
And so in Joule says, okay,

772
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,980
I know you have extra skill capability,

773
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,813
we can now access it.

774
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:27,120
I mentioned our org
chart agent or something,

775
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,500
you can create something
like that yourself.

776
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,710
We can access it inbound to
us using the A2A protocol.

777
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,550
On the other hand,

778
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,350
we're in the process of
building the agent gateway,

779
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,990
which lets us enumerate
all the agents we have.

780
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,930
So if you're, let's say, you
have agent in orchestrating,

781
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,100
you're orchestrating a process

782
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,600
and you want to actually access, let's say

783
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,280
our Concur travel agent,

784
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,397
you can actually make a call and say,

785
00:25:45,397 --> 00:25:47,160
"Hey, I need to travel book a flight,

786
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,930
can I get Concur to respond?"

787
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,950
In that case, our agent gateway

788
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,060
just gives you information right away

789
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,980
because you know what agent you want.

790
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,217
If it's more complicated saying,

791
00:25:54,217 --> 00:25:56,220
"Hey, I actually have a
more difficult question

792
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,460
of supply chain, but I know
that SAP can solve it."

793
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,390
It would then call Joule

794
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,460
and Joule would help
orchestrate the process.

795
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,800
So there's two ways to
access our agents inbound.

796
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,470
One is if you know exactly what you want,

797
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,730
then you can use the agent gateway

798
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,600
and it's call it what you want,

799
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,800
but if you don't know what you want,

800
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,360
Joule can help orchestrate the process.

801
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,863
And that's kind of how
interoperability works.

802
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,870
And, and the value behind this is that

803
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,370
there's just a whole lot more opportunity

804
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,290
where you can actually access agents

805
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,360
through an entire ecosystem
of many, many companies.

806
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,650
And we're actually working on,

807
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,826
we're not letting people
who are supporting this,

808
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:25,828
but a lot of people are
supporting this A2A protocol.

809
00:26:25,828 --> 00:26:27,390
And so it makes it a lot easier

810
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,463
for end customers to get things done.

811
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,300
And so, you know, in terms of like

812
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,890
extending code base frameworks,

813
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,730
I would mention that, you know,

814
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,230
since we're here at "re:Invent,"

815
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,940
we're working with AWS in several things.

816
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,260
One example, one thing we're working on

817
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,170
is using Strands SDK,
connecting with Light LLM.

818
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,840
Light LLM is particularly
good at using connecting

819
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,300
with many different core
base agents form frameworks.

820
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,350
And one them is Strands.

821
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,970
So you can sort of see on the Kyma Runtime

822
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,550
and on the left hand light blue box,

823
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,220
you have your Strands agent,
which I've highlighted in red.

824
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,010
And so Strand agents
works with the Light LLM

825
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,390
and then it connects
to the right hand side

826
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,330
with this purple box encircle
is generative AI hub,

827
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,040
which is where we
actually have our 40 plus

828
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,930
large language models you can access

829
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,730
amongst the 40 large language models,

830
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,800
we have some proxy outside

831
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,350
and the bottom right you sort
of see the Amazon bedrock.

832
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,440
We actually proxy and
access Amazon Nova models

833
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,330
as well as the Anthropics Claude models

834
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,577
and others Titan as well.

835
00:27:19,577 --> 00:27:21,000
And so we actually have the ability

836
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,310
to actually connect to 40 plus LLMs,

837
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,890
including all the ones that AWS supports.

838
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,000
And so this is kind of an example of

839
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,410
how you can actually integrate

840
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,430
different code-based frameworks.

841
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,663
This one's AWS Strands.

842
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,170
Now I want to show you
how we use AgentCore,

843
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,217
which is AWS's agent framework
and Joule together, an A2A,

844
00:27:38,217 --> 00:27:40,500
and this is a real demo that was created.

845
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,570
And the idea is basically we're looking at

846
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,240
how we look at different
disaster relief scenarios.

847
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,550
In this scenarios, there's an area,

848
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,900
there areas that have
been affected by floods

849
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,980
and there's an AgentCore agent

850
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,260
that understands information on floods

851
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,093
and we want to figure out

852
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:54,570
how to help with the relief effort, okay?

853
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,650
So the question is like

854
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,720
what regions have been affected by floods?

855
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,087
And so it quickly, you
can sort of see here

856
00:27:59,087 --> 00:28:00,900
in the Joule analysis, Joule orchestration

857
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,760
that says there's an
Amazon AgentCore agent

858
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,780
that can do this.

859
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,470
So by A2A, we call Amazon AgentCore agent

860
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,150
and ask about the flooded regions

861
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,600
and it gives you Miami and a
bunch of other regions, okay?

862
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,530
And so the idea behind this

863
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,730
is that we could pick any of these,

864
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,770
but let's suppose we
want to focus on Miami.

865
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,350
So we can say, okay, Miami is
the one that's most affected.

866
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,000
So let's spend a little
bit time looking more there

867
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,170
so we can ask more questions about it.

868
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,127
So we can ask AgentCore again,

869
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:26,310
"Hey, tell me about
what help do they need,

870
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,360
what supplies do they need?"

871
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,657
And so then it comes back and says,

872
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:30,360
"You know, some of the things they need."

873
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,790
And gives you a whole list in a second.

874
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,750
But one thing they need is water.

875
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,210
And we're going to focus on water.

876
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,350
This is running in real time.

877
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,183
So I mean, it's demo.

878
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,603
So it'll take a second or two.

879
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,950
So you see here it gives
you different issues

880
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,640
of like life jackets, water,
cleaning drinking water,

881
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,360
mobile command centers.

882
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,193
But we'll focus on water.

883
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:50,250
But before we focus on the water,

884
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,650
I want to say, if you're not
sure actually using this,

885
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,210
we can actually go underneath the hood

886
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,380
and take a look at what's happening.

887
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,150
And this is what I'll show
you next that if you look,

888
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,430
you can sort of see that
AgentCore agents are activated,

889
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,690
this is looking at CloudWatch,

890
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,370
if you use that for AWS,

891
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,260
you can sort of see the
calls are being made.

892
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,780
Four calls have been made
there, so calls have been made.

893
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,020
So we're actually indeed working
within Joule and AgentCore

894
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,670
and now let's look at
clean drinking water, okay?

895
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,800
let's figure out how to
handle clean drinking water.

896
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,260
So far Joule's been using AgentCore.

897
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,120
Now we're going to use S/4 with an SAP

898
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,670
to actually look at provider suppliers,

899
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,770
look at S/4 and determine
which of my approved suppliers

900
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,750
can support Miami this point in time.

901
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,340
We get two responses back saying

902
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,960
these are two possible suppliers.

903
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,820
The first one has been
approved for specific reasons,

904
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,260
second one's good too as well.

905
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,004
And I can say, look, I
given the supplier ID,

906
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,730
we'll just make an order
for Oriental Labs Inc.

907
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,880
And so I says, okay,
place a purchase order

908
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,860
and then the order's made,

909
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,020
and again, this is all a real demo,

910
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,970
meaning that we actually
did connect with AgentCore

911
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:45,990
and to show you that we did that

912
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,890
we can actually go into our
purchase order product UX

913
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,600
and see you do a search
for that purchase order.

914
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,863
You'll see it's there.

915
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:57,212
You see it's there.

916
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,160
And so the main goal is that showing you

917
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,390
that you can actually have different

918
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,620
agents collaborate with each other, right?

919
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,520
And so this is just a quick
demo to show you how it works.

920
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,440
Okay, so we talked about agents

921
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,320
and I think that managing
agents can be easy,

922
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,153
it can be hard,

923
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:13,116
people might say, well how
come, how does this work?

924
00:30:13,116 --> 00:30:14,820
Some of these demos are obviously easy

925
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,460
because they're few agents in a universe.

926
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,780
So managing single agents easy, right?

927
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,220
Let's say have a sourcing agent,

928
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,410
there's like one monkey in the zoo, right?

929
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,030
But then all of a sudden
you have other agents.

930
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,950
When you have other agents,

931
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,270
it gets a little more crazy, right?

932
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,410
Like it's the same idea.

933
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,540
If I say, hey, book a flight, right?

934
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,430
And I have a Concur agent,
nothing else, right?

935
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,260
But if I actually have a bunch
of different travel agencies,

936
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,060
then you need to figure out book a agent

937
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,490
using my company's preferred agency,

938
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,323
Concur, whatever, right?

939
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:41,160
And so basically you
need a little bit more,

940
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,450
but in general, how do you handle this?

941
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,971
Well, we actually have a process to handle

942
00:30:43,971 --> 00:30:48,600
these wild agents by
having a zoo of sorts.

943
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,730
And basically this AI Agent Zoo, we call,

944
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,040
is basically the idea that we organize

945
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,680
through a LeanIX agent hub,

946
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,750
different agents in the different groups,

947
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,770
finance, human resources,

948
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,330
supply chain, customer experiences.

949
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,760
And so by doing so, we can actually help

950
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,530
provide better context and segmentation

951
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,773
to make it easier for you
to access your agents.

952
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,920
And so by using this tool, as
I mentioned, LeanIX Agent Hub,

953
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,810
you can access all the
agents in one place,

954
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,000
but not just SAP agents.

955
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,440
It also can access third party agents

956
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,520
and custom agents as well.

957
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,720
So you build your own agent,

958
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,890
custom agents are there,

959
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,060
you have a third party agent,

960
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,890
we talked about AgentCore or anyone else,

961
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:23,880
we can also have it there as well.

962
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,580
So all of that is available there.

963
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,683
Okay?

964
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:29,040
So we're trying to make
it as easy as possible.

965
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,406
You know the reason I'm
talking about making it easy

966
00:31:31,406 --> 00:31:33,120
is you can sort of imagine,

967
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,650
in the initial case of a few pages,

968
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,450
it's kind of like when the
internet started, right?

969
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,500
A couple of URLs came out.

970
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,333
I don't know if you remember,

971
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,900
you probably memorized them.

972
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,961
Maybe you go to espn.com
for sports or whatever,

973
00:31:41,961 --> 00:31:43,200
there are three or four sites,

974
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,160
you just memorize the URL.

975
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,150
But after it became a thousand URLs

976
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,220
you went to search engines, right?

977
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,630
And this is the same thing with agents.

978
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,920
Initially you might use like three or four

979
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,060
of your favorite agents

980
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,680
over time you might
use hundreds of agents.

981
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,030
So you need to use
something like LeanIX hub

982
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,680
to track the agents you're using.

983
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,860
So quickly to summarize the work on

984
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,240
to basically our vision of agents,

985
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,200
there's three parts again, right?

986
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,430
The first part again is

987
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,760
we want to empower businesses
with these prebuilt agents.

988
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,620
We have 40 agents that
are already out of the box

989
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,970
by the end of the year,

990
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,320
we want to democratize the development,

991
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,817
make it easy for you to
develop on top, right?

992
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:14,940
So the idea is that Joule
democratizes business applications

993
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,190
by letting users access
with natural language.

994
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,830
We're also here for developers,

995
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,890
democratize agent development
using Joule studio.

996
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,510
And then finally we
actually want to make sure

997
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,344
you can use the full agent ecosystem.

998
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,290
So we support A2A as well.

999
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,127
You work outside as well.

1000
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:30,390
And so you heard, you know,

1001
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,950
in the morning Matt
Garman is talking about

1002
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,894
democratizing through platform, right?

1003
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:36,653
AWS creates a big platform
for business applications.

1004
00:32:36,653 --> 00:32:37,953
SAP, we create the software on top

1005
00:32:37,953 --> 00:32:39,993
to also make it easy for people to use.

1006
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,980
One other thing we've done
actually use AI Assistants.

1007
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,000
I want to explain again,

1008
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,670
we talked about how you have the LeanIX.

1009
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,430
LeanIX AI Agent hub shows you, you know,

1010
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,263
what type of agents you have

1011
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:52,710
and that's for humans, very valuable.

1012
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,450
It helps us to see how it's organized,

1013
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,497
but machines also sometimes
need context as well.

1014
00:32:56,497 --> 00:33:01,497
You know, if you say, hey
can approve this process,

1015
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,660
if you ask a question that's very vague,

1016
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,190
it might not know what
you want to approve,

1017
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,620
but what it can do is
look at the AI Assistants,

1018
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,710
which we announced that
SAP connect in October.

1019
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,060
We can know what persona you're in

1020
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,770
or what lines of businesses
you're working on

1021
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:17,550
and use that as a grounding
function of where you are,

1022
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,410
by doing this so we can
scope down the work.

1023
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,720
If you're a finance professional,
if you want an approval,

1024
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,880
it would be something that
your CFO might approve.

1025
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,713
If you're in procurement,

1026
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:25,950
it could be a purchase you're approving,

1027
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,950
for supply chain, you know,
whatever's appropriate.

1028
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,710
These AI Assistants help you scope down

1029
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,630
kind of your universe of agents.

1030
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,770
As I mentioned earlier,

1031
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,200
you have a bunch of animals in a zoo.

1032
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,033
It's very hard to know.

1033
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:39,390
But if you know you're
looking for giraffes,

1034
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,233
you actually can actually
get a better answer,

1035
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:41,850
you know what you're looking for.

1036
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,890
So basically this is the same thing here.

1037
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,690
And so Joule agents, as I mentioned,

1038
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,110
both visually through
for humans through LeanIX

1039
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,030
or through yeah, Assistants,

1040
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,880
can actually help you organize

1041
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,150
and segment the different agents
that you have to deal with.

1042
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,770
And so the one thing you may want to do,

1043
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,910
if you are interested in our agents,

1044
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,430
we have QR code here as well as the URL,

1045
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,650
I think this will also be
available offline as well

1046
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,750
so you can actually certainly
have access to it afterwards.

1047
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,573
Just wanted to share this
before I move to next section.

1048
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,640
So the one thing that we do is SAP and AWS

1049
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,503
have worked together for a long time.

1050
00:34:15,503 --> 00:34:17,820
We have a partnership for years.

1051
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,590
And so one of the things
that we decided to do

1052
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,910
is basically to help accelerate

1053
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,520
the generic success for customers.

1054
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,000
We power the software and we scale on AWS.

1055
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,430
And the idea is that we have this

1056
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,930
collaborative gradient agreement

1057
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,480
where customers can
actually make a request

1058
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,030
and have us help you
accelerate your onboarding.

1059
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,950
And so we have, you know,
obviously our track record,

1060
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,750
we have more 16 years of working together.

1061
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,910
We have a lot of industry
and technical expertise

1062
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,320
and then we have this global reach.

1063
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,390
And so the idea is that you can reach out

1064
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:48,270
and this unique path
lets you get started fast

1065
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,573
and also is subsidized by us in AWS.

1066
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,700
How does it work?

1067
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,590
So basically you apply
to get into the program,

1068
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,670
you have an idea,

1069
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,740
and once you have your
program, we approve it,

1070
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,840
you can accelerate your production.

1071
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,420
So innovation comes through
SAP business processes.

1072
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,680
We can actually, you know, as I mentioned,

1073
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,180
scale it through AWS,

1074
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,670
the adoption can run your
AI through our environment

1075
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,930
with built in safeguards.

1076
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,210
We have obviously
enterprise grade compliance

1077
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,760
through AWS and through SAP capabilities

1078
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,610
and the security that you've
heard about on both sides.

1079
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,560
And then the agility increases too.

1080
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,750
You can actually get a
lot more done with this.

1081
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,940
And so the idea is you can get this done

1082
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,440
as early as nine weeks.

1083
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,767
And so if as any of you are saying,

1084
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:28,200
"Hey look, I'd like to do this,

1085
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,810
but I just don't have
the resources to do it,

1086
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,280
don't have the ability to do it."

1087
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,480
This is how you can do it, right?

1088
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,630
So basically you make a request

1089
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,850
and I'll show you the next
couple slides how to do it.

1090
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,980
But the code innovation
process is very structured.

1091
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,400
You have actually, we take the
first phase of exploration,

1092
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,737
we look at key business
challenges and look at use cases.

1093
00:35:46,737 --> 00:35:47,617
And so basically you say,

1094
00:35:47,617 --> 00:35:48,630
"Hey, I have a big challenge,

1095
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,730
a big pain point in my job in my company

1096
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:51,870
and this is what it is.

1097
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,703
Make sure it works."

1098
00:35:52,703 --> 00:35:54,390
Then we ideate this use case discovery.

1099
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,730
We say, "Hey, do workshops with customers

1100
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,260
together to AWS and SAP,

1101
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,360
let's figure out how
to solve this problem."

1102
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,650
And then we can have an architect come in

1103
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,020
and help architect the right design

1104
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,860
and then we can build it.

1105
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,570
And so this whole process is actually

1106
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,000
like assisted by us in AWS,

1107
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,650
you can use SAP's generative AI hub,

1108
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,762
which is our solution of the
40 plus large language models

1109
00:36:12,762 --> 00:36:14,760
I mentioned earlier

1110
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,920
use Amazon bedrock capabilities

1111
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,010
and then also Amazon Nova's
foundation models as well.

1112
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,530
And then finally phase
five is the implementation

1113
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,320
with all the security monitors
and guardrails in place.

1114
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,240
So basically this is a five step process.

1115
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,740
The first four steps
can pretty much be done

1116
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,573
in about nine weeks,

1117
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:31,590
as early as nine weeks
if you work in quickly

1118
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,120
and you can actually need
formal ways to deploy

1119
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,010
so this is a very fast process

1120
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,360
and if you're interested in doing it,

1121
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,340
as I mentioned, if cost is an issue,

1122
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,600
it's a funded project

1123
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,180
and I'll show you how to do
it and handle in a minute.

1124
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,322
But summary, basically you
have inside out or outside in,

1125
00:36:45,322 --> 00:36:46,950
outside in you have SAP AI core,

1126
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,780
which is our capabilities
inside the cores,

1127
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,950
our generative AI hub,

1128
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,390
which has a bunch of language models

1129
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,087
included in our Amazon Bedrock LLMs.

1130
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:56,160
And so you can actually
access their foundation models

1131
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,740
from Anthropic as well
as Amazon's native ones,

1132
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,260
which are Titan and Nova.

1133
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,850
And the foundation models,

1134
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,340
you can actually also
access Cohere Command,

1135
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,173
Embed, or Rerank.

1136
00:37:06,173 --> 00:37:08,520
And so this is the technology you're using

1137
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,353
and the process if you want to do is

1138
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:13,800
you have to contact
AIProgramSupport@sap.com to get started

1139
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,240
and as I mentioned, it'll accelerate

1140
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,380
your journey AI development,

1141
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,640
adopt advanced capabilities

1142
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,080
and leverage our investments.

1143
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,310
And this is actually doable

1144
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,530
if you're an especially AWS ecosystem

1145
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,363
or if you're trying to decide

1146
00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:25,050
if you want to use AWS and SAP,

1147
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,360
this incentivizes you to do that.

1148
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,040
And we have to helped fund, you know,

1149
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,780
together with AWS, we help support this.

1150
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,730
So it's actually a great opportunity

1151
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,680
for on the fence of you know,
whether not to try it or not.

1152
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,080
Okay, so I'll just summarize
kind of what I talked about

1153
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,850
and some of the things
that I didn't talk about

1154
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,209
but just the full picture of SAP

1155
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:45,840
and I'll go love to write top to bottom.

1156
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,130
So basically we talked about

1157
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,560
agent to agent interoperability earlier

1158
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,880
and MCP server support, right?

1159
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,190
You can take the MCP
server wrap, your APIs,

1160
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,090
can get access to it,

1161
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,040
and then we can actually
allow agent to agents

1162
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,070
to expand extend use and connectivity

1163
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,560
to different API services.

1164
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,640
More Joule scopes have been built.

1165
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,860
We have over 2100 capabilities total,

1166
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,840
which basically means in natural language

1167
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,340
you can actually do a lot of things

1168
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,310
with our systems across all
of our lines of businesses.

1169
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,410
Two weeks ago we announced
that our ABAP AI model,

1170
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,840
which is our fine tuned
domain specific model,

1171
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,330
has been made available inside of,

1172
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,160
will be made available inside
of our generative AI hub

1173
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,993
for direct access.

1174
00:38:20,993 --> 00:38:23,190
So any of you not from the ABAP,

1175
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:26,970
so our advanced business
application programming language

1176
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,590
is our domain specific language.

1177
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,000
And so if you use GitHub copilot

1178
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,880
or any of these coding tools,

1179
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,590
it doesn't really have ABAP covered.

1180
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:38,070
So we fine tuned with
over 300 million lines

1181
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,050
of internal code on ABAP

1182
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,270
and built a fine tuned model on ABAP AI.

1183
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,820
And so that model was available
inside the eclipse IDE

1184
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,500
for about a year now.

1185
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,810
But people said, "Hey, can
we have better access to it?"

1186
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,540
And so now we're making it
available in in Gen AI hub

1187
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,010
so it can be accessed in other

1188
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,870
development environments as well.

1189
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:59,400
So if you develop in ABAP,
if you have SAP developers,

1190
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,980
you obviously can, please
have them use that.

1191
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,960
Beyond that, we actually
are using that tool

1192
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,670
also for code migration.

1193
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,220
We are building a custom
code migration agent.

1194
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,290
So any of you working
on a your rise migration

1195
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,840
or updating your code can also leverage

1196
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,043
this capability as well.

1197
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,590
Lastly, in the first row,

1198
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,450
basically these new mutual agents

1199
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,890
I mentioned, we have
40 by end of the year,

1200
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,140
but we have more coming as well.

1201
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,280
And if you have specific agents

1202
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,600
that we don't have on our roadmap,

1203
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,950
you can reach out and tell me.

1204
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:29,700
We can actually make sure
that we go, you know,

1205
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,417
customize and make sure
you can get what you need.

1206
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:34,800
Second row, AI Assistants
in the left hand side

1207
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,840
is basically, as I
mentioned, the scoping down.

1208
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,610
The idea that understanding your persona,

1209
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,830
what persona you are and
what you're working on

1210
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:44,070
could help reduce the scope
of what agents are activated.

1211
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,238
And so the idea is that over time

1212
00:39:45,238 --> 00:39:46,920
there'll be more and more agents.

1213
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,600
And so having ability to scope down

1214
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,640
and help us figure out what you need.

1215
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,590
The middle one, middle
box, is AI Agent Hub,

1216
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,360
which I mentioned already with LeanIX,

1217
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,580
where you can actually have
all virtual agents are there

1218
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,960
custom agents that you build can be there

1219
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,460
and third party agents as well.

1220
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,280
That way you have easy
access to all of them.

1221
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,860
Middle right is what we announced

1222
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,740
at the beginning of November,

1223
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,610
which is our first enterprise
relational foundation model.

1224
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,443
So just to make clear,

1225
00:40:09,443 --> 00:40:10,276
in case you're not familiar with this,

1226
00:40:10,276 --> 00:40:13,170
basically people are built
building language models

1227
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,470
and we built the first
business trans tabular model.

1228
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,050
And so the difference
is basically if I say,

1229
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,610
hey, it's cloudy outside today, right?

1230
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,900
I say it's cloudy outside,

1231
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,020
I'm going into closet to pick out a blank.

1232
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,700
The model can either say,

1233
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,340
let's say jacket or umbrella,

1234
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,820
maybe 60% chance jacket,
30% chance umbrella,

1235
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,300
10% chance anything else,
glasses or whatever.

1236
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,133
But you don't really
think about that, right?

1237
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:39,240
You just have a language
model, complete sentences,

1238
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,070
but it's all probabilistic, right?

1239
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,200
But when you're talking about
like your business processes,

1240
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,490
you do think probabilistically, right?

1241
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,370
Hey, I need to find enough inventory

1242
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,570
for Black Friday shopping.

1243
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,230
How many units of my
widgets should I purchase?

1244
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,670
You know, it's also probabilistic, right?

1245
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,610
Maybe 80% chance you need
more than a hundred units,

1246
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,320
20% chance you need less
than a hundred units.

1247
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,630
And so the foundation
model takes tabular data,

1248
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,250
which is like Excel spreadsheets

1249
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,490
or comma separated value files for short

1250
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,050
and does predictions on them

1251
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,370
the same way language is predicted

1252
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,957
upon with large language models.

1253
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:11,520
And we don't, may not
think of it that way,

1254
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,600
but it's the same thing.

1255
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,710
And so we use the same technology,

1256
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,170
it's a transformer based technology.

1257
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,520
And the reason why we can do is

1258
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,260
because we have, as I mentioned,

1259
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,357
data from all lines of businesses
as you've heard already.

1260
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:24,630
And so we can actually
apply these foundation model

1261
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,450
across many different prediction problems.

1262
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,910
And the value behind this
is basically five years ago

1263
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,190
when the first large
language models came out,

1264
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,110
you stopped building narrow AI models.

1265
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,720
No one builds sentiment
classifiers analyzers anymore.

1266
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,180
I used to actually had to,
my jobs a few years ago,

1267
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,160
I built a sentiment analyzer
for a quick serve company.

1268
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,170
You don't actually ever
do that anymore, right?

1269
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,370
You don't build summarizers.

1270
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:47,550
People don't need to have
a team of data scientists

1271
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,570
build summarizers.

1272
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,880
The same thing happens here
with predictive analytics,

1273
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,670
if you use this RPT-1 or
rapid one, as what we call it,

1274
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,430
you can actually use one
horizontal tabular model

1275
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,310
to solve a lot of different
tabular AI problems.

1276
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,440
And so we gave it, it's
publicly available,

1277
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,550
the playground, you should try it out,

1278
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,620
if you haven't seen it,
we've given some examples.

1279
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,730
But you can do a lot of different things

1280
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,800
like examples of like extrapolation,

1281
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,700
like if you have missing data,

1282
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,250
I gave you an example about
transportation management.

1283
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,320
If let's say you have a
table of like packages

1284
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,730
and you have some missing data points,

1285
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,640
like you ship the package
to me in Las Vegas,

1286
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,900
you know, which, what's a shipper?

1287
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,640
And you can actually use
a foundation model to say,

1288
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,880
oh, typically speaking
packages shipped to Las Vegas

1289
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,380
at this time of day or this time of week

1290
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,330
are driven by this particular shipper.

1291
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:30,540
And so those type of things
are available in this model.

1292
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,950
So definitely try that out.

1293
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,630
We're going to continue evolving that.

1294
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:36,190
But it's basically, I tell
you kind of like a GPT-1

1295
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,030
or GPT-2 moments in terms of
what happens type of models.

1296
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:42,420
And so this is unique to
SAP so please check it out.

1297
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,770
Bottom row, I'll start from left.

1298
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,440
Our prompt to my service,
we made it also available.

1299
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,490
We lets you change prompts
when you change different LLMs.

1300
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,967
This is really valuable,
and you can also say,

1301
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:53,940
"Hey Walter, I use bedrock only."

1302
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,773
So, but it's fine,

1303
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:56,100
you can also still use prompt optimization

1304
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,920
across different bedrock LLMs as well.

1305
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,710
If I'm using Nova and I've
been using it for weeks,

1306
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,180
I modify the prompt

1307
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,260
and then tomorrow I say maybe I should

1308
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,970
try Anthropics Claude.

1309
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,920
Well, if I take the same
prompt and move it over,

1310
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,230
I'm not doing an apples
to apples comparison.

1311
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,526
I use the analogy that you, may have kids,

1312
00:43:12,526 --> 00:43:14,550
I don't know if you have
kids, but if you have kids,

1313
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,010
you raise them and you talk
to them one particular way.

1314
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,570
And then once your kid's a teenager,

1315
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:21,780
your teenager brings a friend
home to talk to dinner,

1316
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,670
and then you talk to this person

1317
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:24,690
the same way you talk to your child

1318
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,980
and they don't respond the same way.

1319
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,600
And you're like, I don't understand why.

1320
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,220
It's like, because each person likes

1321
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,990
to be responded to differently, right?

1322
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,190
And believe it or not,

1323
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,600
we don't want to
personify language models,

1324
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,700
but the idea is language
models are trained on data

1325
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,010
by different, mostly similar public data,

1326
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,170
but it's all customized to each model

1327
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,687
just the same way humans
are all different, right?

1328
00:43:41,687 --> 00:43:44,340
And so if you talk to two
different LLMs the same way,

1329
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,300
you won't get the same answer.

1330
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,680
So we built this prompt optimizer

1331
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,840
to make sure we optimize the prompt.

1332
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,360
That way you can actually get
apples to apples comparisons

1333
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,220
if you're trying to switch LLMs.

1334
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,780
And that's actually valuable
because the next step

1335
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,422
we've already pre announced is that

1336
00:43:56,422 --> 00:43:59,280
we'll help you also decide
on LLMs in the future

1337
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,297
that way give you more RRI to say,

1338
00:44:01,297 --> 00:44:04,235
"Hey look, this LLM is more
expensive than this other LLM."

1339
00:44:04,235 --> 00:44:06,627
And give with the same
return accuracies, right?

1340
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:08,730
And so basically that's
kind of where we're leading

1341
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,130
to this prompt optimization.

1342
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,710
The bullet in between is basically

1343
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,102
we have engage with Joule
and Microsoft 365 copilot

1344
00:44:16,102 --> 00:44:17,520
is fully integrated

1345
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,670
because productivity
users and M 365 and SAP

1346
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,810
have a high overlap.

1347
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:23,250
So with one within one copilot,

1348
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,170
you can access the other
one and vice versa.

1349
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,270
And the value behind that is that

1350
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:27,680
as kind of we talked about agent to agent,

1351
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,730
is that we don't expect you as users

1352
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,680
to go to eight different co-pilots, right?

1353
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,090
I mean, if you wake up in the morning,

1354
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,700
use one consumer co-pilot at home

1355
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,800
to set your alarm when
you're cooking your eggs,

1356
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,660
you go to work, use another copilot

1357
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,070
for your productivity tools,

1358
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,134
use Joule for your SAP tools,

1359
00:44:42,134 --> 00:44:45,297
use four from our co-pilots,
it gets old, right?

1360
00:44:45,297 --> 00:44:47,100
And so we want make sure
we're doing our best

1361
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,200
to help make it as easy
as possible for everyone.

1362
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,670
That's why we have this engagement

1363
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,683
and we also why we support A2A as well.

1364
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,890
And lastly, I think one thing
that's also interesting is,

1365
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,450
you know, there's deep research now.

1366
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,650
In the past, you ask a question,

1367
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,090
you got an answer, you're done.

1368
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,860
Now you can ask more
complicated questions, right?

1369
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,900
Like, hey, I mentioned an example again.

1370
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,887
I want to book a trip to see
my four, five biggest customers

1371
00:45:07,887 --> 00:45:09,360
and I want to make sure
it fits my schedule

1372
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,193
and their schedules.

1373
00:45:10,193 --> 00:45:11,640
That's actually a deep
research type question.

1374
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,020
We have this capability in Joule,

1375
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,077
which goes deeper and says,

1376
00:45:14,077 --> 00:45:16,980
"Okay, I need to spend five
minutes to give you an answer,

1377
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,813
but I'm going to give you

1378
00:45:17,813 --> 00:45:19,080
the itinerary for that process, right?"

1379
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,880
So that example I gave from the beginning,

1380
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,520
you can actually apply this
and ask these questions now

1381
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,140
because deep research exists.

1382
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,300
And deep research means
that each of these agents

1383
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,417
can give you what can
figure out what it can do.

1384
00:45:29,417 --> 00:45:31,560
And it also knows what
other agents can do.

1385
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,520
And in this example I'll give you

1386
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,117
is basically again, you might say,

1387
00:45:34,117 --> 00:45:37,211
"Okay, I want to visit my
five biggest customers."

1388
00:45:37,211 --> 00:45:40,470
I go to my CX solution,
which is our CM solution.

1389
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,090
It says, "Here are your
five biggest customers,

1390
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,680
here's where they're located."

1391
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,990
And then you say, "Okay, go to Concur

1392
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,150
to find a travel and here's
a potential itinerary."

1393
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,540
But then before you finish
that you actually go to

1394
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,500
engage engagement with Microsoft

1395
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,670
where you look at people's calendars.

1396
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:54,870
Are people free? Are you free?

1397
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,700
Maybe you have Thanksgiving vacation,

1398
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,810
your Christmas vacation.

1399
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,400
So basically there's
three different agents

1400
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,470
if you are at play here,
going back and forth,

1401
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,910
back and forth to figure out.

1402
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:03,900
Okay, finally figure it out,

1403
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,850
first week of December,
I'm going to "re:Invent".

1404
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,140
Last week of November,
I'm at Thanksgiving.

1405
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,130
But okay, second week go December,

1406
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,950
I'm going to go to New
York first and then Miami,

1407
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,020
third week I'm going to
be in LA, San Francisco,

1408
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,580
and then my Christmas vacation happens.

1409
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,280
So basically these agents
have using research

1410
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,720
to solve a problem that you have

1411
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,730
can give you the right answer.

1412
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,170
That kind of summarizes
all the different things

1413
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,190
that we're doing.

1414
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,090
I know I have a few minutes left

1415
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,920
so I can take time for questions.

1416
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,253
And if you have some,
I'll repeat your question.
