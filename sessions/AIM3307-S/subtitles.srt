1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,539
Hello, everybody. Uh,

2
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:05,360
my name is Abhishek Sharma. Everybody

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,118

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,288
I work for LPL Financial,

5
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:11,898
where I lead the

6
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:14,028
technology platform from trading and investment

7
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:14,579
management.

8
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:17,599
The time is 2:30 p.m.

9
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:19,129
Um,

10
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,539
also known as the post lunch

11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,620
danger zone,

12
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:24,879
the lunch is settling in,

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,620
attention span,

14
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:27,679
well, it's

15
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:29,039
somewhat conflicting.

16
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,690
So before we get started,

17
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:32,368
let's get some, uh,

18
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:34,000
energy in the room with some

19
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:35,798
show of hand exercises.

20
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:38,459
Who here is attending the

21
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:40,279
reinvent conference for the first time?

22
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:43,130
Wow. All right.

23
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,829
Uh, hopefully, the experience has been good

24
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,029
so far. It's one of the best industry conferences.

25
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,118
Who has been ascertained at least

26
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,298
5 or more times.

27
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,039
Got some veterans in the room.

28
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:56,520
Uh,

29
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:59,029
who has already done 10,000 steps today.

30
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:01,069
All right,

31
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,009
20,000, here we come.

32
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,680
Uh,

33
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,439
and this is the most important question.

34
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,888
Who has enough swag that is

35
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,028
not gonna fit in the carry-on luggage?

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And he's debating now, do I check in my

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,879
bag? Do I buy another bag, right?

38
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:18,778
Happens a lot more than you think,

39
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:19,838
um.

40
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,730
On a serious note,

41
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,469
let's, a couple of questions related

42
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:26,558
to the topic at hand, which is trading

43
00:01:26,558 --> 00:01:27,069
platform.

44
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,980
How many here have done

45
00:01:30,638 --> 00:01:32,698
any sort of stock trading in their life?

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,459
Most of you guys, as expected, right?

47
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,620
How many here understand

48
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:41,918
what happens after a trade is

49
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:44,239
done, after you buy and sell a security.

50
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:48,250
Great, some experts in the room as well, great.

51
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,579
All right, so let's get to it.

52
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,519
Before we begin the session, I wanna start the session

53
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,180
by thanking AWS.

54
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:59,698
The partnership has been truly critical

55
00:01:59,698 --> 00:02:00,480
in our journey.

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,308
As we modernize and build

57
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,629
the next generation trading platform,

58
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,368
AWS provides us the tools that we

59
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:08,909
need

60
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,909
scale, resiliency,

61
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,949
access to the emerging AI platforms,

62
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,409
so we appreciate the collaboration and we

63
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,069
look forward to make LPL

64
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:20,270
the platform of choice for advisers.

65
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,008
So,

66
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,538
future of trading platform. Why build

67
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,399
a next generation trading platform?

68
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,710
We are at the inflection point.

69
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,479
In wealth management.

70
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:34,889
Speed, scale, resiliency,

71
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,088
intelligence,

72
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:37,569
those are

73
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,368
not nice to have anymore.

74
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:42,189
They are mandatory table stakes

75
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:44,429
to have any competitive advantage in the

76
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:46,538
market. The next

77
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:48,399
few minutes, we'll walk you through

78
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:51,419
how we're designing the next gen trading platform

79
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:52,278
at LPL,

80
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:53,520
a platform.

81
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,838
That is designed not just to keep up

82
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:57,618
with the market,

83
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:00,038
but to anticipate and adapt

84
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:02,069
to it. This is

85
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:02,860
a story

86
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,639
of moving away from legacy dependencies,

87
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,419
traditional architecture

88
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,179
to fully intelligent cloud native

89
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:12,338
trading platform for the next decade.

90
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,538
Let's get to it.

91
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,460
So we got a jam-packed agenda today.

92
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:21,770
There's no technology problem

93
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,849
solution without a business problem, so we'll kick

94
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,588
off, we'll talk a little bit more about

95
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,088
overview of what is wealth management

96
00:03:28,088 --> 00:03:29,058
industry, what are the,

97
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:31,069
what's happening in wealth management world.

98
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:34,550
Who is LPL? What is LPL's business model?

99
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,719
Zoom in to the trading platforms at LPL.

100
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,979
What are we up to today?

101
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:41,569
We'll set some context from what are

102
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,679
the business goals,

103
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,429
technology goals that we're trying to solve for aspirationally.

104
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,159
We'll go through our journey in the cloud.

105
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,210
Transformation is always a journey. It's never a big bang.

106
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,919
We'll see how we are approaching that.

107
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:56,508
We'll talk about our current state

108
00:03:56,508 --> 00:03:58,588
platform, our aspirational next generation

109
00:03:58,588 --> 00:03:59,330
architecture.

110
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:00,719
And we'll

111
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:03,899
go at the end with some deep dive use cases

112
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:05,960
where we're applying some of the cloud principles

113
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:08,819
and it is 2025. There is no presentation

114
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,949
worth attending without the mention of AI,

115
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,240
so we'll talk about AI at the end,

116
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:14,319
um,

117
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,100
things that we are up to and things we have aspirationally

118
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,600
that we have in pipeline as we go,

119
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,187
right. And we'll save some

120
00:04:21,187 --> 00:04:23,209
time at Q&A if we can't get to the

121
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:25,367
Q&A because I know everybody wanna rush to the next session,

122
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:27,648
so find us offline. My team, his

123
00:04:27,648 --> 00:04:29,788
entire team is sitting here, so depending on the questions,

124
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,848
we'll help do our best to answer your questions.

125
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,459
Right,

126
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:38,230
wealth management. So when we did show of hands,

127
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,350
all of you have done, most of you have

128
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,379
done some type of trading.

129
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:43,428
So what is wealth management industry?

130
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,309
At its core,

131
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,048
wealth management is simply helping

132
00:04:48,048 --> 00:04:50,119
people make smart

133
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,139
decisions with their money,

134
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,750
how to save it,

135
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,350
how to invest it, how to grow it,

136
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:56,309
and most importantly,

137
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:57,509
how to protect it.

138
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,259
Is, is the guidance given to

139
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,399
anybody at every financial moment

140
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,238
of their life.

141
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:07,750
As an industry, wealth management

142
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:08,850
is huge.

143
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,869
144 trillion assets

144
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,088
under management

145
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:16,819
across 300,000 financial advisors,

146
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:18,910
68 million clients.

147
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,670
That's a big opportunity. That's a big market.

148
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,160
And The

149
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,869
last two years, especially now,

150
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:29,319
has been, is an amazing time

151
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,298
to be in wealth management.

152
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:33,519
What we call it is a generational wealth

153
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,678
transfer is underway. What that means

154
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:38,238
is there's 100 trillion assets under management,

155
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,798
which baby boomers are transitioning these assets

156
00:05:41,798 --> 00:05:43,160
to the next generations.

157
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:45,678
This next generation is.

158
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,660
More tech savvy

159
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,798

00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:52,619
this next generation is pushing the curve.

161
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,350
They are demanding

162
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:55,838
personalization,

163
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,559
instant art responses, intelligent

164
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,899
insights, right?

165
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,540
Something they are very much used to

166
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,959
from the consumer tech partners.

167
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:09,338
Opportunity is huge.

168
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,959
Challenge,

169
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,540
how do you meet to that expectation

170
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,619
for systems that has existed for decades?

171
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,629
Great technology challenge opportunity to have.

172
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:21,540
Let's bring

173
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,420
close to LPL.

174
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:25,600

We are a Fortune 500 company.

177
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,149
What is

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,928

from the rest of the competition is.

191
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,009
The flexibility

192
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:10,189
and the scale.

193
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,798
The ability for the financial advisors

194
00:07:13,798 --> 00:07:15,879
to choose technology and tools that

195
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,079
define design their own practice is

196
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,238
amazing. This freedom of

197
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:21,988
flexibility, this freedom of choice.

198
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,750
is core to our value proposition.

199
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,048
But from a technology perspective, that it creates

200
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,309
a great opportunity,

201
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,170
because now your platform has to adapt

202
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,170
to small business, to

203
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,548
large scale institutions.

204
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:40,389
We are a very customer centric

205
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:41,528
organization. Our mission.

206
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:42,970
Is to help

207
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:45,470
our clients success at every step of

208
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,048
the way.

209
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:47,209
Our vision

210
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,428
is to be the best wealth management firm.

211
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,588
To be the best, the technology has to be

212
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:53,160
the best.

213
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,588
It has to be adaptive,

214
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,259
cutting edge, future ready.

215
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:03,269
Let's click down

216
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:05,759
within LPL. Let's talk about creating investment

217
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,309
management.

218
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:10,470
I define trading in our world as

219
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,009
a connective tissue for financial advisers

220
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:13,819
to the market.

221
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,290
When the trade is done,

222
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:20,269
behind the scene, there are

223
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,970
hundreds of high performance

224
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,778
systems.

225
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,778
They all work in unison.

226
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,178
To execute,

227
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,459
settle a trade

228
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,959
with the speed, accuracy

229
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,918
and transparency.

230
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:35,340
If you look at this picture,

231
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:37,418
The workflow is pretty standard.

232
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,778
Somebody generates order, order is

233
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:43,018
placed, it goes through process, ultimately

234
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:44,638
it gets executed.

235
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:47,138
While this is happening in our world, we

236
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:49,778
have 2,000+ checks running in sub milliseconds.

237
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:52,690
And any trading system

238
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:55,090
has its own complexity

239
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:57,590
that's in their own ecosystem like in LPL we

240
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,750
have 78 systems, 70 to 80

241
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,009
systems that run together,

242
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:03,538
but a trading system also relies

243
00:09:03,538 --> 00:09:05,629
on multiple partners out there, market

244
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,119
centers, fintech organizations, right, which

245
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,048
makes the complexity

246
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,288
to the next level.

247
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:14,139
It's a complex

248
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:15,320
ecosystem,

249
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:17,918
but from a user's standpoint, it should be

250
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:18,580
simple

251
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,298
and very seamless.

252
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:33,038
All right. There

253
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:35,210
is no technology with business objective.

254
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,639
Tech for technology's sake doesn't really last,

255
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,918
right? So before we define our

256
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:41,139
technology aspiration technology

257
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,099
goals.

258
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:45,210
Let's bring in something that we all

259
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,210
are comfortable with.

260
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:49,229
So when we trade as a user,

261
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:50,928
when you go and do a trade,

262
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:52,330
what are the basic

263
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:54,178
expectations when you trade?

264
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,580
First of all, my trades should be very,

265
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,519
very secure,

266
00:09:58,899 --> 00:09:59,418
no brainer.

267
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:02,859
I should be able to trade whenever

268
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:03,739
I want to.

269
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,609
Always on systems.

270
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,259
When I trade, I should get the responses.

271
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:11,580
Instant, near real time.

272
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:13,379
And

273
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,070
it should be cheaper to do so,

274
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,629
right? So when you look

275
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:20,090
at enterprise grade platforms

276
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,048
like LPL,

277
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:23,070
these objectives don't change.

278
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:25,349
They just scale up

279
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:26,950
1000 times over.

280
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,558
We have to deliver on the same fundamentals

281
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:33,629
as you would expect when you do a trade, but

282
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:34,719
at institutional level.

283
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,678
Now to define our business goals, business

284
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:39,259
objectives,

285
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:42,619
what are the basic business outcomes we typically expect?

286
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,139
Customer satisfaction,

287
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:46,899
in our case, adviser satisfaction,

288
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:48,239
high customer retention,

289
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,538
advisor retention.

290
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,418
Reduce, cheaper, reduced cost

291
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,158
to serve,

292
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,849
ultimately that will lead to better margin

293
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:56,500
expansion.

294
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,639
So what technology goals do we need to do to get to

295
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,200
that?

296
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,719
Same thing, the first one.

297
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:05,658
Zero security incidents.

298
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:11,080
Needless to say, wealth management is a highly regulated

299
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,259
industry. We want to have 100% compliance

300
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:14,379
in our industry.

301
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,190
We want systems that are ultra

302
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,048
resilient,

303
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,308
always on,

304
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:22,710
and very fast recovery mode when

305
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,609
the failure happens.

306
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:27,639
And training systems are designed for peak. You

307
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,879
don't design trading system for average volume.

308
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:31,428
You always designed for the peak, right?

309
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:34,239
So 10x scale, sub-millisecond

310
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:34,899
performance,

311
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
and obviously make it cheaper as you do so.

312
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:40,590
Now LPL, if you look at LPL, we are a very

313
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,750
fast growing organization,

314
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,269
both organically and inorganically.

315
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,048
As we add more advisers on the platform,

316
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:51,619
those advisors will add more clients,

317
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,450
more accounts on the platform.

318
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:55,590
More trading volume.

319
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:58,529
Regardless of how much trading volume happens,

320
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,129
every adviser, every client account expects

321
00:12:01,548 --> 00:12:02,590
speed, scale,

322
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,330
institutional grade resiliency.

323
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:11,529
And how are we doing that?

324
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:14,200
So we have two objectives to do, to meet

325
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,119
those expectations.

326
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,460
First, we want to leverage

327
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,219
AWS Cloud to provide

328
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:22,000
the speed, scale, and resiliency commitment

329
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,940
to our customers.

330
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,899
And we wanna infuse intelligence

331
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:27,960
in our platform, leveraging AI

332
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:31,080
platforms like SageMaker, Bedrock, and others.

333
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,538
The next slides will look at exactly how we

334
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:35,369
are trying to do that.

335
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:40,129
So our cloud journey,

336
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:42,519
the journey is a very appropriate term, especially

337
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,570
large scale organizations like us, right? It's

338
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,149
never a big bang to go to the cloud.

339
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:48,808
So we have been on a cloud journey for a few years

340
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:50,969
now, but to keep it simple, we'll anchor

341
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:52,808
ourselves in 2024.

342
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,158
To understand how we are doing our cloud

343
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:56,779
journey,

344
00:12:57,158 --> 00:12:59,200
this is more of an iterative fashion where

345
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,538
every year, every step feeds into the next

346
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:03,859
step. It's a,

347
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,729
it's not a migration,

348
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:06,649
it's a reinvention.

349
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:09,009
I had to use the word reinvention somewhere,

350
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:11,308
uh, uh, but

351
00:13:11,308 --> 00:13:13,288
it's truly a reinvention every step of the way,

352
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,210
um.

353
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,529
So the way we, we, the way we

354
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,950
deliberately began a cloud journey, the analogy

355
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,099
I can give, the best analogy we can come up with is

356
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:24,178
building a skyscraper.

357
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,668
You wanna get to a very fault tolerant system,

358
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,048
highly resilient platform.

359
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,590
It's like building like a skyscraper. You don't start

360
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,590
a skyscraper with the 40th floor. You

361
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,950
build a foundation, reinforce the core,

362
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:38,190
then you add electricity, plumbing, automations,

363
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,908
what have you.

364
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:41,320
Every level

365
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,259
helps the next level to withstand more load

366
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:46,379
and grow taller and operate smarter.

367
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,399
Our journey is very similar.

368
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:51,250
Up until 2024.

369
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:53,418
We started migrating

370
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
more and more of our processes from

371
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,129
our on-prem data centers to the cloud.

372
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:00,759
We have multiple critical systems running

373
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,918
in EKS and we'll see more in some use

374
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:05,000
cases. We

375
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,119
are adopting more AI. We have machine

376
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,639
learning algorithms which are

377
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:10,619
used on Sagemaker.

378
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,330
This year has been a lot about auto scaling.

379
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,750
Now one thing about auto scaling is, uh,

380
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,379
EKS, as we all know, scales automatically

381
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:21,590
if it's, it's set up in the right way.

382
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:24,750
You gotta have a good independent

383
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:25,509
system,

384
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:26,590
so we started

385
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,090
decoupling our platforms this year so

386
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,168
that we can harness auto scaling. In some

387
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:32,750
instances we have seen 10x scale

388
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:35,090
just by tweaking how we design our

389
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,210
system, and we'll we have a good use case to talk

390
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:37,849
about that today.

391
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,269
As we go into next year, we are on a journey of

392
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:43,288
enhancing our resiliency of the platform.

393
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,899
Like today, we are

394
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,808
multi-availability zone,

395
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:49,389
and we want to transform that to a multi-region,

396
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:51,080
multi-availability zone.

397
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,989
We'll do so by reducing our

398
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:56,009
on-prem dependencies, on-prem

399
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:57,109
data dependencies.

400
00:14:58,178 --> 00:14:59,320
We do so by

401
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,460
incrementally first trying to go to an active

402
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,678
passive journey

403
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,219
if you, if you have done any multi-region implementations,

404
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:07,239
you realize that

405
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:10,139
going from active passive to active active,

406
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:12,379
especially for right systems is a different ball game.

407
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,298
So we start with active active passive trend

408
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:16,399
towards active active.

409
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,739
Our target state is to be a really a

410
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:20,080
system that is.

411
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,009
Very fault tolerant,

412
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:25,070
recovers in sub millisecond.

413
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:28,529
Is using AI as a digital

414
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,629
practice within the infrastructure itself.

415
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,359
So this is an iterative and incremental journey

416
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:34,879
we're on.

417
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,879
So let's look at our current state architecture.

418
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:39,869
I, like I said,

419
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,000
We have our on-prem data center,

420
00:15:44,538 --> 00:15:47,989
right? And

421
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,989
we have multi availability zone in the

422
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:50,548
cloud.

423
00:15:50,989 --> 00:15:53,649
Our workflows today for many instances

424
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,029
designed to handshake between on-prem to the cloud.

425
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:58,509
So we have a dedicated handshake, dedicated

426
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:00,769
line pipe between our on-prem

427
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:01,869
to the cloud,

428
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:04,418
which helps reduce the latency for any of the

429
00:16:04,418 --> 00:16:06,908
workflows that become chatty. We try to avoid chattiness,

430
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,349
but if, if there's chattiness, it reduces the latency.

431
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:13,629
Some of the key components that we have in the,

432
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:15,899
in our, in our design from Amazon,

433
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,080
AWS perspective.

434
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,048
We use

435
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:23,000
Um, We use S3

436
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,269
bucket for our presentation layer and

437
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:26,019
content rendering

438
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:27,219
very standard.

439
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:30,668
We use EKS Kuberti's surveless

440
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:31,658
design and architecture

441
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,479
for um intensive processes in

442
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:36,658
many spaces. It's actually designed to

443
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,200
auto scale and self-heal. They're

444
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
returning to a self field. We'll talk a little bit more about that

445
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,619
later. When

446
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,330
it comes to data,

447
00:16:45,658 --> 00:16:46,639
it's uh

448
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:49,080
different options depending on the need

449
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,479
for our relational need, which is a pretty common

450
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,058
requirement for high transaction

451
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:55,149
throughput systems,

452
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,099
we have Postres SQL,

453
00:16:57,739 --> 00:16:59,940
uh, we use the Dynamo DB

454
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,479
for our

455
00:17:01,298 --> 00:17:03,538
document docu document databases for more

456
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:06,000
mostly read read, uh, use cases.

457
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,719
We use memory DB for low latency,

458
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:10,959
high computing in memory processes.

459
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:14,417
Um, Kafka is a big part of our ecosystem.

460
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,968
Uh, it serves as a big message broker.

461
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:19,298
It reduces the cascading

462
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:21,499
dependencies. It reduces any, any

463
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,479
failures that may happen from one system to another.

464
00:17:24,229 --> 00:17:24,789
Um,

465
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:27,348
around that, we use SageMaker heavily

466
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:29,348
today for our machine learning algorithms and some

467
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,608
of the AI use cases.

468
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:33,170
Um, CloudWatch is a big part of our

469
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,568
instrumentation

470
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,170
along with, uh,

471
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:38,750
any observability, end to end observability.

472
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,608
Right, so this is our current state.

473
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:44,539
Designed uh it's

474
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,328
multi availability zone,

475
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:48,390
works in tandem with on-prem.

476
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,588
And it works for what it is now, but

477
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:53,750
we are on a journey to we are transforming this into

478
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,750
something more futuristic and ready for the

479
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,348
next generation.

480
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,009
So next-gen architecture

481
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:00,088
is trending.

482
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:02,789
First, the biggest thing that you see here is that there is

483
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:04,750
no on-prem dependency, right?

484
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:07,689
Especially for what we

485
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,189
call as tier one

486
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:10,930
critical applications.

487
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:14,150
Uh

488
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:17,799
When you remove the on-prem dependency

489
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:19,358
at that time,

490
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,939
it's easier to harness the

491
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:24,549
full. Power of the cloud,

492
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:27,160
your resiliency becomes truly from end

493
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,709
to end. Your failovers become simpler,

494
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,469
so we are in the journey of transforming

495
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:34,568
a cloud, our on-prem dependencies

496
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:36,509
to the cloud, and which is an interesting

497
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:39,358
thing if you have any done any of this cloud transformation

498
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:40,009
from on-prem.

499
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,199
On-print systems, traditionally, the way

500
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:45,019
it is, is not really designed for

501
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:48,199
small components. You gotta break down the dependencies,

502
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:50,799
sequence the work, we do it in a very risk-averse,

503
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:51,818
high tested manner.

504
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,299
We are trending towards a

505
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,640
An active, active multi-region environment,

506
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,598
especially which is gonna be real,

507
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:02,160
especially without with reducing the on-prem

508
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,779
dependency

509
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:03,939
and like I said,

510
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,509
we'll start with active passive and we are going to trend

511
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:07,568
towards active active.

512
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,088
One of the biggest challenges that we are seeing

513
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:11,868
and we we are working on it is

514
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:14,729
how do you make sure the data is consistent

515
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:17,118
for right instances on multi-region.

516
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,759
So we're looking at Aurora DB as a big use

517
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,108
case for us, uh, natively supports this.

518
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,549
Um, how do you orchestrate

519
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,949
requests between multiple regions

520
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:28,309
in an active, active way?

521
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:31,250
So those are the problems that we are solving, um.

522
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:34,709
In the next gen architecture we will also be

523
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:35,500
also adopting

524
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,910
uh Bedrock along with SageMaker. We

525
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,039
feel Bedrock because as we adopt more Gen

526
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,858
AI and LLM, I think Bedrock

527
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,199
gives us better integration into our

528
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,239
core workflows and becomes an and

529
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:48,259
there's a learning curve is slightly easier.

530
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,279
So this is our next generation architecture

531
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,348
that we are solving for,

532
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,338
right? Um

533
00:19:57,618 --> 00:19:59,838
Most of it, many of it actually is underway,

534
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,420
and we want to start getting some stuff in production

535
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,318
early next year.

536
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:06,920
Now, um

537
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,160
we break water.

538
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,949
Let's click down a little bit in terms of

539
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,209
some of the use cases that we

540
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:21,250
are supporting today, uh,

541
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:23,108
the architecture that we looked at,

542
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:25,930
let's see some use cases in action in terms of how

543
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,049
that cloud and this native AWS helped us

544
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:30,180
get there. So Klein

545
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,189
works rebalancer,

546
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:33,660
Klein works rebalancer is our

547
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,529
uh. Flagship

548
00:20:36,828 --> 00:20:38,769
homegrown trading platform.

549
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,578
This platform is designed on the principle

550
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:43,519
of what we call as models-based trading.

551
00:20:44,318 --> 00:20:45,618
Now what is model space trading?

552
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:48,578
Now. Typically

553
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:50,469
an advisor will have hundreds of clients,

554
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:51,358
let's say

555
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,318
each client, as you would imagine,

556
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:55,699
would have different investment needs,

557
00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:58,140
different goals, investment objectives,

558
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,299
risk profiles.

559
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:01,160
Some clients

560
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:02,578
may want

561
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:04,239
an aggressive portfolio,

562
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:05,358
high reward,

563
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:08,180
high risk. Some may want conservative portfolio,

564
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:09,559
low reward, low risk.

565
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,719
For example, if someone is close to retirement, you

566
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,559
may see a more conservative portfolio like that.

567
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:19,390
Now, advisors would typically

568
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,689
create portfolios to meet the client's need

569
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,848
as per their investment objectives, their goals,

570
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:25,789
and that's good.

571
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:29,229
But markets is always changing, right? Our market

572
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:31,269
is always moving, always changing. I mean

573
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:32,729
if you think about this year,

574
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:34,890
think of the big market movers this year

575
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,410
interest rate changes, tariff

576
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,858
changes, tariff changes,

577
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:40,358
AI disruptions,

578
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,949
those are pretty common instances in the market

579
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,930
and when those swings happen.

580
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:48,229
The portfolio completely deviates

581
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:50,068
from what it was intended to do.

582
00:21:50,368 --> 00:21:52,410
A portfolio that was supposed to be conservative

583
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,049
will become moderately aggressive.

584
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,068
And that's not good. Uh,

585
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:58,959
an adviser will have to financial advisor

586
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:01,219
in this case will have to take prompt action toward

587
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,828
any market exposure for the client.

588
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,269
Now, without automation, this

589
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:08,949
would be a very tedious manual

590
00:22:08,949 --> 00:22:11,368
process, account by account, client by client.

591
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:12,588
Not scalable,

592
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:13,469
error prone.

593
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:15,180
How do we solve this?

594
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:16,469
Models based practice

595
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:19,309
in models based practice, advisor sets up models

596
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:21,969
and each model will be flagged by metadata

597
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:24,410
like this model is for aggressive portfolio,

598
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:26,029
conservative portfolio,

599
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,689
an adviser will assign the model to the

600
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:30,809
account so ultimately this would be a

601
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,189
one to many relationship from model to accounts.

602
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,209
So when the trading happens, advisor is not trading the

603
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:40,328
account, the adviser is actually trading on the

604
00:22:40,328 --> 00:22:40,939
models.

605
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:43,380
This principle is exactly the principle client

606
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,750
grocery Balance is built on.

607
00:22:45,689 --> 00:22:47,420
Client was rebalancing today does

608
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,299
millions of drift checks

609
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:50,578
in parallel.

610
00:22:51,118 --> 00:22:53,640
It does executions, trade executions

611
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,549
automatically,

612
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,078
does so by being fully compliant with

613
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:58,140
the seamless

614
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,920
experience for the advisors.

615
00:23:00,818 --> 00:23:03,088
The best analogy I see of client rebalancer

616
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:03,759
is, uh,

617
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,779
is like a GPS when you put a target destination,

618
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,680
your GPS will recalibrate, reroute

619
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,180
based on the traffic pattern.

620
00:23:11,578 --> 00:23:13,479
That's exactly what client rebalancer does.

621
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:15,358
Thousands of accounts,

622
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,049
millions of trades calibrate in the

623
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:20,098
client rebalancer as the market moves,

624
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,328
it will suggest automatically and bring the

625
00:23:22,328 --> 00:23:23,920
accounts back into their original goal.

626
00:23:25,368 --> 00:23:27,670
Today, on Clein Works Rebalancer, we have

627
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,430
14,000 advisors.

628
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,789
And this has been a deliberate incremental journey

629
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:34,989
for the last 5 years. If you recall,

630
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:37,029
we have 32 32,000

631
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:38,930
advisors at LPL Financial.

632
00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:41,779
And we are slowly rolling this

633
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:44,259
platform out to more and more advisers incrementally.

634
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:47,009
We have done more than 70 million trades

635
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,449
on this platform, and we do a million

636
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:51,309
drift checks every day on this platform.

637
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,939
So this is the

638
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,578
product side of the equation setting the business

639
00:23:56,578 --> 00:23:57,150
context.

640
00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:59,000
Now let's take a simple use case.

641
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,759
One use case with inclined grocery balancer

642
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:03,939
powered by AWS for hyperscaling.

643
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,890
When a trade happens.

644
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,848
Each trade,

645
00:24:17,348 --> 00:24:19,699
like, let's say climber's rebalance a trade happens,

646
00:24:19,868 --> 00:24:20,769
each trade will do

647
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,269
50+ checks.

648
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,000
Think about things like what are the common things

649
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,858
if I wanna trade

650
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,358
is my account OK? Account details,

651
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:30,559
uh, what is the price right now in the market? What

652
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,640
is the, what is the licensing check? Uh, what is

653
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,699
the compliance rules for this, for this trade?

654
00:24:35,118 --> 00:24:36,630
Imagine 50+ calls,

655
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,118
thousands of trades across hundreds of accounts, across

656
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:41,209
hundreds of advisers. We're looking at hundreds

657
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:43,098
of thousands of trade volume going through

658
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,259
every minute.

659
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:47,828
The way we design the platform, so if you've, if

660
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:49,880
you keep up with me from the left to right,

661
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,420
imagine a large rebalance rate comes in

662
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,180
from the, from the, from the advisor.

663
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:57,489
We, we run an orchestrator.

664
00:24:58,189 --> 00:25:00,549
This orchestrator looks at the function and sees

665
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,229
how do we smartly design this hundreds

666
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:04,939
of thousands of crates into chunks.

667
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:07,309
So design, it breaks into small mini

668
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:08,009
batches.

669
00:25:08,969 --> 00:25:11,289
All these chunks, these mini batches,

670
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:13,650
go to Kafka, which is our broker.

671
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,618
The me and Kafka is amazing

672
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,299
because it, it has guaranteed delivery.

673
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,809
So it goes to Kafka on

674
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:26,509
the other side is where the brain is,

675
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:29,269
the rebalancer. The rebalance algorithm

676
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,229
is sitting on EKS cluster,

677
00:25:31,578 --> 00:25:33,670
right? It's designed

678
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:35,068
to auto scale.

679
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,640
That the algorithm of rebalance

680
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,759
is made in a way is completely independent

681
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:43,140
of each other. It's harnessing

682
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,459
the full power of EKS for auto scaling, so

683
00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:47,539
in real time, it will look at

684
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:48,539
what's my CPU

685
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:50,969
right now, what is the memory utilization,

686
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,299
what is the queue depth on my Kafka

687
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:54,239
stream right now.

688
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,219
And based on that, it will

689
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:59,759
scale up or spawn more instances of

690
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,358
rebalancer with the EKS.

691
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,900
Now, if you remember I said something about 2000

692
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,789
checks that happened.

693
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:09,289
More than 200 checks from that actually

694
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:10,568
are pre-trade validation.

695
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:13,130
So pre-trade validation

696
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,199
to even know if this trade can be done or not,

697
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:17,420
right? And you want to do the

698
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,539
trade checks as soon as possible. So

699
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:21,529
what we do here in Rebalancer is

700
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:23,818
We do in-process caching.

701
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,529
Of all the data and the rules

702
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:28,078
for 200+ trade checks,

703
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:30,529
so instantaneously we get some millisecond

704
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:32,539
feedback and the trade cannot be done,

705
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:34,559
it's not in good order, failed from here,

706
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,828
it's kicked back

707
00:26:36,098 --> 00:26:38,150
to to the queue and will not make its way forward.

708
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:39,689
Right,

709
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,239
so we had rebalancer,

710
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,930
IKEAS, auto scaling in process caching

711
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,150
for some uh pre-trade validation

712
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:47,410
from here.

713
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:51,118
There are intensive processes that happen

714
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:52,858
for every trade, every rebalance.

715
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:56,828
So what we did, we applied the principle of parallellyzation

716
00:26:56,828 --> 00:26:58,848
over here. So we looked at all the 60 plus

717
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:01,140
code uh microservices database

718
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,689
calls happen. We grouped them

719
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:05,430
as per the dependency map and see what

720
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,469
can be run in parallel. So we decided we

721
00:27:07,469 --> 00:27:09,709
run everything in parallel and just rebalancing

722
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:11,769
calling them and they're designed to not block each other.

723
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,368
Now from here

724
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,368
Every system,

725
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,989
right, has reads and rights. Now Res has different

726
00:27:18,989 --> 00:27:20,650
problems, rights are different problems, right?

727
00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:22,410
So from here,

728
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,989
we apply the paradigm of CQRS

729
00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:27,170
command query responsibility segregation.

730
00:27:27,368 --> 00:27:28,469
Most of you know about that.

731
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:31,410
So for the rights we optimize the

732
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,449
rights writings of one server, but

733
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:35,489
the rights are not transactional. The rights

734
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:37,608
are batched, buffered together so that we

735
00:27:37,608 --> 00:27:39,309
have less hits to the database.

736
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,318
From here the reads span

737
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:44,368
out and the reads are going to the read

738
00:27:44,368 --> 00:27:45,189
instances

739
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,779
because there are more reads than rights in the system, so

740
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:49,130
the reads optimized for that

741
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:51,568
and we also do a lot of caching

742
00:27:51,568 --> 00:27:52,449
in memory DB

743
00:27:52,848 --> 00:27:53,949
uh in AWS.

744
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:56,410
Which helps for any, any computations,

745
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:58,809
anything that may be intensive, we precalculate,

746
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,229
get it ready in memory for further steps.

747
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:04,650
Now one thing that we are doing now is

748
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,809
adaptive scaling on the read instances,

749
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,239
uh, because this system is heavy read,

750
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:11,670
so we want the system to, like I said, the EKS

751
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,670
automatically scales, we want the reads to automatically

752
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,789
scale, so we're doing adaptive scaling on the reeds.

753
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:20,328
Throughout this life cycle, we use cloud

754
00:28:20,328 --> 00:28:23,199
watch to end to end observability.

755
00:28:25,189 --> 00:28:27,209
When the trade happens

756
00:28:27,469 --> 00:28:29,640
from that it gets a correlation ID

757
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:32,380
because obviously we got a heavy logging,

758
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,809
full traceability of every trade

759
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,670
and that trade will tell us that token

760
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,828
tells us how did the trade navigate, which cluster

761
00:28:38,828 --> 00:28:40,949
it went through, did it go through, how long did it take,

762
00:28:40,989 --> 00:28:42,809
so we have I use cloudWatch for that.

763
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:46,009
We also do, uh, now all the systems

764
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:48,250
are designed to self- alert, self

765
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,949
feel the AES cluster, especially,

766
00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:51,989
but we also do synthetics.

767
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:54,890
So what it, what synthetics, what we do basically

768
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,549
we create a transaction which mimics

769
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,209
how an advisor would do this.

770
00:28:59,608 --> 00:29:01,608
So we run that transaction

771
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:03,189
for end to end on the system

772
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,689
just every, every iteratively

773
00:29:05,689 --> 00:29:06,910
so that we know if there's

774
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:09,328
a problem with the platform we would know before the users

775
00:29:09,328 --> 00:29:11,328
knows it. Today the

776
00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:13,449
system is running 1,000s

777
00:29:13,449 --> 00:29:15,449
of transactions per second. We have seen

778
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:17,568
almost a million transactions in peak volume.

779
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:19,828
And

780
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,969
it's, it's ready for more,

781
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:24,328
uh. All

782
00:29:24,328 --> 00:29:26,719
right, AI

783
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:28,799
as promised. So we'll talk about some of our use

784
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,838
cases we're doing in AI,

785
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,098
uh.

786
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:32,989
So

787
00:29:33,348 --> 00:29:35,549
our philosophy in LPL we truly

788
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:37,709
believe the power of AI that AI is

789
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:38,328
here

790
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:40,529
to help advisers get

791
00:29:40,868 --> 00:29:42,390
smarter and more efficient.

792
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,719
But we believe in a human in the loop approach

793
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:48,920
as AI is suggesting.

794
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:50,650
Outcomes

795
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:53,568
As AI is suggesting um.

796
00:29:54,348 --> 00:29:56,549
Smart recommendations inside, advisor

797
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:57,848
will still be in control,

798
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,469
taking those insights.

799
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:03,309
So let's look at the first use case.

800
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,739
So market center outage, right? So

801
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:08,979
once when a trade happens,

802
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:10,318
right, the trade

803
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:12,818
doesn't just just go and execute. There are

804
00:30:12,818 --> 00:30:15,140
a set of intermediaries that have that

805
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:17,279
that. Before it

806
00:30:17,868 --> 00:30:20,140
reaches the market center, some of the intermediaries

807
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,209
are within the company, some are external to the market,

808
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:24,779
but the critical end point is the market center is

809
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,219
where actually the trades happen.

810
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:30,539
Now these market centers

811
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:32,779
sometimes have slowness, and there are multiple market centers,

812
00:30:32,949 --> 00:30:34,588
right, not just one, there are many market centers.

813
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:37,779
But sometimes there are challenges, problems,

814
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:40,098
and outages even in market centers.

815
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,750
And by the time we get alerts, it's kind

816
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,009
of late for us to know.

817
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,989
To react to it, what happens is that

818
00:30:47,608 --> 00:30:49,509
there's an outage in a market center,

819
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,098
orders keep piling on.

820
00:30:52,848 --> 00:30:53,529
The system.

821
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,189
Worse, new orders keep on piling

822
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:58,828
on as well.

823
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,769
If you look at from um adviser's

824
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:03,848
perspective, from a user's perspective, the user would

825
00:31:03,848 --> 00:31:06,009
say, oh, my order did not go

826
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:07,630
through. Let me try it again.

827
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,269
Duplicates happen.

828
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:11,309
Complete operational nightmare

829
00:31:11,689 --> 00:31:13,189
when you start getting duplicates in the system.

830
00:31:14,098 --> 00:31:16,219
So our goal was to lift shift and

831
00:31:16,219 --> 00:31:18,289
know as much as we can from market center

832
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:19,420
outage ahead of that.

833
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:21,189
So how did, how did we do that?

834
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,118
So we created a workflow.

835
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:25,180
Now this workflow

836
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,078
first feeds all the real-time trades

837
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:29,338
and executions

838
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:30,989
to an algorithm.

839
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:32,160
This algorithm.

840
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:35,750
Detects patterns for any anomalies

841
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,209
and if the anomaly is detected, it will

842
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:40,328
transition the anomalies and outcome

843
00:31:40,328 --> 00:31:41,199
to the operational

844
00:31:41,729 --> 00:31:43,769
team, and they will start taking actions from there.

845
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,049
What algorithm do we use? We use an algorithm

846
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:49,130
called random cut forest, which

847
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,130
is a time series anomaly

848
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,049
detection algorithm.

849
00:31:56,328 --> 00:31:58,500
That's first use case, and we'll talk about architecture

850
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,559
after this, like how we did that using SageMaker.

851
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:03,769
The second use case we have is our ETF

852
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:04,568
classification.

853
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:07,588
Now, obviously in trading

854
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:08,709
there are a lot of securities.

855
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:11,078
You got equities, you got mutual funds,

856
00:32:11,088 --> 00:32:13,229
you got ETF which is a type of equities.

857
00:32:13,689 --> 00:32:16,269
Now if you know ETFs, ETFs have

858
00:32:16,608 --> 00:32:17,949
different holdings that go in there,

859
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:20,549
right? Based on what goes in an ETF,

860
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,140
we have to classify ETF

861
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:24,670
in different categories.

862
00:32:25,368 --> 00:32:27,368
For example, let's say there's an ETTF for

863
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:29,449
crypto, ETF for commodities,

864
00:32:29,568 --> 00:32:31,150
ETF for foreign funds.

865
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:33,890
Based on the metadata of the ETF,

866
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:34,959
what it holds,

867
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,989
we have to classify because

868
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,430
there is a regulatory implication

869
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:41,969
because certain ETFs, there has to be licensing

870
00:32:41,969 --> 00:32:43,630
checks, there has to be

871
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:46,088
compliance rules, there have to be trainings that

872
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:47,660
the user advisor has to go through.

873
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,449
So this, this is a pretty critical workflow

874
00:32:50,449 --> 00:32:52,729
where we gotta flag and categorize the ETF

875
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,650
appropriately.

876
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,180
Now, typically, traditionally, this was done more manually,

877
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:58,459
where somebody would go.

878
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,130
Look at the data,

879
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,420
look at the prospectus, as we call it,

880
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,588
look at the metadata for the ETF

881
00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:06,269
and manually classify it.

882
00:33:07,578 --> 00:33:08,160
So we

883
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,500
decided how do we start because and and ETF

884
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,519
is is a fast changing market. There are new ETFs

885
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,858
always added in the marketplace.

886
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,358
So how do we automate that?

887
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:17,699
So we again, we created a workflow here which

888
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:20,108
runs nightly. It takes an ETFs

889
00:33:20,108 --> 00:33:22,259
as we go. It runs through a model, a

890
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:23,039
trained model,

891
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,039
and that model would suggest

892
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,459
what ETF this category should be

893
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:28,358
categorized as

894
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:30,858
and operational staff reviews and accepts

895
00:33:30,858 --> 00:33:33,259
it. The algorithm we used was ANN,

896
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,930
artificial neural network, which is an unsupervised

897
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,199
model for doing so.

898
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:38,769
With high accuracy

899
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:41,769
Now, let's get to the

900
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,430
architecture of how we did this.

901
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,180
Um,

902
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:56,259
so,

903
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:59,439
any AI model has to be trained,

904
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,358
right? You gotta have the data,

905
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:03,068
historical data,

906
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:05,640
wherever you get the data, so it gets better

907
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,598
outcome, better results.

908
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,708
We store the data in the RDS, Aurora

909
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:12,010
postgrad database.

910
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,800
For example, the first use case, the market center outage,

911
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,969
the data for that is all the historical trades

912
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:19,139
and executions data.

913
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,750
The data stored over there.

914
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:23,510
The second use case, which is the classification,

915
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,688
all the security master, all the metadata around

916
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,378
it is stored in the database.

917
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:30,958
From here, we have a lambda function. This

918
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:31,818
lambda function

919
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:34,559
picks this data, historical data, which is

920
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:35,958
curated, updated every day.

921
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,478
Massages it, gets it ready, dumps

922
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:40,860
the data for

923
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,188
learning in 3 bucket.

924
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,059
And this is where the heart comes into play, which is the sage

925
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:48,300
maker. So our sage maker is

926
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,639
where we train

927
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:52,159
and uh other models reside.

928
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,780
So Sage maker in this case will pick up the trained

929
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,539
data, the, the training data,

930
00:34:56,978 --> 00:34:59,019
run through it, train it, and once it's

931
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:01,079
trained, it's ready to be published

932
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:03,260
and it's available as an endpoint,

933
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:06,010
as a model, trained model for for downstream

934
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,110
consumption. Very simple

935
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,949
workflow Now

936
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,438
let's run these couple of use cases.

937
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,030
The first use case, uh,

938
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:16,550
in the real-time anomaly detection, right? So

939
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:17,969
as the traits.

940
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:20,949
Hundreds and thousands of trades are going in real time.

941
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:22,050
The stream of data

942
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:24,628
is picked up by this lambda on the right function,

943
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,449
right side. It picks up this data,

944
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,030
runs this data via the train model, that

945
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,590
endpoint.

946
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:31,739
Like in this case, the

947
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,128
random cut cut forest algorithm, it

948
00:35:34,128 --> 00:35:36,378
will detect the time series data,

949
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,760
tell us that, hey, there's an anomaly. If there's

950
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,878
an anomaly, immediately it alerts

951
00:35:40,878 --> 00:35:41,469
the staff

952
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,429
then the data is fed back to the RDS for

953
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:46,438
future learning based on the decisions that

954
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:47,280
uh the model took.

955
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,510
Same thing for the ATF classification.

956
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,800
New ETF comes,

957
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,139
go to the lambda function,

958
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,639
runs it by the train model end point,

959
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:55,898
gets outcome,

960
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,119
gives outcome to the operator,

961
00:35:58,398 --> 00:35:59,039
and, uh.

962
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,760
And it's ready in the RDS instance.

963
00:36:02,898 --> 00:36:05,059
So yeah, so this works and uh it's

964
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:07,128
fully functional, it's really helped us a lot, these couple,

965
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:08,579
at least these couple of use cases.

966
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:10,769
Um,

967
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:13,239
to some of the use cases that we have underway

968
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:13,750
right now.

969
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,579
Um,

970
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,099
so the first one is a trading back office

971
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:27,639
automation.

972
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,708
Right, so this is our multi-agenttic

973
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:31,969
solution, um,

974
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:34,530
that we are currently, it's underway on our side.

975
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:37,389
So let's give me some, let me give some business context

976
00:36:37,389 --> 00:36:39,329
to this problem that we're trying to solve here.

977
00:36:39,668 --> 00:36:40,188
Um.

978
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:43,219
So, so when we all invest money,

979
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,159
what is our goal?

980
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:47,188
Grow money, right? We want to make more money.

981
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,369
When the portfolio grows, what happens?

982
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:53,228
More capital gains taxes. The more

983
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:54,530
more taxes

984
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:57,228
has high impact on accounts which are larger

985
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:58,030
sizes.

986
00:36:59,128 --> 00:37:01,309
Especially for ultra high net worth

987
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:02,300
uh clients,

988
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,579
the tax consequences can be huge,

989
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,969
and they, uh, there are typically tax

990
00:37:06,969 --> 00:37:09,159
thresholds that, hey, this for this account,

991
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:11,478
this is the max tax I would like

992
00:37:11,478 --> 00:37:12,429
to pay every year,

993
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:14,110
so they're tax thresholds.

994
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,228
Now we saw that rebalancer itself

995
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:19,719
is a complicated process. Now imagine

996
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:22,010
a rebalancer overlaid

997
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,389
with tax awareness,

998
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,250
tax optimization, tax consequences

999
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:28,340
gets different level of complex.

1000
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:31,789
We have an algorithm that takes 50

1001
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:33,090
plus variables.

1002
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,719
Into account

1003
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:37,139
now when we run and each 5th

1004
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:38,599
of these variables

1005
00:37:38,878 --> 00:37:40,978
has an interdependency

1006
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:43,039
if one changes this impact to the other one

1007
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,659
and they're highly highly sensitive

1008
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,099
so tweaking those variables

1009
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:48,500
in the algorithm

1010
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,918
and getting the right return and the

1011
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:52,938
right tax outcomes, it's

1012
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:54,458
a very difficult process

1013
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,280
and very hard to scale.

1014
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,320
So we decided we explore different possibilities.

1015
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,000
So one of the things that we're looking at

1016
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,438
is using a multi-agentic uh agentic

1017
00:38:03,438 --> 00:38:05,139
AI framework to solve this problem.

1018
00:38:05,918 --> 00:38:08,079
So what is an agent, as we all know, agent is nothing

1019
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,199
but a model model that has a role and

1020
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,579
takes actions based on the role.

1021
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,800
So the first model, our first model and first agent

1022
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,000
we have is a rebalancer.

1023
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,760
So this rebalancer model, this agent is trained

1024
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,030
with. 22

1025
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,039
data sets. First data set is

1026
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,519
the algorithm that I talked about, it is trained with

1027
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,269
the algorithm,

1028
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,878
it's trained with this 50+ parameters,

1029
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,750
these variables,

1030
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:32,329
different combinations, what does each variable

1031
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:34,438
do? The other set of

1032
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:36,978
data that it is trained with is

1033
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,559
the historical runs, right? So

1034
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:42,599
if there was a run for a tax trade rebalancer,

1035
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,619
especially which is done manually today.

1036
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:48,168
Good outcomes, not so favorable outcomes,

1037
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,949
regardless, whatever data is, it's actually trained with that

1038
00:38:50,949 --> 00:38:53,119
data. So imagine now

1039
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,458
we are doing hundreds of these requests in a day. A

1040
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,300
request comes in,

1041
00:38:56,659 --> 00:38:58,659
the rebalancer agent runs the

1042
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:00,550
request, gets some outcome, right?

1043
00:39:00,978 --> 00:39:02,320
This outcome goes back.

1044
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:05,409
Based on the favorable outcome, it'll go to the validation

1045
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,530
agent. Now validation agent, its role

1046
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,389
is very simple.

1047
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:11,269
Rebalance it just looks at the rebalance as one thing

1048
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:13,369
validation looks around the ecosystem of

1049
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:14,849
an account, account a client.

1050
00:39:15,128 --> 00:39:17,329
Is this outcome gonna create any cascading

1051
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:18,510
dependencies and impact?

1052
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,409
Based on that, the validation agent on a happy

1053
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:23,648
path will approve it and it goes

1054
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,728
to the trading agent, which, which I'm

1055
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:27,820
dumbing down as an agent, which is more complex,

1056
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,429
but trading agent will just

1057
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:32,010
execute the trades with the market makers,

1058
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:33,010
market centers.

1059
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,179
Now, the other part where the validation

1060
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:36,958
agent

1061
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,719
fails based on whatever the rule may be,

1062
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:42,559
it'll send the response back with the appropriate feedback

1063
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:43,978
to the rebalancer agent.

1064
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:47,000
So that it can reprocess this request.

1065
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,300
So it's an agentic loop, but in

1066
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,099
some of our

1067
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:52,500
initial studies, it has given us 10x

1068
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,760
scale already

1069
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,378
in terms of what it can do from the throughput standpoint.

1070
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,389
So we're very excited about this uh as an agent,

1071
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,349
uh, multi agent AI solution.

1072
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,550
Uh, next use case is the model suggestions for

1073
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,628
account portfolio that's being uh, that's being worked

1074
00:40:06,628 --> 00:40:07,329
on right now.

1075
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,409
So. So we talked about models-based

1076
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,789
trading. So the industry is

1077
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,750
gone, trended towards

1078
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,289
models-based trading.

1079
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,309
But advisors, in many

1080
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:20,228
cases,

1081
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:23,309
some part of the book is not catered

1082
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:24,978
towards model-based trading.

1083
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:28,458
Why? Historical reasons is very common,

1084
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:30,628
right? But the, the process

1085
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,659
to actually convert the platform

1086
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:35,360
or the accounts to a models based practice

1087
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,599
or around the models is a very

1088
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,260
operationally intensive process and not really scalable

1089
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,079
so we are, we are working on an AI solution and

1090
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,159
it will do it will be very simple. It will look

1091
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,918
at advisor.

1092
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,579
The current book.

1093
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,769
And the current book and the holdings for

1094
00:40:51,769 --> 00:40:52,449
the accounts,

1095
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:55,168
accounts which have models, accounts that did not have models,

1096
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,519
based on the book, based on the accounts and the holdings,

1097
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,648
it will suggest the models that the

1098
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,719
adviser can use

1099
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:03,128
to transition towards models based practice.

1100
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:05,889
It's the ultimate, uh, it's a very efficiency

1101
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:07,030
play for the advisers over here

1102
00:41:07,728 --> 00:41:09,809
because we don't want advisers to spend time in operational

1103
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:11,809
work versus spend more time with the customers.

1104
00:41:13,148 --> 00:41:15,188
Right, so this is our end of the presentation.

1105
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:17,269
Um, uh, this journey has

1106
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:19,369
been pretty fun. It's truly been a team effort

1107
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:21,500
for multiple teams, organizations within

1108
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,188
the company,

1109
00:41:22,628 --> 00:41:24,849
uh, technology, business, product, and,

1110
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:25,559
uh,

1111
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,128
thank, uh, and our partners, and I'll call out,

1112
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,269
uh, cognizant for the partnership

1113
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:31,530
and support during the process.

1114
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:33,909
Great, um,
