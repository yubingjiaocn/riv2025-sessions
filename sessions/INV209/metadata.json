  "abstract": "AI agents have made financial institutions more productive, efficient, and secure. But a more autonomous financial system—defined by innovations like inter-agent payments, real-time underwriting, hyper-personalized customer service, and customized lending offers—represents the industry’s next frontier. This session explores how we will get there...and beyond. After outlining a vision for the agentic future of Financial Services, we’ll hear from two customers who will share how they are building the infrastructure for AI systems that independently execute complex financial operations. We’ll learn how they are architecting these systems for compliance and scalability and what it takes to run autonomous agents in production.",
