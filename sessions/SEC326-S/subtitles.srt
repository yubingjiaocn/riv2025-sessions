1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,413
- How you doing?

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,000
Do we have any golfers?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,495
Anybody who plays golf, likes golf?

4
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:11,730
Good, I have a good golf story.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,350
Now, this goes back to 1958

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,893
in Fort Worth, Texas.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,110
There was a...

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,030
The championship for the
Blind Golfers Association

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,710
had their award ceremony
for the best blind golfer.

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,910
And there was a guy, his
name was Charley Boswell.

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,910
He was the national champion blind golfer.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,550
And because of that,
he got the opportunity

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,220
to play a round of golf with Ben Hogan.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,900
Ben Hogan was the premier
golfer of that era.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,960
Like Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus,

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,300
Tiger Woods, that kind of level.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,900
So, Charley was very thrilled to meet them

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,503
'cause this was his idol.

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,430
But Charley lost his
sight during World War II.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,270
He was a really good athlete,

21
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,060
played football, played baseball.

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,440
And then during World War II,

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,890
he tried to save one of his comrades

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,660
in a tank that was burning.

25
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,110
And a shell blew up and he lost his sight,

26
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,790
so he didn't know what to do.

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,240
He came back, he took up
golf, never done it before.

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,410
So, he gets to meet the
best golfer of that era

29
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,120
and gets to play with him.

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,200
And Ben Hogan was in awe of
him 'cause he could play blind.

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,270
So, he said...

32
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,257
Charley said, "Hey, how
about if we play for money?"

33
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,927
And Ben, you know, go like,

34
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:49,140
"Wait, I'm like the best
golfer in the world.

35
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,543
I can't play for money for you.

36
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,417
It's unfair, you're blind."

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,423
And Charley is undeterred, he says,

38
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:00,147
"$1,000 a hole."

39
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,840
And Ben's like, "I can't play golf.

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,390
No, that would be unfair."

41
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,270
So, Charley says, "Are you chicken?"

42
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,430
Now, Ben is very competitive.

43
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,530
He says, "No, I'm not chicken.

44
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,720
Okay, you want me to play, I'll play.

45
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,130
No, I'm not gonna hold
back, I'm gonna play hard."

46
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,857
He goes, "I would expect that from you."

47
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,373
So,

48
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,840
Charley says...

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,213
Or Ben says to Charley, "Okay.

50
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,730
What time?"

51
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,157
Goes, "Tonight at 10."

52
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,230
So, this is an example of how

53
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,410
the playing field can be evened out.

54
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,340
Now, if you're...

55
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,860
Let's switch to another sport, football.

56
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,390
So, football, who has the advantage?

57
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,430
The offense or the defense, right?

58
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,590
The offense obviously
has advantage, right?

59
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,500
The quarterback gets to
play, calls it in the huddle,

60
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,260
comes in line, he sees
what the defense is set,

61
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,390
he figures out, what am I gonna do?

62
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,010
You know, the defense has to guess.

63
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,900
It's first down, maybe they're gonna run.

64
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,670
It's third down, maybe they're gonna pass,

65
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,290
but maybe they're gonna fake 'em out.

66
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,610
Are they gonna pass?

67
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,450
They gonna hand off,

68
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,640
they gonna fake the handoff pass,

69
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,870
run around, you know,

70
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,660
there's so many things that could be done.

71
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,470
So, we wanna say, how can
we even out the field?

72
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,560
How can we get into the
minds of the attackers

73
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,270
and make that playing field level,

74
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,060
just like Charley was able to level it out

75
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,680
with the world's greatest golfer?

76
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,300
So, I'm gonna pass it over to Memo here,

77
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,550
and he's gonna talk about

78
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,253
what our new deception technology does.

79
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,020
- Thank you, Rick.
(Rick laughs)

80
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,550
Well, now let's focus our
attention to the attackers, okay?

81
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,050
Just like Rick was mentioning.

82
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,340
When we are defending our systems,

83
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,550
sometimes we focus

84
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,780
and have our attention into the

85
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,390
designing defensive strategies, right?

86
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,750
And we focus on the attacks,
but not on the attackers.

87
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,220
And by doing this,

88
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,310
we can overlook something super important.

89
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,390
The humans...

90
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,460
Sorry, the attackers are just humans

91
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,530
like everyone in this room, right?

92
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,530
Humans with a brain that
works in the same way than us.

93
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,860
This is very important.

94
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,980
Understanding this is key to
implement defensive strategies

95
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,790
much more efficient, right?

96
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,000
We want to influence the
decision making of the attackers

97
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,303
to protect our systems.

98
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,533
Sorry.

99
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,900
But how can we influence the

100
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,810
decision making processes
of our attackers?

101
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,210
To answer this, let me
introduce these two concepts

102
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,810
of behavioral science, nudge and sludge.

103
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,830
Both are ways of describing

104
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,340
how to influence the
decision making, okay?

105
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,410
But in opposite ways.

106
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,730
On this side, we have nudge,

107
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,420
which is influencing in
a positive way, okay?

108
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,750
Let's say make it easier,
make it more simple.

109
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,480
Like here, we have a
password strength meter

110
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,180
to help the user create a strong password.

111
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,130
This is a very simple example.

112
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,940
Or on the bottom part, we have
a reminder of a application

113
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,040
to just do your daily exercise.

114
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,380
This is a example of nudge.

115
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,320
And on the other hand, we have sludge.

116
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,160
We have sludge,

117
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,830
which is to make the
process more complicated.

118
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,880
To add steps, add
complexity, add friction.

119
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,740
This is an example of sludge.

120
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,210
And here on the center we have a CAPTCHA.

121
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,730
A CAPTCHA has good intentions, right?

122
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,740
Is to block the bad actors.

123
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,883
But sometimes, the CAPTCHAs
add friction, complexity.

124
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,310
The legitimate users,

125
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,280
sometimes they see this
as additional steps

126
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,360
and end up just giving
up and going elsewhere.

127
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,040
This is an example of sludge.

128
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,980
And we can think of many examples.

129
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,160
Like, I'm sure here,
everyone has experienced

130
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,830
the subscription services on the internet.

131
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,840
It's always super easy to subscribe.

132
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,220
It's just one click away.

133
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,863
But what happens when you want to cancel?

134
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,560
There are several steps.

135
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,620
Sometimes you get an offer.

136
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,020
One free month, don't cancel.

137
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,910
Just extend three months more.

138
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,063
This is a very common
example of sludge and nudge.

139
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,003
And in the case of the attackers,

140
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,010
we want to use sludge for good.

141
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,410
We want to add friction, right?

142
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,243
We want to...

143
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,260
We can impose friction to
our attackers in our benefit

144
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,540
to create better defensive strategies.

145
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,440
We can influence their behavior

146
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,513
and decision making with sludge.

147
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,720
And what is the cost to the
attackers if we add friction?

148
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,570
There are different costs.

149
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,110
We have quantitative costs
and qualitative costs.

150
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,090
First, we have the obvious.

151
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,070
If we add friction into the process,

152
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,280
if we make the process more
difficult to the attackers,

153
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,010
we have everything that
costs money and effort,

154
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,840
we have this quantitative cost,

155
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,360
all the foregone opportunities.

156
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,490
But there's also the qualitative costs.

157
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,020
And we have reputational.

158
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,633
If we make them fail, the attackers,

159
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,800
they will lose credibility,
it will be harder to recruit,

160
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,190
it will be more difficult
to get new clients.

161
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,610
And also we have informational cost,

162
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,210
which refers to the
effort that the attackers

163
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,490
put to get more information
about the next targets.

164
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,370
If we add invaluable information,

165
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,890
we create more cost to them.

166
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,970
And finally,

167
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,750
and this is the reason of the
title of this presentation,

168
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,820
is the psychological cost.

169
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,800
If we add frustration, shame,
and confusion to the attackers

170
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,800
by making the process more
difficult, by adding friction,

171
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,970
we add this cost.

172
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,740
Now, let's see how at Fastly
we are using sludge for good.

173
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,450
And this is with deception.

174
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,000
Deception has been used
over the course of history

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,760
in many contexts, especially in warfare.

176
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,650
That's why we have here the Trojan Horse,

177
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,653
which the Greeks used against
the Trojans to win the war.

178
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,723
In cybersecurity,

179
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,370
we all know about the concept of honeypot,

180
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,830
which is a way to deceive the attackers

181
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,220
to get more information
about their tactics, okay?

182
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,230
In the nature, we also have many examples,

183
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,680
like animals changing their
appearance to hunt their preys

184
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,430
or protect against the predators.

185
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,410
Deception is not playing dirty.

186
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,800
Deception is about leveraging what we know

187
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,700
about our enemy tactics
in our benefit, okay?

188
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,410
This is deception.

189
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,200
And now Rick is going to explain to you

190
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,240
how Fastly is introducing deception

191
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,583
into our cybersecurity products.

192
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,260
- Okay, so this is kind of the
brainchild of our product VP

193
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,540
who has a deep security background

194
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,240
and a background in behavioral economics.

195
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,610
So, we wanna try and get
into the head of these guys.

196
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,443
We wanna,

197
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,020
like you said, make them
frustrated so they'll go away

198
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,310
or they won't bother this
particular site anymore.

199
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,470
So, this is just the
start of what we're doing.

200
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,900
And right now, the way we're gonna do it

201
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,660
is we're looking at account takeovers.

202
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,400
So, this is our WAF product,
Next-Gen WAF from Fastly,

203
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,230
where you can set the parameters

204
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,230
on when you want to trigger
the deception to happen.

205
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,690
So, basically, what it's gonna do,

206
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,600
once it's hit that deception trigger,

207
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,910
either by a signal that
says this is a bad bot,

208
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,490
or suspected bad bot,
or it's a certain path,

209
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,260
certain IP, certain country,

210
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,390
all that is open and configurable,

211
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,640
so you can decide the trigger point

212
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,250
when you want it to start deceiving.

213
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,580
But once it starts, gets
that deception going,

214
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,690
it's gonna take...

215
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,400
That guy's gonna go iterate through

216
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,930
his username and password

217
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,357
to try and find one that works

218
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:25,560
'cause he paid money for it.

219
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,640
So, we're gonna make all of them bad,

220
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,160
so if he has a good username and password,

221
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,910
we're going to scramble it,
send it back to the origin

222
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,480
and it'll say, you know,
that's bad, it's a...

223
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,180
Wrong username and password you'll see.

224
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,180
So, everyone will start seeing like that

225
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,570
and he won't get any feedback
on why, what's wrong?

226
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,467
See, if we just blocked it,

227
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:51,810
"Ah, he blocked me.

228
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,910
Maybe he rate limited me.

229
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,430
Okay, I logged in more
than 10 times a minute."

230
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,697
And they'll go down to nine.

231
00:10:57,697 --> 00:11:00,420
"Oh, I tried this path,
maybe I'll try another path."

232
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,650
Something like that.

233
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,850
In this case, he doesn't
know what's going on,

234
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,963
so we're effectively blocking
him and frustrating him.

235
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,180
So, what makes this more important is,

236
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,020
as I just mentioned,
when he's under attack

237
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,720
and he gets the signal, he can retool.

238
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,990
He sees, "Okay, that's the offense

239
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,790
or that's the defense you have in place.

240
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,810
I know how to get around that.

241
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,370
I could go this way or that way."

242
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,200
But here, he doesn't know.

243
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,030
He thinks he has a bad list.

244
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,860
He doesn't know what they're doing.

245
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,740
Now, again, as Memo mentioned,

246
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,570
honeypots have been around for a while.

247
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,920
The problem is they're typically
a separate infrastructure.

248
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,580
So, you have your production,
then you have your honeypot,

249
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,460
you gotta keep 'em in sync,
you gotta keep 'em exact,

250
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,230
you gotta run two instances.

251
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,640
You know, it'd be costly.

252
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,800
A lot of engineering work.

253
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,970
You know, it could be worth
it, but it's a lot of effort.

254
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,063
In this case, the genius here
is we put it right in line.

255
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,290
It's right in line with
your normal WAF workflow.

256
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,600
And we could take those triggers,

257
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,400
and again, instead of blocking,

258
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,920
we're just scrambling
the password and username

259
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,290
and sending back, "Hey,
that was a bad one."

260
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,490
But we're not blocking them.

261
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,880
So, it's easy to put it
in and out and tune it

262
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,060
without having to create all
this other infrastructure,

263
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,160
which is costly and difficult to maintain.

264
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,590
So, to mention, this is a start.

265
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,360
We're doing it with account takeover

266
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,783
and we plan on expanding it,
putting it into other areas,

267
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,000
API and other types of attack vectors that

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,530
we're going to make it look
deceptive in different ways.

269
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,830
And the beauty here is
it allows security people

270
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,110
to easily use this

271
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,470
without having to go deep into the code

272
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,060
and build things that might be

273
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,100
more difficult and costly to maintain,

274
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,680
'cause it's a GUI-driven interface,

275
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,050
very easy to enable it and log it,

276
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,410
or even try it and see
what it would've deceived

277
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,023
before you're ready to
really put it in production.

278
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,850
And this is all part
of a defense in depth.

279
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,170
So, we see there's a whole myriad of tools

280
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:24,147
that you need to have in place
to protect those attackers.

281
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,260
And this is something that
Fastly provides as well.

282
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,750
The deception's just one part of our WAF.

283
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,670
We can also do rate limiting.

284
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,710
We have DDoS on the front end,

285
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:39,710
which can detect DDoS
attacks and block them.

286
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,930
And then we're secured down by design.

287
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,510
Deep inside our CDN and our WAF,

288
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,950
we make sure all the code,
everything there is secure.

289
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,830
And you have this whole defensive depth,

290
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,530
it's all logged, it's all API-driven,

291
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,900
it all is driven by Terraform.

292
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,540
It's very easy to roll
it forward, roll it back,

293
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,403
and manage it and iterate on it.

294
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,150
So, again, we want to

295
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,470
even the playing field,

296
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,440
like I mentioned with
Charley and the golf,

297
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,710
and try and

298
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,413
fool those attackers before
they can do their damage.

299
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,533
Thank you.
