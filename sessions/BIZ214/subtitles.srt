1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
- Just quick introductions.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,480
I'm Kevin Mah, director for Amazon Connect.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,910
I've been on the team
largely since the beginning,

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,650
since we first launched Amazon Connect

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,420
a little over eight and a half years ago.

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,700
And it's certainly been the best job

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,990
and best experience of my life

8
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,210
to get to take this business from nothing

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,080
to being one of the fastest
growing services in AWS history.

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,470
And I saw recently in the Amazon earnings,

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,300
we announced that we had achieved

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,890
a billion run rate as a business,

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,380
which is a massive
personal milestone for me

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,270
to be a part of that journey.

15
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,030
I'm joined today by Corey and Matt

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,530
who are gonna come up and talk

17
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,230
and have way more interesting
things to say to me

18
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,813
about Traeger grills
and customer experience.

19
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,230
But I wanted to set a quick baseline today

20
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,770
about what a great customer
experience looks like.

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,810
And I always struggle with this question,

22
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,280
which is a weird thing to say

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,250
considering the role that I'm in,

24
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,410
but it's both a really hard question

25
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,610
and a really easy question.

26
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,520
If I polled the room,
I'd get a bunch of stuff

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,180
about personalization, efficiency,

28
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,090
some intuitiveness and
kind of understanding

29
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,380
and all this stuff around, like,

30
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,023
getting to know me and adding value.

31
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,450
But what I find, like,
it's also really easy

32
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,250
because when you see it, you know it.

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,900
And I'll give you an example.

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,740
I booked a trip for my
family to go to Asia

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,850
probably about six months ago.

36
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,040
I've been looking
forward to this all year.

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,440
I want my kids to see their grandparents.

38
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,910
And I booked this trip

39
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,780
and it's seared into my
brain for December 19th.

40
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,510
And I was thinking, it's
the Friday before Christmas,

41
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,640
the kids probably won't
have much to school,

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,530
work will be chill.

43
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,910
So I booked it, locked it in,

44
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,100
flights, hotels,
excursions, train tickets,

45
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,900
the whole deal, had it loaded,

46
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,600
and that was the key date, December 19th.

47
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,900
Then I find out, this
is five-ish weeks ago,

48
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,710
that my son was singing in his
school's Christmas concert.

49
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,773
And guess what date it
landed on, December 19th.

50
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,560
That wasn't something
I was willing to miss

51
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,950
and so suddenly I had
to change everything.

52
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,650
And first step, call the airline, is like,

53
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,730
okay, I need a different flight.

54
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,230
Can I move it, like, 12 hours?

55
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,280
Can I move it the next day?

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,750
What does that look like?

57
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,220
And then I had to call the hotel,

58
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,600
I had to change the train reservations,

59
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,220
I had to change excursions.

60
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,230
This was a pretty
frustrating experience, like,

61
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,810
and all of these things
were awkward and difficult.

62
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,760
Did I have to navigate cancellation fees?

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,980
Did I have move from
some transferring agent

64
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,420
who could do the cancellation

65
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,950
and then someone else who
could do the rebooking?

66
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,710
And I had some stuff
booked with the points.

67
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,640
It was pretty awful,

68
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,760
and I think any of us
who are in technology

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,200
can kind of understand, like,

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,880
it doesn't have to be that hard.

71
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,220
Like, I wasn't doing
anything super complicated.

72
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,890
These systems should be able
to understand each other.

73
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,750
We could all look and see,

74
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,460
a great customer experience would be like,

75
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,720
I just need to move it a day.

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,733
Could you just figure this out for me?

77
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,720
But I also think the realists in this room

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,580
understand why it's not that easy.

79
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,580
And so what happens is...

80
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,480
oh, I pressed the wrong button, sorry.

81
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:03,600
There's a gap.

82
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,690
There's a gap between
the customer experience

83
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,680
that we all kind of understand
and should be able to deliver

84
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,350
and the thing that we
can practically deliver.

85
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,410
And so you look across this complexity,

86
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,360
you've got internal systems,

87
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,220
you've got siloed data architectures.

88
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,650
I've got this private backend database

89
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,420
that doesn't have an API next to it.

90
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,100
I've got legacy tech debt

91
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,980
and suddenly mountains upon mountains of,

92
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,040
you know, issues come in that prevent us

93
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,260
from providing the amazing
customer experience

94
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,573
that I think we all
intuitively understand.

95
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,560
And as I kind of tackle this problem,

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,480
this is probably the number one question

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,110
I get from executives and
when I go visit customers.

98
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,550
It's like, okay, I understand,

99
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,680
I want to transform
customer experience with AI,

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,050
sprinkle some magic AI pixie dust on here

101
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,170
and make it agentic and
it's gonna be awesome.

102
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,670
Doesn't really work that way,
and the question is, like,

103
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,630
how do we get started?

104
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,570
Like, what am I actually
gonna do to pull this off?

105
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,100
And I typically have
three pieces of advice.

106
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,360
The first is something that
we do a lot of at Amazon

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,460
and what we do is we start from the end.

108
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,400
We call this process working backwards.

109
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,350
And at Amazon, this process means

110
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,110
we write a press release
with a bunch of FAQs

111
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,150
and we date it multiple
years down the line

112
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,130
and I say, "This is
what I'm gonna launch."

113
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,040
And I keep that crystal
clear locked in my mind.

114
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,930
And what that does is,

115
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,330
as I'm developing and as
I'm adding new features,

116
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,430
I never compromise because I always know

117
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,470
what that crystal clear
experience would be.

118
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,700
And I always encourage customers

119
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,870
to do that for themselves too.

120
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,750
Like, think about what is this
amazing customer experience

121
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,890
you want to provide?

122
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,860
Write it down, lock it
in, do not compromise.

123
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,260
And that will allow you
to kind of build your way

124
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,540
to the end state there.

125
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,040
And then my second piece of advice is,

126
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,710
if you can kind of put
this down, articulate it,

127
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,290
get it to a place where you like it,

128
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,730
the next thing that you want to do

129
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,790
is start to find ways to
deliver incremental value.

130
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,590
And you start looking, it's like, okay,

131
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,120
I can't tackle the giant
ocean of going from A to Z,

132
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,310
but what are the ways that
I can meaningfully change

133
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,143
from A to B?

134
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,590
And what are some incremental ways

135
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,090
that I can add value,

136
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,580
and certainly, like,
demonstrate business value.

137
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,380
It'll be kind of one of those CFO things.

138
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,570
Like, okay, why are you guys
migrating to Amazon Connect?

139
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,830
What's my payback gonna be?

140
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,740
How am I gonna shift from a
cost center to a profit center?

141
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,020
It's kind of these common
things that you get

142
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,030
to make a migration or, you know,

143
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,250
change in your technology
stack makes sense.

144
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,920
And I think if you have the
vision, you can start saying,

145
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,510
these are the pieces, these are the steps

146
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,920
that I'm gonna take to get there.

147
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,250
So not only can I make
meaningful incremental steps,

148
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,110
I can articulate why they're accretive

149
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,970
to a longer term vision.

150
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,190
And then the third piece of advice,

151
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,810
which is a really tough one,

152
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,740
and I've only seen, like,

153
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,410
the most forward thinking
CTOs kind of pull this off,

154
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,690
is to get your data right.

155
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,690
I think we all live and work in companies

156
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,470
where the data is not in a
place where we need to be.

157
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,447
We don't have the full
context of our customers

158
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,670
and their experiences
and their interactions

159
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,940
and the things they do on
different parts of the website.

160
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,760
And if you're looking ahead to the future

161
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,120
where we have AI coming
in and personalize things

162
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,580
and helping you drive business outcomes,

163
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,310
I think the way you're
gonna do this effectively

164
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,243
is with data.

165
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,810
And if you kind of want

166
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,330
to have this immense personalization,

167
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,700
getting the underlying
data infrastructure correct

168
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,610
is one of those no-brainer investments.

169
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,720
You know in the future

170
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,190
the data's gonna need to be structured

171
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,023
and organized in a way

172
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:35,460
if you're gonna realize
any of this AI value

173
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,470
that you kind of need to get up front

174
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,690
and say, "Okay, I'm gonna
set up my underlying data,

175
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,700
I'm gonna set up the subsystems,
I'm gonna set up in a way

176
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,410
that they can all interact to each other."

177
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,150
And I think if you can do those things,

178
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,120
you set this foundation
to preparing yourselves

179
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,590
for what is probably gonna be

180
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,720
one of the most
fundamental transformations

181
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,013
in our lifetimes.

182
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,790
Jumping ahead to Amazon Connect,

183
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,550
this is something where I feel

184
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,030
this was just kind of the
perfect timing and opportunity

185
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,430
and the reason Amazon
Connect came into existence.

186
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,740
Like, this was the mindset that we had

187
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,750
when we first started this business,

188
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,430
knowing that we were gonna need to power

189
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,100
these kind of cross business interactions

190
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,500
and being able to have AI integrated.

191
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,160
And honestly, like, AI has been
pretty good for a long time.

192
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,350
It just hasn't been as adopted

193
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,550
till we've had this kind of boom

194
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,780
over the past few years

195
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,000
where the LLMs and generative AI

196
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,190
has really inspired people

197
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,450
and lowered the barrier to entry

198
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,400
to what they can do with AI.

199
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,500
And Amazon Connect came in

200
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,110
with this mindset from the beginning.

201
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,900
One way that I like to
think about Amazon Connect,

202
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,690
for some more tech forward people,

203
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,700
is that at the end of the day,

204
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,320
like, we're an AWS service

205
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,375
that's powered by a whole
bunch of public APIs.

206
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,240
And if I think of the
Amazon Connect product,

207
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,660
it's almost just an
abstraction of a bunch of APIs.

208
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,820
You could kind of rebuild Amazon Connect

209
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,653
if you wanted to

210
00:07:57,653 --> 00:08:00,870
on top of the underlying
APIs that we provide.

211
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,730
And the reason that's
important and empowering

212
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,490
as part of this kind of agentic future

213
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,370
is all of these APIs can
now have MCP servers.

214
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,410
All of them can be
understood and talked to

215
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,990
across a series of different AI agents.

216
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,420
And it gives you this kind of foundation

217
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,010
that lets you be ready

218
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,220
for whatever AI is gonna throw
at you in the coming years

219
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,313
and it almost future proofs
your contact center today.

220
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,980
And so I'll skip through the
fun stuff, lots of logos.

221
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,180
We are growing like crazy.

222
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,730
It's been an incredible
and rewarding thing

223
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,060
for me to get to be a
part of this business.

224
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,340
12 billions of customer interactions

225
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,680
analyzed with AI over the past year

226
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,930
has just been an
incredible amount of scale.

227
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,480
We started as an internal contact center

228
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,150
for Amazon over 15 years ago

229
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,120
and we've grown it to be
something incredible today

230
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,490
that I think has fundamentally disrupted

231
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,263
what was almost a legacy, kind
of, incumbent stodgy space.

232
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,370
This other slide, to kind
of emphasize that point,

233
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,470
just shows how much we've grown.

234
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,470
When I started this business,

235
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,237
the number one customer
question I would get is like,

236
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:14,370
"How serious is Amazon really
about the contact center?"

237
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,630
This is not your bread and butter.

238
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,950
Like, this is not something

239
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,740
that we would've ever
expected Amazon to get into.

240
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,350
And that was something I
had to prove constantly

241
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,730
in the first three years of the business.

242
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,610
Like, I promise we're really
in this, it's gonna be awesome.

243
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,870
We might be feature light now,

244
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,910
but we are investing and it is growing

245
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,680
and it's the thing that we know is great

246
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,603
because it powers amazon.com.

247
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,870
I don't have to really
defend that anymore,

248
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,640
as you can kind of see by our growth,

249
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,750
the amount of features we launched,

250
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,830
how far we've come,

251
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,860
we are very, very serious
about this business.

252
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,950
Not only from a higher up the
stack application standpoint,

253
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,920
but it has just become
this foundational way

254
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,340
that people think about
applying AI to their business.

255
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,050
We are one of the most, kind of,

256
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,570
proven battle tested applications of AI

257
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,030
that is driving real results.

258
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,950
And so as we get to Amazon Connect

259
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,180
and its approach to AI,

260
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,380
I like to think a little bit about

261
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,560
this kind of spectrum between, you know,

262
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,900
this self-service where
there's less humans involved

263
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,450
and on this side there's
more humans involved.

264
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,257
The other question you
get all the time is like,

265
00:10:14,257 --> 00:10:16,590
"Is AI gonna come and replace jobs

266
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,320
and am I gonna need less agents

267
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,210
and less humans and interactions?"

268
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,800
And we've been at this for a while now

269
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,560
and I'm not really
seeing that be the case.

270
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,790
What we're seeing instead

271
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,860
is humans are becoming way more capable

272
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,150
than they have been before

273
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,670
and the value that the
contact center provides

274
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,340
is becoming much more
than it ever has been.

275
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,890
And one of these catchphrases
that we're seeing a lot

276
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,980
is the contact center
shifting from the cost center

277
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,970
to the profit center.

278
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,040
Instead of being this awful bill

279
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,200
that your COO has to pay each year,

280
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,020
now they see it as an
opportunity to drive revenue,

281
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,730
to drive a better customer experience

282
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,450
and to drive the things in
your brand that you want.

283
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,980
And the great part is, like,

284
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,320
we engage at all levels of this spectrum,

285
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,190
and I think AI is going to
supercharge these humans

286
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,660
that these agents that you already have

287
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,140
that are, like, embraced and
well-versed in your business

288
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,780
and can now do, you know, 10 x the things

289
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,180
that they ever could before.

290
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,640
And the only other thing I
wanted to talk about with AI

291
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,710
and the way we've kind of approached it,

292
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,440
we are seeing a bit of a
sea change in our business

293
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,610
where rather than kind
of AI for AI's sake,

294
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,890
what we're seeing is people are using AI

295
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,050
to drive business outcomes.

296
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,660
And some of the legacy
contact center metrics

297
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,540
that you might've thought of before,

298
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,490
average handle time and, you know,

299
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,500
longest contact in
queue, things like that,

300
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,510
still good, still
meaningful, still valuable,

301
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,827
but I see more and more
companies now shifting to,

302
00:11:44,827 --> 00:11:48,420
you know, what is the
revenue conversion rate?

303
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,920
How am I actually driving,

304
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,570
kind of, top line or bottom line

305
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,970
fundamental changes to my business?

306
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,890
And what happens is, it forces you

307
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,110
to think of your contact center

308
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,060
as more than just the contact center.

309
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,760
It's this piece that
kind of is the lifeblood

310
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,170
and the heart of your business

311
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,670
and allows you to extend

312
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,370
what your contact center
agents had been doing

313
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,930
into other parts of your business

314
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,660
and finding other ways to add value.

315
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,850
And the other part of this

316
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,790
kind of pipeline for AI that we're seeing

317
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,520
is that what's happening is,

318
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,040
Amazon Connect is
treating your human agents

319
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,830
the same way that we treat the AI agents.

320
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,400
It's the same set of tooling,
it's the same set of software.

321
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,220
And when you can kind of do it that way,

322
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,047
I have this performance
evaluation product that says,

323
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,380
"Hey, let me see, was
this agent empathetic?

324
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,640
Did they solve the problem?

325
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,920
Are they, you know, selling
the right conversion rate

326
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,390
and things like that."

327
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,930
I can apply that exact same
evaluation to an AI agent.

328
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,750
And you start to get this pipeline

329
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,870
where what you're learning
from your human agents

330
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,080
gets to be something that you
can teach to your AI agents

331
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,970
and you start to build things

332
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,940
that were more human involved
into less human involved.

333
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,080
And you're learning and building

334
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,810
this flywheel for your data

335
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,700
and that data is eventually the thing

336
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,650
that is driving the business outcomes.

337
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,700
And at Amazon, you know,

338
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,250
we were founded on the idea of flywheels

339
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,350
and I think every contact center,

340
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,183
every business here

341
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:16,530
has the opportunity to use their data,

342
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,280
use their customer experience
to drive their own flywheels.

343
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,860
And so enough about me kind
of just talking the talk,

344
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,170
I want to introduce an incredible customer

345
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,550
who actually walks the walks

346
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,610
and delivers an amazing
customer experience.

347
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,110
Welcome, Corey.

348
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,943
- Yeah.

349
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,240
Good afternoon, everyone.

350
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,010
My name is Corey Savory

351
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,860
and I am the Senior Vice
President of Customer Experience

352
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,270
for Traeger grills.

353
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,653
Anyone hear of Traeger?

354
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,560
All right, great.

355
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,630
It was a busy week for me last week,

356
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,250
I'm sure you can imagine.

357
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,060
Thanksgiving is the number
one cooking day of the year

358
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,330
and it was exceptionally busy this year

359
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,230
with everyone cooking on their grills.

360
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,853
I joined Traeger going,
oh, over six years ago.

361
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,590
At the time I was living, when
I got the call from Traeger,

362
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,860
in the Boston area, which is
where I'm originally from.

363
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,000
I had moved back there

364
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,790
after considerable time on the west coast

365
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,460
working for companies like DirecTV

366
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,900
and moving out to the east coast

367
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,220
to take leadership of CX

368
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,720
for a company called iRobot

369
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,240
that makes cute, adorable little vacuums,

370
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,920
little robot vacuums.

371
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,410
And I was really happy,
I was finally home.

372
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,170
I was around people whose
accent sounded like mine

373
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,690
and I felt really, really good.

374
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,650
And then I got this call from
a company called Traeger.

375
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,060
And what I loved about it,

376
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,030
is I had been a customer
of Traeger for years.

377
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,500
I bought my first Traeger grill

378
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,720
when I was living in the Denver area.

379
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,580
I assembled it myself.

380
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,370
I reloaded that grill around the country

381
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,100
from one state to another

382
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,960
all the way to Massachusetts.

383
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,780
And I'd been in Tokyo on business.

384
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,230
I was out visiting my
team in the Tokyo area,

385
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,960
came home, and on my back
deck, for Mother's Day,

386
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,460
was a brand new Ironwood 885,
a connected Traeger grill.

387
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,740
I'm gonna say it's the best grill.

388
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,150
It's my absolute favorite.

389
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,000
Trust the person that
runs customer service,

390
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,410
it's an amazing grill.

391
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,493
And a week later,

392
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,920
coincidence,

393
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,450
I get a call from a recruiter

394
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,180
asking me if I've ever heard
of a company called Traeger

395
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,380
and they were looking for someone

396
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,260
to come lead CX for Traeger,

397
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,430
where it was pretty easy to convince me

398
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,530
to move back to the west

399
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,387
to go work for such an amazing company.

400
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:42,390
And the thing that really lured me in

401
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,470
about working for Traeger

402
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,170
wasn't just that I was
familiar with the product

403
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,710
and I had been using it for
over 10 years at the time,

404
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,800
but because of the way that they described

405
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,450
the state of customer service

406
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,910
and customer experience at Traeger.

407
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,550
There was no CX process.

408
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,950
Customer experience as
a concept didn't exist.

409
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,990
They were strictly talking call center.

410
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,160
They were strictly talking,

411
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,530
we need to stand up customer service.

412
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,020
The state of customer service was abysmal.

413
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,880
And I thought that that sounded
like the absolute best thing

414
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,230
that I could have the
opportunity to go tackle.

415
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:23,070
So when I came to Traeger
in September of 2019

416
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,000
with the global pandemic on the horizon

417
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,383
that I had no idea about,

418
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,590
what I walked into was a state

419
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,310
where we had zero control
over our technology.

420
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,250
The only technology that
Traeger had at the time

421
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,670
was a CRM designed by a team of people

422
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,100
who I don't think ever
once sat next to an agent

423
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,953
or ever once walked into a contact center.

424
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,120
Everything else we relied
on our BPO partners,

425
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,260
their IVR, their data, their reporting.

426
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,080
They would report to us
how they were performing.

427
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,140
Sounds like a great situation.

428
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,790
They actually told me
that they had 85% CSAT

429
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,720
and 80% first contact resolution.

430
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,670
I knew that wasn't the case.

431
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,700
And when I was able to
stand up Amazon Connect

432
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,173
in over a weekend,

433
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,440
immediately having access to our own data

434
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,870
and was able to baseline
for the first time,

435
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,031
what the reality was,
was we were at a 35% CSAT

436
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:28,623
and a 30% first contact resolution.

437
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,450
But Amazon Connect, we
were an early adopter.

438
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,930
We got in super early
and had been partnering

439
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,630
with the Amazon Connect
team from the beginning

440
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,510
to help us design our customer experience

441
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,120
infrastructure and technology

442
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,650
and leverage it as a
really robust ecosystem.

443
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,680
So working with the Amazon Connect team

444
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,800
over the last six years,
we started small, right.

445
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,420
We took on telephony,

446
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,110
we were able to start
taking calls, routing calls.

447
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,050
We also stood up QuickSight.

448
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,430
I love QuickSight.

449
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,070
I tell everybody that is in the business

450
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,070
how much QuickSight has
really allowed me and my team

451
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,940
to hone in on areas of opportunity
and data visualization.

452
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,940
And now with a lot of new
features built in with AI

453
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,600
where you're able to have a conversation

454
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,790
with your data, it's just great.

455
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,380
We then adopted sentiment
analysis transcriptions,

456
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,060
allowing us to start standing up

457
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,970
a true customer experience ecosystem

458
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,620
where now we can analyze our data

459
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,150
and not just take calls,

460
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,820
understand why people are calling us,

461
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,840
understand why, when we send
a part on a particular grill

462
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,690
for a particular reason,
it isn't fixing the issue,

463
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,510
allowing us to start elevating issues

464
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,470
coming through the call center

465
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,603
to our product and engineering teams.

466
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,353
That was very exciting at Traeger.

467
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,310
Previous to that, customer
service was seen as,

468
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,080
as I said, the call center.

469
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,480
And then this is really what enabled us

470
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,770
to have a seat at the table

471
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,690
and truly help the business understand

472
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,820
what customer experience is

473
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,580
and how the data that we have

474
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,470
should feed into product development

475
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,480
and should feed into product roadmap

476
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,380
and understanding customer experience.

477
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,400
We've also launched chat.

478
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,170
We've built video streaming.

479
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,540
For anyone who does
technical troubleshooting

480
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,710
in a call center,

481
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,820
I will tell you video
streaming is a game changer.

482
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,480
We're able to, through our
Amazon Connect instance,

483
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,710
send our customers a text
message that you can click on.

484
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,380
The customer then, it activates the camera

485
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,180
on the back of your smartphone

486
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,340
and streaming live to
our agent's desktops,

487
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,860
we can see exactly what
the customer's seeing,

488
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,740
not spend time asking 20 questions

489
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,320
and trying to get the customer
to explain in their words

490
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,480
what they think is going on.

491
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,910
Our agents can now see with their own eyes

492
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,580
exactly what our customers are seeing.

493
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,230
And that really helped us improve

494
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,703
our first contact resolution.

495
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,770
We've launched screen
recording with Amazon Connect,

496
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,230
also been a game changer
in helping us understand

497
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,300
process improvement opportunities.

498
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,990
And then the end phase six and
seven and whatever is beyond,

499
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,050
I'm gonna be talking to you today more

500
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,220
later in my presentation

501
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,960
about two things that
we've been working on.

502
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,740
One that I've coined as
self-healing contact center

503
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,160
and the other is our single
pane of glass instance

504
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,113
where we're using generative AI.

505
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,290
- Hi, hey everybody, I'm Matt Richards.

506
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,510
I'm a senior solutions architect at AWS

507
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,010
and I have the distinct pleasure

508
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,257
of working with Corey
and the team at Traeger.

509
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:49,080
And I'm just here to hype Corey up

510
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,590
and talk a little bit more
about their evolving story here.

511
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,410
So, let's talk about what comes next

512
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,110
after Corey spent this
time building up a mature

513
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,290
modern customer experience organization,

514
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,230
they recognized that there
were still limitations in place

515
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,610
and most of these limitations

516
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,090
were around the experience of the agents.

517
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,920
As we have a lot of these conversations

518
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,150
about a modern call center,

519
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,340
a lot of the conversations center around

520
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,440
how to make the agents more effective,

521
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,348
how to let them have more efficient access

522
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:21,390
to data, to resources,

523
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,780
help them help the
customer more efficiently.

524
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,613
And what they recognized

525
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:27,930
is that evolving their agent experience

526
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,790
beyond what was in place

527
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,920
was getting increasingly difficult.

528
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,080
And that was mostly because of a lot

529
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,760
of disparate user experiences

530
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,860
for the various parts of their ecosystem.

531
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,470
For instance, a lot of
the customizations came in

532
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,020
through customizing their CRM

533
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,550
for doing things like case management

534
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,680
and basic customer management.

535
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,270
And the agent would have
to go back and forth

536
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,340
between their Amazon Connect experience

537
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,270
for the live calls and the chats

538
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,940
with their CRM to handle the casework.

539
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,270
And because of these
disparate experiences,

540
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,740
the agent would constantly have to hop

541
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,840
between many different screens.

542
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,790
There was a lot of cognitive overload,

543
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,370
it caused a lot of
additional training time

544
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,450
and then adding on any additional
customizations after that

545
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,600
really took a lot of
work and a lot of time.

546
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,460
So these are the challenges
that they were up against.

547
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,170
They wanted to find the next step

548
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,393
to make the agents more effective.

549
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,250
And so this is where we get
into Amazon Connect Cases.

550
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,210
Connect Cases is an integrated
feature of Amazon Connect

551
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,180
that allows for agents
to do customer issue work

552
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,390
that may require more than one interaction

553
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,800
with that customer.

554
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,140
And the thing that this could really give

555
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,720
was an integrated user
experience for that agent

556
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,060
where they could be in the
Amazon Connect experience

557
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,250
and handle every part of the lifecycle

558
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,400
of that customer interaction,
that customer touch,

559
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,440
without any additional screens to go to,

560
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,730
without looking through manuals

561
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,040
of what's the tool I need to go into

562
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,750
to get this thing done.

563
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,381
Makes the agents more effective,

564
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:03,270
it gets the new agents
onboarded much, much quicker.

565
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,950
And they didn't have to
spend a bunch of time

566
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,260
customizing a legacy CRM

567
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,690
and everything could be a one stop shop.

568
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,000
And this was really, really huge for them.

569
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,680
And it was also extremely important

570
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,370
because Traeger had another
big evolution in their company

571
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,050
in the form of Meater.

572
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,310
I'm gonna pass it back to Corey

573
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,830
to talk about this
specific set of challenges.

574
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,530
- Yeah, thanks.

575
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,023
Anyone hear of Meater, M-E-A-T-E-R?

576
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,703
All right, so in 2021, our world got,

577
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,350
welcomed a new friend
into the Traeger hood

578
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,840
with our acquisition of
a company called Meater,

579
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,950
a wireless meat thermometer,
intelligent meat thermometer.

580
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,680
And we let them stand alone for years.

581
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,440
They operated out of Leicester, England.

582
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,680
They were very much keep at arms length,

583
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,810
let them operate on their own.

584
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,050
And we let it go that
way for years on end.

585
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,430
Until last year,

586
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:03,390
the beginning of last
year, January of 2024,

587
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,930
I was asked to take on
customer service leadership

588
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,460
for the Meater brand as well

589
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,370
and integrate Meater customer support

590
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:15,060
into Traeger customer support,
into our contact centers.

591
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,060
Well, we'd spent years
building our tools and systems

592
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,550
to work for Traeger,

593
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,640
for how Traeger tools and systems work,

594
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,060
how we do warranty claims on Traeger.

595
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:31,590
And then within a matter of four months,

596
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,550
we had to stand up a complete
customer service organization

597
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,730
to bring Meater into the contact centers.

598
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,440
Of course that includes writing training,

599
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,900
writing a knowledge base that didn't exist

600
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,510
and doing all of the additional prep work.

601
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,490
But from a systems perspective,

602
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,920
we were shoehorning Meater

603
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,310
into a system that was built for Traeger.

604
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,040
And it was enough for us to limp along,

605
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,100
but it was a very awkward agent experience

606
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,530
when they take a call.

607
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,050
And if it is a Traeger call,

608
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,370
I have to handle it this way.

609
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,890
If it's the same type
of call but it's Meater,

610
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,870
I now have a whole
different set of screens

611
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:13,230
and a different way that
they had to process support

612
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,250
on the Meater side

613
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,590
because we had to run
really, really, really fast.

614
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,430
We had a deadline

615
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,320
for when the phone calls
were gonna start coming in

616
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,540
and we had to start
taking on Meater support.

617
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,140
So now I have this system
that wasn't too bad,

618
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,950
that now isn't working
exceptionally well at all

619
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,790
for our agents

620
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,530
and adding additional cognitive load

621
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,780
and stress and pain on them

622
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,000
to have a second set of systems

623
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,610
and our main CRM that isn't designed

624
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,060
to be able to support Meater.

625
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,550
So that was another great
opportunity, just like I said,

626
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,290
when I was super excited
to come to Traeger,

627
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,930
when I heard just how bad things were

628
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,910
and what a great opportunity it is

629
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,620
to build from the ground up,

630
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,750
we had the choice to make, to say,

631
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,600
do we take the time and the investment

632
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,450
to go into our CRM and modify it

633
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,810
and rework everything
to do with making Meater

634
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,640
flow a lot better?

635
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,470
Or do we leapfrog in
technology to something modern

636
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,720
that we can build from the beginning,

637
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,970
that has the right process flows

638
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,510
and the right agent experience
for both of our brands

639
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,310
and do so simultaneously.

640
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,260
And that's what we opted to do.

641
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,590
We wanted to evolve our
experience in customer service.

642
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,360
We didn't wanna take a step back

643
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,520
in any of the great work
that we did with Traeger.

644
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,970
We didn't wanna lose a
whole year of our innovation

645
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,550
and the way that we move fast

646
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,550
to take the time to rebuild Meater.

647
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,700
We made the decision
to move to Amazon Cases

648
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,230
within Amazon Connect.

649
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,540
We refer to it as single pane of glass

650
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,010
because to our agents,

651
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,460
they have the experience
of a contact coming in.

652
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,260
Based on the phone number called

653
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,310
we know if it's a Traeger interaction

654
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,913
or a Meater interaction.

655
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,870
The account information pops,

656
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,780
the agent is then just
asked to pick a button.

657
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,680
Is this an about an order

658
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,290
or is this a technical
support interaction?

659
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,770
If it's about an order, up
pop the customer's orders.

660
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,600
Is it one of these?

661
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,540
If it's about a technical interaction,

662
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,710
up pop the devices that are
registered to the account.

663
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,980
Whether it's Traeger
grills or Meater probes,

664
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,800
the agent can select, it's about this one.

665
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,810
If they have to register it,

666
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,630
the agent can then enter the serial number

667
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,130
and register a new product.

668
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:39,030
We're also working with
some modern AI technology

669
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:44,030
and another partner on
IVR bots and chatbots

670
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,970
to assist us with handling
some of that registration work

671
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,680
offline from our agents.

672
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,550
But what we wanted to focus
on was not necessarily

673
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,700
about trying to get contacts
out of our call center.

674
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,700
It wasn't about how to remove
the customer from the agent.

675
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,040
It's what Kevin was talking about.

676
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,210
It's more about how do we
make the job of the agent

677
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,050
one that is easier, more streamlined,

678
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:17,280
something where our agents
are able to spend less time

679
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,610
thinking about what screen to navigate to

680
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,070
and what piece of information
that they're looking to find,

681
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,920
but that they can focus
on the interaction.

682
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,530
At Traeger, we talk
about the Traeger hood,

683
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,970
it's all over our advertising.

684
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,350
But if you ever come to our office,

685
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,020
you'll see that we live and breathe it.

686
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,180
We have lunch together.

687
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,450
Matt, I think comes a lot for lunch

688
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,730
to Salt Lake, to our office,

689
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,070
but we do have a full
culinary staff on site.

690
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,720
They do all of our recipe testing

691
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,400
and all of our recipe writing

692
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,280
and they cook delicious
food for us every day

693
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,300
where we sit around a table,

694
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,820
and we're really passionate
about the Traeger hood.

695
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,670
And the feeling that we wanna
give in customer service

696
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,230
when you're speaking to an agent

697
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,830
is as if you are talking to
someone on your back deck,

698
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:06,780
that feeling of a neighbor
next door that you are helping.

699
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,140
Grilling, cooking, cooking
with Meater probes,

700
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,550
cooking with our grills,

701
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,920
is really about the emotional connection

702
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,470
around food and around preparing food

703
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,100
and sharing a meal with
someone that you care about.

704
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,720
Hopefully you don't have
people at your table

705
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,553
that you don't,

706
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,650
but that's the feeling that we wanna give

707
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,230
when we talk to our customers
in the Traeger hood.

708
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,860
It isn't us trying to keep
you from contacting us

709
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,550
or having a organic
interaction with our agents.

710
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,160
We really wanna focus on
how do we make the job

711
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,560
of the agent easier, faster,

712
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,290
so that they really lean
in and spend that time

713
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,083
creating an amazing relationship
in the Traeger hood.

714
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,760
So we deployed Amazon Cases,

715
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,190
our single pane of glass solution,

716
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,930
where all of the process flows,

717
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:58,260
where agents would have
to use a knowledge base

718
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,080
that would tell them step 1, 2, 3, 4,

719
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,220
of how to process this
particular type of transaction.

720
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,080
Now we don't need that anymore

721
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,000
because the tool is so intuitive.

722
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,610
As I said, the agent clicks on the button,

723
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,200
this is what I want to do.

724
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,340
And we've built it in a way

725
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,710
that it is seamless to the agent

726
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,210
what's happening on the back end.

727
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,690
It doesn't matter which
order management system

728
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,470
is processing the order
for Traeger versus Meater.

729
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,770
The agent just needs to
tell single pane of glass

730
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,150
what it is that they want to do.

731
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,950
And we've built everything on the back end

732
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,960
to be completely seamless for them

733
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,400
to have to actually process
any of the transactions.

734
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,650
We built it in four to five months.

735
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:43,710
We had a goal that we wanted to deploy

736
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,210
in June of this year

737
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,180
and we started working
on it in about February,

738
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,340
I think, February.

739
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,610
We put requirements together.

740
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,530
We documented our requirements
in December, January.

741
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,510
We started working on it in February

742
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:00,600
and we were up in, in four to five months

743
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,640
with a complete build of this solution

744
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,430
on top of our Amazon Connect instance.

745
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,890
We deployed in June and July.

746
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,540
We rolled to our contact centers

747
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,930
and immediate removal of our old CRM,

748
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,815
which was a huge cost savings for us

749
00:31:14,815 --> 00:31:18,690
from moving from a licensing model to,

750
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,100
you know, the model with AWS

751
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,380
where you're paying for
data and not licensing.

752
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,480
And that was also part of our deadline,

753
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,920
was we were about to hit
renewal with our CRM in June

754
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,550
and had to get out, (chuckles),
before the renewal hit.

755
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,530
So a little bit of added pressure,

756
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:39,530
but it was a very, very
quick implementation timeline

757
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,060
for something that really is

758
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,030
a complete new CRM, essentially.

759
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,830
But for us, the benefit is our agents

760
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,590
had already been using
Amazon Connect for years

761
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,490
for interfacing with our
telephony and our chats

762
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,950
and sending those text messages,

763
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,810
and video streaming was all built

764
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,060
within our Amazon Connect instance.

765
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,200
So the tool itself was
familiar to our agents

766
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,783
where we just provided
them this new experience.

767
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,730
And what that led to

768
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,390
was a 40% reduction in
training for new hires.

769
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:20,390
Our path to proficiency
is light speed now.

770
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,370
When bringing somebody in off the street,

771
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,200
now we have to train them, of course,

772
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,660
on how our products
work, how a grill works,

773
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,970
how a Meater probe functions.

774
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:33,060
But we were able to carve
out over a week of training

775
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,380
that was based specifically

776
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,500
on how to navigate this CRM

777
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,210
and how to process transactions,

778
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,820
because the actual processing, as I said,

779
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,510
of the transactions is
removed from our agents.

780
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,310
And what we're finding is agents

781
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:50,070
who we brought in and trained

782
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,820
only knowing single pane
of glass as an experience

783
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,960
outperformed tenured agents

784
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,843
within hitting the
floor in nesting period.

785
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,570
And we also have seen a bump

786
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,910
in our agent satisfaction as well.

787
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:10,910
We operate in the 92 to 93% top box CSAT,

788
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,220
and this has allowed our agents

789
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,830
to improve our scores around connection

790
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,600
and relationship building

791
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,800
with our customers on the phone

792
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,480
because they don't have to spend the time

793
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,090
focused on what they're
doing in their tools

794
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,023
and how to do it.

795
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,220
Ah, there's our Traeger hood.

796
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,370
That looks really good.

797
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,357
All right, so what are
some of the other benefits

798
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:37,560
of our single pane of glass instance?

799
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,680
It's not just about the workflows
that have been built in,

800
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,040
it's also AI generated
case notes and emails.

801
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,410
So the time that it takes agents

802
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:49,320
to type what happened on an interaction,

803
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,490
what they did, to leave
notes for the next agent,

804
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,440
our agents don't do that anymore.

805
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,460
The AI that is present
within the interactions

806
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,860
is doing all of the case summaries

807
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,310
and leaving case notes

808
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,390
on single pane of glass
for the next agent.

809
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:10,140
So the time it takes to do
that, as well as emails.

810
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,660
If you're a Traeger customer,
anytime you contact us,

811
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,020
we will follow up that
interaction with an email to you

812
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,660
with important information
that you need to know.

813
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,810
It would take time for our
agents to generate those emails

814
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,850
and because we didn't use templates,

815
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:28,020
we wanted everything to feel
Traeger hood and very familiar.

816
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,480
I will tell you our agentic email bot

817
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,197
is a lot better at writing
emails than our agents ever were.

818
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:36,660
(Corey chuckles)

819
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,210
And I think that it's
also important to note

820
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,080
that due to budget constraints

821
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,510
that I think that we all
feel as a cost center

822
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:49,350
in being asked consistently
to optimize and reduce costs,

823
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,510
we've moved our contact centers,

824
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,690
not just offshore but really offshore.

825
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,570
We are in Cairo, Egypt now

826
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,310
and we are in Johannesburg.

827
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,470
Native English speakers in Johannesburg,

828
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,150
but certainly not in Cairo.

829
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,900
And we've been in Costa Rica
and Guatemala for a while.

830
00:35:07,961 --> 00:35:11,160
We found a lot of complexity
in moving to Egypt

831
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,610
with our agent base being
native Arabic speakers

832
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,220
and that it would take them a long time

833
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,830
to write notes to leave on the account,

834
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,220
to write those emails
follow ups to customers.

835
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,830
And I think regardless of the location

836
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,780
of where your contact centers are,

837
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,160
one agent to another,

838
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,160
the variability in how
one agent takes notes

839
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,080
versus another agent takes notes.

840
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,460
Some, you tell that agent,

841
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,040
you didn't need to spend a
half an hour writing this book.

842
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,660
Another agent, you might coach them

843
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,210
that they could have added more context

844
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,740
to the notes that they left.

845
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,430
And because now we've left that to,

846
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,790
up to single pane of
glass to our agentic bot

847
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,553
that is working with us in Amazon Cases,

848
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,790
our agents don't have to do that anymore

849
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,750
and the consistency and
variability is removed.

850
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,030
Easy for anyone to understand.

851
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,240
And as I said, I keep calling her a she

852
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,003
'cause we have a bot we call Traegy.

853
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,690
But anyhoo, whether it's Traegy

854
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,973
or our Amazon Connect instance,

855
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:17,880
the consistency, the tone,

856
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,330
and the way that we can
train how to write these

857
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,310
is really providing, in my opinion,

858
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,060
a really great customer experience.

859
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,940
Alright, a few other things.

860
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,060
I mentioned this thing called
self-healing contact center.

861
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,610
Who's ever had a catastrophic event

862
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,430
where maybe your website
went down or your app crashed

863
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,810
and all of a sudden, unplanned for volume

864
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,283
hits your contact center?

865
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,630
Right, you can staff as much as you can.

866
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,010
You do your intervals,

867
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,720
you know how many agents you need,

868
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,550
but when something unexpected happens,

869
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,740
it can topple a call center.

870
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,813
And this happened to us a few times.

871
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,720
I won't go into details,

872
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,360
but what happens is your call center

873
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,790
becomes flooded very, very quickly.

874
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,910
Right, and you scramble
to maybe put a message

875
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,297
at the top of your IVR saying,

876
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:12,480
"Hey, if you're calling
about the website being down,

877
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,160
we know. (chuckles)

878
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,750
Or if you're calling
about the app crashing,

879
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,583
we know."

880
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:20,520
But by the time that you
have identified the issue,

881
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,140
that you have taken the time

882
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,420
to put a message to your customers,

883
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,490
they've missed it, they're in queue,

884
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,530
and now you're buried.

885
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,140
So what we've worked with Amazon Connect,

886
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,170
the AWS team, on last year

887
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,910
was this concept of self-healing,

888
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,950
where the tool is smart enough to know

889
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,490
how many agents I have working,

890
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,780
what my handle time is,

891
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,720
what the volume is coming in

892
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,470
and at what rate that
I'm going to get buried.

893
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,840
And at the rate that it sees

894
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,610
that we're about to get to a point

895
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,190
where we are never gonna dig out

896
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,770
of the debt hole that we are in,

897
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,600
we turn off callbacks automatically.

898
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,713
We stop offering them.

899
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,450
We turn chat off

900
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,980
to stop ghost chats from coming in.

901
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,450
And we monitor it.

902
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:12,020
And by we, I mean the
tool, not me, (chuckles).

903
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,700
The tool monitors itself

904
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,490
to the point where it
knows I'm caught up again.

905
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:20,220
It's okay, turn back
on offering callbacks,

906
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,050
turn back on some of
these other functions.

907
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,060
What we want to do is be able to deliver

908
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,713
the best service that we can.

909
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,080
But if you've ever been in a position

910
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,790
where your customers have left the chat

911
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,530
and you're just answering
ghost chats all day

912
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,260
and trying to find a customer
at the other end of the line

913
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,203
and you've got hundreds
of customers in queue,

914
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:44,730
if your call center can note that itself

915
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:49,410
and start to look for
opportunities to reduce those,

916
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,023
you continuing to build upon the problem.

917
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,090
And then I also mentioned,

918
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:58,170
we are working with a
partner on AI technologies

919
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,360
in our chat and in our IVR.

920
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,760
As I mentioned, her name is Traegy.

921
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,850
We don't tell customers that
that's her name, internally,

922
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:08,940
and we love her and she
does a fantastic job.

923
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,370
So we are doing things
like where's my order

924
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,100
and, like, trying to actually
reduce those contacts

925
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,260
from ever getting to agents.

926
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,080
But what we found more successful

927
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,800
and better fit for our, ooh,

928
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,650
our philosophy on customer
service in the Traeger hood

929
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:30,180
is looking for non-value added
work that we can have her do.

930
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,490
Like, you contact in,

931
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,320
you're saying that you're
having a technical problem

932
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,550
with your device.

933
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,040
She can say, "I noticed you
don't have a registered product.

934
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,570
Before I pass you to an agent,

935
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,010
can I just take a moment

936
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,530
and have you text me a
picture of your serial number

937
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,660
and I'll get that product
registered for you?"

938
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,170
So trying to not be
invasive with the customer

939
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,810
but also trying to strip away work

940
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,550
that is non-value add for an agent

941
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,070
to take the time for you to say

942
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,720
an alpha numeric serial number

943
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,030
that's 17 characters long.

944
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,130
That takes time on a contact

945
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,260
where we want our agents
focused on other things.

946
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,240
And we're seeing great success there

947
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,813
and looking forward to
continuing to work and develop.

948
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,030
So as I wrap up what I
have to share for today,

949
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,310
the other thing that we absolutely love

950
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:20,460
about working with Amazon Connect

951
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,150
is that we can move fast.

952
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,340
As I mentioned, we
brought Amazon Connect up

953
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,933
over the course of a weekend.

954
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:32,070
The speed at which we can
develop where we're now,

955
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,660
especially in single pane of glass,

956
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,340
and we have no ties

957
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,430
to any further development
within our old CRM.

958
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,610
We can move as fast as we can code

959
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:44,973
as opposed to the situation
that we were in before.

960
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,780
And thank you.

961
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,680
Matt.

962
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,650
- Alright, well we're
going to get into the Q&A

963
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,670
in a minute here.

964
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,580
Before we do, wanna do a quick plug.

965
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,190
There's gonna be a lot of
really great conversation

966
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,540
about Amazon Connect

967
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,640
and other customer experience topics

968
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,890
happening through the
rest of the conference.

969
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,350
You can see here there's two per day

970
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,183
through the rest of the week.

971
00:41:08,183 --> 00:41:09,720
So if you wanna spend your entire time

972
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,520
immersing yourself in Amazon Connect

973
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,470
and all the Amazon Connect things,

974
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,310
plenty of opportunity.

975
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,810
Take a picture, go to those sessions,

976
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,373
they're all gonna be wonderful.

977
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,580
- Well, thank you for the opportunity

978
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,080
to talk with y'all today.

979
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,194
- Yeah, thanks everybody.
- Thank you.

980
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:26,027
(audience claps)
