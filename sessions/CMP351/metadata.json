  "title_cn": "AWS re:Invent 2025 - 通过AWS性能测试构建高效可靠的系统 (CMP351)",
  "abstract": "Learn how to run and leverage performance testing on AWS to drive cost optimization, validate system behavior, identify bottlenecks, and significantly improve reliability, while informing architectural decisions and optimal instance type selection for your workloads. You'll discover methods for pinpointing performance thresholds across different traffic patterns and understanding system reliability when stressed beyond normal parameters. Dive deep into techniques for measuring critical percentiles and determining breaking points as demand fluctuates, ultimately architecting for improved efficiency and building confidence in your system's resilience at scale.",
  "abstract_cn": "学习如何在AWS上运行和利用性能测试来推动成本优化、验证系统行为、识别瓶颈并显著提高可靠性，同时为架构决策和工作负载的最佳实例类型选择提供依据。您将发现在不同流量模式下精确定位性能阈值的方法，以及了解系统在超出正常参数压力下的可靠性。深入探讨测量关键百分位数和确定需求波动时临界点的技术，最终实现更高效的架构设计，并建立对系统大规模弹性的信心。",
