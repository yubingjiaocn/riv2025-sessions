1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,700
- I think we are finally
ready to get started.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,670
First off, thanks everyone for
joining this session today.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,070
I know you guys got a lot
of choices to pick from,

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,680
so we're really happy
for you to join us here

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,330
to talk about sustainability.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,940
So before we dive right
in, wanted to just get

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,500
a quick kind of poll

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,210
on the audience.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,640
Who here works in sustainability?

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,950
Does anyone work in sustainability?

11
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,360
Touch the sustainability data.

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,576
Okay, we got a few.

13
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:29,370
How about operations, operations?

14
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,240
We got some software
development engineers in here.

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,010
Okay, got a couple of those

16
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,093
How about FinOps?

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,120
Okay. Also this blinding light.

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,920
So I see about two hands out there.

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,220
Okay, all right, great, well,
hopefully this talk will kind

20
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,630
of touch on all of those dimensions

21
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,980
and have something a
little bit interesting

22
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,160
for our builders out there,
our FinOps, our operations,

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,280
and, of course, hopefully you
all walk away here wanting

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,720
to get more into sustainability

25
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,330
or at least thinking more about it.

26
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,640
Last question before we
kind of dive right in,

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,150
who knows what the customer
carbon footprint tool is?

28
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,870
Ooh, we got, all right, three, all right.

29
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,238
By the end of this talk, you will all know

30
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:10,590
what the customer carbon
footprint tool is,

31
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,620
and hopefully you will all
go there and check it out

32
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,540
and see what it is and what
information and can provide you.

33
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,250
All right, let's jump here.

34
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,648
All right, so just to recap,
you are in session 332.

35
00:01:24,648 --> 00:01:26,340
In this session,

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,830
I'm joined by some colleagues in Adobe

37
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,090
and Salesforce to talk about

38
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,940
how they're enabling their
sustainability initiatives

39
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,160
using the customer carbon footprint tool.

40
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,720
My name is Alexis Bateman.

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,103
I am at AWS and I lead our
sustainability tech team.

42
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:42,240
We are en we enable all

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,880
of our sustainability objectives at AWS,

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,160
whether that be on our net
zero carbon objectives,

45
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,691
our water positive, our
renewable energy goals.

46
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:51,619
We are sort of the backbone

47
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:54,750
of those products and initiatives.

48
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,420
And then today I am joined
by Eric from Salesforce

49
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,750
who's a director of
technology sustainability

50
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,686
and Rao from Adobe,

51
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:06,291
who's in senior program
manager for Cloud FinOps.

52
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,367
Thanks both for joining
me today to talk about

53
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:12,690
how you've leveraged CCFT
to meet some of your goals.

54
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,570
So we're gonna get right in.

55
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,490
Our agenda is pretty streamlined.

56
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,680
First, we're gonna talk
about AWS sustainability,

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,810
what are some of the goals that we have,

58
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,870
and then, of course, how you
actually can get insights

59
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,820
and visibility into some of those goals

60
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,470
through the customer
carbon footprint tool,

61
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,310
which is available in in
the AWS billing console.

62
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,189
Then I'll turn it over to Eric

63
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:35,995
to talk about Salesforce
sustainability goals,

64
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:38,190
what they're doing, and then, of course,

65
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,050
how we've partnered on some

66
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,970
of those sustainability objectives
and some of the reporting

67
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,460
and insights that we
provide to enable them.

68
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,419
And then we will then pass it off to Rao

69
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:52,080
to talk about a similar set
of in initiatives in Adobe

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,010
and how they're driving these
initiatives together with us.

71
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,370
And then what we have a few targeted Q&A.

72
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,980
I've had some, some conversations
while I've been here

73
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,450
in the short time in re:Invent.

74
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,340
And we kind of curated a few questions

75
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,810
that we're gonna talk about, which are,

76
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,770
you know, some topic
areas around generative AI

77
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,603
and sustainability

78
00:03:11,603 --> 00:03:12,955
and so we'll end with that.

79
00:03:12,955 --> 00:03:15,090
And so that's our session for today,

80
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,740
so we're gonna dive right in.

81
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,010
So AWS has sustainability
at the core of a lot

82
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,329
of our operations and
how we provide services

83
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:26,200
to you and to our builders and partners.

84
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,370
We are a Climate Pledge signatory,

85
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,090
which is Amazon's Pan
Amazon Climate Pledge.

86
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,330
This is to be net zero carbon by 2040.

87
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,194
So Amazon co-founded this
together with Global Optimism

88
00:03:40,194 --> 00:03:44,970
and we are one of the
signatories to the climate pledge

89
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,853
and, of course, abide by
that same set of objectives.

90
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,410
But how do we actually
operationalize that at AWS?

91
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,100
We have a few different
pillars that we work towards.

92
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,170
Some of them are carbon free energy,

93
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,530
so how we actually supply
our data centers with power,

94
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,720
what sources of energy we use

95
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,265
to actually power those
across solar, wind, nuclear

96
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:09,660
achieving, striving to achieve renewable

97
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,818
and carbon free energy goals.

98
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,390
Also operating the most
efficient as we can

99
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,910
in our operations of our data centers.

100
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,085
We also have circularity
at the heart of a lot

101
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:21,780
of how we build things.

102
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,813
So whether that be looking at
our critical raw materials,

103
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:26,580
critical rare earth materials,

104
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,840
how we take those back

105
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,706
as well as circularity
initiatives for our components.

106
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,455
So just a quick factoid

107
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:36,180
that in last year we had

108
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,077
over 23.5 million
components recycle or sold

109
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:45,840
on the secondary market
since 2023, excuse me.

110
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,640
We also have a water positive objective.

111
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,380
So lemme just build that out.

112
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,880
So we are seeking to be
water positive by 2030,

113
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,760
and we're about 53% of that the way there.

114
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,170
What does water positivity mean?

115
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,570
It actually means that we're

116
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,760
or replacing more water than
we use in our operations

117
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,740
of our data centers.

118
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,240
So these are sort of
like the three pillars

119
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,040
that we are driving towards
in AWS sustainability

120
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,740
and we partner across
in our entire company

121
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,540
to achieve these objectives.

122
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,020
But of course, so what does
this look like at scale?

123
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,860
So we're, you know,

124
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,560
seeking to provide a
sustainable infrastructure

125
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,920
at scale across 120 availability zones,

126
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,915
over 245 countries and territories

127
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:33,631
as well as over 338 geographic regions.

128
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:36,889
We've also looked at
some studies that compare

129
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:38,970
that we actually operate more efficiently,

130
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,300
about 4.1 times more
efficient than on-premise.

131
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,540
So we are actually kind of
providing that efficiency

132
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,820
for our customers that
are coming to the cloud,

133
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,056
but we know we can't do
sustainability in isolation.

134
00:05:51,056 --> 00:05:53,280
So that's why, of
course, today I am joined

135
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,250
by some of our some of our customers

136
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,750
to tell their story as well.

137
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,940
So sustainability is a
shared responsibility.

138
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,044
We, as AWS,

139
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:03,060
we had just talked about some of our goals

140
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,600
across carbon free energy,
across water positivity.

141
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,840
So we, you know, as the infrastructure

142
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,700
that are providing these cloud services,

143
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,640
we can, you know, support how
we're building our servers

144
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,160
and the components we put
them, how we're cooling them,

145
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,020
where the water's coming from,

146
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,290
how we handle our waste,
what energy we procure.

147
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,126
So we as AWS can control those

148
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:26,550
and provide those to our customers.

149
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,800
But we also have the customer partnership

150
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,847
where customers like yourself
are leveraging our services.

151
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:35,190
And so this would be where we need

152
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,400
to actually support our
customers on how they use AWS.

153
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,860
So either that could be
through the services we offer,

154
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,150
that can be through the reporting

155
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,850
and insights they're able to
use to make decision-making.

156
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,750
And so this is something

157
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,980
we call shared responsibility
model for sustainability.

158
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,980
So if you're familiar with
the well architected pillar,

159
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,830
this is one of the fundamentals

160
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,640
of the sustainability pillars
in the well architected.

161
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,470
So you can read a little
bit more about it,

162
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,050
but fundamentally this is
sort of the relationship

163
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,700
that we share between AWS
and our customers as well.

164
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,390
So, you know, with that in mind,

165
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,833
we, as sustainability, really
needed to kind of understand

166
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,250
and meet our customers where
they were at as we were,

167
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,250
you know, understanding what
we were delivering, excuse me,

168
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,540
what goals we're taking,

169
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,830
what kind of transparency,

170
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,420
what kind of visibility they needed

171
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,700
to actually meet some of their
sustainability objectives.

172
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,490
Because, you know, again, not
just the partnership model,

173
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,850
but, of course, our customers
are running directly on AWS

174
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,310
so we are a portion of their footprint.

175
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,140
So how do we start to build
some of that relationship?

176
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,660
You know, it's been a
longer term initiative,

177
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,890
but one of the key initiatives

178
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,250
was launching a carbon
footprint tool in 2022.

179
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,140
So our carbon footprint tool,

180
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,730
and I'll show you a
little bit more later what

181
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,170
that looks like and, of course,

182
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,270
kind of where you can learn
a little bit more about it.

183
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,520
But the customer carbon footprint tool

184
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,340
is actually shows our
customer what portion

185
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,730
of the AWS's emissions they're responsible

186
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,840
based on their usage.

187
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,400
So you log into the billing console,

188
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,010
you're able to see that allocated portion,

189
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,858
and I'll a little bit
about how we built that

190
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:12,453
and we provide that to our customers.

191
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,956
But what we learned along the way was

192
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:17,190
we weren't listening close
enough to our customers.

193
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,883
We needed to know really what, you know,

194
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:22,587
what was blocking them from
making some of their, you know,

195
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:24,210
progress on their initiatives,
how we could listen better.

196
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,380
And so in 2024, excuse me, I
built that, oh no, excuse me.

197
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,720
We kind of opened up
customer survey to some

198
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,720
of our biggest, our most vocal,

199
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,180
our most sustainability-progressive
customers

200
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,443
to really gather them
together to get feedback.

201
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:42,007
And so through this
mechanism we're able to say,

202
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:44,040
"Hey, you know, what
can we be doing better?"

203
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,690
And and a lot of what we
heard in the beginning was,

204
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,619
we need more transparency from AWS.

205
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:50,361
We know we need to know, you know,

206
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,579
our footprint looks running on AW.

207
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,463
We need to know more visibility
about your operations

208
00:08:55,463 --> 00:08:57,480
and so we've done a couple things

209
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,580
in response to that feedback.

210
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,290
One of which was releasing

211
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,320
our power usage effectiveness ratings

212
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,570
in 2024 across our regions.

213
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,240
And so that actually provides visibility

214
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,550
into how we're actually
using power on-site

215
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,056
in our data centers.

216
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:15,226
We also released our
water usage effectiveness

217
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:16,920
earlier this year.

218
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,170
So similar to powers is also looking at

219
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,160
how efficient we are in water
usage in our data centers

220
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,300
to cool things down

221
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,330
and so you're able to look
at that at a regional level.

222
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,270
And then, and in 2025,

223
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,450
along with what we heard was

224
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,360
to kind of level up our
customer carbon footprint tool.

225
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,090
Customers wanted to know how
we calculated those numbers.

226
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,130
Could you tell us the methodology?

227
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,600
Is this third party verified?

228
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,430
So we released a verified methodology

229
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,220
to say this is actually how
we're computing these numbers

230
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,630
and that we've had a third party say

231
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,460
that this is up to speed.

232
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,021
And so we did that earlier this year

233
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:54,249
along with better functionality

234
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:55,710
and data exports

235
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,610
so customers could get their
allocated portion more easily.

236
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,320
We also, and sorry for the shorthand,

237
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,570
also released location based emissions,

238
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,850
which is a different type of methodology.

239
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,590
So we have both our
market based emissions,

240
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,447
which accounts for some
of our energy attributes

241
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:13,860
and other credits that we
use in our total footprint.

242
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,030
and we have the location base,

243
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,720
which is essentially the grid,

244
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,740
and this is our scope to reporting.

245
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,870
And then just recently,
just about a month ago,

246
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,240
we released something
called Scope 3 emissions.

247
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,090
I'll talk more about what
that looks like across scopes,

248
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,480
but was sort of like, it now
rounds out the complete pie

249
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,770
of AWS's footprint.

250
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,410
So we have all Scope 1, Scope 2

251
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,600
and Scope 3 emissions, including the tool

252
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,206
so that our customers can
actually see, you know,

253
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,700
where the sources of
emissions are coming from,

254
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,080
whether that be operation,

255
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,390
whether it be our energy sources

256
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,461
or of course our Scope 3.

257
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:48,960
So things like our hardware, you know,

258
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,160
that go into our server
racks and et cetera.

259
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,820
And then, you know,

260
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,650
we have a lot more plans
going into this year,

261
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,330
so we kind of hit a measure of success

262
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,640
to have complete verified reporting.

263
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,667
And in 2026,

264
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,390
we're looking to increase
the customer experience

265
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,590
and additional granularity

266
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,021
and keep serving our customers

267
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:09,213
to enable their sustainability initiatives

268
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:12,003
and we'll touch a little
bit more on that later.

269
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:16,110
But, you know, we will continue to hear

270
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,760
from our customers like Adobe,

271
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,080
like Salesforce on what they need

272
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,000
and really be responsive to that.

273
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,330
So I talked about Scope
1, 2, and 3, right.

274
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,390
Some of you may be like,
okay, that's old, old news,

275
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,590
I already know what that means.

276
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,630
Some of you might not know
what those Scopes are.

277
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,790
So I'll just give a quick recap

278
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,770
on what Scopes 1, 2, and 3.

279
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,560
So if we're thinking about
carbon accounting that's similar

280
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,320
to financial accounting, this
is actually how we account

281
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,990
for the emissions that we
generate as a business.

282
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,080
So there's something
called Scope 1 emissions.

283
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,970
This is like our operational emissions.

284
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,600
So things like our, you
know, backup generators

285
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,085
or others that we're
fully responsible for.

286
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:56,340
There's Scope 2, which is essentially

287
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,530
where we're getting our
energy from the grid

288
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,130
and so the sources of energy

289
00:12:01,017 --> 00:12:02,490
that actually supply our data centers.

290
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,080
And then there's scope 3,

291
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,657
which are basically all the
components, materials, hardware,

292
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:09,240
cement, everything

293
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,210
that goes into our actual
physical data centers

294
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,871
to actually power all
the compute that services

295
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:19,230
that we're actually
providing to our customers.

296
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,320
And so just as sort of like
a recap on all of those

297
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,430
that sort of just to
provide that visibility.

298
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,978
So how do we actually compute
the sustainably footprint,

299
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:30,390
the carbon footprint?

300
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,684
So we have a variety of
different data sources

301
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,950
that come from around our business.

302
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,519
So things like hardware
components and processors,

303
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,190
data center building
materials and equipment

304
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,480
like what I just talked about

305
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,119
all the way down to the cement.

306
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,698
The energy consumption

307
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,960
where the grid source water usage,

308
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,370
all of these different data sources,

309
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,540
we actually take in

310
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,830
from the all over our business

311
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,170
to be able to compute this footprint

312
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,420
and actually provide it
out to our customers.

313
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,900
And so this all feeds into something

314
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,120
what I was talking about, the
customer carbon footprint tool

315
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,720
that we actually built to
supply this to our customers.

316
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,040
So how do we do this?

317
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,630
We go through a couple different steps of,

318
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,780
obviously we have to ingest
millions of data points

319
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,330
from around the customer, or
excuse me, around the companies

320
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,769
to be able to actually
generate that number.

321
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:18,965
We orchestrate that.

322
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,880
So obviously we have numbers coming in

323
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,840
that are on an hourly cadence, on a daily,

324
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,060
weekly, monthly, right.

325
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,390
So we have different orchestration

326
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,620
of how we pull in

327
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,850
and generate those numbers

328
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,580
and actually tally them all up

329
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,400
into our total full total footprint.

330
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,230
We also, because it's carbon,

331
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,556
we often need to either apply
an emissions impact factor

332
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:43,110
or we have a team of scientists

333
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,120
that actually model the carbon emissions

334
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,710
of things like our components

335
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,420
that feed into our server racks.

336
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,360
And then, of course, we need
to persistent govern that data

337
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,090
because it is data from
around our entire company,

338
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,080
which feeds into some of our
downstream analysis and acts.

339
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,250
So how we actually plan

340
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,640
and forecast what we're doing
to meet our 2040 objectives

341
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,950
and, of course, how
we're reporting monthly

342
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,800
through the customer
carbon footprint tool.

343
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,690
And so I talked a little bit

344
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,760
about how we kind of progressively

345
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,775
take all these different components down.

346
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:16,239
This is sort of how we go step-by-step

347
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:18,840
on breaking down our top down allocation

348
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,980
for carbon emissions.

349
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,634
And so we actually do look
at across all our regions.

350
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:26,263
We are looking down to the
server racks allocating

351
00:14:26,263 --> 00:14:30,900
to our foundational services,
something like EC2 or S3

352
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,070
and then allocate those out

353
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,780
to our non foundational services.

354
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,870
These are the ones that run
directly on services like EC2,

355
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,898
which are running on hardware

356
00:14:38,898 --> 00:14:41,910
and then essentially we allocate
that out to our customers.

357
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,210
So across all of our AWS
accounts, we actually then do

358
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,201
an allocation model to
say, okay, hey, you know,

359
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:50,203
Adobe across all of your
accounts, this is the portion

360
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:52,980
of that your usage is generating

361
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,113
based on AWS's footprint.

362
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,080
So this is a quick screenshot

363
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,640
of the customer carbon footprint tool.

364
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,760
I also quick call out that
we have our product manager,

365
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,593
Marta Fraga here,

366
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:06,690
who's actually supports the
customer carbon footprint tool.

367
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,058
and we'll be at a demo,

368
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:09,870
we'll segue it to that later.

369
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,730
But if you can see sort
of like this is sort

370
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,360
of the screenshot you navigate
it to and billing console

371
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,860
and you find the tab

372
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,990
and we can look at both
market-based emissions

373
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,400
and location-based emissions.

374
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,530
And then you have different data exports

375
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,960
in terms of the range that
you can pull for your needs.

376
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,800
This would be actually
our market-based emissions

377
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,927
of a sample account.

378
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:34,530
Of course, this is nobody
in particular's account,

379
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,390
but you can see sort of the example here.

380
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,360
And then here is our
location based emissions

381
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,610
so this was just sort of an overview

382
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,320
on how we've actually got to the point

383
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,120
where we are now across

384
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,020
all of our sort

385
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,170
of sustainability objectives
and getting down to the CCFT.

386
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,180
So now I just wanna turn it over to Eric

387
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,539
to talk a little bit
about how we partnered

388
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:55,770
and worked on this.

389
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,033
All right, thanks.

390
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,130
- Thanks, Alexis, this is great.

391
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,990
Appreciate everyone being here.

392
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,303
It's definitely been a journey.

393
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,880
Salesforce has been a
customer of AWS for a while

394
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,680
and, you know, kudos to you guys

395
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,990
for consistently pushing the envelope

396
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,116
and bringing more sophistication

397
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:21,360
to a very complicated problem.

398
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,456
So thank you everyone who's worked on it.

399
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:26,451
I'm Eric Gertsman, I lead our
tech sustainability program

400
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:29,190
at Salesforce.

401
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,320
Want to give you guys
a kinda a big picture

402
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,558
of what we mean when we say
Salesforce sustainability.

403
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:36,300
I'll talk about four quick pillars

404
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,500
and then we'll dive a little bit deeper

405
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,210
into our infrastructure program.

406
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,210
So, you know, emissions
reductions probably one

407
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,692
of the biggest first starting
points that we focus on.

408
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:48,255
We wanna be net zero by 2040 as well.

409
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:49,680
And that's, you know,

410
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,200
looking at long-term
Scope 1 and 2 targets,

411
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,777
total carbon as well
as our carbon intensity

412
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:57,660
for our Scope 3 targets.

413
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,673
You can see those reflected up there.

414
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,913
To do this,

415
00:17:01,913 --> 00:17:03,782
we have to reduce our value
chain emissions significantly,

416
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:05,640
that's Scope 1, 2, and 3.

417
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,520
And we want to be more
efficient internally,

418
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,510
the things we have control over

419
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,550
per the shared responsibility model.

420
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,690
But we also, you know,

421
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,813
rely on and work with our
main providers like AWS

422
00:17:17,889 --> 00:17:21,210
to continue pushing the
envelope and decarbonizing.

423
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,660
We have an agent force for
net zero cloud product,

424
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,061
which is essentially a
sustainability management console

425
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:31,950
and helps our clients, you
know, really track, analyze,

426
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,830
report and reduce their
environmental and social impacts.

427
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,770
So it's something, if you're
in into that industry,

428
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,603
you should take a look.

429
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:41,573
It's a great way to tally

430
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:43,290
and and footprint.

431
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,450
And then we have agents, as you know,

432
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,948
Salesforce is big on
agents, as many of you are.

433
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:50,273
And and there's a lot of internal

434
00:17:50,273 --> 00:17:52,290
and external agents that are doing a lot

435
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,520
of great work with sustainability.

436
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,559
and if we wanna talk about
that near the end, we can.

437
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,350
As far as energy transition goes,

438
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,190
we are pushing hard to continue
moving the industry forward.

439
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,023
For ourselves,

440
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:06,360
we have been a hundred percent
renewable energy since 2021

441
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,910
and you know,

442
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,010
that is Scope 1 and 2.

443
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,360
We are looking further than that.

444
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,220
We're looking at
location-based grid emissions,

445
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,120
We're looking at, you know,

446
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,953
our Scope 3.

447
00:18:15,953 --> 00:18:17,640
We're trying to, you
know, look at, you know,

448
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,470
as the market is market-based emissions

449
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,140
by time and space and consider
what the right thing is

450
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,928
for the world and the economy.

451
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:26,310
We're helping to innovate at scale, right,

452
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,940
and scale certain technologies,
whether that's, you know,

453
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,940
efficiency, fuels, renewables, removals,

454
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,210
pushing the industry where we can,

455
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,446
where we don't necessarily
have direct control,

456
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:41,550
but we have, you know, our influence.

457
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,780
We wanna be nature positive.

458
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,040
Nature positive doesn't always show up

459
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,570
in everyone's sustainability reports,

460
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,560
but it's important to us.

461
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,670
We believe that the health

462
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,500
of business relies on
the health of nature.

463
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,490
It's kind of a no-brainer.

464
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,650
We all float around on this rock together.

465
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,720
However, there has been studies

466
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,610
from the World Economic Forum and others

467
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,160
that say that there's a tremendous
amount of economic value,

468
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,640
in fact, $10 trillion worth
of annual business value

469
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,110
and almost 400 million jobs
that can be developed by 2030

470
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,925
if we implement nature-positive
policies out there.

471
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:11,630
So huge, huge to think about.

472
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,500
We wanna re reduce our impact.

473
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,310
We've talked a lot about carbon,
but water is a huge focus.

474
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,510
It's a hyper localized resource.
We're thinking about it.

475
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,120
Our data centers and
resilience of the power grids.

476
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,310
Power grids use a lot of water,

477
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,950
something we're very
focused on going forward

478
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,290
and we're also thinking about investing

479
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,180
in up upstream watersheds,

480
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,250
quite literally upstream to make sure

481
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,530
that we have resilient sources of water

482
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,343
to continue powering our
data centers and our offices.

483
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,580
We also have a hundred
million dollars, you know,

484
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,290
nature and sustainability fund.

485
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,300
We are looking at nature-based solutions

486
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,880
for decarbonizing, you know,

487
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,750
through nature solutions

488
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,670
like the 1 trillion Tree Initiative.

489
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,490
Many of you may have
heard of that, 1t.org,

490
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,630
very important initiative.

491
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,890
And then we recognize

492
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,290
that big companies are
not gonna do this alone.

493
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,920
We have to foster an
environment where ecopreneur,

494
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,050
small mission-driven
companies that are doing a lot

495
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,660
of good sustainability
work can be successful.

496
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,670
And, and through our
philanthropy, our ventures work,

497
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,886
putting our full capital
stack at play there

498
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:17,043
to support them.

499
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,170
So when we talk about our

500
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,760
infrastructure sustainability program,

501
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,020
I'm focused on a few things, you know,

502
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,780
over this year into next
year on that right side,

503
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,910
so all of these stuff, sokeep an ear out

504
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,910
for how data transparency
and data, you know,

505
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,750
feeds into each of these things,

506
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,280
and I'll talk about that a
little more in the next slide.

507
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,710
But, you know, first and foremost,

508
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,630
we're transitioning to public cloud.

509
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,699
We have a lot of our co-location
data centers currently,

510
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:48,020
but we've rapidly deploying on a AWS

511
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,580
over the last few years

512
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,400
that requires a lot of
data to understand sort

513
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,730
of the right, the right, you
know, economic incentives,

514
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,920
the right sustainability, you know,

515
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,220
impacts, and then going
forward, making the case

516
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,197
for continued deployment.

517
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:05,520
But to do that,

518
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,140
we also have to rightsize
that utilization.

519
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,540
We don't, we don't wanna just, you know,

520
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,730
willy-nilly just throw all of our capacity

521
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,662
without making sure we're doing it

522
00:21:13,662 --> 00:21:15,090
in the right most
mindful, thought out way.

523
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,860
So we have been
rightsizing our utilization

524
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,270
and getting much more efficient

525
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,140
over the last few quarters
and years, really.

526
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,088
And in this shared sustainability,

527
00:21:24,088 --> 00:21:25,800
excuse me, shared responsibility model,

528
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,370
we have thought a lot about
cost driven optimizations,

529
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,260
you know, FinOps professionals,

530
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,970
if you're in here, it
sounds like there's a few,

531
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,580
you think a lot about, you
know, keeping costs low

532
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,310
and thinking about cost to
serve and, and unit costs.

533
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,200
We do the same thing with a carbon lens

534
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,260
and they're very, very similar pathways

535
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,300
and it's okay to, you know, work together

536
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,190
and one ride the coattail of the other

537
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,936
and oftentimes work together to double

538
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:51,093
sort of the, the impact and the incentive,

539
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:52,680
you know, business drivers.

540
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,985
But it's includes things like, you know,

541
00:21:54,985 --> 00:21:56,158
selecting the right instances,

542
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:57,090
which I think a lot of
you are thinking about,

543
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,580
using S3, intelligent tiering,

544
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,000
upgrading to EBS, you know,
so keep, things like that.

545
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,610
You know, suspending or
releasing ODCR capacity,

546
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,440
things that make you more efficient

547
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,920
and drive costs down and, and carbon down.

548
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,990
We're also kind of taking it a view

549
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,990
of our own infrastructure,
deploying our customers

550
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:21,660
in a more efficient and and effective way.

551
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,457
So we think about the
efficiency as, you know,

552
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:26,700
and we try to benchmark where
they should be based on,

553
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,220
where, you know, we seek similar customers

554
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,890
and try to help give them tools to,

555
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,148
to deploy the most effectively,

556
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:36,330
which then, of course, makes
us more efficient as well.

557
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,450
But we're staying mindful of
regions, regions for, you know,

558
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,620
carbon intensity, but also
water stress, big deal.

559
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,990
And we are giving customers an option

560
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,190
to actually deploy

561
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,598
or migrate either from their co-location

562
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:52,230
to clean regions

563
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,478
or from, you know, AWS-to-AWS regions

564
00:22:55,478 --> 00:22:59,670
you know, if they have priorities

565
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,350
to be in the greener regions.

566
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,880
We're trying to develop software code

567
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,801
that's more, you know, efficient, elegant,

568
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,990
and avoids anti-patterns

569
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,065
that really can drag
resource utilization down.

570
00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:11,902
So it all starts with that underlying code

571
00:23:11,902 --> 00:23:14,580
and it's both human generated code

572
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,490
and AI generated code

573
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,249
that we're really trying to
think about going forward.

574
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:20,676
We're tracking water.

575
00:23:20,676 --> 00:23:22,590
We're tracking E-waste.

576
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,750
We're trying to set the
performance expectations.

577
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,260
Try to understand when we're
talking about WE and PUE,

578
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,610
we're thinking about climate.

579
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,380
We're thinking about where, you know,

580
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,520
what is the right strategy,

581
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,171
the trade-offs between carbon and water?

582
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:39,570
And so data is highly important for that

583
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,210
and then, of course, we're
continuing to engage a variety

584
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,490
of stakeholders, customers,
regulators, investors

585
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:49,263
and data is super important
for those purposes.

586
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,350
So I wanted to kinda reiterate
some of the things, you know,

587
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,330
different types of data
have different purposes

588
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,090
and you know, we need a lot of it

589
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,440
for a lot of different purposes, right.

590
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,979
So location-based grid
emissions is important

591
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:08,190
for certain uses, market based we require,

592
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,198
and thank you guys for,
for continuing to push

593
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,570
to bring more types of data to us.

594
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,150
Scope 1, 2, and that supply chain

595
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,490
is really important as we, you know,

596
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,130
become more sophisticated
with the decisions we make

597
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,330
as customers, suppliers, our customers.

598
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,440
It's a big ecosystem,

599
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,287
where we have to all, all
think and work together.

600
00:24:28,287 --> 00:24:32,730
And so that as sort

601
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,740
of dissected by master payer account

602
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,297
and subaccounts by regions,
by service level stuff.

603
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:40,590
WE, we talked about by region,

604
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,470
but you know, all regions
with, with withdrawals

605
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,210
and potentially in the future a variety

606
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,890
of of other things which
I've kind of put there,

607
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,890
those are kind of in my brain of things

608
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,320
and I know you guys have
been thinking about this too.

609
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,660
So those four categories
to the right are sort of

610
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,481
where we use things like,
so footprinting, right.

611
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:58,860
We have to keep track of historicals.

612
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,115
We do that internally to track, you know,

613
00:25:01,115 --> 00:25:03,420
where we are and where
we're hitting our goals,

614
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,924
but we also have to do external reporting,

615
00:25:05,924 --> 00:25:08,430
either through our
stakeholder impact report.

616
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,573
We ave to plug in,

617
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:13,440
you know, the CDP or the 10K
filings, things like that,

618
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,736
that all requires data from the CCFT

619
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:19,140
and AWS to get that right.

620
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,160
Forecasting and trendsetting.

621
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,770
We take historicals,
think into the future.

622
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:26,430
We have science-based targets
we have to hit in 2040

623
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,680
and we need to know what trends we're on

624
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,210
and how we're doing with our current

625
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,872
and forecasting going forward.

626
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:35,010
Internally, it sort of dovetails

627
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:35,902
with this internal analysis,

628
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,740
but it goes kind of a level deeper.

629
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,900
'cause we think about each
of our business units.

630
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,360
Many of you know Salesforce
is a CRM company,

631
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,645
which obviously it is, but
we have a lot of other arms.

632
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:46,530
We do marketing and commerce.

633
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,390
We have Slack under our umbrella now

634
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,170
and Tableau, MuleSoft,
a lot of these products

635
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,580
that people know and love,

636
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,060
but do have sort of different
businesses, different metrics.

637
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,700
And as we think about that,
we need AWS data to match

638
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,810
with that to help us find patterns

639
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:07,320
and kind of opportunities.

640
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,570
And then lastly is, is stakeholders.

641
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,160
We, you know, talk about
engaging customers,

642
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,870
that is hugely important for us.

643
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,480
Our customers are constantly
asking for what their usage

644
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,578
of our cloud is, our products are.

645
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:21,594
And, of course, we rely
on AWS in many cases

646
00:26:21,594 --> 00:26:23,984
to sort of pass through some of that data.

647
00:26:23,984 --> 00:26:26,817
But also when we set
expectations for suppliers

648
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:28,710
and we engage our suppliers,

649
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,567
we think about industry benchmarking,

650
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:30,400
all of that stuff is gonna be required

651
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,608
and we think a lot about how we can bring

652
00:26:34,608 --> 00:26:36,810
that data into the richest way possible.

653
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,206
So with that, I will stop,

654
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:40,570
I'm gonna turn it over to Rao from Adobe

655
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,947
to talk and then looking forward
some discussion after that.

656
00:26:44,947 --> 00:26:46,280
- [Alexis] Okay.

657
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,000
- Thanks, thank you Alexis.

658
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,290
so for that nice context as well

659
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:01,590
as the introduction and thanks Eric

660
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,794
for walking through the, you know,

661
00:27:03,794 --> 00:27:06,003
Salesforce sustainability journey.

662
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:08,730
You know, it's inspiring

663
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:12,307
to see how this collaboration

664
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,727
drives the collective progress,

665
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:19,920
you know, in our industry.

666
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,570
So this is a perfect example
of the collaboration.

667
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,780
And, hello, good afternoon,
my name is Rao Chargondla.

668
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,210
I'm a senior program manager at Adobe.

669
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,780
I lead the initiatives in cloud FinOps.

670
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,343
as well as the sustainability.

671
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,540
So one of the things is like

672
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:46,587
at Adobe, the sustainability
is mindful and intentional.

673
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,205
So that thing that we
wanted to kind of do is

674
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:57,205
that the sustainability
is not a kind of journey.

675
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,650
It's not a just it's not a destination.

676
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,773
So it is actually
ingrained as a business DNA

677
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,093
within Adobe.

678
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:18,390
One of the things that I
wanted to focus on here

679
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,530
is that Adobe Sustainability journey

680
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,360
stands on three pillars.

681
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,480
So one is the product pillar,

682
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,650
and the product pillar

683
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:33,650
is where we are developing
the digital workflows

684
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,790
for our customers

685
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,620
to enable their process flows

686
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,340
and the second one is that
operational sustainability.

687
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,152
In the operational sustainability,

688
00:28:46,152 --> 00:28:51,000
we are enabling our internal as well

689
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,020
as external operations and efficiencies.

690
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,040
And the third one is that we collaborate,

691
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,050
which is the advocacy.

692
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:05,825
We collaborate with our
partners, with our customers

693
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:09,600
so that it, we are actually going together

694
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,293
as one partner model.

695
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,430
And to enable this strategy,

696
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:25,430
we have all actually developed
the five guiding principles.

697
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:31,863
One is empower our customers
through our products.

698
00:29:32,747 --> 00:29:37,747
You all probably aware Adobe Acrobat,

699
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,520
I'm sure most of you
are using Adobe Acrobat.

700
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,570
Adobe Acrobat, Adobe document Cloud

701
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,630
through which we enable digital workflows

702
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,956
and through which we
save billions of papers,

703
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:55,590
which is, you know, printing

704
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,440
and also Adobe sign

705
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,940
through which we are enabling
the digital signatures

706
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,810
whereby, you know, reducing
the logistical carbon.

707
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,690
So second one is

708
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,190
that building the sustainable
innovative workspaces

709
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,311
for our employees.

710
00:30:16,311 --> 00:30:21,311
So our facilities are 80%
of them are lead certified.

711
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,507
So what that means is that it, you know,

712
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:31,507
one of our recent buildings
at Adobe Head headquarters,

713
00:30:34,196 --> 00:30:38,370
which has onsite renewable energy

714
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:43,230
as well as our own water
circulation system,

715
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,283
which reduces the load on municipality.

716
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,100
So the third area is the boosting

717
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:57,100
of productivity within
our own data centers

718
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,360
for the Scope 1, Scope 2 emissions

719
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,470
whereby reducing the PUE

720
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:11,540
and also kind of cutting
down the under emissions.

721
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,203
The fourth area is that
employee engagement.

722
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,210
So we have a number of green teams

723
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,056
and they engage thousands
of our own employees

724
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:30,056
who actually kind of do
90% of our waste recycling

725
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:39,395
that happens as part of the
green teams and the effort.

726
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:45,713
The last one is what we
call it as a transparency.

727
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,390
So bringing the transparency that is

728
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,910
through annual sustainability reports.

729
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,590
The annual sustainability report,

730
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:58,920
which not only kind of provides

731
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,922
all the en environmental parameters,

732
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:06,870
but also brings the
what is the ethical AI,

733
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,090
ethical and sustainable AI?

734
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,370
And as well as the data transparency

735
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,340
into the, you know, mix of it.

736
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,340
So there are the five guiding principles

737
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,080
that drives our overall strategy.

738
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,363
So obviously it is not just,

739
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,570
you know, Adobe,

740
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,643
but I think it's a
partnership with our partners

741
00:32:31,643 --> 00:32:33,513
as well as the customers.

742
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,810
Now when it comes to our commitments,

743
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,390
so we have our North Star,

744
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:47,010
North Star is to become net zero by 2050.

745
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,228
So, which is kind of very similar to most

746
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:51,870
of your organizations.

747
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:56,730
So however, so these, the
milestones that you see here,

748
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:00,030
the commitments that you see here,

749
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,100
they're not just aspirations,

750
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,960
but they are milestones to our progress.

751
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,313
So two of the important milestones
which you can see here is

752
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:15,060
that our operations,
which is Scope 1, Scope 2,

753
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:20,060
reducing our emissions by 42% by 2030.

754
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:29,060
And the second one target is

755
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:32,100
our supply chain,

756
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,034
reducing that the emissions by 52%,

757
00:33:36,034 --> 00:33:41,034
which is where our cloud as
well as our supply chain,

758
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:44,493
they sit in this category.

759
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,610
And apart from that,

760
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:52,610
so we have four of the different
operational milestones,

761
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,240
a hundred percent renewable energy,

762
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,210
electricity by 2025.

763
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,699
And then 90% of our waste

764
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:07,440
has global waste recycling diversion.

765
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,440
And again, 80% of our buildings

766
00:34:12,788 --> 00:34:16,470
continue to maintain
the lead certification.

767
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,905
And then 25% is, you know,

768
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:22,740
reduce the water
consumption goal, you know,

769
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,690
both within our own data center as well

770
00:34:25,544 --> 00:34:27,603
as kind of overall per employee.

771
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:36,033
So driving sustainability is not

772
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:39,734
as a kind of, it's a
shared responsibility.

773
00:34:39,734 --> 00:34:41,730
Obviously, you know,

774
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:45,063
the partnership is a
very important aspect.

775
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,310
So there are three things

776
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,690
that to keep in mind.

777
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,110
One is data, right,

778
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,430
So from data

779
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:01,320
and deriving the insights,
that's one important aspect.

780
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,830
Second one is that reporting aspect

781
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,020
from data to reporting.

782
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,750
So we have several
types of reports, right,

783
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,830
so sustainability disclosures

784
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,830
and, you know, deep diving
the internal reports

785
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,850
to understand the carbon
footprint for each

786
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,280
of the products.

787
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,437
And the third thing is that

788
00:35:29,437 --> 00:35:32,329
how we are actually kind of going to get

789
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:35,050
that programmatic data access

790
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:41,340
from the CCFT standpoint.

791
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:46,170
So our partnership with AWS is

792
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,580
that our inventory Adobe inventory

793
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,740
is standards aligned

794
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,740
as well as we are greenhouse
gas protocol enabled.

795
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:02,330
But where the CCFT data adds value is

796
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:07,140
that it enhancing the data so that,

797
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,330
I mean we do our own data

798
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:13,500
in the form of spend based estimates.

799
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,150
So to bring the precision together.

800
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,380
So that is where the Scope 3 data

801
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,900
that plays an important role here.

802
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,260
So again, in summary,

803
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,260
so, again, sustainability
is a shared responsibility

804
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,523
and a shared progress that we are making.

805
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:46,440
Thank you for all the, you
know, support from the AWS

806
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,500
and of that, you know,
we were kind of bringing

807
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,303
that information together.

808
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,217
Again, let's make every pixel

809
00:36:56,217 --> 00:36:59,278
and every partnership count, thank you.

810
00:36:59,278 --> 00:37:01,396
- Awesome, thank you.
(audience clapping)

811
00:37:01,396 --> 00:37:02,349
Awesome, thank you,

812
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:05,670
Actually the funny story is last year Rao

813
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,501
and one of his colleagues Tridar said

814
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:10,510
that this year we wanted to
be on stage talking about

815
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,300
how we deliver Scope 3,

816
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,670
and so we actually came full circle moment

817
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,920
that we are here on stage presenting that.

818
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,683
So we just have a few, a little
bit more to wrap up here.

819
00:37:19,683 --> 00:37:23,790
So obviously as you saw the headline

820
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,710
of our talk collaboration is key, right,

821
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,610
and sustainability.

822
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,290
We can't do this in isolation

823
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,870
sitting up here with two
of our customers, right,

824
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,810
and telling us how we need to
kind of meet our commitments

825
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,047
and our goals and drive transparency,

826
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:38,310
but also, you know,
their part in, you know,

827
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,930
driving their sustainability initiatives

828
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,443
and the demand things
that there are things

829
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:45,342
that you can do like running
well architected pillar reviews

830
00:37:45,342 --> 00:37:47,518
that have a sustainability dimension.

831
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:49,620
So you can work with account managers

832
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,782
and any of our technical
field community to do

833
00:37:51,782 --> 00:37:53,897
those type of sessions.

834
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,370
But, of course, you know,
like I started to talk today

835
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:59,820
and I saw that only three
of you have seen the CCFT.

836
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,560
So that means by the
end of this conference,

837
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,110
I want all of you guys have seen the CCFT.

838
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,000
So please go see Marta

839
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,830
and some of our good friends over

840
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,380
in the showcase at the Venetian we have.

841
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,510
There's a very large sign
that to sustainability.

842
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,340
There's a bunch of cool demos.

843
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,890
Please go and you know, check it out.

844
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,960
It will be worth your time, I promise.

845
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,065
And then a shameless plug as
I'm doing another talk tomorrow

846
00:38:23,065 --> 00:38:24,690
where we actually talk about

847
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,780
how we built some of our
core data infrastructure

848
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,580
using AWS Native Services.

849
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,500
So please also join me for that

850
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,380
if you wanna see a little
bit more of the guts of like

851
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,800
how we built this using
some of our core data

852
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,790
and AI services

853
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,990
that actually feed this

854
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,550
into the customer carbon footprint tool,

855
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,050
which you can do.

856
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,100
With a few minutes left,

857
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,400
I had kind of heard some
conversations in these early days

858
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,016
about maybe some topics
we just wanna, you know,

859
00:38:50,016 --> 00:38:52,170
we got about nine minutes left

860
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,120
to just kind of bring some of these,

861
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,740
some questions and topics I've heard.

862
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,740
And so did wanna kind of
ask you guys a few questions

863
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,340
while we're still here together

864
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,620
and I think the elephant in the room

865
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,460
that I've heard from some
folks is GenAI, right,

866
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,140
and so we obviously we're here

867
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,700
as sustainability professionals,

868
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,965
but wanted to get your take
a little bit on like how,

869
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:17,489
you know, as large
organizations like Adobe

870
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:20,730
and Salesforce are starting
to kind of grapple with,

871
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,580
you know, being, you know,
in a sustainability position,

872
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,110
but also with the growth of AI

873
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,190
and we know there are more

874
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,840
environmental pressures with that.

875
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,180
So maybe I just ask, you know, Eric,

876
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,823
if you wanna like comment or sorry Rao.

877
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,120
- Sure, I can start.

878
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,060
I think couple of four things is that,

879
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,342
I mean, gene AI is a
really a force multiplier,

880
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:47,152
certainly it has a double edge.

881
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:50,070
One, is that kind of a positive

882
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,080
from the opportunities standpoint.

883
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,140
There are couple of opportunities,
several opportunities.

884
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,639
One is to kind of how we can bring

885
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:01,050
that unstructured data together

886
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:05,323
and then to kind of from
data to insights, you know,

887
00:40:05,323 --> 00:40:08,100
that is just certainly is a feasible

888
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,070
from the sustainability data standpoint

889
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,257
and also to bring that to
all the way to the, you know,

890
00:40:14,257 --> 00:40:18,180
ESG disclosures that we publish.

891
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,713
So that's something that we
do and that is been happening.

892
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,220
But where on the other side,

893
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,197
which is the challenges
front is obviously kind of,

894
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:32,920
you know, we all know there
are a couple of things

895
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:34,760
that are adding up.

896
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,853
One is that, you know,
the more you bring in,

897
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:43,853
the GPUs, then you know,
you are adding more energy

898
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,110
and you water consumption.

899
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,530
So, which like for an
organization like Adobe,

900
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,550
you know, carbon footprint
is growing, right,

901
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,325
and the other area is that, you know,

902
00:40:56,325 --> 00:40:59,449
you are refreshing that
GPUs so frequently,

903
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:02,970
there is a E-waste that is happening,

904
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,267
unless you are kind of
extending the life of that,

905
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:09,420
you know, GPUs within that.

906
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,860
So I think

907
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,960
because you know, the,
when you are looking at

908
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,143
that accounting part of it,
right, so you are accounting

909
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:19,800
that to the customers as well

910
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,120
from the, you know,
hyperscalers to customers.

911
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,510
So that this is where the opportunities,

912
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,333
there are opportunities,
there are challenges,

913
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,644
but I think it also kind

914
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:38,644
of depends on like when we
look at the finally like ROI

915
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,073
versus the cost, right.

916
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,910
So we are kind of, you know,

917
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,970
I mean, I know sustainability
is one of the pillars

918
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,604
for the well architected framework,

919
00:41:49,604 --> 00:41:53,150
but what we, or what we
were trying to do is that

920
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,590
to in introduce the sustainability

921
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,160
as part of the region selection process.

922
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,452
So that's something is, you know,

923
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:05,460
definitely is helpful from that.

924
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,720
- Great.

925
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,710
- Yeah, I mean,

926
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,320
obviously we are looking
a lot of scary things

927
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,910
in the future that may come from AI,

928
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,663
but I'm fairly bullish on it.

929
00:42:14,663 --> 00:42:16,260
I think that AI

930
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,140
is actually gonna help
sustainability quite a bit.

931
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,680
Yes, we have to be mindful of
our data center energy usage

932
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,280
and we will, but I honestly
think that AI has an opportunity

933
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,680
to transform these
infrastructure systems, right.

934
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,570
What you're talking about
data centers, you know,

935
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:35,123
being able to, to do better
intelligent automation,

936
00:42:35,123 --> 00:42:37,110
really allows you to save costs

937
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,720
and be more reliable, be more efficient,

938
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,040
and even upstream from that,

939
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,096
like the, the power grids, right.

940
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:45,840
There's a tremendous amount
of opportunity, I think

941
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,570
to forecast, you know, supply and demand

942
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,797
with around time and space to get more,

943
00:42:49,797 --> 00:42:52,631
you know, benefits there

944
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:55,230
and, you know, in
integrate more renewables

945
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,280
to the grid, things like that.

946
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,303
So I'm excited and also it's
gonna accelerate innovation.

947
00:42:59,303 --> 00:43:02,697
The IEA, I think said that 50%

948
00:43:02,697 --> 00:43:05,610
of the carbon reduction
we're gonna see in 2050

949
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,110
will come from technologies
not even invented yet,

950
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,010
which means that we gotta
get these technologies online

951
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,210
and the faster we can do that, the better

952
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,400
and AI, I think it's really
gonna push that forward

953
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,390
quite a bit.

954
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:16,650
And I think just modeling,

955
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,463
I think AI does this really great.

956
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:20,296
We just take so much data

957
00:43:20,296 --> 00:43:21,750
and help us model things, you know,

958
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,640
and when we think about mitigation,

959
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,700
whether it's like near term
stuff around like, you know,

960
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,520
flood risk or sea ice
change, things like that,

961
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,401
or you know, longer
term things like drought

962
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:34,370
or, you know, tree canopy, you know,

963
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:39,060
growth and water retention,

964
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:39,930
those are important.

965
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,010
And then even policies,

966
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:44,160
like how certain programs
will change behaviors

967
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:44,993
like, you know,

968
00:43:44,993 --> 00:43:46,410
carbon pricing, things like that.

969
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,000
AI can help generate models

970
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,440
around what's gonna be the most impactful

971
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,170
and help our policy
makers and our businesses

972
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,790
and other organizations do better.

973
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,440
So it's just an exciting time.

974
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,630
I think just like for
the rest of the world

975
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,340
and industry, there's all opportunities,

976
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,980
but I think sustainability
really needs to leverage AI

977
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,769
as much as possible,

978
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:06,000
and I think the whole industry
would be better for it.

979
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,410
- Yeah, awesome, great comments.

980
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:09,180
I mean, I will also say that, you know,

981
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,909
we, as a engineering
manager myself, right,

982
00:44:11,909 --> 00:44:15,058
we have our developers
building products at a faster

983
00:44:15,058 --> 00:44:17,869
pace than ever before,
leveraging some of our core,

984
00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:21,330
you know, developer products like Kiro.

985
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,320
And then, of course, you know,

986
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,000
tomorrow I'll talk a
little about like bedrock,

987
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,230
where we're actually using that

988
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,490
to make insights

989
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,440
and actionability more accessible

990
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,665
to all of our internal and
eventually external as well.

991
00:44:31,665 --> 00:44:35,220
So we're seeing, you know,
obviously some of the kind

992
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,020
of daunting things that
we need to continue

993
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,190
to operate more efficiently,

994
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,350
but then also how we're building

995
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,660
and supplying more
sustainably transparency

996
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,730
and progress leveraging AI.

997
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,000
So we're also seeing that
here with AWS as well.

998
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,120
So I wanted to ask just,
you know, one more question.

999
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,310
We and maybe we'll have
time for the third one,

1000
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:58,170
but we obviously talked about
our journey this year, right,

1001
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,680
and, you know, kind of where
we thought we were last year.

1002
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,570
We were like, we're never gonna get there.

1003
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:06,300
But we got here and we're,
we're on this stage saying,

1004
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,450
you know, we've kind of
reached this, this moment.

1005
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:10,495
Do you think we're done?

1006
00:45:10,495 --> 00:45:12,240
Have we like checked the box?

1007
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,680
Are we ready to go home now?

1008
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,690
Or what else, you know, are Adobe

1009
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,750
and Salesforce like needing
from AWS in this space?

1010
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,180
Can you talk a little bit
about like how, you know,

1011
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,440
some of the initiatives you're driving

1012
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,511
and how we're gonna
continue to collaborate? ,

1013
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:28,082
- Yeah, I mean, I kind of
a loaded question, right,

1014
00:45:28,082 --> 00:45:28,915
we're never gonna be done.

1015
00:45:28,915 --> 00:45:31,484
I think as sustainability professionals

1016
00:45:31,484 --> 00:45:33,330
we have to keep pushing the envelope.

1017
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,978
And again, tremendous amount of progress.

1018
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:40,350
It's not mission complete
quite yet for any of us,

1019
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,670
but I do want to reiterate

1020
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,010
that customers really do care
and I think the world cares.

1021
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,610
I know we're in a time right now

1022
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,640
of very interesting political wind

1023
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,770
and I think it's a time
for business to lead,

1024
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:56,940
like show leadership and
be true to your values.

1025
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,257
The pendulums will continue
swinging constantly

1026
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:02,970
from the next a hundred, 200, 500 years.

1027
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:06,780
So, you know, I think the, the
importance of sustainability,

1028
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,600
it's not just about hugging some trees,

1029
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,170
it's really truly about
delivering social value,

1030
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,740
economic value, business value,
longevity of your business,

1031
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,300
de-risking, you know,

1032
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,760
improving a variety of different things

1033
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,680
that are associated with your business,

1034
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,840
driving down costs, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1035
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,890
So for us, excuse me, it is not done.

1036
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,606
Thank you for your partnership.

1037
00:46:30,606 --> 00:46:31,500
We want you to keep going.

1038
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,420
I think the things we would
like to see is, you know,

1039
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,356
just continued accessibility,
more access to our data

1040
00:46:37,356 --> 00:46:41,910
and maybe even better tools,
maybe easier, you know, APIs,

1041
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:42,960
more recent data, right.

1042
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,090
Like no, you know, low neo lag time,

1043
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,080
which I know is on the horizon,

1044
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,013
which is exciting.

1045
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:50,374
Granularity of data, right,

1046
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:51,780
you know, we sometimes
look at very high levels,

1047
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,760
but going forward, we're
gonna go deeper and deeper

1048
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,990
and deeper and our stack

1049
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:58,050
and try to understand where
the carbon footprint's coming

1050
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,633
so we can analyze that at a better level

1051
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:01,290
to help us, you know,

1052
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:03,900
make better decisions in
our sustainability program.

1053
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,080
And I think probably,
you know, actionability

1054
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,350
or identifying opportunities
within our deployments

1055
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:14,400
on AWS is an area where we'd
love your support more and more

1056
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,410
and more and help us understand the places

1057
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:17,670
and that shared responsibility model.

1058
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,640
I know there was a very
clear pink and blue category,

1059
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,230
but the reality is, you know,

1060
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,240
you know so much about
your infrastructure.

1061
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,430
You know so much about running,

1062
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,260
you know, workloads on the cloud

1063
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,320
that the more you can help
your customers figure out

1064
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,180
ways to be more efficient,
I think would be great.

1065
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,890
So these are things

1066
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,448
we could talk about next year, right,

1067
00:47:36,448 --> 00:47:37,560
and the year after and the year after.

1068
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,150
- We'll, stay busy, yes.

1069
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,830
- Yeah, I could just say ditto,

1070
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:44,130
but one of the things though,

1071
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:47,320
certainly more and more
for customers are asking

1072
00:47:48,287 --> 00:47:52,530
about, you know, what's the
carbon footprint for your,

1073
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:55,122
you know, product X.

1074
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,055
We are not there yet.

1075
00:47:57,055 --> 00:48:01,582
I think we at this point of
time to kind of trying to

1076
00:48:01,582 --> 00:48:05,640
bring that together to be able to dissect

1077
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,790
and then allocate it to the product level.

1078
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:12,480
It takes a little bit
of more for the effort.

1079
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,010
So that's one use case.

1080
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:17,130
And the other one is
that, you know, again,

1081
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:20,070
mostly the customers from the Europe,

1082
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:23,820
they started asking the
questions about, you know,

1083
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:27,818
yeah, GenAI footprint and
I think, you know, again,

1084
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:29,490
that all points

1085
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,310
to that what Eric you
were mentioning about

1086
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:36,243
the data granularity and
the data accessibility.

1087
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,630
I think those are the top items

1088
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:43,020
on our agenda as well.

1089
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,660
And then we are actually kind of excited

1090
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:50,660
about the console, CCFT console

1091
00:48:50,812 --> 00:48:55,812
because of that, that gives
them more access also kind of

1092
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,263
from that standpoint.

1093
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,820
And, of course, one of the exciting things

1094
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,977
that you were mentioning
about in the roadmap is,

1095
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:10,059
you know, monthly data,
availability of monthly data.

1096
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:13,000
So, yeah, no, I mean I think

1097
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:16,980
for the last 12 months or so,

1098
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,390
I think there's a tremendous progress

1099
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:20,970
that's been made, but certainly, you know,

1100
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:25,970
continue to push the for data
accessibility and granularity.

1101
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,170
- That's awesome,

1102
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:31,070
I mean, I always like to hear
that there's gonna be plenty

1103
00:49:32,233 --> 00:49:33,270
of work for my engineers
for a while to come.

1104
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,730
So sounds like we got
a lot of things coming.

1105
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,590
So we have a lot of things planned

1106
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,690
and as I look over at
Marta who will be one

1107
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,000
of the key orchestrators in 2026,

1108
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,710
so keep watching this place.

1109
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,437
Lots of interesting things in terms of

1110
00:49:45,437 --> 00:49:47,580
where we're driving granularity so

1111
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,490
that partners like yourselves, like Adobe,

1112
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:54,420
like Salesforce can continue
to kind of innovate on AWS

1113
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,610
with sustainability in mind.

1114
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:59,700
So really thankful for
you guys joining today.

1115
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,845
Like I said, just one
more like shameless plug,

1116
00:50:01,845 --> 00:50:05,919
go to our demo desk in the
showcase, big sustainably sign.

1117
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,070
Would love to see your
faces again tomorrow

1118
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,150
at the other session

1119
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:10,710
where we're actually
gonna do a chalk talk,

1120
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,180
building out sort of the infrastructure,

1121
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,400
how we built some of the underlying,

1122
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,230
I like to call it guts of the CCFT.

1123
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:19,950
So would definitely be happy
to see you there as well.

1124
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:23,820
Also, please rate our session
five out of five stars.

1125
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,140
We are, you know,

1126
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:28,110
sustainability is still
fundamental, right,

1127
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,400
it's still super important.

1128
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,770
So wanna keep bringing back these insights

1129
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,780
and bringing back these
perspectives for you.

1130
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,360
So really appreciate your time today.

1131
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,947
Don't forget AWS Skills Builder.

1132
00:50:37,947 --> 00:50:42,105
Here's my obligated slide
that I need to pop up for you,

1133
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,100
but will also,

1134
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,950
I kind of did sort of a
pre-curated set of questions,

1135
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:47,783
but we'll be around

1136
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:50,550
for a few minutes if you wanna
come up and chat to us after.

1137
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,441
So thank you again so much.

1138
00:50:52,441 --> 00:50:55,441
