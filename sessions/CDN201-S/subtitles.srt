1
00:00:00,509 --> 00:00:02,990
All right, everybody here in theater 3 happening

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,500
now, secure, easy and performant VPC

3
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:08,509
resource connectivity with tail scale. Take

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,368
it away, Lee.

5
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:11,750
Thank you very much. Um, as

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,028
just mentioned, I'm here to talk to you about tail scale,

7
00:00:14,069 --> 00:00:15,050
secure, easy,

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,673
and performant VPC resource connection. Activity

9
00:00:17,673 --> 00:00:18,344
with tail scale.

10
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:21,274
Now, two words of warning, this is a sponsored presentation,

11
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,524
and I do work in sales, so if you feel

12
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,545
compelled to part ways with your hard earned

13
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:27,635
money as a result of this presentation, that means it's

14
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:28,184
gone well.

15
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:30,513
I think I can make a pretty compelling argument

16
00:00:30,513 --> 00:00:31,875
for why you should do that anyway,

17
00:00:32,154 --> 00:00:34,274
but let's talk a little bit about an agenda, um.

18
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,630
The pain of connecting to private VPC

19
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,709
resources, there are many, many ways to solve

20
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:40,319
this problem.

21
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,579
You likely have this problem already,

22
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,149
but you probably have experienced some pain

23
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,109
at some point here.

24
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,469
Uh, and I'm gonna talk about how Tailscale does things a little

25
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:50,704
bit differently. I'm gonna talk about the. Power

26
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:53,024
of wireguard which underpins tailscale's

27
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:53,984
connectivity solution.

28
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:55,793
I'm gonna talk about some use cases.

29
00:00:56,145 --> 00:00:58,185
I'm gonna talk about how you can do it right

30
00:00:58,185 --> 00:00:59,325
and how you can do it wrong,

31
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:01,634
and then you'll see that it says demo on here,

32
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:03,984
this is Las Vegas. I was out too late last night,

33
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,564
we're not getting a demo today.

34
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:09,260
So what does private VPC resource

35
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,159
access look like today?

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,329
Well,

37
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,909
what we have found, or what I have found prior

38
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,969
to being a solutions engineer, I was a

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,500
a system administrator, DevOps engineer, platform

40
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,510
engineer, whatever the title is this

41
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,510
week. Um, and what we generally found is

42
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,588
that actually connecting to things that are inside

43
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:27,698
your VPC that are in a private subnet

44
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:29,528
that are not exposed to the public internet

45
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,069
is fraught with complexity. If you want to connect

46
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:34,349
two VPCs together, you're immediately in VPC

47
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:36,909
peering pain or you have to deal with transit gateways.

48
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,444
You are. You have limited visibility

49
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:40,025
and control,

50
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:42,435
sure you can send all these things to cloudWatch and Cloud

51
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,444
trail, but does anybody ever actually look at

52
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:45,096
those things?

53
00:01:45,444 --> 00:01:47,486
Um, the, the, the, the

54
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:49,685
costs of doing these things are immediately,

55
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:52,206
uh, painful, like, you know, AWBS

56
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:54,325
announced regional nat gateways, that's a, a

57
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:56,486
great change, but every single bite or every

58
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:58,486
single packet that goes through those gets

59
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:00,605
charged, and that's an expensive

60
00:02:00,676 --> 00:02:03,055
operation. And then finally and most importantly,

61
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:05,772
I'd imagine everybody. Nobody here who's had any technology-based

62
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:08,222
background has used a VPN at some point in their lives,

63
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,730
and they've probably had to reboot their laptop

64
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,010
because the VPN has gone wonky

65
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,991
or caused you some level of frustration.

66
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,711
These are things that we hear about at Telscale all day.

67
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,271
Every single time we talk to a new company,

68
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:22,271
they have an existing connectivity solution

69
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,890
and they say the developer experience is

70
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,931
really, really poor, it's impacting

71
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:29,051
my productivity, it's making things really, really

72
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:29,751
painful.

73
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,479
The complexity can be kind of described a little

74
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,758
bit like this. This is a nice visualization

75
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:36,500
of a pretty

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,199
typical VPN or connectivity

77
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,389
topology. You might have some sort of VPN

78
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:43,599
hub and then you might have a gateway in another region

79
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,038
or a gateway in another VPC.

80
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,058
It's very limited to the network it works.

81
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:49,633
Model that you have originally ascribed

82
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:51,713
to, and if you have a problem

83
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,993
at some point in this path,

84
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:55,433
if a developer is trying to get into an RDS

85
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,774
database or a developer is trying to get to

86
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:00,294
something that's only an internal resource,

87
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:02,433
and they can't achieve that even though they're on the

88
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:02,985
VPN.

89
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,538
They don't have any idea how to

90
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:07,618
solve that problem, that's immediately an

91
00:03:07,618 --> 00:03:09,659
IT ticket or it's somebody else

92
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,338
who's gonna have to solve that problem for them.

93
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:13,819
We hear all the time how painful and frustrating

94
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,099
that is and the topology here is a is a

95
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,240
an artifact of that.

96
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,288
So

97
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:22,199
A lot of these VPNs were built on

98
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,278
technology that was designed for a

99
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:26,479
day when your

100
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,558
work machine was under your

101
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:30,800
desk and was not a portable

102
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,919
machine. It had a cable plugged into it, so

103
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,319
you might be familiar with er VPN

104
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,319
technology with encryption that is TLS based and so

105
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,058
it uses certificate-based encryption.

106
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,618
A lot of the pain points

107
00:03:41,618 --> 00:03:44,000
that you see in the complexity that we just talked about are

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,080
because of that lack of design for

109
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,699
modern networks. We.

110
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:50,092
Wi Fi now, we have laptops, we have cell

111
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:52,132
phones, you're on the move all the time. People

112
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,412
are working from coffee shops, they're working from

113
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:56,483
their homes, they're working from the office. Things are

114
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:58,602
moving around a lot more. And so

115
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:00,711
in the, in the mid 2010s,

116
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:03,112
uh, a gentleman called Jason Donnenfeld

117
00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:05,412
felt so empowered to, to fix

118
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,013
this problem that he designed a new connectivity

119
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:10,051
solution called Wireguard. If you're familiar

120
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:12,453
with it, it was built from the ground up from our modern

121
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,733
networks. It has fewer bottlenecks,

122
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:17,425
um, which means you. You can connect all of the devices

123
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,764
in a network together. Um,

124
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:21,846
it's way more lightweight and predictable,

125
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:24,305
um, so it's a much more smaller boat codebase.

126
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:26,466
It was written from the ground up, um, it

127
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,665
has an entirely new cryptography stack underneath

128
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:30,704
it, and it is really, really

129
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,725
good in situations when you're moving around

130
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:34,985
a lot. It self heals the connectivity path.

131
00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:37,505
So I can close my laptop and open

132
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:39,584
it again and my VPN is not

133
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:41,716
gonna go all, all sideways and force

134
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:42,764
me to reboot the machine.

135
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:45,528
That. That was one of the reasons

136
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:47,670
that why a guide was was was designed.

137
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:49,970
And we at Tailscale have built

138
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,028
our products on top of that technology.

139
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,439
So we are the easiest way

140
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,720
for you to get all of the benefits of this new

141
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,798
built cryptography and this new

142
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,079
built connectivity solution

143
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,600
without having to do things like key management, without

144
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,639
having to do identity, without having to

145
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,678
figure out how you're gonna build a client that works.

146
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:09,079
Telscale is a very, very straightforward way to

147
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,819
get to get all of those benefits.

148
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,778
We, as we said, we built it on on Wireguard.

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,238
We embedded identity

150
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:18,319
directly into the product, so we are SSO

151
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,632
driven. We don't charge extra for SSO

152
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:23,052
it's all based right from the, it's all

153
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:25,062
um required for you to actually sign up

154
00:05:25,062 --> 00:05:25,622
for the product.

155
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:27,983
No usernames and passwords, none of that

156
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:28,963
kind of like legacy

157
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,781
security stuff. It works on any operating

158
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:34,023
system, any device, in any location.

159
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:36,463
So one of our engineers recently compiled

160
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:38,531
tail scale for an old um

161
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:39,622
operating system.

162
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:42,341
We work on your cell phone, we work on

163
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,923
your laptop, we work on

164
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,634
vehicle entertainment. Systems, we work on,

165
00:05:46,884 --> 00:05:49,204
you know, we have tailscale deployed in submarines,

166
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:51,966
we have tailscale deployed in farms, there's tailscale

167
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:54,485
about to get launched into space, we will work basically

168
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:56,745
anywhere. And one of the, my favorite, um,

169
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:59,286
piece pieces of tailscale is that we actually

170
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:01,514
handle navigating out of your network

171
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:03,634
for you. So you don't need to open any ports,

172
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:05,605
you don't need to open any security groups.

173
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:06,824
It will, it will

174
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:09,565
connect these two devices together via

175
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:11,295
the magic of our natroversial.

176
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:13,819
And so

177
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:16,139
when we layer the identity on top of that,

178
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,230
you, instead of the other topology that we looked

179
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,238
at earlier, you end up with something that looks a little

180
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:20,939
bit like this.

181
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,259
Every device is aware of every other device in the

182
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,338
network, every device can communicate with every other

183
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:26,139
device in the network.

184
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,619
We have embedded the identity of

185
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,358
that device into the client,

186
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:32,040
and so then we decide

187
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,619
what you're actually allowed to communicate with

188
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:36,730
based on. Who you are and

189
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,088
who you've logged in as. And so we build this huge

190
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:41,449
mesh of nodes, and then we build an ACL

191
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:43,449
system on top of that, which will allow

192
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,488
you to be able to determine, you

193
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,769
know, can this person access this RDS

194
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:49,850
database? Is this person able to

195
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,850
access this EC2 instance? And so

196
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,639
rather than thinking about this from a network level segmentation,

197
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,170
we think about it from an identity-based segmentation.

198
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,259
What sort of things does this open up for you? Well.

199
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,600
I've used the term VPN

200
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,439
quite a lot already in the

201
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:06,629
6 or 7 minutes of this presentation,

202
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,980
but what we are finding from our customers

203
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,519
is that,

204
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,798
This can solve a whole bunch of things

205
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:15,439
that traditional VPNs or traditional connectivity

206
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,619
solutions cannot solve for you. So we've talked

207
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:19,920
a little bit about a standard kind of business

208
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,259
VPN use case. You have

209
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,678
employees that are on the road, working remotely,

210
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:26,250
they need to get access to internal

211
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,819
applications that you need to secure,

212
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:30,439
um, and we can solve that problem very, very straightforwardly.

213
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,415
We can also. Solve some more AWS

214
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:35,555
and like what we call machine to machine

215
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,596
based use cases. So if you look at

216
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:39,596
the the concept of CICD if you're

217
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:41,545
using GitHub and GitHub's manage runners,

218
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:43,875
you might wanna run a database migration.

219
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:46,394
But the GitHub managed runner is outside of your

220
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:47,216
security boundary.

221
00:07:47,555 --> 00:07:49,634
Because Tailscale is so lightweight and small, you

222
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:51,815
can drop tailscale into a GitHub action

223
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:52,795
workflow.

224
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:55,271
Uh, we have a GitHub action workflow that will do set

225
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:57,730
up tail scale and connect you to CICD pipeline,

226
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,302
and you can now run those,

227
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,610
you know, RDS migrations or talk

228
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,630
to your EKS cluster that has an internal

229
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,190
API

230
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:06,752
really, really easily with just a single

231
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:07,752
step in a workflow.

232
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,190
And it's, it's a really straightforward way

233
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,271
of kind of enabling connectivity to

234
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:14,110
things that you couldn't previously do.

235
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,709
Um, you look at things like workload connectivity.

236
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:18,988
I don't know about you, but I, I've certainly

237
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:21,389
run, you know, some of the agentic AI

238
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,428
based things that are running amok around,

239
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,750
um, my laptop. I'm able to delete

240
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,028
random files and do whatever it wants. The

241
00:08:28,028 --> 00:08:30,220
workload connectivity, um, and the securing

242
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,889
AI tenants of our platform

243
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:34,269
allow you to actually secure those things and stop

244
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:36,509
those things running rampant, um, and doing

245
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:38,668
things that you, you know, really don't

246
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:39,369
want them to do.

247
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,058
Workload connectivity is really interesting because previously

248
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:44,178
the way you would solve this, I know there were some announcements

249
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:46,340
today about cross-cloud um

250
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,619
connectivity for like

251
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,899
Google Cloud and AWS. We have

252
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:51,479
large organizations right now

253
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:54,139
solving that exact problem with Tailscale. They just

254
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:54,739
dropped two tailscales.

255
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:56,215
Agents, one in Google Cloud,

256
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,614
one in AWS, so they drop, um, you

257
00:08:58,614 --> 00:09:00,734
know, uh, something in their ADBS VPC and

258
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,835
something in their data center or in their office,

259
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:05,215
and that immediately connects those two things together. There's

260
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:06,224
no configuration,

261
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:08,533
no firewall changes, no setup,

262
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,955
it just works straight away.

263
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:10,918
Um,

264
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,408
the other two I think are Edge and IOT,

265
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,759
um, because Tailscale is so small and lightweight,

266
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,389
if you are,

267
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:19,080
you know, deploying things like kiosks to,

268
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:19,750
um,

269
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:22,080
to different stores, or if

270
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,359
you are deploying, you know, robots

271
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:26,678
and, and all that kind of stuff, you can actually

272
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:28,750
install tailscale directly on those things which

273
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,908
will help you with things like getting telemetry

274
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:33,489
off them. Or debugging debugging

275
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,849
problems in those environments,

276
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:37,250
you know, it costs millions of dollars for

277
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,369
organizations to send technicians out to fix

278
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:40,389
things that are in the field.

279
00:09:40,808 --> 00:09:42,889
You can install tailscale on those devices

280
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,918
and fix them remotely without having to get people

281
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,928
on the road. It saves you millions.

282
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:49,210
It can save you millions of dollars. We have customers saving

283
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,149
millions of dollars on Edge and IoT.

284
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,428
And then finally,

285
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,729
Our go to market motion is that you are gonna

286
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,389
love our product so much

287
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:59,808
that you want to take it to work. And

288
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,820
so I'll talk a little bit later in the presentation about

289
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,950
our pricing structure,

290
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,250
but our um default

291
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,399
setting is that you use Tailscale for your home lab.

292
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,649
We offer very generous, uh, a very

293
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:11,889
generous personal tier. So if you have video

294
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:13,928
cameras at home or you wanna check the contents

295
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:16,729
on your smart fridge and you wanna do all that remotely,

296
00:10:16,928 --> 00:10:18,928
Tailscale is a free and easy

297
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:20,269
way to solve that problem.

298
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,960
So we talked about some of the real world problems here.

299
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:26,359
Developer access to resources in AWS is

300
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,019
the kind of straightforward one. You have EC2 instances,

301
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:31,399
you wanna debug why that uh EKS pod

302
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,440
didn't start properly, so you wanna get to EKS

303
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,109
worker mode,

304
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
you wanna get into a database to fix

305
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,639
a production issue,

306
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,399
you, you know, want to, um,

307
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,099
Get access to anything that is only confined

308
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:43,960
to the VPC.

309
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:46,658
Telscale can solve that quickly and easily

310
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:47,629
and straightforwardly.

311
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,379
If you want to connect two ABS regions together

312
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:52,719
or two ADS organizations together,

313
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:55,619
or perhaps you want to enable your customers

314
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:57,820
to be able to communicate back to your infrastructure

315
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,918
in a secure way,

316
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,009
Telscale can solve that problem for you.

317
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:03,460
We can help you with secure automation

318
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,639
problems. We can help you

319
00:11:04,928 --> 00:11:07,279
things like, like I already mentioned, like GitHub actions

320
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,509
or Terraform Cloud or Jenkins runners

321
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,759
that need to actually communicate from

322
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,798
outside your security boundary to inside

323
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,798
your security boundary. And then as I already talked

324
00:11:15,798 --> 00:11:18,139
about the hybrid and cross cloud connectivity,

325
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,308
um problem. I know there were some some announcements

326
00:11:20,308 --> 00:11:22,440
today as I already said, but we've been solving that problem

327
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,558
for nearly 5 years. And I think we know what

328
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,460
we're, I think we've done a pretty good job of that.

329
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,379
That's er that's er the same slide twice,

330
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,178
er apologies for that. um,

331
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,080
so what does doing it wrong look like? Well,

332
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:39,009
If you have too many layers of indirection,

333
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:41,048
I already talked about this earlier in the presentation.

334
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,489
If you do too many layers of indirection, if you have

335
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:45,889
too many hops through an infrastructure

336
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:47,330
in order to make these things work,

337
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:49,609
the debugging and the user experience

338
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,678
is really, really painful. Um,

339
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:53,808
so each time you build some sort of

340
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:56,058
like hub and spoke connectivity model,

341
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,408
each one of those instances is a point

342
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:00,408
of failure that can cause you

343
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:02,504
problems. In really critical

344
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:04,614
situations. In a mesh-based approach, there

345
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:05,933
is no single point of failure.

346
00:12:06,215 --> 00:12:08,835
No single instance can

347
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:11,134
can can break any of your connectivity

348
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:11,913
workflows.

349
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:14,894
We see a lot of organizations doing

350
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:16,033
what we call security,

351
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:18,053
security by IP address.

352
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:21,494
So you might be using things like IP whitelisting.

353
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,854
You might be doing things like only

354
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:26,298
allowing access from. Certain subnets

355
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:27,379
to other subnets.

356
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:29,759
I've seen in my career

357
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:32,298
hundreds of security groups that only allow

358
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:33,599
access on port and protocol,

359
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:36,200
uh, on specific IP addresses.

360
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:38,580
The problem that you run into with that is what if the IP

361
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,288
addresses change?

362
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:41,700
What if, you know, things move around and you

363
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,979
have to migrate these things? You know, that causes

364
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,979
real world connectivity problems and so we

365
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:48,739
focused on doing this via identity

366
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:49,803
rather than. Via

367
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:52,104
any networking level. So we wanna know who you

368
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,474
are, we wanna know the origin of the request,

369
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:57,254
and then we allow access based on that identity

370
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:58,445
rather than the IP address.

371
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,783
And then finally, I've talked about this a lot, but I really think it's

372
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:01,484
worth driving home.

373
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:04,104
The developer experience debt of doing

374
00:13:04,104 --> 00:13:04,844
these things wrong,

375
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:07,565
sorry, of, of doing the things, these things, um,

376
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:10,125
right, um, is, is just

377
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,144
a, an experience that just works. It's

378
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:13,163
just way better.

379
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:18,428
So what does that look like for

380
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:20,548
organizations that have actually adopted Tailscale? Well,

381
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,570
Cribble

382
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:24,269
has grown their organization. You can see their

383
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:25,908
huge booth over there in the corner.

384
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:28,229
They've been using Tailscale since the very inception of the

385
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:29,489
company. They've grown

386
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,950
by 25x in terms of their employee

387
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,519
count, and they've had seen

388
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:36,413
no, they have. No dedicated IT resources

389
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:38,455
to actually manage connectivity. And

390
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:40,553
they attest a huge portion of that

391
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:42,673
to tailscale. Um,

392
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,494
hugging face, um, estimated

393
00:13:45,494 --> 00:13:47,754
that they save 240 hours

394
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:49,933
annually just on provisioning

395
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:51,933
new users when they are onboarded

396
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:53,075
into the organization.

397
00:13:53,455 --> 00:13:54,134
Um.

398
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,840
Call light, 1000 hours saved annually with

399
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,269
fewer VP VPN connectivity

400
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:01,330
issues. 90% reduction

401
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,989
in internal support requests from Instacart.

402
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,649
I was, um, you know, part of the, um,

403
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:09,259
the sales team that that was rolling out Instacart,

404
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,788
and the level of of happiness

405
00:14:11,788 --> 00:14:12,529
that they got

406
00:14:12,788 --> 00:14:14,908
just from switching from one product to another,

407
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,389
just in terms of IT tickets and like

408
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,389
people picking up the phone saying, hey, I've got a meeting in

409
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:20,928
10 minutes and the VPN's not working,

410
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,349
like. It, it, it made a

411
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:24,719
huge difference to their business.

412
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,729
And then in terms of actual like,

413
00:14:27,308 --> 00:14:29,580
like real technology performance,

414
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,629
because we use Wireguard as our underlying encryption,

415
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:34,469
we've seen we can guarantee a 4x

416
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:36,869
reduction in latency because we're going directly

417
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:40,019
between those resources and 22

418
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,279
22X increase in 3. Though.

419
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,989
Um, we can often find that with tailscale

420
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:45,009
we can saturate,

421
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,928
um, the nick inside these EC2

422
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:48,529
instances

423
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,450
to,

424
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,788
you know, up to the 10 gig nicks basically. So you can

425
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:54,330
get full, fully encrypted connectivity,

426
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:55,969
um, like full,

427
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:58,389
a full throughput for

428
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:59,950
most EC2 instances.

429
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,048
So here are some diagrams that show you what that looks like in the

430
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:03,750
real world.

431
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,070
So here you can see we have an EC2

432
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,200
instance in a private subnet.

433
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,599
We have the Nat gateway in a public

434
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:13,080
subnet. You'll notice I haven't opened any ports

435
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
in this particular example. I don't

436
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,239
open any security groups. I only

437
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:19,239
need outbound connectivity. I do not need any

438
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,239
inbound connectivity.

439
00:15:20,538 --> 00:15:22,769
Uh, and Telscope can connect me to my laptop,

440
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,940
I can run SSH commands, I can run

441
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,099
debugging things, all those kind of things. If you're

442
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:29,178
regularly SSHing into things or

443
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,759
using something like ADBS SSM,

444
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,340
there are a lot of things that are fraught with peril there. The

445
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,418
fact that you don't have to open any any firewall ports

446
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:37,798
is gonna make your security team very happy, I suspect.

447
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:39,109
Um,

448
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:41,609
we have a, um, a Kubernetes

449
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,038
operator so we can run within,

450
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:44,139
uh, EKS.

451
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:46,029
Uh, we can make, we can help you,

452
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,359
um, move your EKS control plane.

453
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,538
Obviously the default setting is public access.

454
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:53,019
Your EKS control plane, if there's a Kubernete zero

455
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,219
day tomorrow, a lot of EKS clusters

456
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:57,259
are gonna be in a really bad way. Uh, they're gonna

457
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:58,058
be publicly accessible.

458
00:15:58,585 --> 00:16:00,663
You probably don't wanna put your MySQL database on

459
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:03,094
the public internet. I don't wanna put my EKS

460
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:05,384
control plane on the on the public internet. That's a very powerful

461
00:16:05,384 --> 00:16:05,904
API

462
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:08,504
and tailscale will enable you to actually move

463
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:10,585
that into a private subnet, so you no

464
00:16:10,585 --> 00:16:12,663
longer need to worry about that being on

465
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:14,864
the public internet. And I can do, I get the same

466
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:17,375
level of throughput and connectivity using the Tailscale Kubernetes

467
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,379
operator. Um, I can also use

468
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,359
telscale to connect,

469
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:24,080
um, EKS nodes using EKS

470
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,349
hybrid nodes. Um, so if you have

471
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:28,379
remote GPUs that you want to connect from

472
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:30,558
another cloud, and connect them back to your EKS

473
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:32,668
control plane, Tailscale can solve that

474
00:16:32,668 --> 00:16:34,764
problem with you. Requiring no dedicated

475
00:16:34,764 --> 00:16:35,354
hardware,

476
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:37,724
no, um, no capex in terms

477
00:16:37,724 --> 00:16:38,465
of like spend,

478
00:16:38,724 --> 00:16:40,724
you don't need EPSEC tunnels anymore. All you need to do is

479
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:42,764
install tail scale on the on the node that you want

480
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:45,033
to connect and everything will just work. There's a great blog

481
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:47,283
post on the on the on the AWS,

482
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:49,144
um, blog about how to do that.

483
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,849
Um, if you want to do, as I already mentioned, like

484
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:55,099
just connecting to things like, uh, uh, Amazon RDS,

485
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:57,379
very common thing. I imagine most people don't want

486
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:59,580
to put their RDS databases on the public internet

487
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,658
anymore. Um, so you know, how do you

488
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:03,779
actually run things like database migrations, how do you do

489
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,979
debugging? Uh, all you have to do

490
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,979
is run, uh, a tailscale

491
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:08,979
EC2 instance.

492
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:11,380
You create something called a subnet router

493
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,539
that advertises the address of the RDS

494
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,618
database and you can use that to proxy requests through

495
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,000
there. We see that as a very, very common use case.

496
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:22,358
And then finally, um, you know, if you

497
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:23,338
want to connect two

498
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:25,259
specific VPCs together,

499
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,108
obviously you can use transit gateways.

500
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,269
Very, very expensive, you can use VPC once it

501
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:32,348
gets to more than two connections, it

502
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:34,400
can be quite complicated and difficult to set

503
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,479
up. Um, you can actually connect

504
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:38,640
these two VPCs together with just 2

505
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
EC2 instances or 1

506
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,858
EC2 instance in each one of the VPCs,

507
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,039
and it will connect you together really, really easily.

508
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,699
I mentioned at the beginning, um, I

509
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,989
believe we have a plan that's right for everybody, um,

510
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,559
and one of the things that you could do

511
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:54,199
right after, um, this presentation

512
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,380
is go to Telscale.com and sign up

513
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,608
for our personal tier which is free forever,

514
00:17:58,818 --> 00:18:00,900
up to 3 users, and 100

515
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,328
devices. I think that's a very, very generous tier,

516
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,578
uh, and again, our entire. Model here is

517
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:07,680
we want you to love tail scale so much

518
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,900
that you take it to work and replace that thing that's

519
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,219
been annoying you for years and years and years.

520
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,459
And so you can sign up right now if you head over

521
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:17,098
to our booth, um, it's booth 1818

522
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:19,098
over in the corner over there somewhere. We actually have

523
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,140
a code as well that will give you like 3 months

524
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,539
of our starter tier, uh, for for for

525
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:24,279
free as well.

526
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:25,338
So

527
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,689
that was just about timed perfectly right, I've got about

528
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,368
1 minute left.

529
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,809
Uh, I really appreciate everybody taking the time to join me

530
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,809
today. I appreciate everybody listening to me. Uh, and

531
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:35,039
I hope everybody has a great rest of the conference and thank you very much.

532
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,289
I will be over at the booth for the next 10 to 15

533
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:39,289
minutes. If anybody has any questions, I can probably take some

534
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:40,890
questions here as well, but thank you everybody.
