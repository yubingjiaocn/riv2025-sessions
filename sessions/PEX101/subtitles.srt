1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,119
Thank you so much for coming.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,488
I know we are on day 4 of Reinvent.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,250
It's been an incredible week,

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,769
lots of new announcements, and so we really

5
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:09,868
appreciate you taking the time

6
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:10,909
to be here.

7
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:12,960
Um, I'm Christine Henley.

8
00:00:13,228 --> 00:00:15,409
I lead our worldwide partner

9
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:17,530
programs for Channel and go

10
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,388
to Market with AWS,

11
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,010
and my friend Mike Eastman had

12
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,208
a personal conflict and so we're really

13
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,208
fortunate that he was able to call in a huge

14
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,208
favor and get us Rayhan Shaw

15
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:28,829
here today.

16
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,039
So Rayhan, if you wanna introduce yourself. Hi, I'm

17
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:36,658
Rehan Sham, the partner sales leader in the US responsible

18
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:38,880
for, uh, acquiring new customers with partners,

19
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:40,020
and I'm excited to be here.

20
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,359
All right, so much.

21
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,759
So we're here today to talk about accelerating new

22
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,840
customer engagement and revenue growth.

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,240
So just a quick show of hands, how many

24
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,240
folks here are from an ISV

25
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,779
partner?

26
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:54,158
Thank you. And how many from an SI or

27
00:00:54,158 --> 00:00:55,020
consulting

28
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:57,579
and any distributors in the room?

29
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,560
Excellent. OK, well thank you all for making the

30
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,759
time really excited and we'll take some

31
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,739
questions at the end of the side here, so

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,500
keep those questions for us.

33
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:09,278
So what do we cover today? We're gonna talk about what

34
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,629
going to market at scale means

35
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,879
and why should you do it with AWS.

36
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,480
We'll talk a little bit about what is a partner

37
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,558
business practice and how to build one,

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,120
and we'll talk about that partner profitability

39
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,159
framework of build, market, sell and

40
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,198
grow and close with a few next

41
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:25,918
steps for you.

42
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:29,319
I'll pass it to Rajan to talk a little bit more about

43
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,549
going to market at scale.

44
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,918
Alright, thank you. So the

45
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:35,198
opportunity is vast, it's not limited, it's

46
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:35,900
huge,

47
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,500
you know, if you think about

48
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,698
the industry, if you think about

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,198
where the industry is going, the trends, what

50
00:01:42,198 --> 00:01:43,489
are we looking at right now,

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,079
uh, just at the moment, and this is just

52
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,620
now,

53
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,439
the, it's the AWS

54
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,668
partner network has grown to 1400

55
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:53,558
partners across the 200.

56
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,069
Some countries and territories, right, so think of that

57
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:58,370
as an opportunity for you as a partner, you as a customer

58
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,849
to work with each other and create

59
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:01,388
solutions,

60
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,948
um, so that opportunity continues to expand

61
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:06,308
and why scale? Why not just work with

62
00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:08,308
the larger organizations where the deal size is

63
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:09,490
a little bit larger, right?

64
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,808
It's because 98%

65
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,229
of the organizations are SMBs,

66
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:15,270
either small or medium.

67
00:02:16,038 --> 00:02:18,118
So that's the opportunity right in front of you, right? And

68
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:20,699
this 98%, when you think of the small medium

69
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:22,618
organizations, 90% of them

70
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,219
are going to consider

71
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:26,679
some G AI solution in the next 3

72
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,788
years. So therein lies an opportunity for

73
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:31,020
all of us within the small medium

74
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,319
and that leading with some G AI focus.

75
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:35,069
And as we go further,

76
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,990
um. We're

77
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,099
predicting that 2026,

78
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,449
50% of the marketplace transactions

79
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,919
will be through a channel partner,

80
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:46,909
something key to note and understand.

81
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:49,860
All right, so let's swap over now. Let's talk a little bit about

82
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,250
the customer trends, what's happening from a customer

83
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:52,919
perspective.

84
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:54,500
So the big ones, right?

85
00:02:54,778 --> 00:02:56,819
Um, first one is the industry

86
00:02:57,058 --> 00:02:57,679
focus

87
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,000
continues to be an area of trend,

88
00:03:00,338 --> 00:03:02,580
and then focusing on customer outcomes, customer

89
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,618
business outcomes.

90
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:06,020
Uh, Zeno, who's one of our partners, predicted that

91
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,038
75% of the enterprise buyers,

92
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,860
uh, will buy based on your deep vertical

93
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,058
knowledge and expertise. So it's

94
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:15,038
important to hone in your industry expertise.

95
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:17,879
The continued focus, I mean

96
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,000
you guys heard girls in the last 34

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,240
days, G AI, AI all

98
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,618
over constantly, right?

99
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:26,149
Um, and that seems to be not just the trend,

100
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,629
it's reality. So 81% of SMBs

101
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:29,979
and mid-market firms

102
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,500
are gonna invest

103
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,319
something in AI

104
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,000
according to Tech Isle in the coming

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,038
year. So that's right there, a huge opportunity in front

106
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:40,099
of you building a go to market very specific

107
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,210
to AI. And then lastly,

108
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,319
also very important is the focus on

109
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,550
multi-cloud, right?

110
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,308
Multi-cloud was a focus not just for enterprises,

111
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:50,429
it's now expanded even small medium sized

112
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:52,469
businesses are considering multi-cloud

113
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:53,949
solutions for different use cases,

114
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,449
so it's good for you to be

115
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,939
front and center in front of it and building your business

116
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,058
around it. So

117
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:02,360
now I'll talk a little bit about some recent

118
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,679
um customer use cases

119
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:07,219
where we've seen some outcomes be created

120
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:08,719
and for you to consider as a partner.

121
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,139
The first one is in Northern Island Loch

122
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,679
Nee has been building

123
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,618
a toxic algae bloom, um, battling

124
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:16,559
actually I should say

125
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:18,759
that was threatening drinking water

126
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,639
and 40% of the water in that region.

127
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:24,569
So the Department of Agriculture and Environment

128
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:25,548
partnered up

129
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,970
with private sector for a solution, and this

130
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,028
is where AWS stepped in with its partners.

131
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:32,488
So partners build Ingram

132
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:34,170
Micro, LG Sonic,

133
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:36,720
and Whole Food, um, Whole school

134
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,769
software joined forces to create a

135
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:41,689
Lochne AI powered predictive analytics

136
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,689
solution, and this solution then helped

137
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:44,309
curated

138
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:46,769
the right outcome for the customer and how to clean up this

139
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:47,850
water and have a solution.

140
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,548
That's really solved for

141
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,879
the overall environment, so a big one for

142
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,470
us, right?

143
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,278
The second one is an example, um,

144
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:58,048
JDS, Woodmark Consulting firm,

145
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,540
um, and, and basically they worked.

146
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:03,600
This is about a global maritime logistics

147
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,910
organization. The industry backbone here is really

148
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,790
international trade,

149
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:09,309
which is really dominated by a few large

150
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:12,528
organizations leaving small businesses at a disadvantage.

151
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:14,428
But when it comes to real-time tracking.

152
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:16,028
Or accurate, um,

153
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,399
arrival predictions,

154
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:19,809
JDS and Woodmark Consulting teamed

155
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:21,269
up to change that,

156
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:22,600
leveraging the SMB

157
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:24,309
competency,

158
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:25,910
GAI rapid funding,

159
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,600
MAP, and some of the programs that we have.

160
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,048
JDS was able to help the customer,

161
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:33,250
and they implemented a logistics intelligence

162
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,449
platform that leveled the playing field for

163
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:36,329
all businesses,

164
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,420
not just large organizations, also for SMB.

165
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:41,230
So a big one for us and big one for you as well,

166
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:43,678
right? Finally, in the healthcare

167
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:45,629
industry. When I think of quality care,

168
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:48,428
um, and it's becoming harder and harder now with

169
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:50,889
half the organizations of healthcare in the US

170
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,149
alone planning to switch careers due to burnout,

171
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:55,588
right? So Care.com recognized this crisis

172
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,889
and partnered up with Cloudhesive

173
00:05:58,088 --> 00:05:58,798
and Guidehouse

174
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:00,230
to transform how

175
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:02,350
care providers and patients connect.

176
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,028
So this led to Cloudhesive's Amazon

177
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,428
Connect capabilities and integrating a solution

178
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,769
with Cloud Connect,

179
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:10,608
or Amazon's Connect I should say.

180
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:12,949
With Epic EHR systems

181
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,250
that's creating a HIPAA compliance solution, an AI

182
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,389
driven contact center,

183
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:19,230
um, that created an outcome in this situation

184
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,428
for Care.com to continue serving more than

185
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:22,988
45 million families,

186
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,528
so fast and furious, but in the healthcare

187
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:26,329
creating an outcome.

188
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:29,449
And as I continue building on this,

189
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,798
Christi, I go to you now. OK, thank you.

190
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:36,358
Excellent, so fantastic stories

191
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:38,439
and what I love about Rajan Shared is that it's

192
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,569
not just impacting the community,

193
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,040
but it really shows the power of when partners

194
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,160
leverage AWS programs to

195
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
help small organizations and the

196
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,139
only way to really do that is to build intentionally

197
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:52,600
and consider how you're setting yourself up

198
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,379
to go to market at scale.

199
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,798
So we have a framework for thinking about this with an

200
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:59,199
AWS which we call the partner profitability

201
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,899
framework.

202
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:02,699
We're gonna talk here today a little bit about the

203
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,939
build stage where you're creating capabilities

204
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:07,129
and solutions that solve real customer

205
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:07,798
problems

206
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,259
market where you generate demand and

207
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,298
identify that customer fit for the

208
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,338
solutions that you have,

209
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:16,100
sell and convert those customers into

210
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,449
real opportunities and engagements, and

211
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:21,100
then grow. How do you help those customers succeed

212
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
and expand over time and

213
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,540
find more customers that can benefit from a similar

214
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,209
solution. When

215
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:30,209
we think about those phases, there's one

216
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,329
other factor that comes into play.

217
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,048
When you're going to market together with AWS

218
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,720
we really see a partner maturity

219
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,879
journey of how you interact

220
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,358
and integrate with us and our programs.

221
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:46,019
The first phase of that journey we're calling

222
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:48,178
the opportunity phase. That's

223
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:50,278
where you have a solution and you've identified

224
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:52,088
that customer market fit,

225
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,579
but you're really working with AWS and our sales

226
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:57,129
teams on an opportunity by opportunity

227
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:58,910
basis which works really well,

228
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,379
but it can be very resource

229
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,660
intensive. It's reactive. You're building

230
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,678
relationships with sellers on each deal.

231
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:07,858
You're building relationships with customers on each

232
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:09,889
deal and pitching the value of your products

233
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,858
over and over again.

234
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,750
In this second phase we switch towards

235
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,829
intentionality. That's where you

236
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,149
start to really make deliberate decisions about

237
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,230
focus, which industries, which

238
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,309
customer segments, which teams

239
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:24,798
within AWS do you build long-term

240
00:08:24,798 --> 00:08:25,988
relationships with

241
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:28,850
so that you're creating repeatable motions

242
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:30,389
that will help you scale.

243
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,139
And finally that 3rd phase is a

244
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:35,139
business practice. When you really have

245
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,619
a practice with AWS,

246
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:39,340
that's when the magic happens. It means

247
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,739
you've built systematic repeatable

248
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:43,808
approaches, hopefully some AI

249
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:45,859
and automation inside

250
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,918
that practice.

251
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,854
You have clear metrics, dedicated

252
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:52,413
teams, and a long term customer

253
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:53,754
engagement flywheel,

254
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:56,215
and this makes each deal that you

255
00:08:56,215 --> 00:08:58,553
do less and less resource intensive

256
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:00,974
and really helps you go to market at

257
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,004
scale with many customers on the

258
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:03,614
same solution.

259
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:07,469
We don't expect you to get to this 3rd phase

260
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:08,178
overnight or in

261
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:12,070
every solution that you offer. Intentionality

262
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,479
really is the key here,

263
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,788
but I'm really excited to talk a

264
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,908
little bit more about two partner programs we

265
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:19,908
have that really help you

266
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:21,950
build this business practice and embark

267
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,729
on that long term journey with us.

268
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:26,649
So just this week we launched the brand

269
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,719
new Partner Greenfield Program

270
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:31,269
or PGP because we love acronyms

271
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:33,798
um so I'm gonna talk a little bit more about

272
00:09:33,798 --> 00:09:36,129
this program. It provides multi-year

273
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:38,288
investment to help you focus on new

274
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:40,489
customer acquisition and helping more

275
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,609
customers realize the value and benefits

276
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:43,308
of cloud.

277
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,099
We're also expanding our Small

278
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:48,129
Business acceleration initiative or

279
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,080
SBAI.

280
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,658
We debuted it here

281
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,678
at Reinvent last year and have seen incredible

282
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:55,798
results, engaging over 30,000

283
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:58,119
customers through this initiative this year

284
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,158
already. And so we're really looking

285
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:02,158
forward to expanding it globally next

286
00:10:02,158 --> 00:10:04,279
year. OK, so how do these

287
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,700
two programs work?

288
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:09,119
They both provide multi-year

289
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:10,899
investments with the partner

290
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,298
along with support, enablement,

291
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:16,629
packaged go to market solutions,

292
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:19,298
packaged marketing materials, and

293
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:21,320
other great information from

294
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,678
AWS that includes latest market

295
00:10:23,678 --> 00:10:25,779
research, customer trends that we're seeing,

296
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,399
engagements with. Sales leadership and marketing

297
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,440
leadership teams so you can ask questions and

298
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,418
understand how we're thinking about the space.

299
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,798
The difference in the programs is

300
00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:37,038
that the partner Greenfield program supports

301
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:39,038
you in engaging customers in the

302
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,639
mid-market and large enterprise size

303
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,389
segments,

304
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:45,139
whereas a small business acceleration initiative

305
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,399
understands that to reach small customers.

306
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:50,099
Takes a different type of go to market

307
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,139
approach and so we really partner with

308
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:54,178
you on what that scale effort

309
00:10:54,178 --> 00:10:56,469
looks like and actually the roles

310
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:58,649
within sales that you'll engage with

311
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:00,808
in these two motions are different roles,

312
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,979
compensation models, and the way that we

313
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:05,058
work with the partner and Rayhan's gonna

314
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:07,460
go into more depth on that later

315
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,058
as well.

316
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,678
So are you ready to

317
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:13,379
build a partner practice?

318
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:16,080
Let's talk about how to get ready for that

319
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,320
stage and how to think about whether you're there

320
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,359
yet. The first step is in the

321
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,798
build. Do you have a clearly defined scope

322
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:24,070
and target customer?

323
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,918
And again, where you wanna go deep with AWS

324
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:29,080
may not be all the places that you

325
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,178
can serve customers or can play

326
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,399
or do have targets, but rather really

327
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,504
thinking about what are. 32 to

328
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:37,673
3 areas to really go deep

329
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:38,594
and broad

330
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:40,354
together with AWS

331
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,134
and then next you have those well defined

332
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:45,183
solutions and capabilities.

333
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:47,634
Do you have a good training model for your team

334
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:49,774
and execution ability?

335
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:52,808
In the market and sell phase, we want

336
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:54,928
to think about whether you have a dedicated

337
00:11:54,928 --> 00:11:56,969
team that has clear success

338
00:11:56,969 --> 00:11:59,369
metrics aligned to those goals.

339
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:01,889
We have found that goaling is critical.

340
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:04,450
If your goals look similar to our goals and we're aligning

341
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,529
our teams collectively, we

342
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,649
really see that business take off.

343
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,798
So being intentional about who

344
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:13,288
and how you're staffing inside your own

345
00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:16,048
organization and then which teams inside of the Amazon

346
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:18,075
organization. You're engaging with can make a

347
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:18,955
big difference.

348
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:21,394
And the second piece to this is, do you have

349
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:23,835
a scalable demand generation

350
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:24,774
practice?

351
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:26,875
And that can look like events,

352
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:29,715
but are they one to many? Do you have digital

353
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,724
marketing campaigns? Do you have

354
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,884
websites? Do you have a prepackaged

355
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:36,274
so that you use repeatedly?

356
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:38,504
So really thinking about how you've

357
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:40,744
made your demand generation less ad hoc

358
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:41,894
and more repeatable.

359
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,519
And this last phase in grow is

360
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,918
whether you have a robust customer

361
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:48,139
success function.

362
00:12:48,558 --> 00:12:50,558
So do you have a managed service

363
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:52,619
or a partner led support offering

364
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,279
or other mechanisms where you

365
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,320
stay engaged in that customer

366
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,519
account and look for their success long

367
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,320
term and play that business advisory

368
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,298
role for your customers.

369
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:07,590
So let's go a little deeper

370
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,109
on each of these phases and talk about what AWS

371
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:12,109
offers for you to help build

372
00:13:12,109 --> 00:13:13,479
out that capability.

373
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:16,190
We're gonna start in the build phase, which is really

374
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,009
that foundation for your success.

375
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,469
So we touched on this for us that that

376
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:23,330
build phase looks like having technical capabilities,

377
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,269
a really clearly identified

378
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:28,590
target customer, and developing

379
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,330
the right solutions.

380
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:35,219
Some of the most common questions that we get

381
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,599
is how do we maximize our AWS

382
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,658
program benefits

383
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,200
and what I would advise is to work backwards

384
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,320
from the solutions that you're looking to build

385
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,440
and the customers you're looking to reach and

386
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,558
then identify relevant AWS

387
00:13:48,558 --> 00:13:50,178
programs that will help

388
00:13:50,678 --> 00:13:52,719
stitch together and help you go to market in

389
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:53,500
that space.

390
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,759
So rather than building from an

391
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,940
AWS funding program

392
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,158
outwards, I would think more about

393
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:01,418
who you're trying to engage.

394
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:04,384
How you want to engage them and then

395
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:06,404
identify AWS programs that you

396
00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:08,524
can stitch together to get the

397
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:09,585
support that you need

398
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:12,004
and that's why when you look across we have many

399
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:14,085
different AWSS partner programs sometimes you get feedback

400
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:16,085
that it's perhaps too many, but

401
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:18,205
the value in that is that they're building

402
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:20,404
blocks that you can use to stitch

403
00:14:20,404 --> 00:14:22,484
together that go to market that really

404
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:24,524
suits your company and your target market the

405
00:14:24,524 --> 00:14:26,625
best and partners who are very thoughtful

406
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,585
in how they do that

407
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:30,004
provide really positive feedback about

408
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:31,445
how these programs work together.

409
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,259
So just as one example, our ADS

410
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:36,889
Business Outcomes Accelerator or BO

411
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,009
program can help you identify

412
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:41,229
and match make between ISVs and

413
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:43,570
SIs that want to build a solution

414
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,649
in an industry,

415
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:46,168
and it will provide

416
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,830
credits and support, SA

417
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,489
support as well

418
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,869
for building out that solution, and then

419
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:54,149
market development funds for taking that

420
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:55,469
solution to market.

421
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,109
And if you're interested in serving small and

422
00:14:58,109 --> 00:15:00,229
medium businesses, we have an SMB

423
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:02,229
competency that can also bring

424
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:03,529
you into that community.

425
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,908
So again, you're looking at how if you start from what

426
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:08,259
you're looking to build and work backwards,

427
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:09,330
you'll find often

428
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:11,830
there is an AWS partner program that can

429
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,349
support you.

430
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,408
I did want to highlight a little bit more on that

431
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:17,489
SMB competency because it is

432
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:20,119
such a valuable program for scale,

433
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,950
which is what we were talking about today.

434
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,729
Within that S&B competency we provide

435
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:26,808
three huge benefit areas. The

436
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:28,519
first is go to market support,

437
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,308
provide market research,

438
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:31,529
industry insight,

439
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,969
customer trends that we see in our own

440
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:36,048
data, and joint marketing

441
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:37,840
campaigns and other resources.

442
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,830
We also have an SMB solution

443
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,830
community so you can talk to us and

444
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,070
other partners about what to build,

445
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:47,408
what trends we're seeing. You can get again

446
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:49,690
technical advice from our teams,

447
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,029
um, and we also have prepackaged

448
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:55,190
starter kits that can take some of that

449
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,330
build work out of your solutions,

450
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,710
um, so really enjoy

451
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,649
talking to all of our partners in the solution community.

452
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,210
We also provide expertise validation so

453
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,759
you do get this badge that you can showcase to your customers.

454
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:09,250
You get priority in our own AWS

455
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,298
sales and marketing initiatives,

456
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,369
including like on our website for

457
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:15,570
SMB customers. We do local

458
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,969
events where we bring our SMB sales leadership

459
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:20,190
and our partners together and do networking

460
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,303
and different. Events,

461
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,933
um, and we feature you in our own marketing

462
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,974
campaigns. So overall we've seen

463
00:16:25,974 --> 00:16:28,335
over the course of the last year and a half that

464
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:30,654
our partners in the S&B competency

465
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:33,254
grow their S&B business 35%

466
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:35,375
points more year over year

467
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:37,654
than similar partners who are not

468
00:16:37,654 --> 00:16:39,394
yet in that S&B competency.

469
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:41,854
And that's why I really wanted to stress that

470
00:16:41,854 --> 00:16:44,134
here with you today and see if that's something

471
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:46,455
that fits your business model to take advantage of.

472
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:49,440
We are really excited to lean in based on that

473
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,418
success and deliver more benefits in 2026,

474
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,918
so we're adding a go to market capability

475
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:57,178
assessment which would help you self assess

476
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,399
where you're at in that journey and especially in that

477
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,719
partner practice building that we talked about. So

478
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,750
really excited to debut that and then

479
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,890
you can build kind of a learning plan for yourself.

480
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,400
We're gonna offer more build workshops and

481
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,459
roundtables.

482
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,779
Um, we'll provide additional

483
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:14,299
market research and market development funding

484
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,400
for SMB competency partners as

485
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,858
well as a co-sell workshop,

486
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,239
and we're also adding an SMB

487
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,598
track at our partner equip local

488
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:24,880
events where again, as I mentioned, we'll bring local

489
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
SMB sellers in to meet with you.

490
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:29,410
We'll also have experts, technical and business,

491
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,219
um, come and present to you on our latest

492
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,959
information. OK,

493
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:37,239
so a few tools and resources I

494
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:39,279
wanted to highlight. There are many, but there's a few

495
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,348
that are really critical to this build stage I

496
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:43,608
wanted to make sure are on your radar.

497
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,989
The first is SkillBuilder. Um,

498
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,199
that's where you can see custom trainings. We

499
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:50,358
have all different great learning paths

500
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:52,439
for different role types that includes marketing

501
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,469
roles, selling roles,

502
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,709
um, as well as technical roles. So

503
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,259
if check out a SkillBuilder subscription. Um,

504
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:01,420
really excited. Just a couple weeks ago we launched new

505
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,818
managed services trainings into SkillBuilder

506
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:05,900
as well, um, so it's a great place

507
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,709
to see that all.

508
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,380
And we also have a partner analytics dashboard

509
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,479
where you can view the training certifications

510
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:13,500
of your team so you can keep track

511
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,739
of how your builders are growing and learning.

512
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,539
We also have the AWS marketplace and AI

513
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,539
agent marketplace where you can

514
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:22,900
find solutions that you can consume and

515
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,900
help you build your practice and your solutions

516
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,939
out. So maybe there's an ISV that has

517
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,939
built a component and you don't need to build from

518
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:30,779
scratch. You can leverage their solution

519
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:31,680
or an.

520
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:34,193
Built AI agent. In fact, this week we

521
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:36,265
announced 3 new agents

522
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:38,114
built by our professional services team,

523
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,555
one around migrations. I'm really excited about.

524
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,943
So take a look, and there's a lot of ways that can

525
00:18:42,943 --> 00:18:45,555
really speed up your development process by leveraging

526
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:46,174
existing

527
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:47,233
materials.

528
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:52,098
OK, so some key action items.

529
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,078
First is think about applying for innovation sandbox

530
00:18:55,078 --> 00:18:57,279
credits, especially if you're building a new solution.

531
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,719
I think this program sometimes gets overlooked.

532
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,380
So just a reminder to really

533
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:03,719
work backwards from what you're trying to do and

534
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:05,519
find the database programs that fit.

535
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,588
Um, Review, oops,

536
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,989
updated competency requirements.

537
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,489
Um, we also have industry competencies

538
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:14,769
if you're looking to double down on a particular

539
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:17,209
industry. Um, we've enhanced our AI

540
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:19,650
competency as well, so there's a

541
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,969
good suite of different competencies to pursue.

542
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,049
Be thoughtful,

543
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:25,568
but take a look at what these new competency

544
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:26,410
updates offer.

545
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,989
And you can schedule a solution architect

546
00:19:28,989 --> 00:19:29,818
review with our team,

547
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:32,318
um, or if you're in the S&B competency, we can do a

548
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:33,390
workshop with you.

549
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,759
So take advantage of these great

550
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,500
resources.

551
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:39,239
All right, I'm gonna hand it to Rayhan to talk a little bit more about

552
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:41,279
the market. All right, so the next phase

553
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,578
market, which is one of my personal favorite ones,

554
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,779
um, so as you think of market,

555
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,500
same, I want you to first look at the bottom.

556
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,259
Christine just talked about it, but I'm gonna drive it home.

557
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:53,568
Level the playing field for yourself.

558
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,709
Make sure you are leaning into the basic

559
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:58,750
foundational programs and competencies

560
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,348
that we have in the certifications.

561
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:03,029
These certifications then unlock special funding

562
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,650
for you

563
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:06,309
that gives you a chance to provide that incentive

564
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:08,019
to the customer, to your sellers.

565
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:09,949
You kind of even out the playing field.

566
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:12,519
The two big ones that we talked about today is

567
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:13,439
SBAI

568
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,709
and PGP.

569
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:17,279
If you're not signed up, sign up,

570
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,259
sign up,

571
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,880
get leaned in, take advantage of these two

572
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,259
programs that are big at scale.

573
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,618
Let me talk about the middle one a little bit more

574
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,900
and zoom in.

575
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,439
So in the middle this is the partner

576
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,699
tools and resources,

577
00:20:30,118 --> 00:20:32,779
um, so if you're looking at partner marketing central,

578
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:34,029
what that is,

579
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,479
what that means to you, that's a place where you can go

580
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,939
get co-branded marketing material

581
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:41,318
that AWS has already created for you.

582
00:20:41,598 --> 00:20:42,618
You just remove.

583
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,150
Put your customer's logo, your logo,

584
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:47,769
go to market with it, right? That's money and

585
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:49,769
research that we've put in that you're taking advantage of as

586
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:52,150
a marketing resource fully available to you.

587
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:53,848
The marketing development funds,

588
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,650
this is how you build your go to market.

589
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:58,719
Depending on what segment you're going after and what your focus

590
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:01,368
is, how you're accelerating those opportunities for your customers,

591
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:03,838
or how you're incentivizing your sellers to lean in better,

592
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,049
critical to lean in and get to know this.

593
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:08,608
And then lastly, of course, you know, we talked about the marketing

594
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:09,269
tools in general,

595
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,848
but just you, you really being the pro and the

596
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:13,880
expert and having a designated winner

597
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,049
on the team who understands how

598
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:18,130
to lean in and what these tools are and when

599
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,368
to use these marketing tools at the appropriate

600
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:22,380
time. OK, so let

601
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,739
me highlight a partner, right?

602
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:24,939
Uh, innovative,

603
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:26,959
um, and in this case

604
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:29,318
this is an exemplary job

605
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:31,880
in the market phase where innovative

606
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,299
has a 3 step phase approach

607
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:35,759
that's allowed them to scale

608
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:37,680
their initial customer outreach

609
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:39,059
along with retention.

610
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,420
And a proven marketing flywheel.

611
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:42,930
First

612
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,799
they meet the customers where the customers at. They

613
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,880
do that by attending industry seminars

614
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,828
and popular events and local events

615
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:52,410
so they know where the customer is present and what the customer

616
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,449
is focusing on and what the trends are,

617
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:56,848
right? So they've really done a very nice job of knowing

618
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,009
that local customer and market that they're going

619
00:21:59,009 --> 00:21:59,549
after.

620
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:00,789
The second is

621
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:03,509
after identifying the customer problem,

622
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:06,088
it's really the speed, how fast

623
00:22:06,088 --> 00:22:06,868
they move

624
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,449
in solving that problem and

625
00:22:09,449 --> 00:22:11,250
creating an outcome for that customer.

626
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:14,459
And doing it in a way where it's repeatable

627
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:15,618
and it's scalable

628
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,078
across a few 100,000 customers. In this

629
00:22:18,078 --> 00:22:20,199
case they leveraged, built

630
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,500
a tool called, uh,

631
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,199
Dursol IQ that's what Darrasol IQ

632
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:26,640
that you're seeing on there, which is built on Amazon

633
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,338
Bedrock,

634
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:28,858
and it was developed

635
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:29,979
basically

636
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,118
for them to go leverage their

637
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,279
past wins and use customer use

638
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:35,979
cases.

639
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:38,400
And they use that to accelerate

640
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,729
how fast they get statement works out to customers.

641
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,019
So in this case we are talking about.

642
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,489
What used to take them 2 weeks,

643
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:47,729
they took it down to 2 hours,

644
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:50,489
so just that reduction of almost 90%

645
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:51,848
in sales cycle time

646
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,170
means faster revenue for you and your

647
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,269
organization, right? And faster outcomes for this customer

648
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:56,809
as well.

649
00:22:57,189 --> 00:22:59,469
And then the third approach that they talk about is the 8

650
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:01,150
AWS competencies that they have,

651
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:02,939
which has helped them accelerate this.

652
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,489
So this is a good example

653
00:23:05,068 --> 00:23:07,189
for you to figure out as you expand your go to market

654
00:23:07,189 --> 00:23:08,568
and figure out how to lean in,

655
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:10,930
um, uh, you know, a partner Spotlight

656
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:12,608
who's made some sense out of this.

657
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:16,059
Call to action for this market face as you

658
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:16,640
think about

659
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,078
how you lean in. The first one is.

660
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:22,959
Evaluate what you already have as a marketing

661
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:25,709
program. And are you utilizing

662
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:27,709
all the resources that are available to you

663
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:28,759
from AWS

664
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,130
in the marketing

665
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,170
tools that are available to you that we talked about in the previous slide?

666
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:36,170
Second one is leverage partner central.

667
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:39,170
Make sure you know which

668
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,838
applicable funding program.

669
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,709
Applies to a specific opportunity that

670
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:45,809
improves your chances of actually helping

671
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:48,170
the customer and accelerating that opportunity

672
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:50,598
and creating an outcome for that customer as well.

673
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:51,650
That's super critical.

674
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,650
And then always just having a complete

675
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,009
eye over your

676
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:58,709
marketing plan and assess that what does that

677
00:23:58,709 --> 00:23:59,279
look like,

678
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,459
right? Keep assessing that as you're iterating,

679
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,868
especially in the day of Gen AI as you're building out your

680
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:05,229
plans fast and furious, right?

681
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,189
Um, and then lastly,

682
00:24:07,469 --> 00:24:09,630
it's that identify, build, and execute

683
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,568
a campaign,

684
00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:12,608
right, to support a co-marketing

685
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:14,670
opportunity. So whatever campaign that you're running.

686
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,449
Make sure you have a framework you follow it it's

687
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:19,650
wrapped around with all the funding programs with all the

688
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,689
content that's already available to you and how do you make

689
00:24:21,689 --> 00:24:23,930
that compelling enough for the customer to get you a better outreach.

690
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:26,868
So this is the next phase of it

691
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:29,689
which uh it's kind of where I sit I'm part of partner sales

692
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:31,729
so I get to live this on a daily basis so I can speak to

693
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:32,890
it a little bit more realistically.

694
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,140
Our cloud sales center.

695
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:37,880
Two perspectives.

696
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,199
One is it's obviously there for us to

697
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,529
create scale in our business,

698
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,000
but this is also the scale on for you as

699
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,469
well. If you do it right,

700
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,588
you partner up with Cloud Sales Center,

701
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,239
this helps you scale your business as well, and

702
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,358
Cloud Sales Center is a very significant

703
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,239
investment for us.

704
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:55,828
So if you look to the left, the two big pillars,

705
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,439
you know, it's the Greenfield customers that are

706
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,858
new to the cloud journey

707
00:25:00,358 --> 00:25:01,140
with AWS.

708
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,680
We refer to them as Greenfield, or it's the

709
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,578
small businesses that are still growing with us.

710
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,289
Um, and in those pillars in the middle

711
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:10,489
you kind of see how we, how we break down the sales

712
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:12,989
segments enterprise, mid-size,

713
00:25:13,449 --> 00:25:15,529
and small. Enterprise and, and mid

714
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:17,670
as you would expect, have an industry focus,

715
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:20,828
and within that we have three different types of roles

716
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:23,088
in the cloud sales center that you'll be

717
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,489
partnering with. The first one is the DemandGen

718
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:27,719
team. Straight up just very

719
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:29,799
simple like the way it says they're executing on a

720
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,750
demand gen plan, calling on customers,

721
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,439
setting up appointments, engaging the unengaged

722
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:36,239
customer. That's what their focus is.

723
00:25:36,848 --> 00:25:39,049
The second one is actually the seller cloud

724
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:41,130
sales rep is an account manager. It's an

725
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:41,949
inside account manager

726
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:44,529
that you partner up with that you co-sell

727
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:46,670
with in the field talking to customers.

728
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:49,358
And then the third one is the SBI

729
00:25:49,358 --> 00:25:50,969
initiative that we created last year.

730
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:53,449
Part of that was partner territory managers that sit

731
00:25:53,449 --> 00:25:54,750
down with you and build a plan

732
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:56,189
at the territory level

733
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,608
that you two then co-own as the customer,

734
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,868
you're the lead, and then you got the partner territory manager

735
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:03,729
hand in hand working with you. How do we make that territory

736
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,449
successful at a holistic level?

737
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,318
So what's your lean in look like

738
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:11,858
when you work with the cloud sales Center?

739
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:13,299
Straightforward.

740
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,259
But I think it's important to understand these

741
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:17,799
three intersects are ways for you

742
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,338
to earn the trust of that cloud sales

743
00:26:20,338 --> 00:26:21,449
center seller

744
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:23,209
and scale your business through them.

745
00:26:23,578 --> 00:26:24,759
So that first one is

746
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,259
MAP, our, um, most

747
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:29,779
popular migration assistance acceleration

748
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:31,900
program, understanding what MP is, how

749
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,680
it's applicable

750
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:35,219
at the opportunity level and how you leverage

751
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,640
that for the customer

752
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:38,338
at that opportunity level.

753
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,209
And then how you intersect and partner up very

754
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:43,209
closely with CSC as you're

755
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:44,348
going through that phase.

756
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:46,108
The second one is

757
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:48,809
Just knowing all the, you know, uh, whether it's

758
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,949
Gen AI and you're leveraging rapid funding

759
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:53,449
or you're working with Gen AI Innovation Center and you have

760
00:26:53,449 --> 00:26:55,719
access to some other funding for POC to get activated,

761
00:26:56,009 --> 00:26:57,630
but how do you align that with your framework

762
00:26:58,088 --> 00:27:00,088
to accelerate and scale as many

763
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:02,269
possible POCs, obviously rationalizing

764
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:03,108
the ones that make sense

765
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:04,900
that create outcomes for the customer,

766
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:07,568
but it's a way for you to build a profitable business

767
00:27:07,568 --> 00:27:09,890
around POCs that then land in consumable

768
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,640
workloads.

769
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:13,088
And then lastly we talked about this a little

770
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:13,809
bit today, but.

771
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,920
Uh, partner greenfield program

772
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,529
new, we're super excited.

773
00:27:17,818 --> 00:27:18,699
When's it going live?

774
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:21,088
It's live, live, yay.

775
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:23,459
Everyone can sign up. Everyone can sign up,

776
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,118
yep, so take advantage of that, please.

777
00:27:25,618 --> 00:27:28,380
Um, so let's draw some parallels and some comparisons.

778
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:30,979
We talked about the Partner Greenfield

779
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:33,759
Program, PGP and SBIA.

780
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:36,289
And you can see them both up on screen, right?

781
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:37,400
Very similar,

782
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,719
uh, the core purpose is to help

783
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:41,900
you build a business that's profitable and

784
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,848
help you scale your business with us, right?

785
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,219
So in the two frameworks,

786
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:47,979
PGP is a fit for mid-enterprises

787
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:50,019
and large enterprise businesses that you sell

788
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:50,900
and co-sell with.

789
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:53,939
Um, and I, I'll use the word co-selling because it's truly

790
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:56,140
just that you co-selling whether it's with the field sales

791
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,489
or cloud sales center teams,

792
00:27:57,769 --> 00:27:59,880
but that's what that is to the left pillar, and you can see

793
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,989
the intersect is at the cell

794
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,539
that, that bottom flywheel is where you'll

795
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:05,358
be working with

796
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,779
the AWS sellers whether in the field or in CL

797
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:09,199
or in CSC.

798
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:12,739
The second on to the right is SBIA.

799
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,640
It's very similar again for you to make the business profitable,

800
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,949
but as we talked about, this is where you take the lead. You

801
00:28:17,949 --> 00:28:20,078
work with the partner territory manager and you're

802
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:22,818
aligned at that level, owning a sales territory,

803
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,858
you know, the planning of the territory itself,

804
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,318
the tools that you need, joint marketing,

805
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,019
and then just doing events together

806
00:28:29,358 --> 00:28:31,439
to scale across a few customers. But ways

807
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:32,140
for you to make money,

808
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,000
two programs for you to lean into,

809
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:35,618
similar yet a little different,

810
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:38,130
and Christine and I will be here at the end to answer

811
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,400
questions for you if we've missed anything.

812
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:41,949
OK, so

813
00:28:43,118 --> 00:28:45,118
Partner tools and resources that

814
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:47,309
I want to call out for you that I think are

815
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,420
super important. Nothing

816
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,250
happens if you don't use AC.

817
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,959
If you're not the pro at AC pipeline, it

818
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:58,078
does not exist for us. We don't see the

819
00:28:58,078 --> 00:29:00,160
opportunity. You're not generating pipeline even though

820
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,180
you may have a pipeline,

821
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:02,989
but we don't have visibility into it.

822
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:04,779
So think of that as like

823
00:29:05,318 --> 00:29:07,729
the holy grail. That's where the relationship starts.

824
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,969
That's where the go to market gets activated

825
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,618
must lean in and unlock that motion

826
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:13,318
super important.

827
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,959
The partner analytics dashboard I personally

828
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:18,029
like that's a way for you to look at your overall business,

829
00:29:18,118 --> 00:29:20,318
figure out where you have some stalled opportunity, what's

830
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:22,358
the pipeline, what's coming in from AWS, what are

831
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:23,390
you sending back out,

832
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:24,900
what needs hygiene,

833
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:27,739
so it's a good place to look at daily and be very rigorous

834
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
and bring that operational excellence that you need to

835
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,420
be successful with us.

836
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,838
And then lastly,

837
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,719
um, AWS Marketplace.

838
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:38,430
We're leaning on you as a partner to help us

839
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:41,130
help with customers see the value in transacting

840
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,239
through marketplace, whether it's a green field

841
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,289
customer an engaged customer, small, medium,

842
00:29:45,328 --> 00:29:46,709
large, become

843
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,779
that expert for AWS Marketplace,

844
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,328
be that champion that advocates for

845
00:29:52,328 --> 00:29:54,390
transacting through marketplace at scale

846
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:56,789
with your customers across all industries

847
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:58,029
across all sizes.

848
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:01,068
All right, another spotlight.

849
00:30:01,949 --> 00:30:04,009
So let's talk about predictive

850
00:30:04,709 --> 00:30:07,410
um exemplifies selling excellence,

851
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,858
um, knowing they want to reach customers

852
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:10,920
with unique needs.

853
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:12,150
Predictive

854
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:14,630
partnered with University of Alaska's Small

855
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,150
Business Development Center to kick off the competition

856
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,309
pitch series.

857
00:30:18,588 --> 00:30:20,858
The idea was to give local entrepreneurs the

858
00:30:20,858 --> 00:30:23,430
opportunity. To modernize

859
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:25,709
their businesses through AI,

860
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,410
participants joined from commu communities across

861
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,309
Alaska

862
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,719
with ideas like better connect rural

863
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:34,348
communities, making the wilderness safer.

864
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,910
Um, the winner,

865
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:37,068
Arneto

866
00:30:37,328 --> 00:30:39,618
is the region's first AI startup

867
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,170
that helps tribal communities find resources

868
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:42,910
and events

869
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:45,049
through a shared community calendar.

870
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:47,779
And this didn't just stop in Alaska, by the

871
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,039
way. The team created a repeatable model

872
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:52,338
that was then scaled and supported across

873
00:30:52,338 --> 00:30:53,519
emerging businesses

874
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,618
while enabling them to adopt ADWS technologies.

875
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,199
Each winner in this case

876
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,598
receives 25 to 50K

877
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:03,598
um in AWS Pro Serve services

878
00:31:03,598 --> 00:31:06,160
plus mentorship directly from Predictive.

879
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,400
So the team has been very successful,

880
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:10,890
um, through this series and has now expanded

881
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,289
nationwide embodying not only CSE

882
00:31:12,818 --> 00:31:14,848
but also co-growth as a partner with

883
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:17,328
us. OK.

884
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:20,279
So let's talk about a little bit of

885
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,199
where in the sell phase

886
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:24,150
you should think about leaning in.

887
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:25,650
So the first thing is

888
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,500
as you decide where you lean in with your go to market.

889
00:31:29,229 --> 00:31:31,930
Across CSC get yourself oriented.

890
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:33,479
Is it SBIA?

891
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:34,779
Is it PGP?

892
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:37,068
Is it the small business that I'm gonna work with our

893
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:38,640
mid or large enterprise?

894
00:31:39,108 --> 00:31:41,229
Get acquainted with those teams, get aligned with those

895
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:42,900
teams, build relationship,

896
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,729
start your engines and

897
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:46,170
start co-selling,

898
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:48,289
and it all starts with Ace.

899
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:50,328
If Ace is not configured, not working,

900
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,868
it's not activated, so that I would say that should

901
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:54,900
be almost first but front center for

902
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,670
you to keep in mind.

903
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,598
And then align that of course with your business model

904
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:01,039
as well, right? So your target audience

905
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,098
who that you're going after,

906
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:04,880
what customer segment, what industry that aligns

907
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,078
with based on that you build your alignment

908
00:32:07,078 --> 00:32:09,559
with CSC within that specific segment.

909
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,630
And then lastly just review partner central,

910
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:14,199
right, um,

911
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:17,250
meaning as you work on co-sale opportunities

912
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,509
you make sure that you're always leveraging the best

913
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:21,489
possible funding program that's out there

914
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,910
for you to accelerate that outcome

915
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,608
for the customer on that specific migration

916
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:27,519
opportunity you're working on

917
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,029
really important to understand that.

918
00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:32,640
OK Thank

919
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,239
you.

920
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,719
So great best practices and I always love

921
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,799
hearing those partner stories because it really makes it

922
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,000
real that there are partners leveraging these

923
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,559
programs and

924
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,459
helps show where their success.

925
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:45,269
So I want to close with that growth phase.

926
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:47,828
Now that we talked about selling, how do we

927
00:32:47,828 --> 00:32:49,989
make that repeatable and also remember

928
00:32:49,989 --> 00:32:52,309
that your best way to sell is really

929
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:54,469
to engage with customers you've already worked

930
00:32:54,469 --> 00:32:56,469
with. It's going to be a lower cost

931
00:32:56,469 --> 00:32:58,559
to engage with them and also that's where we start to

932
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,509
see larger and larger deal sizes,

933
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:03,150
longer term engagements, more advanced

934
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:03,828
workloads.

935
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:06,309
So this is a really important phase of

936
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:07,890
working with AWS.

937
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,660
A Few key programs and

938
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,739
incentives that we'll highlight here

939
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:17,098
in the foundational program sense

940
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:19,219
there's two key ones you can be

941
00:33:19,219 --> 00:33:22,059
an authorized reseller with AWS.

942
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,539
There's two ways to do that.

943
00:33:23,858 --> 00:33:25,900
You can become a solution provider in your

944
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,009
own right, or I really encourage you

945
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:30,358
to consider working with a distributor partner

946
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,848
who can help you with the operational overhead

947
00:33:32,848 --> 00:33:35,140
of reselling as well as help you

948
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,453
learn across that journey. Journey, learn new AWS

949
00:33:37,453 --> 00:33:39,654
programs, introduce you to the right AWS

950
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:42,035
teams, and really support you in that growth,

951
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:44,515
um, and so that enables you to take on

952
00:33:44,654 --> 00:33:47,015
the billing and the transaction for your customers

953
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:47,634
and certainly

954
00:33:48,015 --> 00:33:50,614
starts that long term relationship. Another

955
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:52,733
great way to build that long term relationship is through a

956
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:54,775
managed services contract and so we have

957
00:33:54,775 --> 00:33:56,854
a managed services provider program. I'm

958
00:33:56,854 --> 00:33:58,275
gonna talk a little bit more

959
00:33:58,614 --> 00:34:01,334
about there. That's what I would consider a foundation.

960
00:34:01,828 --> 00:34:03,949
Then we have growth accelerators. This is

961
00:34:03,949 --> 00:34:06,130
where competencies can help you

962
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:08,789
prove your expertise and also develop and stay on

963
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:10,929
top of the latest trends in different

964
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:13,219
industries, customer segments.

965
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,550
Um, if you are interested to add a

966
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,829
new service or new solution offering

967
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:20,070
to your portfolio, pursuing an additional

968
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,228
competency is a great learning path and

969
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:23,369
way for you to do that.

970
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:25,750
So it really helps you keep your team fresh

971
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,155
on what's the latest and how to bring. That back

972
00:34:28,385 --> 00:34:30,235
to your install customer base.

973
00:34:30,574 --> 00:34:32,635
We also have partner led support

974
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:34,773
which I'm gonna dive a little bit more into

975
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,813
another great way to stay involved in

976
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:38,353
that customer account

977
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:41,175
and we offer some really cool tools, especially

978
00:34:41,175 --> 00:34:43,175
through our AWS Marketplace console

979
00:34:43,175 --> 00:34:45,333
and vendor insights platform where

980
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,534
you can see a little bit more about what that next

981
00:34:47,534 --> 00:34:49,833
best sale to your existing customer base

982
00:34:50,094 --> 00:34:52,715
might be based on AWS predictions.

983
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,599
In the strategic benefits section as we spoke

984
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,099
about SBAI and PGP both offer

985
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:00,260
market research trends and

986
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,340
things like that that will help you stay involved with

987
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,820
those customer accounts.

988
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,969
So I'll talk

989
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:10,728
about what's new next year

990
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:13,188
um we did evolve our

991
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:15,849
channel partner and resell experience

992
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:17,909
super thrilled about some of the changes we're

993
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:19,688
making to help our partners

994
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:22,369
work with new customers for the first time

995
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:24,750
as well as incentives to grow

996
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,070
customer accounts and to grow your overall

997
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,378
portfolio. Portfolio on AWS,

998
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,780
um, so really thrilled about that we've

999
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,869
also simplified the

1000
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:34,918
program because we know

1001
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:37,300
that complexity is the enemy of speed so

1002
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,599
we're really looking at how do we streamline,

1003
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:41,978
make it easy and predictable for

1004
00:35:41,978 --> 00:35:44,179
you, and that way it enables

1005
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:46,659
you to build packaged go to market offerings

1006
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:48,878
to move faster with your customers.

1007
00:35:50,378 --> 00:35:52,739
We also launched a new benefit for

1008
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:55,219
managed service providers through the MSP

1009
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,300
program. So already we have

1010
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,418
a badge that goes when you go through our

1011
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:01,500
third party validation you receive it

1012
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,978
showcases that you're a next gen MSP

1013
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:04,780
in our eyes.

1014
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,300
We provide incremental go to market

1015
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,320
funding. As I mentioned, we launched

1016
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,360
a new skill builder training to help you and your

1017
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,969
teams.

1018
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,719
We've streamlined that application

1019
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,719
process and now we've actually

1020
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,800
introduced a financial incentive

1021
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,340
that's a percentage of the revenue under

1022
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,148
your management new for 2026.

1023
00:36:24,398 --> 00:36:26,719
We're also building out an ROI

1024
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,750
tool so for those of you who haven't

1025
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,800
yet developed an MSP practice and you're

1026
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,000
thinking about it, this tool can help you think

1027
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,059
about what investments to make

1028
00:36:35,188 --> 00:36:37,030
and what that ROI could look like.

1029
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:39,898
Overall we're seeing in our AWS data

1030
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,978
that MSPs who are validated

1031
00:36:41,978 --> 00:36:44,539
through our program see 29%

1032
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:46,199
longer customer retention

1033
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,648
than similar partners who are not in our program,

1034
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,019
so really consider leaning in here.

1035
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:54,688
I did want to touch on partner led support

1036
00:36:54,688 --> 00:36:56,929
again. This is another one that I think gets overlooked

1037
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:59,010
sometimes, but it's a great way to stay

1038
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,010
involved in that customer account whether

1039
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,050
it's a large enterprise or a small

1040
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,570
business. They all need support with their AWS

1041
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,849
offerings, and a partner led

1042
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:09,668
model really helps you

1043
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,489
stay close to that customer, but then also leverage

1044
00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:14,489
our AWS expertise

1045
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:15,688
and um.

1046
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:18,139
And do custom training and workshops with

1047
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:20,139
us you can lean on our support teams for

1048
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:22,139
escalation support. You also

1049
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,539
get assigned an AWS technical account

1050
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:25,119
manager.

1051
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,179
Um, and you have access to our AWS

1052
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,340
support diagnostic tools and

1053
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:30,918
training,

1054
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,860
so we see that partners who leverage partner-led

1055
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,418
support on average see 2 times faster

1056
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:37,260
customer growth.

1057
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:39,619
I'm really excited about that program. We've also

1058
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:41,789
streamlined the partner-led support offerings,

1059
00:37:41,978 --> 00:37:44,360
um, to make them simpler and more predictable

1060
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:45,619
for 2026.

1061
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:48,878
OK, so true to form, a couple key

1062
00:37:48,878 --> 00:37:50,958
tools and resources that we wanted

1063
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:51,780
to touch on

1064
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,739
partner matching engine.

1065
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:56,280
So as you get those competencies and

1066
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,719
build out your expertise

1067
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,159
internally at AWS we've launched

1068
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,519
this AI powered matching engine

1069
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,789
that uses your competencies and

1070
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:06,800
your past work with AWS

1071
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
to match make you to customers and

1072
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,878
surface your profile to our AWS

1073
00:38:10,878 --> 00:38:11,579
sellers.

1074
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,139
So a great way to get surfaced more to

1075
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:16,289
our sales teams is to record your

1076
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:18,378
deals in Ace as Rahan mentioned

1077
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:20,840
and also to build out your expertise

1078
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:23,619
with those competencies with things like the MSP

1079
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:25,769
program that will really help highlight

1080
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:27,389
your capabilities with us.

1081
00:38:27,898 --> 00:38:30,059
SkillBuilder comes into play here as well

1082
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,340
because you need to be always developing that next

1083
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,438
set of skills. So

1084
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,820
coming back around, this is a great place

1085
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,079
to go back to learn more.

1086
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:39,989
And within that AceC pipeline manager

1087
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:42,090
we have opportunity reporting

1088
00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:44,349
that can help showcase to you how you're

1089
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:46,389
showing up in the partner matching engine, so

1090
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:48,469
where are you're being most recommended and not

1091
00:38:48,469 --> 00:38:50,628
as much recommended, um, it can help

1092
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,168
show you your strengths by

1093
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,289
industry, by customer segment, by AWS

1094
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:57,389
definition. Right, because I know that everyone

1095
00:38:57,389 --> 00:39:00,199
here has a different definition of what SMB

1096
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:02,449
looks like and so if you wanna see

1097
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,949
how you're perceived by our AWS

1098
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:07,070
systems, all of that reporting is visible

1099
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,188
to you through Partner Central, our

1100
00:39:09,188 --> 00:39:11,349
AC pipeline opportunity reporting

1101
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,648
so really encourage you to leverage those tools.

1102
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:16,789
So one more partner spotlight I'm thrilled to

1103
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:19,168
share is a flagship partners Soft Choice.

1104
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:21,429
They've really been on this Greenfield customer

1105
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,329
acquisition journey with us,

1106
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,949
and a couple of initiatives that they've implemented

1107
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:28,070
and seen great success is that

1108
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,110
they've leveraged the AWS customer

1109
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,250
engagement incentive or CEI funding

1110
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,668
to create a flywheel of customer

1111
00:39:34,668 --> 00:39:35,789
engagement on their own.

1112
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:38,239
They gave new accounts a credit

1113
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:38,969
towards their

1114
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,188
soft Choice AWS professional services

1115
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,760
which helped customers get started

1116
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,840
quickly and accelerate their onboarding into the

1117
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,000
platform and then newly leveraged our

1118
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,500
POC and map programs to quickly

1119
00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:53,800
grow and move those customer workloads

1120
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,059
onto AWS.

1121
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,760
They also launched a cloud life cycle

1122
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,769
Services plus program that

1123
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:01,958
provides enterprise level managed services

1124
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:04,329
down to even mid-market and small customers

1125
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:06,030
at business support prices.

1126
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,728
By expanding their managed services footprint,

1127
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,168
this allowed Soft Choice to get to know their

1128
00:40:11,168 --> 00:40:13,168
customers more intimately and spend

1129
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:15,688
more time with each of those accounts. Building

1130
00:40:15,688 --> 00:40:18,050
more automation into that platform means

1131
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,168
that their internal team can spend their

1132
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,289
time talking to the customer and understanding

1133
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,688
what that next priority is and

1134
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,668
stay on top of helping that customer grow.

1135
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,599
So these risks of investing ahead

1136
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,679
of customer growth have really paid off for

1137
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,219
SoftChoice,

1138
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:35,119
and that's contributed to their over 50%

1139
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,059
annual growth rate with AWS.

1140
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:39,550
So big congratulations and thanks for

1141
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,579
being here today.

1142
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,039
Or a few grow action items to leave

1143
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:46,159
you with. So something to consider is scheduling a

1144
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,579
QBR with AWS.

1145
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:50,039
Again, a great way to do this is to get involved with one

1146
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:50,958
of our programs.

1147
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,099
Most competencies will offer you

1148
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,800
access to that team for a QBR. Our

1149
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,878
SPY and PGP programs certainly do, or

1150
00:40:57,878 --> 00:40:59,219
you can work with a PDM

1151
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:01,840
to do so. But a, a regular business cadence

1152
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,019
helps you stay aligned and understand

1153
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:06,239
what are the learnings from the past quarter and how to

1154
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,378
think about growth for future

1155
00:41:08,378 --> 00:41:09,059
quarters.

1156
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:11,869
The second is going back to what I mentioned in the beginning around

1157
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,110
growth metrics and KPIs. We really

1158
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,610
deeply at AWS believe in goaling and KPIs

1159
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,668
to say what's our North Star? What does good

1160
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:20,708
look like? Where are we trying to get to, because

1161
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,800
that helps everyone in our organization

1162
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,909
problem solve along the way and stay

1163
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:26,510
aligned with moving towards the vision.

1164
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,219
And build a one team business plan.

1165
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,860
Make sure you do have a documented AWS

1166
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,599
growth plan that you can share

1167
00:41:33,898 --> 00:41:36,398
with all those stakeholders that you work with internally

1168
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:38,739
and also use to guide yourself and your

1169
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:39,378
practice.

1170
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:41,820
This is also where, as I mentioned, you can start to

1171
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,059
become intentional about how you're leverage.

1172
00:41:43,445 --> 00:41:45,695
Different funding programs together to

1173
00:41:45,695 --> 00:41:48,175
really contribute to a holistic business

1174
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:50,175
growth and this is something that will help

1175
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:52,195
you also get more attention

1176
00:41:52,195 --> 00:41:54,655
and and more alignment within AWS if we

1177
00:41:54,655 --> 00:41:55,994
understand where you're trying to grow

1178
00:41:56,293 --> 00:41:58,375
we can advise you better on how to work with

1179
00:41:58,375 --> 00:41:59,215
us to do that.

1180
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,539
So closing, I want to come to a few

1181
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:04,708
key next steps,

1182
00:42:04,978 --> 00:42:07,260
and I'll bring it to Reihan to take us home. All

1183
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,340
right, so now that, thank

1184
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,340
you Christine, I appreciate it, as you've seen

1185
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,438
now on the partnership maturity journey

1186
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,019
and you know the models that we talked about, right, the four

1187
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:18,510
different steps which is the build, market,

1188
00:42:18,898 --> 00:42:20,280
sell, and growth.

1189
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:21,809
And

1190
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,958
the intentionality really matters.

1191
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:27,179
I know some of us could be sitting at the opportunity

1192
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:29,349
phase which is OK, you need a starting point

1193
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:29,929
somewhere,

1194
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:32,389
but I think it's just as important to move fast

1195
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:34,668
from that to being intentional and building a business

1196
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:35,369
practice

1197
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:38,030
and taking a call to action, really important to

1198
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,110
understand that and know that and get in front of it.

1199
00:42:41,168 --> 00:42:43,090
So as you think about that.

1200
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,869
I'll let you read this on the screen for a minute and

1201
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:48,110
reflect on it, but this is,

1202
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,590
are you ready for this business practice,

1203
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:52,250
right? So think of the four phases

1204
00:42:52,789 --> 00:42:54,289
in your build, market,

1205
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:56,739
sell. And when you think of the

1206
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:58,820
defined scope and customer target that

1207
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,800
you're going after.

1208
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,119
Do you have a clear customer identified

1209
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,539
that you wanna go after

1210
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:06,199
and build a go to market?

1211
00:43:07,369 --> 00:43:09,409
Have you mapped out solutions

1212
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:11,610
for that very specific customer segment

1213
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,750
that you're targeting, right? Important to do

1214
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,878
so. And then as you think

1215
00:43:15,878 --> 00:43:16,898
about defined

1216
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:19,458
solutions and capabilities in the build phase.

1217
00:43:21,418 --> 00:43:23,610
Have your solutions been validated by

1218
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:26,050
AWS technical programs and

1219
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,559
teams? Right,

1220
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:31,188
um, and these dedicated teams.

1221
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:33,418
With Success Matrix,

1222
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:35,648
have you aligned your team structure

1223
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:37,789
and your co-cell motion?

1224
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,519
Do you have clear KPIs that

1225
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,418
then build on that motion for you?

1226
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:47,059
And as you think about the demand gen that

1227
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,340
scales your business,

1228
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,340
Have you mapped out a programmatic strategy

1229
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,280
that scales?

1230
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,250
Do you have a pipeline process

1231
00:43:55,789 --> 00:43:57,978
that goes across multiple tools and leverages

1232
00:43:57,978 --> 00:43:59,110
automation as well

1233
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:00,688
so you do that at scale.

1234
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:03,628
And then when you think of your customer success function,

1235
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:05,449
right? um.

1236
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:08,708
Do you have the customer life cycle

1237
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,070
mapped out

1238
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:11,349
and your approach

1239
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:13,728
for that life cycle, what that looks like?

1240
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:15,929
And have you

1241
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:18,449
planned initial wins and long

1242
00:44:18,449 --> 00:44:20,590
term success when you think of this growth phase,

1243
00:44:20,969 --> 00:44:22,269
right, some questions for you to consider

1244
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,769
and really as you're building your go to market, building your business

1245
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:25,728
plan as you're executing,

1246
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,769
have this front center sitting in front of you, right?

1247
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:32,059
OK So what to do next

1248
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,019
that's critical.

1249
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,019
What's, uh,

1250
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:35,579
should I go to you at this point?

1251
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,539
Sure, sorry, I'm taking over your person.

1252
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,840
That's all right. That's OK. We're on

1253
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,739
the same page here.

1254
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,719
Before you leave today, we have 3 action items for you.

1255
00:44:44,438 --> 00:44:46,519
First is think about that build market

1256
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,570
sell grow pillars and choose one

1257
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,519
program from each that you're gonna lean into.

1258
00:44:50,878 --> 00:44:53,030
What are you doing to do the next build?

1259
00:44:53,438 --> 00:44:55,378
How are you scaling your market?

1260
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,590
How are you co-selling with AWS?

1261
00:44:57,878 --> 00:45:00,398
And how are you being intentional about

1262
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:02,840
growth within your customer install base?

1263
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,489
Second is. Assess where you think you

1264
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:07,500
are in that partnership

1265
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,688
maturity model.

1266
00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:11,668
Are you opportunistic? Are you intentional?

1267
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,099
Or do you have a true long term focused

1268
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:16,519
business practice with AWS?

1269
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:19,378
And then the third is, please share this framework

1270
00:45:19,378 --> 00:45:20,260
with your team.

1271
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,579
All this talk will be posted online in just a

1272
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:23,360
couple of days,

1273
00:45:23,739 --> 00:45:25,840
um. We'll be off to the side for any questions you

1274
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,878
wanna ask us as well, but

1275
00:45:27,878 --> 00:45:30,079
share the word and think about it internally. How

1276
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,659
do you aligning within your company

1277
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,320
to make the most out of your AWS

1278
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,360
partnership? So we've given

1279
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,360
you a blueprint and you have everything you need

1280
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,458
to be successful. The big question

1281
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:41,978
is

1282
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,179
what will you build next?

1283
