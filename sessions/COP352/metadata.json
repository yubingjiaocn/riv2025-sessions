  "title_cn": "AWS re:Invent 2025 - 从被动响应到主动预防：基于设计的基础设施治理 (COP352)",
  "abstract": "Many organizations struggle to maintain consistent security controls across their cloud infrastructure as they scale, often discovering compliance violations only after resources are deployed. This reactive approach leads to security gaps, compliance issues, and costly remediation efforts. This code talk will discuss security best practices using AWS CloudFormation Hooks and AWS CloudFormation Guard, demonstrating how to prevent non-compliant infrastructure deployments before they occur. You will learn how to write CloudFormation Guard domain-specific language (DSL) rules for static template validation and integrate them with CloudFormation Hooks, including managed hooks, to enforce security standards proactively across your organization.",
  "abstract_cn": "许多组织在扩展其云基础设施时难以维护一致的安全控制，往往只有在资源部署后才发现合规性违规。这种被动的方法会导致安全漏洞、合规性问题和高昂的补救成本。本次代码讲座将讨论使用 AWS CloudFormation Hooks 和 AWS CloudFormation Guard 的安全最佳实践，演示如何在非合规基础设施部署之前进行预防。您将学习如何编写 CloudFormation Guard 领域特定语言 (DSL) 规则以进行静态模板验证，并将其与 CloudFormation Hooks（包括托管钩子）集成，从而在整个组织中主动实施安全标准。",
