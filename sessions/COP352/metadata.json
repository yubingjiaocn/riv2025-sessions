  "title_cn": "AWS re:Invent 2025 - 从被动到主动：基础设施治理的设计理念 (COP352)",
  "abstract": "Many organizations struggle to maintain consistent security controls across their cloud infrastructure as they scale, often discovering compliance violations only after resources are deployed. This reactive approach leads to security gaps, compliance issues, and costly remediation efforts. This code talk will discuss security best practices using AWS CloudFormation Hooks and AWS CloudFormation Guard, demonstrating how to prevent non-compliant infrastructure deployments before they occur. You will learn how to write CloudFormation Guard domain-specific language (DSL) rules for static template validation and integrate them with CloudFormation Hooks, including managed hooks, to enforce security standards proactively across your organization.",
  "abstract_cn": "许多组织在扩展云基础设施时难以维持一致的安全控制，往往只有在资源部署后才发现合规违规问题。这种被动方式导致安全漏洞、合规问题和昂贵的修复工作。本代码讲座将讨论使用AWS CloudFormation Hooks和AWS CloudFormation Guard的安全最佳实践，演示如何在不合规的基础设施部署发生之前进行预防。您将学习如何编写CloudFormation Guard领域特定语言(DSL)规则进行静态模板验证，并将其与CloudFormation Hooks（包括托管钩子）集成，在整个组织中主动执行安全标准。",
