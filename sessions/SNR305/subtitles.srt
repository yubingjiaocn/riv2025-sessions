1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,493
- Good morning.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,850
Welcome to your first session

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,240
of 2025 re:Invent

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,780
and the first senior leaders track session

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,583
at re:Invent ever.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,690
So it is 9:00 AM, Monday
morning in Las Vegas.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,006
You must really, really love AI strategy.

8
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:26,220
(group laughing)

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,220
So let's get started. My
name is Helena Yin Koeppl.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,883
I am executive in residence for AWS.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,140
So I'm a member of a small group

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,140
of ex-senior leaders who had run

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,170
and led transformation in our past life

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,000
as AWS customers.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,263
Now we join AWS to share
experiences with people like you.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,853
As for myself before joining a... Oh.

17
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,730
Before joining now I hear it.

18
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,730
Before joining AWS last
year, I led 26 years of data

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,640
and AI transformation at
four Fortune 500 companies

20
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,300
in global roles.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,890
So today's session, a lot
came from my own experiences,

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,250
but also my past two years
of talking to hundred

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,163
of customers on their AI journey.

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,060
So how much have happened
in the past three years?

25
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:38,490
We have gone through from
generative AI assistance

26
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,100
to generative AI agents

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,460
and now agentic AI systems.

28
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,460
And as any technology revolution,

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,030
we are foreseeing multiplication
of productivity gains.

30
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,030
So as you can see from
steam engine to electricity,

31
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,290
to moving to the cloud

32
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,070
and the multiplicator is
getting bigger and bigger

33
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,360
and the time it takes

34
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,733
to get there is getting
shorter and shorter.

35
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,190
What about AI?

36
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,940
How much do we see
productivity gains should be

37
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,130
and how long does it take?

38
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,710
And we do hope it can be hundred folds

39
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,740
and it can take the shortest of time.

40
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,740
Because generative AI and
agentic AI should unleash many,

41
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,430
many productivity, huge bottlenecks.

42
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,090
For example, these are the
five productivity bottlenecks

43
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,213
the agentic era should finally unleash.

44
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,833
Number one, unstructured knowledge.

45
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,760
We have gone through
many, many eras of sorting

46
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,560
through data, labeling them,

47
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,570
a lot of them are structured data.

48
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,740
And finally we have
unstructured data in PDF files,

49
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,740
in emails and critical
know-hows in PDFs and people.

50
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,660
Answers vary by who you ask

51
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,660
and all of this now can have
a single sighted front door

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,040
via agentic AI.

53
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,150
To getting through that
institutional knowledge

54
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,983
and reduce time to expedite
and narrow compliance risk.

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,283
As an example, one of the
AWS customers Moody's,

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,970
it is a risk rating agency

57
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,210
and it takes a lot of time to actually run

58
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,470
through the analysis

59
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,493
and huge amount of documents
to analyze risk rating.

60
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,040
What we help was to build a POC with them

61
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,040
and reducing basically using
multi-agent workflow to reduce

62
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,670
that risk assessment analysis
from one week to one hour.

63
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,830
Let's calculate the
productivity gain here.

64
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,150
Number two, we know with agentic AI,

65
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,120
one of the key things it can unleash

66
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,970
and what we have been
talking about for years

67
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,820
and years was basically that segment

68
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,890
of one customer journey.

69
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,724
So we've been talking
about personalization,

70
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:26,070
we've been talking about
tracking true customer's

71
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,560
preferences across platforms

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,210
and finally with agentic
AI's ability of acting

73
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,373
and we are able to do so.

74
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,810
As an example, anybody here
who is not a Rufus user?

75
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,493
Very few, almost none, a few.

76
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,403
Rufus is one of the key
examples of agentic AI powered

77
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,160
and generative AI powered
shopping assistant.

78
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,150
And because it can aggregate
all of those reviews

79
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,050
and product information, personal habits

80
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,380
and person who bought this also about that

81
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,540
and all of this information together,

82
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,150
it's really make it much, much quicker

83
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,750
actually 4.5 times
quicker during prime day

84
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,250
for shopping and maintaining low latency.

85
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,230
And we are foreseeing huge amount

86
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:30,230
of value coming out from
Rufus creation for amazon.com.

87
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,150
And we have seen that not only
in shopping in consumer base

88
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,110
but also in highly regulated
environment like banking.

89
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,250
NatWest boosts their
click-through rate by 900%

90
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,310
and 2 million more higher
interest savings account

91
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,600
publications by using
personalized experiences

92
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,910
and recommendations.

93
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,910
So number three, decision
latency in complex operations.

94
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,020
Huge, huge amount of data,
again, unstructured sensor data

95
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,350
and all can be aggregated together

96
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,800
and leveraging agentic
AI to make sense of it.

97
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,700
Example, again, coming from
Amazon, we have a agentic

98
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,120
and generative AI
assistant called DeepFleet

99
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,470
managing the 1 billion robots
we're using in our warehouses

100
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,240
and really helping the
automation becomes extreme

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,900
and from handling troubleshooting
to route directing

102
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,080
and dynamically deciding
what is the best way

103
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,080
of passing the right
products into packaging

104
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,233
and shipping out.

105
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Again, a lot of the agentic
AI usage we have seen

106
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,670
is in service.

107
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,100
In service management in the past

108
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,800
and I have experienced that
more than 20 years ago.

109
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,910
If you want a great customer
support, you go follow the sum.

110
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,700
You have three teams based
in three different continents

111
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,770
covering 24 by seven.

112
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,773
Now you don't have to do that anymore.

113
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,198
DoorDash for the 7 million dashers have

114
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:17,880
that agentic AI system to support all

115
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,650
of their inquiries from

116
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,620
how much tariff does
this product cost today

117
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,640
to troubleshoot, again to
question and answering.

118
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,873
So that is 3 million savings
in just supporting the dashes.

119
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,700
Last but not least, faster product cycles.

120
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,270
So built-in, learning fast

121
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,390
and really sorting through
that huge knowledge base.

122
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,480
And we see that in
healthcare and life science,

123
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,560
one of the industries
I worked many years in

124
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,480
and very, very difficult

125
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,500
because normally there's huge
amount of unstructured data.

126
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,440
One of the examples we
have is in Genentech,

127
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,040
which is Roche Group company

128
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,160
and we help their research organization

129
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,070
to automate 43,000 hours

130
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,760
of manual work augmenting
their researchers' work

131
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,823
and that's equal to five
years of time saved.

132
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,800
So all of these great examples
yet when you're reading some

133
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,510
of the headlines, 95% of
agentic AI projects seem

134
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,093
to fail to deliver measurable ROI.

135
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,850
And if you read true
and read in the details,

136
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,340
what it's really saying is

137
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,490
those 5% of the companies

138
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,300
who manage to really gain value

139
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,280
and actually millions, millions

140
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,280
of incremental value in productivities

141
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,130
and in business, new business models,

142
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,290
what did they do differently

143
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:57,290
is really transforming their
strategy and business process.

144
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,605
So what I'm talking about
today is stop steering

145
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:09,390
today's AI challenge with
yesterday's playbook.

146
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,830
There are some of the examples
of yesterday's playbook.

147
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,830
I'm sorry if the mic is a
bit, I mean louder and softer.

148
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,460
So yesterday's playbook.

149
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,530
As an example, number one,

150
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,060
when we are talking about such piece

151
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,110
of fascinating technology,
very often we ask ourselves

152
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,700
what can I do about it?

153
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,697
Instead of starting with
the problem to solve

154
00:09:35,697 --> 00:09:40,697
and we are actually going
into and using a solution,

155
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,070
searching for a problem.

156
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,450
That's number one.

157
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,280
Number two, we don't really
rethink about business process.

158
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,580
We look at the exact process as before

159
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,520
and just find steps of automating

160
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,830
and only having incremental gains

161
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,873
and sometimes even slowing it down.

162
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,620
And talking about the experiences,

163
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,280
still we are breaking the
experiences down into silos.

164
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,200
Marketing does communication,
sales lead generation

165
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,480
and none of them actually
are working together

166
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,273
towards actually that same customer.

167
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,860
And there are more in terms of the how

168
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,130
and we've been talking
about yes AI can unleash

169
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,690
productivity gains,

170
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,890
but what we do is not to
retrain and redesign roles

171
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,680
but actually replacing people.

172
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,720
This is actually not the right approach

173
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,970
and especially not the productivity gain

174
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,223
truly the right thing to do.

175
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,800
We have been in terms

176
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,340
of organizationally
centralized AI community

177
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,400
and we will talk specifically about that

178
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,400
and of course data which is the new oil

179
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,800
but especially to oil that engine of AI

180
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,953
and we are still not
setting the data up right.

181
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,470
So many organizations who come to us

182
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,870
who I have experienced before

183
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,710
actually have come to
this inflection point.

184
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,880
We have been doing a lot

185
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,310
of experimentation in
the past three years,

186
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,540
many, many POCs but we
have seen an even ROI

187
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,470
and actually scattered of
AI spending by function.

188
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,661
And really the matrix is

189
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:32,010
how many AI projects am I having

190
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,543
rather than the outcomes?

191
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,100
And now leaders come to us

192
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,070
who are asking the right question which is

193
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,990
are we really backing the
right top three value pools?

194
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,990
Will this give us the defendable
competitive advantage?

195
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,600
How do we turn the incremental ones truly

196
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,940
into compounding gains?

197
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,940
And this is today what
I'm going to talk about.

198
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,140
How do we do that?

199
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,380
How do we actually have an AI strategy

200
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,423
and implement to deliver that?

201
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,053
So let's think about the true
flywheel of AI innovation.

202
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,920
Yes it's great, we have
a lot of experimentation

203
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,100
and it's great to learn
about the new technology.

204
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,482
We actually should actually
go back to improve one step up

205
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:32,321
to say where am I going to truly invest AI

206
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:34,830
and where is the strategy point

207
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,570
and the business strategy

208
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,570
that I can support really
makes a difference.

209
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,470
Start with the opportunity,
not the solution.

210
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,120
And then of course deliver it but quickly

211
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,090
and truly show value and ROI

212
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,790
and all the while at the same time,

213
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,340
building the right foundation.

214
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,153
So that is the new AI strategy playbook.

215
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,190
There are six chapters
I'm going to talk about,

216
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,190
how do you actually
define a AI north star?

217
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,500
Starting from the AI strategy

218
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,453
that mirroring your business strategy.

219
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,427
How do you reimagine business process

220
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,510
and personalized experience?

221
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,220
Then how do you actually build

222
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,600
that motorway not just about
technology or platforms

223
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,740
but truly about people,
both in terms of everyone

224
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,290
who are leveraging AI in your company

225
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,590
but also your AI organization.

226
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:39,590
So number one, let's
start with AI North Star.

227
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,293
The successful AI transformation,

228
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,690
the biggest mistake
organization very often start

229
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,480
is let's have AI strategy

230
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,913
and let's look into how do I leverage AI.

231
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,840
The right question we should be asking is

232
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,270
what is your business
strategy and how do I,

233
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,720
and where do I translate
the business strategy

234
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,670
into AI strategy?

235
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,740
I've talked to organizations who wants

236
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,280
to translate business
strategy into AI strategy.

237
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,500
What they do is listing all

238
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,420
of their seven year business
strategy and looking into

239
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,300
and wondering how do I do this?

240
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,380
How am I going to translate

241
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,880
that very high level
vision into a very detailed

242
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,533
AI roadmap?

243
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,610
The number one question is
you want to ask yourself

244
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,070
where do you have opportunity to automate?

245
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,010
Where do you have opportunity to innovate,

246
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,302
creating new product new services

247
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,290
and where do you actually have

248
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,590
that disruptive advantage?

249
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,210
So keep that three questions in mind

250
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,110
and still think about how
am I going to translate?

251
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:06,110
And the answer is we should
ask different questions.

252
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,120
Not the same question, not the question

253
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,411
that we've been asking
for the past 50 years,

254
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:18,120
but I'm going to introduce a new framework

255
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,730
which is called RiPPLE.

256
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,360
These are a new mental
model which help you

257
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,360
to ask new questions,
to translate, to define

258
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,120
the must-haves on where your
AI can play a role to create

259
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,813
that competitive advantage as
comparing to nice to haves.

260
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,723
Okay, so.

261
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,043
So number one.

262
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,960
R, R means rational pause.

263
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,820
Let's look into

264
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,690
where is truly making a
difference in your business,

265
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,233
where your and actually
the uncomfortable truth,

266
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,890
where are you bleeding customers

267
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,513
and where you are losing
revenue to your competitors.

268
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,160
So the existing market defended

269
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,520
and protect your competitive advantage.

270
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,250
And how do we ask different questions?

271
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,103
Here are the different
questions that you can ask.

272
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,100
So think about yourself
comparing to competitors.

273
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,580
Where are the nimbler
competitors serving customer

274
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,530
faster than us?

275
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,185
What are the high volume
decisions that costing us a lot

276
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:46,770
of revenue through delays or errors?

277
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,170
And that's your opportunity.

278
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,320
What routine work prevents
our best people from winning

279
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,370
new businesses

280
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,220
and where do we lack real time visibility

281
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,580
into customers or competitor moves?

282
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,050
So that's number one.

283
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,340
That helps you to define
where is this problem space

284
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,343
that AI could play a major role.

285
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,323
Number two, incentive mapping.

286
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:19,290
Incentive mapping is all
about realizing within these

287
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,790
organizations, we often talk
about organizational silos

288
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,700
and how our organizational silo created.

289
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,670
It's not just because we
are in different departments

290
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,240
or functions or even in SAP teams,

291
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,293
it's because our incentive
systems are not aligned.

292
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:42,330
So we should actually
ask different questions

293
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,340
to discover that.

294
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,460
So you have conflicting incentives across

295
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,783
different departments.

296
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,780
Where are departments measured on matrix

297
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,283
that work against each other?

298
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,190
Where do department silos prevent us

299
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,440
from serving customer better?

300
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,780
And what handle bottlenecks

301
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,920
and data process are preventable?

302
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,580
And if you're discovering
those opportunity space

303
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,670
and that's where we go
into the second sector

304
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,090
which is re-imagining business process.

305
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,373
We have another framework to introduce.

306
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,103
Number three, perspective divergency.

307
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,750
This is quite interesting.

308
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,700
We do know that we do have problems

309
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,700
that we try to avoid
because it's too complex,

310
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,633
because it's always, always been there

311
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:44,460
and we have tried to solve it for years

312
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,710
and we couldn't solve it.

313
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,430
But right now ask yourself differently,

314
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,030
what if you have a AI native competitor

315
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,133
trying to get into space?

316
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,160
A place I worked before

317
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,570
and I led AI product innovation before

318
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,480
and it's about it's legal space.

319
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,480
And legal space has many,
many years of labeled data

320
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,770
and we truly think that we
have the competitive advantage.

321
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,570
However, when we are,

322
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,620
and there has been quite a few successful

323
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,150
new entries with AI first approach.

324
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,240
At first they were small but

325
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,770
because they have the
valuable insights very quickly

326
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,130
generated with AI and generative ai,

327
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,540
at one point they're truly
becoming threatening competitors.

328
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,250
So where does it make them nimble?

329
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:52,250
Where does it make them
competitive and how can we define

330
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,130
and how can we actually
leverage our own, for example,

331
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,790
proprietary data to actually
become more successful

332
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,833
than them by leveraging AI?

333
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,740
So here are some of the
questions you can ask yourself

334
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,950
to identify that area you
want to (indistinct) AI

335
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,470
and you want to try with experimentation

336
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,973
and moving into production.

337
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,810
Okay, so you've discovered
some opportunities

338
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:26,310
and a next natural actually
important question you want

339
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:31,310
to ask yourself is not should
we actually use AI here?

340
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:37,678
Not just could we? And
that's very, very important.

341
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,120
That is the contrarian truth, right?

342
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,840
So you can ask your question

343
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,750
as the process come into question,

344
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,800
what if it is already the best fit

345
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,003
for the context?

346
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,010
If we introduce AI into this process,

347
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,260
could it introduce new risks?

348
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,300
What are the mitigation?

349
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,950
And especially when we
have perceived bottlenecks,

350
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:12,813
is it real or is it
actually misunderstood?

351
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,530
So all of this, think about your business,

352
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:21,530
think about in your area that not could we

353
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,030
but should we as well.

354
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,933
The opposite.

355
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,760
And very important question you want

356
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,570
to ask yourself is also, if we build AI,

357
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,900
if we truly invest into resources,

358
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,700
if we truly invest into this problem area

359
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,000
with actually transforming
business process,

360
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,653
can we build sustainable
competitive modes through AI?

361
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,960
Maybe it is, maybe we can truly create

362
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,520
that data that are unique
that competitors cannot

363
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,420
and will never have access to

364
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:07,303
and we can embed AI into
workflows, continuously learn

365
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,400
and record that not only
in institutional knowledge

366
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,930
that we've been talking about
which are yearly, monthly,

367
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,060
but actually daily, second

368
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,260
of the operational knowledge

369
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,460
and continuously training AI,
learning on your business,

370
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,150
customize according to your
business and your operations

371
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,450
and where's your knowledge,
where's your proprietary data

372
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,000
and it's eventually becoming true

373
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,490
that nobody else can copy

374
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,230
and that is your mode

375
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,133
that your is your continuous
competitive advantage.

376
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,520
Last but not least, how
quickly can you implement it?

377
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,520
That is so important, the
velocity of implementing it.

378
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,860
And if you can implement
it within two months,

379
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:06,860
within six months you might
be able to create 18 months

380
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,050
of advantage that nobody else can follow.

381
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:13,533
And that is where you should invest.

382
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:18,480
And if you identify that opportunity,

383
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,130
put sponsorship

384
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:24,300
and develop skills to execute
not only for prototype

385
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,020
but truly moving it into
production to continuously keeping

386
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,173
that gap between you and your competitor.

387
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,051
So with this RIPPLE framework,

388
00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:41,730
the opportunity filter
workshop is your next step.

389
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,730
So use that to identify
these opportunities

390
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,890
but score each of the opportunities

391
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,740
by these four factors.

392
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,720
Impact on business outcomes.

393
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,630
By the way, don't forget
technical feasibility

394
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,040
and that would also impact

395
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,670
how quickly you can leverage
it and implement it.

396
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,770
Creating (indistinct) with it.

397
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,940
Strategic alignment and
innovation velocity,

398
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,160
we talked about the last point.

399
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,210
And then select the must
have to move forward.

400
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,163
So that is your map.

401
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,993
Let's talk quickly about ROI.

402
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,450
And we have been talking
about we need to identify ROI

403
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,600
for AI, not only just
for the past three years

404
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,213
but ever since that I
started working on AI.

405
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,620
You need to, one key learning I've learned

406
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,750
in past many years is you need

407
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,230
to set up observation in operation.

408
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,050
So not post facts that will be too late.

409
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,380
You won't be able to separate successfully

410
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,200
what is AI and what is not.

411
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,110
So there are five steps you can do.

412
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,960
You need to select the right value stream.

413
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,960
It really have result into
productivity differentiation

414
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,620
or new revenue streams.

415
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,550
You need to embed AI into
that flow but wire the data.

416
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,670
You need to have the
entire data flow identified

417
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,210
and separating AI and long AI and you need

418
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:20,210
to actually take those usages
not only just AI, no AI,

419
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,990
how long, which part,
what's the percentage

420
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,693
and run and compare and scale.

421
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,280
And there are some AI ROI
discovery methodologies

422
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,740
to put my analysts hat on a little bit.

423
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,730
So there's when you are running pilot

424
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:45,990
and you are able to isolate
where you're running pilot

425
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,840
and a place where have similar environment

426
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,110
and similar activities but without AI.

427
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,320
So what you can't do is test and control.

428
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,320
So the test is where you
have AI like AP testing

429
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,360
and the control area is where you don't

430
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,970
and you can very quickly identify

431
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,313
how much incremental you can create.

432
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,470
After post-launch

433
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,950
because you have embedded
data flow, you are able

434
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,950
to do AI attribution analysis.

435
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,810
And when you are ongoing

436
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,470
what you can do is actually
every single touch point

437
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,770
can be identified with the AI touch

438
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:30,770
and how much AI touched to
continuously optimize it.

439
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
So that's number one.

440
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,820
Business strategy to AI strategy.

441
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,773
That's your AI north star.

442
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,560
Now let's look at a couple
of deep dive examples.

443
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,560
Number one is we talk
about business processes.

444
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,760
If you really keep it completely intact

445
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,760
and only automate the separate
part of it, what we can see

446
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,370
and what we have seen
from many, many interviews

447
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:09,960
with customers is you
don't actually see a lot

448
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,480
of AI value creation.

449
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,710
What we need to do is to shift from

450
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,110
the separate keeping things intact,

451
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,500
completely sequential implementation

452
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,500
of AI into reimagining the
complete business process,

453
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,320
focusing on what is the
outcome you want to get

454
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,793
and rethinking about it.

455
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,890
Several organizations I've
talked to have come back

456
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,020
to say, "We tried that.

457
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,140
We did a workshop, we talk about

458
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,320
the outcome and everybody went away

459
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,140
to think about the
opportunities and redesign it

460
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,060
and six weeks later they came
back with Excel sheets.""

461
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,360
So how do we actually do that?

462
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,560
And what I will suggest is again

463
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,100
ask different questions starting

464
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,150
with the sequential
that you have right now,

465
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,413
which is using.

466
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,000
I have a example of due diligence.

467
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,920
Due diligence, just like
any complex business process

468
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,470
today is pretty sequential, right?

469
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,160
So you collect the document,
you have the initial review

470
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,110
and then you flag the issues

471
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,510
and then the issue go
through legal review,

472
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,010
financial impact review

473
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,989
and eventually you have
the risk assessment

474
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:38,760
and you basically can say,
okay, can I deal with it or not

475
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,140
and is it worth it?

476
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,250
And do we have to go back
to the previous session

477
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,993
and handle the exceptions there?

478
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,990
And it is time consuming

479
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,160
and due diligence takes six
to nine months in average

480
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,240
and when you are actually
should be moving forward

481
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,210
with that business value creation.

482
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:05,210
So another thing to think about is,

483
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,350
and that's why we should
not start with technology.

484
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,680
Very often when we are
transforming business process,

485
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,440
it's not just one piece of technology,

486
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,430
it's not just agentic AA,
it's not just generative AI,

487
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,880
it's not just okay let's use AI assistant

488
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,460
and make the process a little bit better.

489
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,460
No, if you want to reimagine
the process as often said,

490
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,330
don't start with the technology

491
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,250
and this is a key piece of it

492
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,180
because let's identify
exactly what we want to do.

493
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,700
What is the most important thing

494
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,700
and most time consuming thing
is actually to discover issues

495
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,660
in due diligence

496
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,350
and then think about way
of mitigating issues.

497
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,087
When you are thinking about that

498
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:56,400
and you actually reimagine this process

499
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,280
into a non-sequential process.

500
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,020
So number one is I need to inject

501
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,780
all the information I
have, all the documents

502
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:07,770
and then I need to do
sematic analysis to identify

503
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:12,390
that key clause that might be the issue.

504
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,130
So that's number one, right?

505
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,230
So you are already aggregating several

506
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,110
of the components
together, not sequentially.

507
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,933
And you can use generative AI for it.

508
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,310
And once the anomaly is identified

509
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:29,550
and you can use analytical AI to do

510
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,550
for example compare it with your ERP data,

511
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,870
financial impact analysis
and do the risk scoring.

512
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,663
So that's cross-referencing and valuation.

513
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,570
And additionally let's
say the issue you discover

514
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,330
is a vendor which
actually have a clause of

515
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:54,150
terminating the contract if
any (indistinct) happens.

516
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,580
So what do I do here?

517
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,040
You actually can parallel process

518
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,820
and going into several
agentic AI coordinated

519
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,363
by a agentic AI coordinator.

520
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:12,400
And so using legal processing agents

521
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,760
and using financial analysis agent

522
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,270
and actually human oversight all together.

523
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:26,010
So that's your agentic
routine which save time

524
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,170
by not doing it sequentially

525
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:32,730
and identify what could be
the most optimum outcome

526
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,470
and solution and then
sending it to ramification.

527
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:41,490
And by the way the ramification
itself can use agentic AI

528
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,790
to draft waiver proposal for example.

529
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,660
And human at the same time in the loop

530
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,618
did decide the action.

531
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:53,430
So all of this is to reimagine

532
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,923
and not to think about sequentially.

533
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,983
So we talk about the how is important,

534
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,820
how do we do this?

535
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:09,720
How do we take a
sequential business process

536
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,020
and ask different questions to say

537
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,660
how do we completely reimagine this?

538
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,660
And I have a framework
which is called BREAK

539
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,993
and these are the BREAKS.

540
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,210
Blind spot scan,

541
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,440
reframe constraints, economic dissection,

542
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,593
assumption audit and
Kaizen, the happy path.

543
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:40,773
So what is blind sport scan?

544
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:45,870
When you have a business process
which you have been using

545
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,050
for years, it's very hard

546
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,723
to just tell yourself, reimagine it.

547
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,270
One method is to ask why

548
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,730
and ask why five times,

549
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:03,270
and sometimes some of the
whys might be why not.

550
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:07,323
So as an example, this
is a actual example.

551
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,940
The step currently is manual approval

552
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,893
for order over $1,000.

553
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,070
Why?

554
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,400
Because we need to prevent
fraud, it's a big amount.

555
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,570
But why?

556
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,510
Because big amount are risky. But why?

557
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:28,593
Because we cannot verify
customer intent with that amount.

558
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,350
Why? Because we don't have real time data.

559
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,680
Hey, the question has already been flipped

560
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,983
and it's no longer a compliance question,

561
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:40,020
it's actually a data question.

562
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,760
And the last why is

563
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,760
because our systems are
not interoperatable.

564
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,010
So that five whys help you

565
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:55,010
to identify again the
business process problem space

566
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,890
where you might want to dig deeper into.

567
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,720
That's your blind spot,

568
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,430
which without asking the
whys you would just go ahead

569
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:08,343
and continues to do what
you were doing before.

570
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:15,020
Second, we very often
have that constraints.

571
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,750
And another idea of
reframing that constraint

572
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,273
is to challenge your process limitations.

573
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:30,290
Ask yourself what if I have zero latency?

574
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:37,533
What could I achieve with that?
What if there's zero touch?

575
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,523
Then what could I have achieved that?

576
00:34:43,788 --> 00:34:46,020
With for example, AWS,

577
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,053
we ask ourself what if we have zero ETL?

578
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,513
What can we achieve that?

579
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,450
And so the very often a new way

580
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,220
of thinking new invention

581
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,010
and new reimagining of
business process starts

582
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,320
with ask you a question.

583
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,200
This is a limit that I go to

584
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,230
and how am I going to achieve with that?

585
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,113
And then ask how do I achieve that?

586
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,623
And that's how breakthrough happens.

587
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,493
Economic dissection.

588
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:26,324
There are yes today that you might think

589
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:29,013
this process is what we can do,

590
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,520
but what we don't think about is

591
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,490
what are actually the
costs, the actual costs

592
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:40,323
and value destroying elements
if I don't make a change.

593
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,170
So for example,

594
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,770
very often we don't think
about the hidden costs,

595
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,887
when we are thinking about

596
00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:51,060
"Hey this is as much as I can do in terms

597
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,060
of delivering for example
ideas of just work out".

598
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:05,300
Is thinking about it's
normal to stand in the queue

599
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,630
waiting in line at supermarket

600
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,420
but the hidden cost of time consumption

601
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,120
and hidden cost of people
being frustrated actually

602
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,850
put the things down and never buy it.

603
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:21,060
So those are the hidden costs

604
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,420
and value lost that you
have with your customers.

605
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,500
Think about in your process where are they

606
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,943
and how can we solve it?

607
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,280
We should have a assumption of it

608
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,823
and it's about flipping the sacred cows.

609
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,690
And sacred cows are very
often again being used

610
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:52,920
as there are risks, there
are compliance issues,

611
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,141
but is it truly?

612
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:58,950
Every single approval process sometimes

613
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,650
it might be compliance issue

614
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:05,250
but it might be just
organizational habits.

615
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,670
Ask yourself this approval processes,

616
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:13,080
are they truly compliance needed
or are we just used to it?

617
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,360
And we have to go through the
hierarchy of the organization

618
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,550
and also manual quality checks.

619
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,340
I only trust human to do this step.

620
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,393
Could it be prevented?
Can it be prevented?

621
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:34,170
And which sequential dependencies
are actually requirements

622
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,150
and just because historically we have

623
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,593
always been doing that.

624
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:44,853
The last BREAK, the last one is K,

625
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,517
Kaizen, the "happy path."

626
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,320
In process engineering

627
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,540
we very often talk about the happy path,

628
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,190
the path which is the easiest

629
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,820
and which is 80% of the
time you go through that

630
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,223
and that's where you put it in.

631
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,960
But the new way of
discovering the happy path,

632
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,660
especially when you have agentic AI,

633
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,960
when you actually can parallel process

634
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,440
many, many different scenarios

635
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,850
and find the right one is
actually that thing just happen.

636
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,670
That thing just happen for a while.

637
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,220
The picture you're seeing right here,

638
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,460
this happens in Ohio State University.

639
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,160
They want to build paths
for the students to get

640
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,080
to their lecture halls

641
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,137
and instead of building it,

642
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:41,010
they actually let students
just walk across the grass

643
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,430
and identify the most useful paths

644
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,920
and then eventually build the routes

645
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,490
according to the the foot paths.

646
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,480
So that is observing
the actual behavior and

647
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,750
because agentic AI has the ability

648
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,470
of logging everything, reflecting on it

649
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,770
and identify patterns with memories,

650
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:09,363
you can identify the happy
paths and formalize it.

651
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,320
So kaizen by the way in
case you're not familiar

652
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,230
with is Japanese philosophy.

653
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,340
It is about, I mean some

654
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,760
of the enterprises
organizations actually use it

655
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,910
as well in their business strategy.

656
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:28,320
So it's about continuous step
by step small improvement

657
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,740
to get to a bigger value.

658
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,550
But that frequent changes
is informed by actually

659
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:39,363
what has happened in actual
work and experiences.

660
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:45,000
And the identical AI Kaizen
at scale, as I mentioned,

661
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,190
there's continuous observation

662
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,330
and continuous recording
and continuous reflection

663
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,000
and learning loop with agentic AI,

664
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,460
and there's policy refinement according

665
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,347
to the agent's observation.

666
00:39:59,347 --> 00:40:03,750
"Hey this path and with this analyst steps

667
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,260
actually takes 20%
shorter every single time

668
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,900
and we should reroute to that."

669
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,900
So that is the policy refinement
which is continuously done

670
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,563
and is traceable.

671
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,970
And parallel experimentation,
instead of AB testing,

672
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,100
you have A, B, C, D, E, F, G

673
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,730
and many, many thousands going in parallel

674
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,320
and finding the right path

675
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,160
and finding actually truly
the experience people prefer

676
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,840
and the feedback is always
integrated including actually the

677
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,413
human managers of the agentic AI system.

678
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,230
So with the BREAKs, the next one,

679
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:50,130
when you want to implement, how do you do

680
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:54,840
from process mapping and
identify your today's process.

681
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,010
It might be sequential,

682
00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:00,600
you might already have some
digitized or automated part,

683
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,910
but then use the BREAK analysis

684
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,910
to truly challenge your
limits and the the holy cows.

685
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:13,730
And then of all the
bottlenecks you identified,

686
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:19,310
prioritizing which one
makes truly a difference

687
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,830
and what are the dependencies
you have on them?

688
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:27,830
And then map it to AI
solutions as I mentioned before

689
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,340
and what you have seen in the
due diligence re-imagining

690
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:37,340
of the processes and what
AI solution could we use.

691
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,843
And eventually have the
implementation roadmap.

692
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,830
That way instead of just saying,

693
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,080
let's reimagine the business process,

694
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,030
you have a bit of structured
approach to help you to get

695
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,623
to the opportunities.

696
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,650
An example that I already been working

697
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:03,150
with a few customers and
is clinical trial process.

698
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,550
Clinical trial is when we bring a drug to

699
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,030
the market, it takes roughly
10 years and billions

700
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,100
and billions of dollars normally

701
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,640
because you have to go
through phase one safety,

702
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,530
phase two efficacy and phase
three in a bigger population.

703
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,340
And many, many people believe
that all of this needs

704
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:30,690
to happen sequentially,
because of course safety first

705
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,630
and then small population
tasks for the efficacy

706
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,400
and bigger populations.

707
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,640
What we don't challenge
ourself is can some

708
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,150
of these processes happen in parallel.

709
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:45,270
When you are preparing documents,
when you are referring to

710
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,610
what is in the market already,

711
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,980
when you're referring to the literatures,

712
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,330
many of this actually can
happen at the same time

713
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,643
and through trial and error as well.

714
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:03,660
So using similar mindset
we can rethink about

715
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,580
how do we redesign the experience with AI

716
00:43:08,037 --> 00:43:13,037
because it is often very,
very similar problem,

717
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,703
which is the silo problem.

718
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,020
When you're rethinking about it, the way

719
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,940
of doing it is put a human
at the center instead

720
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,930
of to say marketing
needs to do communication

721
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,390
and sales lead generation.

722
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:34,230
This is the person that
you need to actually serve.

723
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,540
What is her need

724
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:40,683
and what does she want
during the entire process?

725
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,240
Agentic AI can help you with that

726
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,667
because it has reasoning, planning, action

727
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:55,550
and orchestration all done
at the background similarly.

728
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,950
So let's use a actual example.

729
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:03,120
Returning products can
be quite frustrating

730
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,070
for customers.

731
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:07,889
So when you are doing
that, I want to return this

732
00:44:07,889 --> 00:44:12,889
and at the behind the scenes
AI can do it in parallel,

733
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:17,470
assessing the possibility of, I mean

734
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:22,050
by the way the purchasing
history is being leveraged

735
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,370
to identify hey,

736
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,990
does this customer always always

737
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,760
return the products she bought?

738
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,170
Is it valid?

739
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,660
And what has been done before

740
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,940
and what are the warranty?

741
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,080
Can she return it?

742
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,911
Is it within 30 days
after she purchase it?

743
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:40,680
And reason it at the same time

744
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,510
and getting all of the related
information needed and acts.

745
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:50,510
So if it's valid, if it's
still within her right

746
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,350
and let's process it,

747
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:55,200
let's update also the
inventory immediately

748
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,820
and let's arrange the shipping

749
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,340
and let's notify the customers.

750
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,750
All of this, imagine if
it's our original process

751
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,080
of processing the return is going

752
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,360
through several departments

753
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,710
and all of this actually are
done without going through

754
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,070
that silo and with actually that person

755
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,803
with this particular needs at the center.

756
00:45:22,204 --> 00:45:26,730
And you need to think about
how are the possibilities

757
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:29,970
of dealing with it more proactively.

758
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,330
Okay, we solve a problem
with returning the product

759
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,870
but eventually if you put
the human at the center,

760
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,910
these possibilities of
thinking about proactively

761
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:44,400
of designing her experiences,

762
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,403
can I propose a new
product if it's a customer?

763
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,990
Can I actually deal with
the project guideline

764
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,540
before the person notice it

765
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,590
and let her know, hey, it is
approaching in three days,

766
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:02,370
what are you doing can be accelerated?

767
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:05,430
And if you are dealing with partners,

768
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,790
can you actually identify
the challenge from all

769
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,150
the arrow locks and the repeated problems

770
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,160
that you might have

771
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,453
or the partner might
have about this issue?

772
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,120
So to implement it, an idea
is again during a workshop

773
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,908
and mapping that event you want to solve

774
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:32,520
and identify the silos

775
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,540
and also the entire orchestration.

776
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,050
Think about how can I use it

777
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,860
to completely transform the experience

778
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:47,610
and without thinking about
sequential steps that I need

779
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:51,213
to go through if it's
human team handling them.

780
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,643
Example is actually again in Amazon,

781
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,780
the entire Amazon organization moved into

782
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:05,780
an new agentic AI solution called A to Z.

783
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:11,026
So instead of when I need
a vacation, I need to go

784
00:47:11,026 --> 00:47:15,450
through HR policies, I
need to ask from my manager

785
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:17,670
and all this information I provided,

786
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,683
I just type in with the interface,

787
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:22,920
I need a vacation of five days

788
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,580
and all of this needed information

789
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,310
and are truly send it to me.

790
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:32,553
Okay, so this is a system
according to the policy,

791
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,890
you are in Switzerland

792
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,630
and this is what you can do

793
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:38,970
and you have remaining 15 days.

794
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:41,733
Yes you can take five days
of vacation right now.

795
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:47,780
So if we put for example in
this case employee as the center

796
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:53,347
there is HR manager, payroll, IT,

797
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:59,070
all of this departmental
silos are put aside

798
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:02,790
and truly think about
what needed to be achieved

799
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:07,050
with this human in the
center and every processes

800
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,123
and tools can be leveraged.

801
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,430
Now let's talk about how do
we actually work together

802
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,373
with AI for all of your employees.

803
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:25,093
First of all, not everything
should be given to AI,

804
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,283
whether it's agent or generative AI.

805
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,200
There are agentic AI

806
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:40,380
big problem spaces that truly deserve

807
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,890
to use a launch agentic AI.

808
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:46,230
For example, you have a clear objective

809
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:49,140
because that's what AI needs to achieve.

810
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,440
You have sufficient data truly available

811
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,080
and you have many decisions

812
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,660
but it is possible to reverse.

813
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,810
In Amazon we talk about
one way door, two-way doors

814
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:04,140
and two way door decisions
can be reversed back

815
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,363
and those you can give to AI.

816
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,020
And you can retain human control

817
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,810
and you should retain human control

818
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:15,000
in more strategic decisions,

819
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,350
relationship sensitive
decisions and novel situations.

820
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:23,070
And let's not forget
and high stake decisions

821
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:27,303
and one way door and
irreversible decisions.

822
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,470
And we need to think about also we need to

823
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:39,180
think about human AI manager.

824
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,900
It is no longer a task definer.

825
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,660
So what is a task definer?

826
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:46,893
Run this report.

827
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,553
You define what needs to be done,

828
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:54,810
but truly now when we're working with AI,

829
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:59,670
especially agentic AI, we
need to give AI the objective.

830
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:03,720
I want to achieve this,
please do the payment on time,

831
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,418
please help this customer

832
00:50:05,418 --> 00:50:10,418
and according to the
policies, return this product

833
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,860
with the right way within the time limit.

834
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:18,860
So that paradigm shift of task dedication

835
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:23,400
to objective setting is our truly

836
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,443
true change of the mindset.

837
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:31,560
So human's role as AI manager requires

838
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,243
three competency, objective setting,

839
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:41,013
performance monitoring and
strategic intervention.

840
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,083
So the details of objective
setting for example,

841
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:50,280
what is the primary goal you want AI

842
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,740
or agentic AI to achieve?

843
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,480
And you set the goal

844
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,640
but you also need to set

845
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,630
what is the success criteria.

846
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:04,440
For example, CSAT scores,
for example, resolution time

847
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,740
for example, fast contact
resolution percentage.

848
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,220
So all of this is
potentially success matrix.

849
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:14,910
What are the constraints?
What are escalation triggers?

850
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:18,450
When do you actually need
to keep human in the loop?

851
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:23,160
And how often do we
review the performance?

852
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,730
Weekly analysis, daily, monthly?

853
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,713
And leveraging AI's memory.

854
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,133
And very importantly,

855
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,390
AI manager skillsets are different

856
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:39,120
from human manager skillsets.

857
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:44,120
And one true important skill
is actually learning agility.

858
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,730
Human managers.

859
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,740
When you're working with AI agents

860
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:54,300
and we always say that it's
actually whoever knows how

861
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,070
to best leverage AI is going

862
00:51:56,070 --> 00:52:00,270
to become the high
performer in the future,

863
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:01,683
the best people you have.

864
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:07,350
What he needs to do is
actually be very, very good

865
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:09,663
as at pattern recognition,

866
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:15,870
as in how exactly is the
best way of leveraging AI

867
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:18,240
and combining with my team members

868
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,660
to achieve the objective the best way,

869
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:25,530
the best route identification
we talked about.

870
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:29,880
And also knows intuitively if

871
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,400
after working with AI for a while,

872
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,060
what are actually the
contextual interventions

873
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,550
human needs to very often do

874
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:41,400
and do not let AI handle it.

875
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,140
So that human AI augmentation happens when

876
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,770
human intuitively know when

877
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:52,500
and how best to leverage AI.

878
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,500
And those are the four key
skillsets they need to develop

879
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:02,520
and eventually is truly on
the job by working together

880
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,903
with AI system.

881
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,100
Now let's talk about AI organization,

882
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,933
the organization which will
enable you to launch AI.

883
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,480
We have the leader, we have
the organizational structure,

884
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,820
we have the innovation ecosystem,

885
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,163
and we have the talent system.

886
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:29,583
Number one, the leader.

887
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:35,253
Anyone here who has the title of CAIO?

888
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:47,390
It is truly becoming a
trend that organization are

889
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,620
hiring CAIOs,

890
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:54,540
people who they believe should
be leading the AI strategy

891
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,670
and telling the organization that

892
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,760
how should we best leverage AI.

893
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,840
That's great, but
sometimes we do encounter

894
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,620
one leader cannot scale

895
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:09,300
because a lot of the organization,

896
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,660
especially the organization
at the top, the board,

897
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:17,220
the C-suites are very
often also new in this.

898
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:22,220
They don't know about
what AI can or cannot do

899
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,360
and they don't know what is the right way

900
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,833
of making their organization
truly know how to leverage AI.

901
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,650
So one key thing about CAIO is

902
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:38,160
actually to educate, to orchestrate

903
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,920
and distributed AI fluency

904
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,280
and ownership across the entire C-suite.

905
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,670
And we see that is the most effective way

906
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:51,600
of CAIO leading the organization.

907
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,290
One person cannot scale AI strategy

908
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,533
and cannot make it successful
for the entire company.

909
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,477
And then the AI organization itself,

910
00:55:03,477 --> 00:55:08,477
I have done and being tasked and done AI

911
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,920
or data and AI transformation
for four global organizations.

912
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,790
And the model I often
use is hub and spoke.

913
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:22,440
Yes, we do need many
things in the hub in order

914
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,460
to scale quickly for
the entire organization,

915
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:31,460
but we also do need spokes into
the other business functions

916
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,470
and into the other departments

917
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:36,750
to help people learn

918
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,240
and to help actually people who are facing

919
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,081
that business problems
and opportunities daily

920
00:55:42,081 --> 00:55:45,843
to identify the opportunities.

921
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:51,570
But how big is the hub
and how big are the spokes

922
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,920
and how flexible

923
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,150
or permanent are the
spokes are the differences.

924
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:01,260
So I mean I have led AI
research heavy models

925
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:05,520
where the organization is
truly creating something

926
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,900
and doing research on that,

927
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,270
doing cutting edge research on that,

928
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:11,910
doing something that
which are the industry's

929
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,770
holy grail problem.

930
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,167
If you were to establish
an AI organization,

931
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:20,370
which is research heavy, by all means,

932
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,890
AI center for expertise needs to be big

933
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:26,610
and very often the spokes
into the other functions

934
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:28,560
are temporary.

935
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,170
Going there solving one particular problem

936
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:35,043
and moving back into the
center which is called squats.

937
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,860
And then another model of
hub and spoke is small hub

938
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,950
and bigger and more permanent spokes.

939
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:47,400
And those are very often
with AI heavy model.

940
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,810
When I was working for global
life science companies where

941
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:55,830
that commercial organization's
hub was actually

942
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,590
at the center, but many, many

943
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:02,853
of the markets have spoke
which are permanently there.

944
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:08,400
But most important thing is
how are you going to discover

945
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,610
and scale that AI innovation

946
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:15,090
and how do you actually multiply that.

947
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:18,570
And that is what I call
AI incubator model.

948
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:22,260
Whether you are hub heavy or spoke heavy

949
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:27,210
and having that ring,
it's really important.

950
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,720
Because very often successful ideation

951
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,220
and pilot of AI use cases
happen in the spoke.

952
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,590
But when people discover that

953
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:39,210
and even it's successful,

954
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:42,654
they have no obligation to scale it.

955
00:57:42,654 --> 00:57:46,450
And in order to actually mobilize that

956
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:51,480
and motivate people to actually moving it

957
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,920
and finding opportunities

958
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,370
of reapplying it in other organizations

959
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:58,650
and then feeding back to the hub

960
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,477
to actually create
permanent products to enable

961
00:58:01,477 --> 00:58:04,500
that fast scale is that ring

962
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,380
and that's your innovation ecosystem

963
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,900
and that is the incubator.

964
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,460
Whether it belong to hub

965
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,070
or belong to spokes, it doesn't matter.

966
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:18,330
We very often say this is
the true two piece team

967
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:20,130
with multifunctional team,

968
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,860
business subject matter experts,

969
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,833
but importantly also AI experts.

970
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,900
Having the right talents,

971
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,790
having a talents which have

972
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,400
that business acumen
on the right hand side

973
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,570
and problem solving skills,
but also AI functional skills,

974
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:42,780
the left side and balanced left

975
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:46,230
and right side is very, very important.

976
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:50,820
Whichever organization
hub or spoke they are in.

977
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:55,590
But what you can adjust are the balance.

978
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:59,790
So some needs to be left brain heavy

979
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:03,300
and you need a lot of
in depth AI engineering

980
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:07,620
or scientist skills or
some needs to be balanced.

981
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,882
Like for example, a very important role

982
00:59:09,882 --> 00:59:14,762
of AI translator is about
problem space discovery

983
00:59:14,762 --> 00:59:18,210
and AI opportunity identification.

984
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:22,053
So that left brain and right
brain needs to be balanced.

985
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:29,150
So from strategy to
implementation takes 90 days

986
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,620
and to think about that
whether hub and spoke

987
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:39,510
and which type of hub and spoke
where your people today are

988
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,190
and doing the assessment

989
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:46,050
and identify that fluency
program for your team

990
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,077
and whether it is increasing
their left brain part

991
00:59:49,077 --> 00:59:53,477
or right brain part is can be done

992
00:59:53,477 --> 00:59:58,053
following this 30, 60, 90 days roadmap.

993
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,283
Last but not least, data.

994
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,853
We have been fixing the base for years.

995
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:15,450
Who hasn't encountered some of these,

996
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:19,770
data warehouses, data lakes,
data lakehouses, data mesh

997
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:20,973
and data fabric.

998
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:27,690
What we need to think about,
what we need to identify now is

999
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,693
how can I actually build
a living foundation?

1000
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:35,310
Because your AI foundation
should not be a cathedral

1001
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:38,340
and should not be keeping
your head down two years

1002
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:43,050
and building it, but really
having it as living city

1003
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:47,040
and lay the pipe and continuously develop

1004
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,490
because agentic AI unlike all

1005
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:54,990
of the others from the past
do not need perfect data.

1006
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:58,347
It can take the data, it
can improve on the data

1007
01:00:58,347 --> 01:01:02,800
and it can actually
continuously use data to both

1008
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:08,643
enrich the use case but also
further develop your models.

1009
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,990
And AI technology
evolution is accelerating

1010
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:15,180
and as we know this is just some

1011
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,420
of the examples in the past three years.

1012
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:22,080
So what we need to do
in terms of architecture

1013
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:26,823
is also keep it simple and modularized.

1014
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,530
And that's where, for example, solutions

1015
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:39,120
and platforms like AWS
AgentCore can help you

1016
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:42,900
and keep the choices and do not log in

1017
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:47,900
and give you production
grade of observability.

1018
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:54,240
And we need to not only
keep responsible AI

1019
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,450
and risk management in principle,

1020
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:00,033
but also operationalize it.

1021
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:08,760
Okay, so for the implementation,
again for the 90 days,

1022
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,760
if you want to actually
think about Agile foundation,

1023
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,970
these are some

1024
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:19,230
of the implementation
roadmaps you can follow.

1025
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:23,313
Start with one use case, create
that template and expand.

1026
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:28,590
So these are my six chapters

1027
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:30,790
of AI strategy playbook

1028
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,270
and this are the summary

1029
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,340
for you to take back.

1030
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:42,900
So if you have, our time is up,

1031
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:46,470
but if you have any questions
and feel free to approach me

1032
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:49,980
after the session or
throughout the entire re:Invent

1033
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,380
and enjoy the rest of your re:Invent.

1034
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,818
You've been a great audience.
Thank you very much.

1035
01:02:54,818 --> 01:02:57,651
(crowd clapping)
