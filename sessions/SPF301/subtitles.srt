1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,570
- I normally like to start these sessions

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,130
with a little bit of interaction.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,783
So indulge me for one second.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,960
Hands up if you knew that
almost every professional

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,000
or semi-professional football team,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,520
professional team or individual athlete

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,680
use some form of wearable device

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,073
to track their data either
in game or in practice.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,300
Okay, significantly more than
I thought there would be.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,010
Maybe you've thought
about what type of data

11
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,950
they're ingesting or
what type of analytics

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,840
can be generated on that data.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,480
But maybe you haven't thought about

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,180
who actually makes these devices

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,730
and the market that they serve.

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,480
Well, that's what we're here
to talk to you about today.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,580
And for those that
didn't raise their hand,

18
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,460
I hope today you can see
a different side of sport,

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,480
one that's fueled by data.

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,000
So my name's Mike,

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,990
and I'm a Sports Solution
Architect based in Australia.

22
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,370
And with me, I have Greg,

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,730
one of our Senior IoT
Specialist Solution Architects.

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,850
And today, we'll be talking
about one of my customers,

25
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,500
Catapult Sports.

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,850
And I'll refer to them as Catapult

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,560
throughout the rest of the presentation.

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,220
We'll be talking about who
they are, what they do,

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,970
and how they're transforming sport.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,010
We'll talk about athlete data ingestion.

31
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,843
What are they ingesting?

32
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:26,160
How are they doing it?

33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,170
And then what can be done with that data

34
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,700
once it's been ingested?

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,580
What type of analytics, metrics,

36
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,523
and improvements to athlete
performance can be given?

37
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,700
We'll go a bit deeper into the
device software architecture

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,043
and how they've used AWS to
build their wearable devices.

39
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,750
We'll talk about device onboarding,
how they manage updates,

40
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,040
and how they can roll out
different types of configuration.

41
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,453
And finally, we'll look to the future.

42
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,720
What can Catapult do next

43
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,793
to continue evolving
data in the sports world?

44
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,450
Now, I've mentioned Catapult,

45
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,030
so let me introduce you to who they are.

46
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,100
Catapult exists to unleash the potential

47
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,983
of every athlete and team in the world.

48
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,120
Operating at the cross-section

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,600
of sports science and analytics,

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,753
Catapult products are designed
to optimize performance,

51
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,800
improve recoverability, and
quantify return to play.

52
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,170
Now, the business is listed

53
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,950
on the Australian Securities
Exchange and has over 400 staff

54
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,323
based across 24 different
locations worldwide.

55
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,240
But rather than tell you
throughout the presentation

56
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,280
who they are and what they do,

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,040
how about a little video to set the scene

58
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,523
and contextualize this?

59
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,915
(intense music)

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,120
Great.

61
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,500
So within that video, I'm gonna
refer to a couple of things

62
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,240
that you might have seen.

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,700
Now, Catapult has a number
of different solutions,

64
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,950
and we don't have time
to cover all of them,

65
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,270
but I'll touch on three,

66
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,960
and we'll go into depth into
one of them specifically today.

67
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,120
First, we have athlete monitoring.

68
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,100
Now, you may have seen in the video

69
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,030
there was a little device that was put

70
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,730
into a vest that one of
the players was wearing.

71
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,010
Now, this is designed
to optimize performance,

72
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,040
reduce the risk of injury,
and improve recovery.

73
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,680
And this is what we'll
dive deep into today.

74
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,860
The second solution is the
scouting and recruiting.

75
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,770
This is designed to find, evaluate,

76
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,443
and acquire the right
players for your team.

77
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,640
And finally, to bring context to data,

78
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,100
Catapult has a video suite offering.

79
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,540
And this connects the data to video

80
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,383
to transform strategy,
performance, and training.

81
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,700
Now, before we dive deep

82
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,420
into the athlete monitoring solution,

83
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,940
let's take a little bit of
a look at Catapult's market.

84
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,560
Now, Catapult operates in
over 128 different countries,

85
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,240
has customers in over 40 different sports,

86
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,040
and has over 5,000 elite
teams as their customer.

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,960
Now, Catapult's customers include

88
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,660
some of the biggest clubs
and franchises in the world,

89
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,740
from the NFL to the NHL to
the English Premier League.

90
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,170
And here is an example of the top sports

91
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,913
that Catapult have customers in.

92
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,990
Now, diving a little bit

93
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,360
into the athlete monitoring capabilities

94
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,130
that Catapult provide,

95
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,380
Catapult tracks comprehensive
performance metrics

96
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,540
that give coaches actionable insights

97
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,090
for training and competition.

98
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,740
Now, I wanna specifically
touch on a couple of these.

99
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,200
Player load is one that we'll
dive a bit deeper into later,

100
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,420
but it quantifies the
total physical stress.

101
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,970
Now, this is a primary tool
for workload management

102
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,870
and injury prevention across a season.

103
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,160
Next, we have speed zones.

104
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,860
Speed zones categorize athlete output

105
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,810
across velocity, thresholds,

106
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,850
helping us understand game demands

107
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,000
and prescribe appropriate
train intensities.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,730
Now, for those that love
their contact sports,

109
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,660
contact intensity measures
collision forces in those sports.

110
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,120
And this is important for
managing player safety

111
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,203
and recovery needs.

112
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,340
And finally, something very important

113
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,400
is that Catapult can identify
sport-specific movements,

114
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,000
such as jumps, tackles, and throws.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,790
Now, these are automatically
detected and quantified,

116
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,940
providing tailored insights
for those 40-plus sports

117
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,710
that I mentioned earlier.

118
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,310
Now, together, these metrics
enable data-driven decisions

119
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,430
that optimize performance
while keeping athletes healthy

120
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,480
and ready to compete.

121
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,490
And with that, I wanna introduce Vector 8.

122
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,800
Now, Vector 8 is Catapult's
next-gen solution

123
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,860
for athlete monitoring,
designed for both elite and

124
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,020
competitive sports environments.

125
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,780
Now, Vector 8 consists
of four main components.

126
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,060
First, we have the Vector 8 tag,

127
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,220
and this is what was shown in the video.

128
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,110
It is compact, rugged, and
packed with advanced features.

129
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,160
It uses GNSS and local positioning

130
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,360
for precise location tracking,

131
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,133
and it works seamlessly
indoors and outdoors.

132
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,280
It captures sport-specific events,

133
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,030
monitors heart rate,
processes data onboard,

134
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,030
and supports integration
with third-party Bluetooth

135
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,720
and ultra-wideband UWB sensors,

136
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,463
and offers up to six
hours of battery life.

137
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,750
Now, ultra-wideband, or UWB,
for those that don't know,

138
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,460
is a wireless communication technology

139
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,940
that uses short-range,
low-power radio signals

140
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,250
to enable precise location tracking

141
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,260
and secure data transfer.

142
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,000
Now, it's important to
note that each athlete

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,593
has their own Vector 8 tag.

144
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,320
The Vector 8 dock is used
post-session or post-match,

145
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,170
and the tag gets placed
back into the dock.

146
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,460
Now, the Vector 8 dock
enables fast Wi-Fi downloads

147
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,960
and effortless data syncing
directly to the cloud.

148
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,940
It supports easy workflows,

149
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,820
manages devices locally or remotely,

150
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,700
and its onboard computing
means you can use it anywhere

151
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,800
without the need for additional equipment.

152
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,880
Next, we have the Vector 8 receiver.

153
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,460
Now, this connects via
both Wi-Fi and ethernet,

154
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,390
and it streams live data to
the cloud for instant analysis,

155
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,900
supports both online
and offline workflows,

156
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,160
and provides real-time diagnostics

157
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,100
for performance and troubleshooting.

158
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,100
Finally, we have the Vector 8 relay,

159
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,460
and this increases coverage
across larger venues,

160
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,370
eliminating the need
for multiple receivers.

161
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,940
It boasts a 400-meter
range in a compact form,

162
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,780
making scalable deployments
efficient and cost-effective.

163
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,080
Now, together, these
components make Vector 8

164
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,770
a powerful suite for
collecting, streaming,

165
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,840
and analyzing athlete data,

166
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,723
advancing both training and
in-game decision-making.

167
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,970
Now, I wanna talk about how they do this,

168
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,230
and this is where I introduce our

169
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,793
first AWS service of the day.

170
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,600
AWS IoT Core is a managed service

171
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,620
that provides scalable and
highly available endpoint

172
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,680
in the cloud, meaning you
have an endpoint there

173
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,820
so you don't need to create
one for every device.

174
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,743
It provides device
authentication and authorization,

175
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,180
encryption in transit,
device management at scale,

176
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,230
which is crucial for Catapult's use case,

177
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,243
and then, most importantly,
the rules engine.

178
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,510
Now, the rules engine is
how you glue the application

179
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,300
to the data coming through to IoT Core.

180
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,480
The rules engine is the
bind between IoT Core

181
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,200
and your application to manage
a large fleet of devices,

182
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,980
ranging in the thousands
to tens of thousands.

183
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,970
That's what makes this a great service

184
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,700
to underpin Catapult's
Vector 8 technology,

185
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,500
and Greg will go into more detail later on

186
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,213
on the extent that they use it.

187
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,480
Now, before we dive a bit deeper

188
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,480
into how Catapult does this,

189
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,500
I wanna talk about the
different ingestion paths

190
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,373
and the different type of data
that Catapult can collect.

191
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,880
First, we have the device health.

192
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,100
Now, this is the battery
status in the firmware version

193
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,663
of the Vector 8 tag itself.

194
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,690
We then have hot data.

195
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,580
Now, this is live, in-game,
or in-practice data

196
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,700
that's sampled at 10 hertz,

197
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,980
and this includes things
like acceleration,

198
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,193
velocity, player positioning,
and heart rate monitoring.

199
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,660
Finally, we have the cold data.

200
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,300
Now, this is post-game or post-practice,

201
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,870
and it is raw inertial
data sampled at 100 hertz,

202
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,260
and this makes the basis of
the machine learning inference

203
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,400
that Catapult runs.

204
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,920
They do it on the cold
data in a batched approach

205
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,413
rather than streaming it
through to the hot data.

206
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,380
But what does this look like?

207
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,520
So let's start with the device health,

208
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,240
and this is during a game or practice.

209
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,470
Now, this slide illustrates

210
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,540
the real-time device health
monitoring architecture,

211
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,600
and this is a critical operational feature

212
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,040
for maintaining fleet reliability

213
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,170
during live games and practice.

214
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,900
Now, it starts with the
player wearing a Vector 8 tag,

215
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,690
and then their data, or the
data that's been ingested,

216
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,053
is transmitted by UWB to
the Catapult receiver.

217
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,450
Now, the receiver's on the sideline,

218
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,300
meaning there is low latency
and high-precision tracking.

219
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,470
From the receiver, this
publishes device telemetry

220
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,100
via MQTT to AWS IoT Core.

221
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,460
This creates a secure,
scalable ingestion pipeline

222
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,293
that can handle data

223
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,210
from hundreds of devices simultaneously.

224
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,010
Now, AWS IoT Rules engine
processes incoming messages

225
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,030
and routes them to Amazon MSK,
our managed Kafka service,

226
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,310
for real-time streaming and buffering,

227
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,043
ensuring we never lose
critical device health data.

228
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,340
Now, from MSK, data flows

229
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,950
to Amazon Elastic
Container Service, or ECS,

230
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,740
where Catapult's containerized
analytics services run.

231
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,730
Now, this process has battery
levels, firmware versions,

232
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,480
and other diagnostics in real-time.

233
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,250
Results are exposed
through Amazon API Gateway

234
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,980
and delivered to the
Catapult web interface.

235
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,260
This is where coaches
and equipment managers

236
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,483
can monitor device status at a glance.

237
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,290
Now, an example of a payload
is there on the screen.

238
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,540
We can see battery, we can
see the firmware version,

239
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,880
and this enables proactive intervention

240
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,933
before devices fail
during critical moments.

241
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,220
Now, prior to AWS IoT, Catapult
lacked the observability

242
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,660
of device status, health, and usage.

243
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,203
Now, they have that in
real-time for every device.

244
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,900
Now, this AWS-powered architecture

245
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,870
ensures high availability, scalability,

246
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,710
and real-time visibility
into the entire device fleet,

247
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,463
minimizing downtime and maximizing
performance reliability.

248
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,840
Let's take a look at the hot data.

249
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,010
Now, this architecture delivers

250
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,500
real-time athlete
performance done at 10 hertz,

251
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,650
as previously mentioned,
or 10 updates per second.

252
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,650
And this enables coaches to
make split-second decision

253
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,200
during games and practices.

254
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,330
And there are inertial
sensors on the tags,

255
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,560
as mentioned previously,

256
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,513
for precise positioning and tracking.

257
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,710
Now, the tags transmit
via UWB to the receiver

258
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,350
and then stream data to the mobile devices

259
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,800
and web applications.

260
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,340
Now, the payloads are
updated in real-time,

261
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,170
and here is a small example.

262
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,030
As you can see, there's a heart rate,

263
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,810
the position, the velocity,
and the acceleration.

264
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,910
Now, coaches can see
instant visualizations

265
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,470
on their iOS apps.

266
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,930
They can see player workload comparisons,

267
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,610
positioning heat maps,

268
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,600
and individual metrics on these devices.

269
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,520
This enables in-the-moment interventions,

270
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,770
substituting fatigued players,

271
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,780
adjusting tactics based
on movement patterns,

272
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,633
and preventing injuries
before they happen.

273
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,560
Finally, we have the cold data.

274
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,330
And this is the post-game, post-practice,

275
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,863
sampled at 100 hertz.

276
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,213
And this is what Catapult uses
to run their ML inference on.

277
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,540
Now, just to put some numbers in the air,

278
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,450
a two-hour session with 30 athletes

279
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,540
can upload to S3 in less than 30 seconds.

280
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,540
To put even more numbers
on, let's take an NHL game.

281
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,020
Assume it's a two-and-a-half-hour game,

282
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,190
20 athletes each side, so 40 athletes,

283
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,040
all wearing Vector 8 tags,

284
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,250
and inertial data that's
sampled at 100 hertz.

285
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,300
That's 900,000 data points per athlete

286
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,280
in that two-and-a-half-hour game,

287
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,950
which means 36 million
data points are captured

288
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,450
in a two-and-a-half-hour game.

289
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,210
We've spoken about the ingestion of data,

290
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,990
and what this looks
like, and how it's done.

291
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,380
And I wanna talk about now

292
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,900
what happens after that data's ingested.

293
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,300
Now, I'm gonna mention some metrics,

294
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,120
but we don't have the time
for me to mention all of them,

295
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,790
as Catapult can create 600 unique metrics

296
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,813
per player per game.

297
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,650
Now, I'm gonna put up on the screen

298
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,020
a couple of different sports,

299
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,330
and a couple of the different
sport-specific metrics

300
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,280
that can be captured per each sport,

301
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,590
and I'll let you have a little read of it.

302
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,710
But Vector 8 delivers AI-driven,
sports-specific live data,

303
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:00,333
so coaches can monitor athlete
output in any environment.

304
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,590
This is essentially automated
performance insights,

305
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,660
and Catapult runs its
machine learning algorithms

306
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,550
on top of the cold data,

307
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,840
and processes large data
sets quickly and accurately

308
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,350
to identify trends and patterns

309
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,070
that might be missed by the human eye.

310
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,530
Now, these sports-specific
movements are very important,

311
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,510
but I wanna think about it
from the coach's perspective.

312
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,200
I have some customers back in Australia

313
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,000
that prior to using Catapult,

314
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,280
spent over eight hours a weekend

315
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,430
looking through video, just coding events.

316
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,890
Post-implementation of Catapult,

317
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,330
that's almost, they've
almost halved the time taken

318
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,310
by being able to identify
these events automatically,

319
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,250
not through video, but just through tags.

320
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,590
And I'll get to it a bit later on,

321
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,200
on what happens when
you can intersect data

322
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,890
that is collected from
these devices and video.

323
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,100
Now, one metric I spoke about
earlier was player load,

324
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,933
and you might be wondering

325
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:58,620
why we've just entered a math session,

326
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,870
and for anyone who has done math,

327
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,940
the minuses are not meant to be subscript,

328
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,803
they're meant to be subtractions.

329
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,020
But let me define player load,

330
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,630
and then let me contextualize
what this means.

331
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,910
So player load is the
sum of the accelerations

332
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,900
across all axes of the
internal triaxial accelerometer

333
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,733
during movement.

334
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,740
That's a lot of words.

335
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,270
This was originally developed

336
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,710
by the Australian Institute of Sport

337
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,293
with Rugby Union as a customer in mind.

338
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,670
And it's important to know
that the output of this

339
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,830
is just in arbitrary units.

340
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,030
This is a volume measurement.

341
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,640
It is how much work a player has done.

342
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,190
This can be used to compare
players to each other,

343
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,170
or it can be used to compare
a player's workload over time

344
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,440
to see how they're returning from injury

345
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,750
or whether they are
tracking towards an injury.

346
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,100
Now, it has advantages over
using something like distance

347
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,090
as an effort metric,

348
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,540
because it can accumulate during tackles,

349
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,060
ruck work, and non-running activities

350
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,503
or off-the-ball activities.

351
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,080
To contextualize, I'm
gonna use an example.

352
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,240
I love tennis, I'm a big tennis player.

353
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,700
Hopefully there are some
others in the crowd.

354
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,290
Let's assume I'm coming back from injury

355
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:14,280
and my player load for a session is 200.

356
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,950
Like I said, arbitrary unit.

357
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,890
The effort that I had
for that session was 200.

358
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,780
Coach is happy, I'm happy,

359
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,030
my performance looked pretty good.

360
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,020
The next session, my
player load is now 300.

361
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,850
So I'm working 50% harder

362
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,710
than I was in the previous session.

363
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,683
But my output has dropped a little bit.

364
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,863
So this can identify a couple things.

365
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,850
I'm working harder, but
my performance is worse.

366
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,730
Maybe I'm not ready to
come back from injury,

367
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,880
or maybe I've aggravated
something as well.

368
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,830
Now I wanna be very clear, this
is not a definitive metric.

369
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,150
This is something that can be used

370
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,710
as an input to other statistics.

371
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,310
It can be used as an input
metric with rhetoric,

372
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,380
how did I feel during the game,

373
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,130
or it can be used with other stats.

374
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,760
Now a customer of mine in Australia

375
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,650
started implementing this,

376
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,290
and they decided to delay
the return of a player

377
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,670
by a number of weeks,

378
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,110
'cause they noticed that their player load

379
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,210
was continuously higher

380
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,740
when they had come back
from injury earlier,

381
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,340
but their output was
significantly less than normal.

382
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,470
Like I said, this is a volume measure

383
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,290
and an example of how much effort

384
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,873
a player has put into a session or a game.

385
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,160
And speaking of effort,

386
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,680
Catapult provides effort
breakdown reports.

387
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,310
And this consists of three main sections.

388
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,690
We have effort profiles,

389
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,000
which is each acceleration
of velocity event

390
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,950
per player that is tracked,

391
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,163
and we'll see what this
looks like in a second.

392
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,410
We have effort location mapping,

393
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,630
and this is a visual representation,

394
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,540
and we'll use soccer as
an example in a second,

395
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,240
around where exactly on a field or pitch

396
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,490
has that effort occurred.

397
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,433
And finally, we have the velocity traces.

398
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,480
Now coaches can visualize
how speed builds and fades

399
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,333
across each individual
effort for each player.

400
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,293
But let's see what this looks like.

401
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,550
Now there's a lot happening on the screen,

402
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,410
but I wanna focus on the
bottom left area first.

403
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,883
Now this is a detailed
profile of every effort.

404
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,100
Each acceleration or velocity
event is analyzed by duration,

405
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,770
peak intensity, and recovery time

406
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,710
to help understand the physiological load

407
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,423
and tactical purpose of each effort.

408
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,730
To the right, you'll see a soccer pitch.

409
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,123
Now this is the effort location mapping.

410
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,690
Coaches can view exactly where each effort

411
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,310
occurred on the field.

412
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,670
Now this brings context
to high-speed movements

413
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,683
and context to the effort
profiles on the left.

414
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,690
And finally, we have the
high-resolution velocity trace.

415
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,190
Now with access to a 10
hertz raw velocity trace,

416
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,950
practitioners can clearly
see how speed builds

417
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,570
and fades across each effort.

418
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,840
Now this supports deeper quality control

419
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,340
and a better understanding
of the player's output.

420
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,140
Now effort breakdown
gives coaches the tools

421
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,020
to move from assumption to precision.

422
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,870
By turning raw movement
into actionable insight,

423
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,390
teams can design smarter drills,

424
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,350
manage workload with greater control,

425
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,610
and ensure players are executing

426
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,293
exactly what the game demands.

427
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,860
Now in the video earlier,

428
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,550
you may have seen a screen similar to this

429
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,983
being played through.

430
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,530
Now it's important to note
that that wearable data

431
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,530
without any context or video
is essentially just noise.

432
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,790
It can be used for analytics,

433
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,823
but it can't really explain
what happened on the pitch.

434
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,953
So what does Vector 8 do?

435
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,910
Vector 8 automatically pushes
athlete performance data

436
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,570
into Catapult's Pro Video suite.

437
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,030
This allows users to align physical output

438
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,703
with what actually happened
on the pitch or field.

439
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,600
Coaches and analysts can review, tag,

440
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,390
and explain moments of
interest immediately,

441
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,590
improving athlete
understanding and engagement.

442
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,380
You can capture,
synchronize, and live stream

443
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,313
multi-angle video on any
device from any location.

444
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,270
This is a way of integrating
player performance

445
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,830
to data, to video, to uncover new context

446
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,810
to team and player performance.

447
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,930
The fusion of video and
wearable athlete data

448
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,290
is changing the way that
people think about sport.

449
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,970
It is helping back decision-making,

450
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,250
it is helping quantify return to play,

451
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,283
and hopefully in the future
it'll be able to prevent injury.

452
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,820
Now we've spoken about Catapult,

453
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,190
we've spoken about the
data that they can ingest,

454
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,340
what type of metrics they
can create on top of it,

455
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,570
but let's take a deeper look

456
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:56,570
into how they leverage AWS to do so.

457
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,580
- Thanks, Mike.

458
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,500
Good afternoon, everyone.

459
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,100
So we're going to dive
a little bit deeper now

460
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,520
into how Catapult are
using AWS IoT services

461
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,530
to build their Vector 8 product,

462
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,120
the benefits they're deriving,

463
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,220
but also the value it's
helping them create

464
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,873
for their customers.

465
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,930
We'll start by looking at

466
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,063
their device software architecture.

467
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,820
AWS IoT Greengrass is a service

468
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,250
that Catapult are using as the foundation

469
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,580
for the Vector 8 dock and receiver.

470
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,400
So to briefly introduce the service,

471
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,140
Greengrass is two things.

472
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,660
It's an edge runtime and a cloud service

473
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,580
that helps you build, deploy, and manage

474
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,803
a multiprocess IoT application at scale.

475
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,190
The edge runtime is open source,

476
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,740
it's available on the cloud,
it's available on GitHub.

477
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,090
The processes or services that you manage

478
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,663
using Greengrass are modeled
as so-called components.

479
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,250
Those components can be
executables, binaries,

480
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,280
scripts, container images,

481
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,470
pretty much any code
that you could otherwise

482
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,420
run on the device you can run

483
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,223
under the control of Greengrass.

484
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,590
As soon as you have a
multiprocess application,

485
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,210
you have dependencies.

486
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,020
Greengrass helps Catapult with that

487
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,280
by supporting component versioning

488
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,903
and component dependency resolution.

489
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,223
It also supports logging for diagnostics.

490
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,930
We have a large collection
of pre-built AWS components

491
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,733
to solve common challenges.

492
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,660
And it has inter-process communication,

493
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,660
IPC for sending messages
between components,

494
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,740
between processes,

495
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,610
but also to access some
advanced Greengrass features,

496
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,623
which I'll talk about shortly.

497
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,540
So, looking at the software architecture

498
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,440
at a very high level, the
architecture of the docks

499
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,600
and the receivers for Vector 8.

500
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,530
At the bottom, we have an
embedded Linux operating system

501
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,070
with the Greengrass edge
runtime sitting just above that,

502
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,620
and it's managing a
multiprocess application

503
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,620
which is comprised of
Catapult custom components

504
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,770
complemented by AWS provided components.

505
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,600
And I'm going to go to some detail

506
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,613
about some of these components.

507
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,190
Moving from the general to the specific,

508
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:42,220
let's take a look inside the
receiver software architecture.

509
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,090
As you saw earlier with
what Mike showed you

510
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,830
with the data ingestion,

511
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,830
the tags communicate wirelessly
using UWB to the receiver.

512
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,480
Inside the receiver software,

513
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,030
there is the data
processor custom component

514
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,570
developed by Catapult that
is receiving that data.

515
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,300
So that's the device health
data that Mike mentioned,

516
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,940
but also the live data,

517
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,613
the 10 hertz in-game and in-session data.

518
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,060
That data processor component

519
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:15,810
uses the inter-process
communication feature of Greengrass

520
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:20,810
to publish the device health
messages to AWS IoT Core

521
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,550
via the Greengrass nucleus,

522
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,463
which is the heart of the
Greengrass edge runtime.

523
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,960
Greengrass includes a message spooler.

524
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,280
And what this is useful for

525
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,780
is if there's any loss of
connectivity for the dock,

526
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,600
if it loses internet connection,

527
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,180
Greengrass can buffer those
device health messages

528
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,570
and send them later when
connectivity is restored.

529
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,600
So this saves Catapult having to build

530
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,000
that undifferentiated
heavy lifting themselves

531
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,763
to just do the buffering and the retries.

532
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,400
Additionally, Catapult
have custom components

533
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,400
that deploy a database, a
RESTful API, and a web server.

534
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,100
And those are used to serve
that 10 hertz live in-game

535
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,000
or in-practice session
data to the iOS apps

536
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,380
that are on the sidelines

537
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,233
that the coaches and the
sports scientists are using.

538
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,170
Moving on to the dock,
as you heard earlier,

539
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,840
when the tags are used with the dock,

540
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,060
they get placed back into the dock.

541
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,520
Part of that's for recharging

542
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,593
as well as for getting data off the tags.

543
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,720
And so when the tags
are placed in the dock,

544
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,913
it's a wired connection, not wireless.

545
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,420
In this case, on the dock,

546
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,630
there's a custom component
called the Retriever component

547
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,030
that is able to go
retrieve that cold data,

548
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,230
that raw 100 hertz post-game data,

549
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,420
and retrieve it as data files

550
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,990
and write that to disk on the dock.

551
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,640
Then the raw file upload custom component

552
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
retrieves those data files

553
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,420
and publishes them to
the Amazon S3 bucket.

554
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,710
And as you heard from Mike,

555
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,780
this whole process to get all the data

556
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,260
from all the athletes from one
game or one training session

557
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,963
typically takes just tens of seconds.

558
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,770
Device onboarding or
device first-time setup.

559
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,233
This is a really big topic for Catapult.

560
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,120
For the Vector 8, they had a goal

561
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,710
that onboarding should be
a self-service experience

562
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,830
that enables the customer
to go from unboxing

563
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,983
to athlete tracking in
less than 10 minutes.

564
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,820
To understand why they had that goal,

565
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,290
let's rewind and talk about

566
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,440
how their previous product
generation, the Vector 7,

567
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,483
how it worked for first-time setup.

568
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,860
Vector 7 wasn't a connected product.

569
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,370
It wasn't an Internet of Things thing.

570
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,430
For Catapult's customers,
when they got Vector 7,

571
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,990
they would unbox the device

572
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,870
and they would need to
install a desktop application

573
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,340
on their laptops.

574
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,720
They would then book an appointment

575
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,880
with Catapult customer support,

576
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,010
wait for that appointment to come around,

577
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,020
and then work with customer support

578
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,710
to configure the devices, to
apply any firmware updates

579
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,100
that had been published
since the device was shipped,

580
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,200
and then test and make sure the devices

581
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,150
were in a working state.

582
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,300
It was a long process, typically
in the order of two days,

583
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,450
but at least many hours,
and it was very hands-on

584
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,020
for both Catapult customer support

585
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,583
and also for Catapult's customers.

586
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,590
Now, with Vector 8, the
first-time setup process

587
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,660
is more akin to what you're used to

588
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,740
in setting up any consumer-grade
electronics device.

589
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,200
The customer is unboxing the device,

590
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,110
installing the Catapult
app on their phone,

591
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,770
registering that device within the app,

592
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,960
and that also provisions

593
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,243
the Wi-Fi credentials on the device,

594
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,200
and then the device is able
to connect to the cloud

595
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,050
and automatically pull
down the configuration

596
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,540
and any firmware updates,

597
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,660
and finally publish its status at the end.

598
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,390
From go to woe, a 10-minute process,

599
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,750
no involvement of
Catapult customer support,

600
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,260
and a much more seamless
experience for the customer.

601
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,023
So, good for Catapult and
good for their customers.

602
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,130
In terms of the value that AWS IoT brings,

603
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,990
it's helping with the scale

604
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,780
and the automation of device provisioning,

605
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,263
configuration, updates,
and status reporting.

606
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,720
Okay, so I mentioned device updates,

607
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,233
but there's a lot of detail
there, so let's unpack that.

608
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:56,610
At AWS, security is job
zero, but in the IoT domain,

609
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,480
I like to say that over-the-air
update is feature zero.

610
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,650
It's the foundation on which
you can build everything else.

611
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,450
If you have over-the-air update,

612
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,430
you can easily add new features

613
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,470
and enhancements to your devices

614
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,470
even after they've shipped to the field.

615
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,800
You're able to easily patch
your devices at scale,

616
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,740
resolving bugs, resolving
customer support issues,

617
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,110
and helping to prevent other customers

618
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,883
from reporting the same issues.

619
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,950
Over-the-air update also
helps to enable innovation

620
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,230
because you're able to
iterate more quickly,

621
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,880
iterate your device software

622
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,180
and help build features
that customers want quickly

623
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,103
in response to customer feedback.

624
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,620
So you saw earlier that
the docks and the receivers

625
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,510
are using Greengrass.

626
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,710
Greengrass supports over-the-air
update out-of-the-box

627
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,623
using a feature called
Greengrass deployments.

628
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,150
Greengrass deployments allow Catapult

629
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,460
to define a set of components

630
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,020
that should be deployed to
a dock or to a receiver.

631
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,120
Some of the components are
shared between the two,

632
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,640
but they also each have
some unique components

633
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,240
'cause they do different things.

634
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,550
With those deployments, it
can target a single device,

635
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,070
but it can also target a group of devices.

636
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,140
So a deployment can operate at scale

637
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,113
by deploying to a large
collection of devices.

638
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,050
It's resilient to
intermittent connectivity.

639
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,450
What this means is when
Greengrass receives a deployment,

640
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,210
it needs to pull down
those component artifacts,

641
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,840
the program binaries,
executables, container images.

642
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,440
If there's any interruption
in the connectivity,

643
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,870
Greengrass will handle all the retries,

644
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,640
all the pausing and the resuming

645
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,850
and get all of those
artifacts to the device,

646
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,830
saving Catapult from having to build

647
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,573
that boilerplate themselves.

648
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,170
Updates are granular.

649
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,650
That means that Greengrass
calculates the delta

650
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,710
between its current state and
what the deployment demands,

651
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,670
and it only downloads what it needs

652
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,653
to make its state match what's
specified in the deployment.

653
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,730
It has rollout and rollback configuration.

654
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,350
If Catapult make a deployment

655
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,450
that includes a faulty component

656
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,660
that fails to start up and
goes into a broken state,

657
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,670
Greengrass will automatically revert

658
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,710
to the previous deployment state,

659
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,100
leaving the dock or receiver
in a good working state,

660
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,733
again, saving Catapult from
having to build that capability.

661
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:34,770
And finally, it integrates
with operating system updates.

662
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,970
Catapult have done that.

663
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,680
They're able to patch and update

664
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,370
and manage that embedded
Linux operating system

665
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,723
using Greengrass deployments.

666
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,570
Okay, so for the docks and the receivers,

667
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,970
it's straightforward because
it works out of the box

668
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,400
just using what Greengrass offers.

669
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,250
With the tags, it's a
little more complicated.

670
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,020
The tags run FreeRTOS,

671
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,050
they're microcontroller-based devices,

672
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:05,040
but the UWB interface
they have is bespoke,

673
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,220
a custom protocol, and
so is the wide protocol

674
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,340
when the devices go to the dock.

675
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,520
Consequently, there's something, yeah,

676
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,133
a little more bespoke
for updating the tags.

677
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,850
Catapult begin by making
a Greengrass deployment

678
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,880
to the dock that transfers
the tag firmware binary

679
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,300
from the cloud to the dock.

680
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,290
They then use an AWS
IoT feature called Jobs

681
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,380
to trigger the update process.

682
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,830
The device manager custom
component subscribes

683
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:42,180
to the necessary MQTT
topics to be notified

684
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,450
of when a job comes in, and
it does that subscription

685
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:49,500
over the IPC feature
that Greengrass offers.

686
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,260
And then when the tags
are returned to the dock,

687
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,200
the device manager custom
component disseminates

688
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,420
that tag firmware binary
into each of the tags.

689
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,080
So this is powerful for Catapult

690
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,140
because after they create
a deployment in the cloud,

691
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,500
essentially the next time the
tags get returned to the dock,

692
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,913
they will be updated.

693
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,520
So let's talk about
then what is the impact

694
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,460
or the benefit that Catapult are getting

695
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,483
from AWS IoT and the over-the-air updates.

696
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,200
The really big one is compared

697
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,450
to their Vector & product generation,

698
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:31,380
it's 32 times faster
based on their own data.

699
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:35,130
A big part of why it's faster
is previously with Vector &,

700
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,780
the customer was in the loop.

701
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,550
They needed to help with their laptops

702
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,880
and that desktop application
to get tags updated.

703
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,540
Now it's an automated process.

704
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:48,003
As soon as the tags go back
into the dock, they're updated.

705
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,260
Another benefit that comes
from that same reason

706
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,080
is essentially almost
every tag in the fleet

707
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,360
is always running the latest firmware.

708
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,130
If the tag goes back into a dock

709
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,730
after an update's published,
it gets the latest firmware.

710
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,950
The only tags not running latest firmware

711
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,870
are whatever small percentage

712
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,780
just haven't been returned to
a dock for whatever reason.

713
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,540
They're misplaced, they're
lost, so on and so forth.

714
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,660
This aspect is really powerful

715
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,820
because in their previous
product generation,

716
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,790
according to Catapult's
own historical data,

717
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:25,170
more than 50% of customer
support issues were resolved

718
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,770
just by updating their devices
to the latest firmware.

719
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:32,280
Now in Vector 8, that
just happens automatically

720
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,140
and hence there's a big collapse

721
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,570
in the number of customer support cases.

722
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,140
That's obviously good for Catapult

723
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,083
and good for their customers.

724
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,720
Over-the-air update also
helps to underpin innovation.

725
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,880
If you want to innovate,

726
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,530
it helps to be able to
rapidly iterate your ideation,

727
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,450
your execution, and your delivery

728
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,300
to have an efficient development process.

729
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,350
So normally you'll ideate and
plan, you'll build new value,

730
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,980
you'll deploy your new
increment, and in an IoT sense,

731
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,533
that means getting it
onto physical devices.

732
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,417
You test, you measure, you update,

733
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:15,540
you learn, you gather
your customer feedback,

734
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,673
and then you begin the cycle anew.

735
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,090
The quicker that you can
get around this flywheel,

736
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,820
the more enabled you are to innovate.

737
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,297
And as you just saw,
Catapult now with Vector 8

738
00:36:27,297 --> 00:36:30,213
are much faster on the deployment part.

739
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,020
And with that 97% penetration rate,

740
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,820
when they do make a deployment,

741
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,410
it's also getting into the hands

742
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,690
of a lot more customers a lot more quickly

743
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,090
and hence there's more
feedback and more learnings

744
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,130
and more testing happening.

745
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,710
So half of this flywheel
is much more performant

746
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,010
because of the Vector
8 over-the-air updates.

747
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,820
And this put pressure on the
other two parts to be faster.

748
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,450
And in particular, put pressure
on Catapult's firmware team.

749
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,510
So much so that they changed
the way that they worked.

750
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,020
They've swapped now from a
Kanban process to Sprints.

751
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,130
Their release cadence has
moved from months to weeks,

752
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,990
and in some cases, even days,

753
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,060
particularly when developing new features

754
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,680
and doing beta testing.

755
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,870
When they're working with
their beta customers,

756
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,300
they're able to iterate
at very high velocity

757
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,220
to help develop the feature that

758
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,500
the customer actually wants.

759
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,180
And again, that's good for Catapult

760
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,193
and good for their customers.

761
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,903
Okay, device configuration.

762
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,030
Every wearable device has
quite a large collection

763
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,220
of configuration parameters.

764
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,220
And now with the cloud
connectivity available to Catapult,

765
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,490
they're interested in having the tags

766
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,590
also being configured from the cloud,

767
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,773
not needing applications at the edge.

768
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,070
Configuration settings include things

769
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,590
like individual athlete settings,

770
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,010
metric settings relating to
the sport-specific movements,

771
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,670
and also specific requirements
of different teams,

772
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,430
different coaches,
different sports scientists,

773
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,880
and also things like
radio frequency settings

774
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,130
to help tune that wireless communication

775
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:14,583
between tags and the receivers
in different environments.

776
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,710
Catapult are using an AWS
IoT feature called Shadows

777
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,780
to help them with configuration.

778
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,680
Shadows are JSON documents that AWS IoT

779
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,223
helps you synchronize between
the cloud and your device.

780
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:34,500
On Greengrass, there is
an AWS-provided component

781
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,660
called Shadow Manager that implements

782
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,050
the device-side part of this feature.

783
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,880
So you can just use it off the shelf

784
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,150
to get shadow functionality
onto your devices,

785
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,450
and that's what Catapult
have done with their docs.

786
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:52,740
So when a vector web user
modifies the configuration,

787
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,200
the Shadow Manager sees
that the shadow document

788
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,840
in the cloud has changed.

789
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,460
It automatically synchronizes that

790
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,740
to a local shadow database.

791
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,140
The Device Manager custom component

792
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,140
can use the inter-process
communication feature

793
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,180
to retrieve those shadow documents,

794
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,020
and the next time the
tags come back to the doc,

795
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,890
they automatically receive
the latest configuration.

796
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,200
So like the over-the-air update,

797
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,880
you make the change in the cloud.

798
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,490
The next time the tags
come back into the doc,

799
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,723
they get the change.

800
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,590
So the value here for Catapult is

801
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,420
this is quite decoupled now.

802
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,180
Configuration changes
can be made in the cloud,

803
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,850
safe in the knowledge, even
when the doc is offline,

804
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:39,390
even when the tags are in
use, safe in the knowledge

805
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,820
the next time the tags
are returned to the doc,

806
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,220
they'll get that latest configuration.

807
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,560
There's no customer in the loop anymore.

808
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,020
Previously for configuration updates,

809
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,630
the customer was involved
using their laptop

810
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,880
and desktop application.

811
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,840
They're out of the loop.

812
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,700
It's less burdensome for them.

813
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,770
They can also make configuration changes

814
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,710
for some of the configuration
parameters in the cloud.

815
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,940
It's good for Catapult.

816
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,533
It's good for their customers.

817
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,173
Okay, device diagnostics.

818
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,660
Rewinding again to Vector
7 product generation,

819
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,460
Catapult were relying
heavily on TeamViewer

820
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,160
to be able to reach their
devices for diagnostic purposes.

821
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,510
They would ask their customers

822
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,700
to run TeamViewer on their laptops

823
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,320
so their customer support people

824
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,450
could have a remote session.

825
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:33,330
Now with AWS IoT, they have the ability

826
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,033
to access their devices
much more directly.

827
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,770
Secure tunneling is an AWS IoT feature

828
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:44,010
that Catapult are using
for remote SSH sessions

829
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,260
into the docs and the receivers.

830
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,410
And again, there's an
AWS provided component,

831
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,830
a secure tunneling component

832
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:55,050
that makes it easy to
implement that on your devices

833
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,840
and Catapult are using that
on their docs and receivers.

834
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,070
It's included in their
Greengrass deployments.

835
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,150
Now when a customer support engineer

836
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,330
needs a remote session
with a doc or a receiver,

837
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:10,140
they go to the AWS
console, create a tunnel,

838
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,830
a notification with a
secure access token is sent,

839
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:17,430
and the secure tunneling
component creates a tunnel

840
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,490
between the cloud and the SSH daemon

841
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,953
running on the doc or the receiver.

842
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,990
And then the customer support engineer

843
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,670
has an SSH session in place.

844
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,530
Again, the value here, previously,

845
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:37,140
they had to have the
customer involved hands-on,

846
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,850
team view was involved.

847
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,590
There's no customer appointment anymore,

848
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,840
there's no burden on the customer anymore,

849
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,670
they just need to consent to
Catapult accessing the devices.

850
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,860
Catapult have easy access.

851
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,650
But also, secure tunneling doesn't require

852
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,990
any inbound open ports.

853
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,650
It makes a connection
using a 443 port outbound

854
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,900
and ephemeral inbound ports,

855
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,200
and hence, this also
works behind firewalls.

856
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,810
All of this together,
it's good for Catapult,

857
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,433
it's good for their customers.

858
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,483
And lastly, Log Manager.

859
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:17,670
Log Manager is another
AWS provided component.

860
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:21,270
Previously, if Catapult
needed to get to device logs

861
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,340
with their Vector 7, they would, again,

862
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,640
be relying on team viewer
and customer involvement.

863
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,360
Now, with Log Manager, it's
able to grab the log files

864
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,870
from the custom components
and also from Greengrass

865
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,750
and publish those to Amazon CloudWatch.

866
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,020
Customer support are able
to access those device logs

867
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,063
at any time in CloudWatch.

868
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:46,590
So it's near real-time logs in the cloud,

869
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,970
all the time, always
accessible to Catapult.

870
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:53,190
Again, no customer appointment needed,

871
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,080
no burden on the customer anymore

872
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,390
when Catapult need device logs.

873
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,310
I think you know what I'm going to say,

874
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,493
that's good for Catapult,
that's good for their customers.

875
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,803
Okay, one last slide on future outlook.

876
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:14,280
We've got a lot of benefits
and a lot of functionality

877
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,890
that Catapult are getting
now by having their devices

878
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:20,670
being cloud-connected, by being
Internet of Things things,

879
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,990
but there's maybe some other things

880
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,253
that they can do as well.

881
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,820
You saw earlier that
the 10 hertz live data

882
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:31,290
streams only from the
device to the iOS apps

883
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,970
that are on the sideline,

884
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:35,400
but something that Catapult
are interested in doing

885
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,250
is streaming that data live to the cloud

886
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,330
that can be used for in-game analytics

887
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:44,730
during matches, during
practice sessions in the cloud,

888
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:47,790
but it would also enable remote access

889
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,500
for coaches and sports scientists

890
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,213
who are not on the sidelines.

891
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,220
With what Mike showed you earlier,

892
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,460
the ML inference was happening
on the post-processing

893
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,590
after games and after practice sessions

894
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,540
and happening in the cloud.

895
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,180
We didn't go to this detail at all,

896
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,820
but Catapult do have a
small amount of ML inference

897
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,820
happening on the device,
but not a great deal.

898
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,680
They're interested in perhaps shifting

899
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,960
more of that machine learning inference

900
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,360
to the edge on either the
receiver or even the tags

901
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,400
so that these insights can be performed

902
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,263
during games, during practice sessions.

903
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,580
And part of why they're
interested in that now

904
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,783
is the OTA update mechanism
makes this much more feasible.

905
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,780
Previously with Vector 7,

906
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,440
with the inference models
on the edge on the device,

907
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,570
Catapult didn't really have a good ability

908
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,390
to update those, to iterate them,

909
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:48,810
to enhance them and innovate over time.

910
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,150
Now, because they have OTA update,

911
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:55,230
they're able to consider
deploying more models to the edge

912
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,060
because they will be able to manage them

913
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,100
and iterate them and enhance them.

914
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,400
And so they can have a true MLOps pipeline

915
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,043
deploying all the way to the device.

916
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,160
They're looking also into AI
analysis of team-wide tag data

917
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,700
in regards to team movements,
players moving as a group

918
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,460
and team tactics,

919
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:21,060
and also AI for natural
language search of video,

920
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:25,200
for example, models like
multimodal embeddings models,

921
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,333
which are powerful for that use case.

922
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,520
And that's it, we've arrived at the end.

923
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,100
Mike and I thank you very much

924
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,260
for your attendance and attention.

925
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,450
We'd like to please ask you give

926
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,970
us your feedback in the app.

927
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,080
We'd really appreciate it

928
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,700
if you could take the time to do that.

929
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,130
And if you'd like to
connect with us on LinkedIn,

930
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:49,173
we would be more than happy to do so.
