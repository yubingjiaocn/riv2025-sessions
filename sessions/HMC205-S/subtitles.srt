1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,330
- Good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,800
My name is Pankaj Kumar.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,600
I lead at AWS practice for
energy and few other markets.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,230
And with me we have a very special client

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,720
who keep Las Vegas warm.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,830
Please welcome Laxman from Southwest Gas.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,200
- Thank you.
- And Kalyan.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,080
So today we are gonna talk
about a very different subject.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,420
Like, I know there's a
lot being talked about,

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,550
cool agentic AI applications

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,880
and how it's, you know,
being applied to business.

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,900
What we are gonna talk about

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,060
is the readiness for agentic AI.

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,440
We heard in the morning

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,020
there is a lot of boring work

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,970
that goes behind being ready.

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,640
So we are gonna talk a little bit on that.

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,620
This is the agenda that we'll cover.

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,380
So we'll start with the
introduction to Southwest Gas.

20
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,213
Laxman.

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,920
- Thank you Pankaj.

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,593
Good afternoon everyone,
welcome to Las Vegas.

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,230
We are Southwest Gas.

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,690
We are based out of Las Vegas,

25
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,070
headquarters in Las Vegas,
and we serve three states,

26
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,883
Arizona, California, and Nevada.

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,020
We serve around 2.3 million customers

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,203
across three different states.

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,453
We are,

30
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,723
from customer experience perspective,

31
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,103
we won five years in a row,

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,490
number one customer satisfaction

33
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,490
J.D. Awards in west large
customer and residential category.

34
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,100
And also we won recently
two SAP innovation awards

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,230
for our digital transformation

36
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,723
on SAP RISE and BTP innovations.

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,240
- So I think a lot being talked about

38
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,640
how these agentic AI projects are failing.

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,710
If you have read the MID report,

40
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,460
it says almost 95% of the organization

41
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,070
report seeing zero outcome.

42
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,943
A lot of POCs going on, but
not a lot of production.

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,470
You know, quality
upgrade that is going on.

44
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,470
Gartner has said almost 40%
of the agentic AI projects

45
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,260
will be canceled by 2027.

46
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,240
So these are scary numbers.

47
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,980
HFS research says that
what, and why is all done

48
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:35,970
it's it's about how of AI
which will define 2026.

49
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,420
Now let's step back and think about

50
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,230
why these people are
forecasting such failures.

51
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,630
We at IBM value research,

52
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,520
IBM has done our own research

53
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,200
talking to multiple clients

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,050
across geographies and across businesses.

55
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,850
One of the key things that we note

56
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,693
is that agentic AI demands
a new operating model,

57
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,410
which is engineered from bottoms up.

58
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,180
So if you look at that diagram

59
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,430
where we talk about, on the top,

60
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,320
scalable, flexible, and secure

61
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,220
hybrid cloud infrastructure is the key.

62
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,720
And then you look at the left,

63
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,270
which is around enterprise applications,

64
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,450
ecosystem partner systems,
and external data sources,

65
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,460
which need to be interconnected.

66
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,010
If you take one thing out of the session,

67
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,010
remember, interconnected workflows.

68
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,260
So it need to be, as we work,

69
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,720
people and agents work in harmony,

70
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,700
I think is very critical for us

71
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,540
to have interconnected
workflows all across.

72
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,900
So this goes back to the
theme of our topic here,

73
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,870
which is around readiness for agentic AI.

74
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,700
Not just being cool AI,

75
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,630
but how do we do that boring
work on infrastructure,

76
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,810
governance, security, cloud, to be ready.

77
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,180
As Laxman pointed out,

78
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,030
Southwest Gas has been
winning a number of awards.

79
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,230
That's for a reason,

80
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,060
because they are highly innovative,

81
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,710
they think very carefully,

82
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,770
but also move with with velocity, right.

83
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,780
So it's great to learn from them

84
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,670
how they are embarking on their journey.

85
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,250
And IBM and AWS have a small role to play

86
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,560
in their journey to agentic AI.

87
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,640
With that, I'll hand it over to Kalyan

88
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,410
to talk about some of
the business challenges

89
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,450
they were experiencing
when they were on-prem

90
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,110
and how it was hindering their innovation.

91
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,640
- Thank you, Pankaj.

92
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,533
Thanks everyone for joining us today.

93
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,250
Yeah, I will walk you through
our business challenges

94
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,573
when we were on on-prem.

95
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,090
Yeah, our on-prem infrastructure
was aged infrastructure

96
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,090
and the most challenges
were like, you know,

97
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,260
maintaining those servers, right.

98
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,717
So we had to spend a lot on
maintaining those systems

99
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,283
and upgrading those servers.

100
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,270
And also the scalability.

101
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,930
So we couldn't able to extend

102
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,600
according to our business demand.

103
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,470
So it's restricting our support for demand

104
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,210
and also the security
and compliance complexity

105
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,320
where our team needs to
manually update the patches

106
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,530
to avoid security vulnerabilities.

107
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,810
And also, I would like to hold a bit here,

108
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,083
lack of ability to do agentic AI.

109
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,950
I would like to relate to my personal case

110
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,690
where few months ago I thought
of teaching AI to my kids,

111
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,880
their too young, but you know,

112
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,450
to do some fun AI stuff,
videos and all stuff.

113
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,290
But my old laptop was not supporting to,

114
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,840
you know, do those innovative stuff.

115
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,350
Similarly, when you
compare to the broader way

116
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,140
a company having aged infrastructure,

117
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,960
then you need a platform, strong platform,

118
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,390
a future ready digital core platform

119
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,270
where you can explore more innovations.

120
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,630
That's what we did from the Southwest Gas.

121
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,910
And thanks to our leadership

122
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,760
for taking this innovative step forward

123
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,310
and implementing SAP
RISE on AWS altogether.

124
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,220
And we are ready to start
our innovation journey.

125
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,580
And we already did couple
of use cases on agentic AI

126
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,663
and I'd like Laxman to talk
about our SAP RISE journey.

127
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,753
Thank you.

128
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,883
- So if you see here, oops, sorry.

129
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,097
So we actually, as a part
of our cloud first journey

130
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,543
and also exiting our
on-prem infrastructure,

131
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,490
we moved the first SAP
mission critical system

132
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,490
to AWS running on SAP on RISE this year.

133
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,060
We were able to move everything

134
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,970
that we have in our SAP landscape

135
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,970
and simplify the architecture,
and also integrations

136
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:15,030
from going from PO to
BTP integration suite.

137
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,793
We have done everything in four months.

138
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,120
That's why we won Fast and
Furious Cloud ERP migration

139
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,180
in SAP Utilities this year.

140
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,060
So how we are able to do that?

141
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,810
It's because, you know, the
partnership that we have

142
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,550
with SAP, IBM, and AWS.

143
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,120
IBM is our strategic partner.

144
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,090
IBM is the global partner for SAP

145
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,980
as well as AWS.

146
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,210
We use IBM's, you know,
strategic partnership

147
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,210
to ensure the speed and
the timelines that we need

148
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,490
is aligned with the project timelines.

149
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,780
So this is one of the key
partnership I want to highlight.

150
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,530
Having IBM supporting us on the,

151
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,330
you know, not just SAP,

152
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,240
we also started going our on-prem systems,

153
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,120
like rest of the systems
which are running on Oracle,

154
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,950
70% of the workload

155
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,303
going to the AWS cloud infrastructure,

156
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,490
So this is allowing us to prepare

157
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,123
for next generation of digital adoption.

158
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,250
As Southwest, we are growing organically.

159
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,940
We are adding 40,000 customers

160
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,553
in our business territory every year.

161
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,510
And our business
requirements are changing,

162
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,460
our customer demands are increasing

163
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,460
and also we actually take
pride in serving our customers

164
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,680
and make them easy in order to,

165
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,890
you know, how they interact with us.

166
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,860
We are the number one mobile app

167
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,100
powered by SCW in North America

168
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,100
with 86,000 5 star reviews in Apple Store.

169
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,093
I believe there is no other
company has this many reviews,

170
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,040
even in the global level
for 2.3 million customers.

171
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,110
So we take very seriously

172
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,200
when we do these loss
transformation projects

173
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,150
and, you know, keeping in, ensuring that,

174
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,930
how we are going to serve
these customers better

175
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,320
with the infrastructure that
we are going to get into.

176
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,780
We see already tremendous improvements

177
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,610
with our SAP RISE running
on AWS just migrating it.

178
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,973
We will cover in some other slides.

179
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,143
So again,

180
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,000
performance is increased by 35%

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,720
just going from our world
on-prem hardware gear

182
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,653
to AWS latest and greatest infrastructure,

183
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,660
We didn't tune anything,
it's just a migration.

184
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,423
It's actually, you know,

185
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,500
the cloud computing power of AWS

186
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,190
allowed us to run faster.

187
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,133
We used to run mission critical jobs,

188
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,490
which is called meter to cash

189
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,420
every night from six all
the way to two o'clock,

190
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,000
which is very important for us.

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,790
Now after going to SAP RISE,

192
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,790
we are actually completing
that within midnight.

193
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,700
So that allows our
resources to sleep early

194
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,630
and also ensuring that we
bill our customers every day

195
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,953
without any issues.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,913
And also this is helping us to,

197
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,213
we are able to capitalize
with the help of IBM.

198
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,530
IBM was able to provide us

199
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,160
the language that we need,
work with our accounting,

200
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,930
and working with our partners
to allow us to capitalize.

201
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,120
This is very important aspect for us

202
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,720
when it comes to capitalization.

203
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,100
And also the resources that are supporting

204
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:28,320
on the on-prem that they are now focusing

205
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,320
on learning more AWS cloud operations

206
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,887
and doing more optimizations, automations,

207
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,940
so that they don't have to do

208
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,253
the same level of jobs that they're doing.

209
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,790
Our goal is try to move away from,

210
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,153
keep the lights on hours
to innovate faster.

211
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,030
This is really helping us

212
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,000
with moving the responsibilities

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,320
of managing by customer
to managing by SAP and AWS

214
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,423
helping us to innovate much faster.

215
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,800
- Thank you, Laxman.

216
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:10,740
So I'll be talking about AI use cases

217
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,163
that are already in implementation phase.

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,970
So our company Southwest Gas embrace AI

219
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,830
and when we approach
customer agents and you know,

220
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,870
when we ask about what are the pain areas,

221
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,570
they said this were some of the questions

222
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,570
they were unable to answer
quickly to the customers.

223
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,670
That's when we thought
of building an agentic AI

224
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,280
for smart gas bill analyzer,

225
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,080
where most of the customers
used to ask why my bill is high.

226
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,120
So they don't just consider

227
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,850
about some root cause
analysis or whatever.

228
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,060
It used to take currently over 15 minutes,

229
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,720
10 to 15 minutes, and it could lead to,

230
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,273
you know, frustration,
right, for the customers.

231
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,740
So what are the challenges that, you know,

232
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,500
currently our agents are facing?

233
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,200
So how this AI could help

234
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,060
and what all the business value that,

235
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,970
you know, it can gain customer trust

236
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,970
and you know, it can fewer our disputes

237
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,343
and can reduce the call volume.

238
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,550
I would like to go through
the root cause analysis

239
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,530
that we found for this, you know,

240
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,620
to build this agentic AI case.

241
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,300
So there are three categories.

242
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,270
One is customer related reasons.

243
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,980
That could be behavioral changes

244
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,040
while using these
appliances and, you know,

245
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,203
making, you know, more consumption.

246
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,820
One could be, and also
inefficient appliances

247
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,290
like, you know, maybe customers

248
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,810
are using some degrading systems,

249
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:58,110
HVAC systems or, you know, water heaters.

250
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,820
And also some behavioral changes.

251
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,340
Maybe some of the
customers could, you know,

252
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,630
keep the appliance uses
for a longer period

253
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,210
and everything resides in a system, right?

254
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,050
So what our agentic AI can does, you know,

255
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,840
we extracts the data from the
systems that mentioned there

256
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,470
from MDMS and billing systems

257
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,360
and also from S4 and
customer support portal.

258
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,260
And it can reason, it can extract the data

259
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,790
and fine tune and validate

260
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,573
and provide the actual reason

261
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,920
and give an insightful summary

262
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,443
to the customer agents.

263
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,060
So the second category is, like,

264
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,190
due to some faulty technical reasons

265
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,590
like faulty machines,
equipment like, you know.

266
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,710
Maybe sometimes the
smart devices won't work

267
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,770
or you know, the meter
may be faulty meters there

268
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,640
and you know, due to some
longer billing cycles, right.

269
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,840
That could be also a reason.

270
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,660
And additional tariffs
or rate plan changes,

271
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,603
that could also lead
to increase the bills.

272
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,670
And we cannot deny the
fact that, you know,

273
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,780
even the external factors
like weather, right.

274
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,450
So mostly in the cold weather

275
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,760
customers switch on their heaters.

276
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,090
That could also increase
their bills, gas bills.

277
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,340
And also the rate changes

278
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,730
and sometimes our regulatory
surcharges as well,

279
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,890
because of that also it could lead.

280
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,590
And during the outages some customers felt

281
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,180
even my bill is high

282
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,090
even though some of the outages happen.

283
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,967
But that can be, you know,

284
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:44,763
due to some of the compensations
planned afterwards.

285
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,890
So all the data can be extracted
from the relevant systems

286
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,830
and then feed to our agentic AI

287
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,040
and what agentic AI can
intelligently validate

288
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,273
and provide a proper reasoning
to our call center agents.

289
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,840
In a holistic view, our agentic AI,

290
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,390
it could be handled like intelligent,

291
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,630
this is our smart
intelligent bill analyzer

292
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,550
where it can answer multiple
prompts or multiple requests

293
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,550
that we just ask the agentic
AI, then it could give us a,

294
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,763
you know, AI driven insights
with the proper reasoning.

295
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,470
Let's say suppose, how
can I reduce my bill?

296
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,530
Then it can advise some, okay,

297
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,060
we switch over to this plan, smart plans,

298
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,830
so that you can reduce this much

299
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,920
of amount every month and how can I...

300
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,750
and also it can compare the usage

301
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,320
with a similar household
items with nearest locations.

302
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,320
And if any disputes there,
it could answer that,

303
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,270
okay, how can this could be raised

304
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,840
and also it can break down the bill

305
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,590
and if a customer asks,
"Just break down my bill",

306
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,720
then it can segregate and you know,

307
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,220
show it to the customers as well.

308
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,700
We're not open.
- Yeah, let's summarize.

309
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,080
- And there are other use cases

310
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,050
that I'd like Laxman to
talk about the rate case,

311
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,760
regulatory rate case submission.

312
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,290
- I'll summarize.
- Thank you, yeah.

313
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,740
- I know we have two
minutes time coming up.

314
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,573
We'll just quickly,

315
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,683
how many of you are
utility customers here?

316
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,410
How many of you are utility customers?

317
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,610
So you can imagine, you know,

318
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,550
rate case is very important
for us as utility.

319
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,650
So what we are trying to do is,

320
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,980
we want to come up with
some use cases where,

321
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,923
how do we get all the
data in such a way that,

322
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,510
you know, all the utilities,
PUCs request, you know,

323
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,200
whether it is invoices,
whether it is bills,

324
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,093
everything that needs to be asked.

325
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,610
We are working through AI use case

326
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,420
connecting all our SAP, Oracle, systems

327
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,060
and trying to give work order number.

328
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,390
Then all the relevant
information related to that

329
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,690
in terms of that is required

330
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,550
to submit to our public union commissions.

331
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,670
So again, this is something very important

332
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,933
for us as a utility.

333
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,983
We will talk more in our next,

334
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,030
in our upcoming sessions
when we have, you know,

335
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,060
successfully completed
everything end to end.

336
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,550
But this is something we want to be,

337
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,690
you know, developing it

338
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,940
and we want to be one
of the leading utility

339
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,203
to be on part of it.

340
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,080
- Thank you, Laxman.

341
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,880
So just in a summary,

342
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,130
we started with the challenges today

343
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,040
that we see in adoption of agentic AI.

344
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,730
The forecast of the failure rates

345
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,350
and what IBM is doing to make sure

346
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,800
we are keeping our
clients to be successful.

347
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,730
Watch out this space.

348
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,250
Southwest Gas is highly innovative.

349
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,710
They move with velocity and the partners

350
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,410
like AWS and and ourselves and SAP,

351
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,750
we are working towards
making them more successful.

352
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,330
They have the vision, we
have do the execution.

353
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,490
I'm sure when you switch
on your heat tonight,

354
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,070
think about this case study,
think about Southwest Gas.

355
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,903
Thank you.

356
00:19:11,903 --> 00:19:13,140
We'll be around for answer more questions.

357
