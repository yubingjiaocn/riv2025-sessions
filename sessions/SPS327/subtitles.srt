1
00:00:00,529 --> 00:00:01,590
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:02,778
Welcome

3
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:05,709
and thank you all for joining us for this session today.

4
00:00:06,288 --> 00:00:08,528
We're excited to tell you about how Manchester

5
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:09,429
Airport's Group,

6
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:10,608
or MAG,

7
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:12,439
are applying Agentic AI

8
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:14,898
so all of our flights can leave on time.

9
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,048
And quick show of hands, do we have any frequent flyers in

10
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:20,719
the room? Yeah,

11
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,539
lots of you.

12
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,079
Most of you probably use an airport to get here.

13
00:00:25,298 --> 00:00:26,399
Then I'm sure you'll all agree.

14
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:29,719
This is the ideal scenario when flying.

15
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:32,450
You arrive at airport security.

16
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:35,298
An hour before your flight's due to take off.

17
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:37,728
And you sail straight through

18
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,130
with no delays.

19
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,700
We're all just looking to get through security

20
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,939
as quickly as possible

21
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:46,899
so we can start relaxing in the departure lounge

22
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,000
or getting down to some productive work.

23
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,359
Whether you're traveling for business

24
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,459
or for leisure.

25
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,029
However,

26
00:00:55,868 --> 00:00:57,689
Whilst Mag have an outstanding record

27
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,529
of customer service in the airport.

28
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,848
Dealing with unexpected logistical challenges

29
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:04,379
is a daily occurrence.

30
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,638
And how frustrating is it for the passenger?

31
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:10,588
When your airport experience is not a smooth

32
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:13,129
one. And if flights are delayed

33
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:14,668
due to operational issues.

34
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,129
Now imagine you're the line manager

35
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,558
of the security line.

36
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,989
It's the week before Christmas. It seems like

37
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:25,150
the entire world is trying to travel

38
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,790
somewhere,

39
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:27,329
and all of a sudden

40
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,709
someone calls up,

41
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:31,069
it's one of your employees, and they won't be

42
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:32,569
able to make it in for their shift.

43
00:01:32,948 --> 00:01:35,290
And all of a sudden you have the entire line to manage

44
00:01:35,418 --> 00:01:37,650
and you also need to find a replacement for the single

45
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,819
employee that can't make it in.

46
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,049
How stressful.

47
00:01:44,058 --> 00:01:45,250
My name's Tom Chester.

48
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:47,879
I'm a senior AI strategist at AWS

49
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,349
and I've been working with Mag over the past year

50
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:51,730
to help shape their AI vision.

51
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:54,579
I'm joined by my teammate Margarita

52
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,480
and Steve from MG.

53
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:57,969
And today,

54
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:00,388
we'll give you the context on the challenges

55
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:01,569
that MAG are facing

56
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:03,969
and outline the vision they saw

57
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:06,638
to apply AI to reduce

58
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:07,668
operational complexity.

59
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,399
We'll also cover why we have chosen Agenic

60
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,599
AI specifically

61
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,139
as a solution to this problem.

62
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:18,038
Finally, we'll take you through a technical deep dive

63
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,419
of how we helped Mag get started on this

64
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:22,580
journey by building the first use

65
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,479
case of many,

66
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:25,159
which focuses on the challenge

67
00:02:25,618 --> 00:02:27,689
of rostering shift workers for

68
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,319
critical airport functions.

69
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,050
With over 1000 flights per day

70
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,599
leaving from Mags airports,

71
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:39,210
you can imagine the operational challenges

72
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,868
they have going on behind the scenes

73
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:42,528
to keep things running smoothly.

74
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:46,588
Many of you probably also work for companies with

75
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:48,149
complex internal processes.

76
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:51,679
Today, we'll share some of the practical lessons

77
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:53,838
that Mag learnt from applying Agentic AI

78
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:54,909
to these challenges,

79
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,758
with actionable insights

80
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,199
you can take forward to your own AI initiatives.

81
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,080
From a technical perspective,

82
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,528
the solution we've built uses Amazon Bedrock

83
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:05,308
Agent Core.

84
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,599
Which I'm sure lots of you will have heard about in the keynotes.

85
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,649
It's our primary service for deploying and operating

86
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,860
AI agents securely and at scale.

87
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:16,899
And as this is an L300 session, we'll be

88
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:18,689
getting into a lot of technical depth.

89
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,990
So Steve,

90
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:21,149
let's get started.

91
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:24,830
Great, thanks Tom.

92
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,990
So. Um

93
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,550
Why, why are you here? I guess, a big

94
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,270
thank you, um, for your time.

95
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:34,788
Uh, you'll have heard a lot already this week

96
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:36,308
about uh Agentic.

97
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:38,288
Um, and I'm gonna set,

98
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:40,618
uh, some of the context for,

99
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,669
uh, how we operate at the airport and then we'll dive into some

100
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,368
more of that technical detail later on.

101
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:47,229
Um, really excited to

102
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:49,500
share this part of the story with you guys. Um,

103
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:50,909
it's, it's not the beginning.

104
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:53,389
So, uh, this is actually a, a,

105
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:55,889
a hat trick. This is the 3rd time that MAG are presenting,

106
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:57,349
um, at, at Reinvent.

107
00:03:57,808 --> 00:03:59,899
Um, we've also got solutions in

108
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:02,338
place, um, uh, Valve,

109
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,659
for example, uh, our, our, our AI

110
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,020
assistant supporting passengers.

111
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:08,379
And we're also, um, teaming AI

112
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,580
with computer vision

113
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:12,258
to determine how we can turn around aircraft

114
00:04:12,258 --> 00:04:14,558
on, on, on the stand in a more efficient way.

115
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:17,079
Um, my role

116
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,608
is looking after our enterprise systems.

117
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:21,980
So that's the stuff that doesn't keep

118
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,100
the airplanes in the air but it's still equally as

119
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,470
important. Um, so finance, procurement,

120
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:27,608
HR, payroll,

121
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,709
workflow and automation,

122
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:32,149
um, and also the digital colleague workplace.

123
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:34,269
So a lot of this is going to be focused around

124
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:36,548
how we can improve our colleagues, um,

125
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,389
experiences,

126
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,108
um, rather than necessarily the, the passengers,

127
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:41,809
um, or, or our end customers.

128
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:45,350
So quick background into who our mag, so

129
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,369
UK based but global, um, presence.

130
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:50,588
We've got 3 airports, we're the largest

131
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:52,129
airport group in the UK.

132
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,000
And we also have uh an arm of the business

133
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,259
that's called Kavu that focuses on,

134
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:59,738
on travel tech and services. So

135
00:05:00,278 --> 00:05:02,439
that our Kavu team are, are focused

136
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,319
on building a platform um to

137
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:06,939
to improve our passenger experience

138
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,459
um around

139
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,199
selling products like uh

140
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,519
lounge bookings, car parking,

141
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:16,139
um, and, and fast track through security.

142
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,879
Now we've got

143
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,879
some pretty ambitious, um,

144
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:21,879
uh.

145
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:24,540
Strategic aspirations,

146
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,119
um, and, uh, I guess

147
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,439
that's coupled with the fact that there's a significant

148
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,509
amount of operational complexity that we also have

149
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:33,459
to deal with across our, our airport base.

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,350
We've got around 9000 staff,

151
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,639
but many, many more, 40,000 or

152
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,160
so operating on our campuses,

153
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:43,278
um, across the airports in

154
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:43,838
the UK.

155
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:48,040
So Our aim is

156
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,649
to provide a seamless experience for our passengers,

157
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:53,689
um, an industry leading airport

158
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:54,309
experience.

159
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,420
Now Sounds

160
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,019
pretty simple,

161
00:05:58,338 --> 00:06:00,379
but actually there's a a

162
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:02,389
an understandable amount of

163
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,660
of hard work and management of of complexity

164
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,720
that goes into

165
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:08,100
um achieving the KPI that you see

166
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,879
on screen there.

167
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:10,358
So

168
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:13,798
our aim is to provide a frictionless

169
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:16,738
yet secure journey for our passengers

170
00:06:16,738 --> 00:06:18,278
through um security

171
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,899
and maintaining that level of service takes

172
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,019
a a a lot of monitoring I guess

173
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,019
of of all of the different components that that

174
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:25,798
come together.

175
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:28,959
Um and it doesn't always go smoothly.

176
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,660
Quick show of hands for anyone that

177
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,720
has flown in this week that their journey

178
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:36,759
wasn't quite as smooth through their airports.

179
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,699
As expected, OK.

180
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,269
Couple of hands.

181
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,040
Um. I actually

182
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,259
surprised myself. I, I got here so quick,

183
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:49,059
uh, I beat my luggage

184
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,420
by 2 hours.

185
00:06:50,838 --> 00:06:51,798
That's interesting, isn't it?

186
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:54,769
The service that an airline and airport provide

187
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:56,850
means that me and my luggage arrived at

188
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,509
Harry Reid

189
00:06:58,028 --> 00:06:59,009
2 hours apart. Hm.

190
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:02,069
So it it's things like that that

191
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:02,629
um.

192
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,588
The passengers just view as a hygiene

193
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:06,178
factor,

194
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,699
um, and

195
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,069
you know the particular use case that we're gonna come on to,

196
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:12,139
to, to dive into some technical detail around

197
00:07:12,678 --> 00:07:13,778
is, is,

198
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,559
is just the first foray, I, I

199
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:18,559
guess there's, there's many other use cases that

200
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,500
we can apply this to.

201
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:23,220
So Cast

202
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,298
your mind back to the, to the example I just, I just

203
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:27,298
gave there around security, behind the scenes there's

204
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:29,579
there's lots of management of, of

205
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:30,500
operational complexity.

206
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:33,019
We've grown as an airport group um

207
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:33,798
over time.

208
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,939
COVID was also um uh.

209
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:39,009
A period of time that significantly impacted

210
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:40,209
us, um,

211
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,709
you know, only about 1 to 2% of

212
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,009
flights, um.

213
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,139
We're were going globally at that at that

214
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,178
time, mainly for mainly for cargo rather than

215
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:49,959
for passengers,

216
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:52,459
um, and it, it's meant

217
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:54,459
that there's, there's a significant amount of

218
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:56,298
complexity that we need to deal with in the airport.

219
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:59,139
And Also consider this,

220
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,309
there's a number of different parties and partners that

221
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:02,790
come together, so there's Mag staff,

222
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:05,149
there's also Border Force, there's our airline

223
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:06,790
partners, there's ground handlers.

224
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:09,509
All of these come together to deliver a service

225
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:10,709
that you as a passenger

226
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:11,928
may just, um,

227
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:14,420
consider as, as, as, you know, a, a, a, a,

228
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,369
a seamless

229
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:16,488
journey.

230
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,178
And the final point to mention is that passenger

231
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:21,939
safety and security is priority.

232
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,858
So, um, in order for us to prioritize

233
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:27,298
that, it often leads to higher operational costs.

234
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:29,079
So this was the opportunity for us.

235
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,308
Now This is the more exciting

236
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:34,500
bit that I really wanna talk to you about. Um,

237
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,009
and we are already

238
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:38,849
a, a good way along this journey.

239
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:39,788
Um,

240
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:42,149
and the, the opportunity for us

241
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:43,408
is, is huge.

242
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:45,529
So it's now Thursday morning,

243
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:48,469
um. AI

244
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:50,548
and Agentic is is not going to be a new

245
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:52,668
topic that you've heard about, um, at this point in

246
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:53,450
time throughout the week,

247
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:55,830
um, but we are going to go into a lot more

248
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,048
technical detail on how we've applied that.

249
00:08:58,428 --> 00:09:00,788
Um, it's certainly no longer

250
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:02,820
a dream, it's, it's definitely a

251
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,489
reality,

252
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:06,269
um, and I hope that this customer story

253
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:08,269
and some of the lessons that we've learned along

254
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:09,489
the way is really useful.

255
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,029
Um, for you guys to, to consider,

256
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:12,889
to learn from,

257
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,200
um, and I'm really happy to take any questions as well at

258
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,210
the end of the session if you've got any, um,

259
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:19,529
thoughts or, or queries about how we apply that.

260
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:21,729
So our, our vision

261
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:23,849
is to create a single

262
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:27,158
unified experience for our colleagues

263
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:28,928
powered by agents.

264
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,210
Removing a significant amount of the complexity

265
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,609
in order to deliver value

266
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,739
for Mac,

267
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,469
and there's a host of different

268
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:39,509
use cases that we could apply this to,

269
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:41,989
um, the particular ones

270
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:44,279
that we've decided to, to focus on initially

271
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,428
are shown on the screen, but there are going to be many, many

272
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:47,210
more that we will

273
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:48,729
discover along the way.

274
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,700
Tom's gonna tell us a little bit more about um

275
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,269
how and why we've we've chosen

276
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,519
Agentic and then we'll go into the technical detail.

277
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:02,808
Now, perhaps some of the challenges

278
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:04,808
that Steve has shared are resonating with

279
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,009
you, and you're starting to think about

280
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:07,950
operational complexity

281
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,750
and technical debt in your own organizations.

282
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,580
Mag is certainly not alone in this regard.

283
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:16,090
It's something we hear time and time again from our customers

284
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,070
at AWS.

285
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:20,349
Whilst your company may not be coordinating

286
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:21,408
airport security

287
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:23,489
or delivering passengers' baggage,

288
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:25,489
every company has its own

289
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,320
operational processes.

290
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:31,058
But with a vision as bold as agentic AI

291
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:32,200
to control the airport.

292
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:34,038
Where do you start?

293
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:39,168
Many processes in the airport are high risk

294
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:41,369
and involve critical customer touchpoints.

295
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,048
And it's an environment where passenger safety and

296
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:45,889
security is non-negotiable.

297
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,690
So Mag had to get started on this journey

298
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:50,729
by finding the right use case.

299
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,288
And in doing so, we applied the framework

300
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,849
of think big,

301
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:55,969
start small,

302
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,450
and scale fast.

303
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:00,678
The digital colleague workplace is the think

304
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:01,330
big idea.

305
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,250
Agentic AI to control the airport.

306
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:07,690
But first, we had to securely lay the foundations

307
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:10,570
before iteratively adding functionality

308
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:11,509
and complexity.

309
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:14,788
It was also vital to find a use case

310
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:17,529
that not only demonstrates the power of agentic AI.

311
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,668
But also solves an immediate business problem

312
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:21,229
for Mag.

313
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:24,869
And demonstrates measurable value and

314
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:25,668
return on investment.

315
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:28,918
Well, Mag had identified exactly that kind

316
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:29,859
of opportunity,

317
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,678
which Steve will now share with you.

318
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:34,979
So

319
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:38,489
The first use case we selected was,

320
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,729
was around unplanned absence reporting.

321
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:43,479
So we're we're pretty good at forecasting and rostering

322
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:45,048
in the medium term,

323
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,469
but there's always these unplanned issues that

324
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:49,639
that that happen which means that you need to have

325
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,580
real time um

326
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:54,168
uh re-rostering of staff at any given

327
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:56,379
moment. Now, particularly

328
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:58,719
topical for us, it's a, it's a relevant um

329
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,599
and, and critical business need.

330
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:03,129
Um, but we needed to ensure that we

331
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:05,119
stayed laser focused on the outcomes here.

332
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:07,739
So yes, we're building a solution, but it needed

333
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:09,859
to ensure that we were reducing our operational

334
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:10,678
cost overall.

335
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,019
And that we were reducing our um

336
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:16,029
overtime payments, for example,

337
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:18,599
that we had to continue paying when other

338
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,619
um staff that were due to come onto

339
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:22,908
uh onto shift were unable to make it in at that time.

340
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:25,700
So significant cost drivers

341
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,739
that that underpinned why this was

342
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:29,739
a a particularly pertinent use case for

343
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:30,379
us to select.

344
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,479
Um, what does unplanned ill, uh, unplanned absence

345
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:35,479
consist of? Uh, primarily illness,

346
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,808
um, which is, uh,

347
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
of significant importance to us

348
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,538
around,

349
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:42,519
um, the summer peak,

350
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,080
around half-term periods where, where lots of

351
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,859
families go, go, go abroad,

352
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,960
um, and also coming up to Christmas.

353
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:50,168
Um,

354
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,538
of course there are other types of emergencies that also have

355
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,619
the same implication, right?

356
00:12:54,178 --> 00:12:55,298
Travel, um,

357
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:58,250
issues with public transport or, or people's vehicles

358
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,469
enabling them to get in, or a family emergency

359
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:01,538
that people have to deal with.

360
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:06,109
So let's just take a look at the current

361
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:08,269
state. Um, there's probably two

362
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:09,210
key things

363
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:11,599
to, to, to mention in, in

364
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:12,168
this,

365
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:14,389
um. There's

366
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:17,369
the aspect of dealing with the re-rostering

367
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:18,090
of staff.

368
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,979
And so that's the, that's the top line of the thread.

369
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:24,389
And then secondarily, there's also

370
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,428
the pastoral care for that

371
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:28,590
employee that the line manager would need to take care of.

372
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:31,048
So in this instance, we would have

373
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:32,210
um an employee

374
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:33,750
calling in.

375
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:36,389
Uh, we've got a third party reporting helpline.

376
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:39,210
Um, the ros, the resourcing team would,

377
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,969
would deal with that. Uh, uh, re-rostering

378
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:42,548
would occur

379
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:45,149
and a replacement would be, would be scheduled.

380
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,489
In parallel,

381
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:49,168
the line manager would, would be informed,

382
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:51,609
um, and their HR record

383
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:53,330
on our, on our, um,

384
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:55,849
HR database would be, would be updated.

385
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:57,320
Um

386
00:13:58,048 --> 00:14:00,210
Now that's all well and good for this

387
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,210
user group, but as you can imagine across 3 different

388
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,788
airports and different

389
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,099
um. Teams,

390
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,428
there is a very slightly different process in

391
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:10,428
place. Meaning

392
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:12,830
that we wanted to take the opportunity

393
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,109
to standardize,

394
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,649
but we had to ensure that the

395
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,830
outcomes being driven by the solution

396
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,690
that we built

397
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:22,408
were um were accurate

398
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:24,668
and er I guess

399
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,869
provided the the the same result

400
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:28,690
in very varying circumstances.

401
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:31,408
So

402
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:34,070
what's the, what's the value case behind it? I,

403
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,190
I touched earlier on some of

404
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,269
the reasons why we selected this as a use

405
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:38,808
case.

406
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:41,629
Um, but the value kind of stands

407
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:43,629
up for itself here. I'll talk you through the three

408
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:44,500
points in a second.

409
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,969
This is, this is only

410
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:49,529
for this particular use case.

411
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,489
Bearing in mind

412
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,090
this is step one on a larger journey for us.

413
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:55,428
So the, the value

414
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,869
case for an underlying digital colleague workplace

415
00:14:57,869 --> 00:14:59,129
is even greater than this.

416
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,710
But the example here for unplanned absence

417
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,908
is really centered around reducing

418
00:15:03,908 --> 00:15:05,979
the amount of cost on um

419
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:07,989
on payment of overtime to cover shifts.

420
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:10,889
The quicker we can get people through

421
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:11,609
security,

422
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:13,969
the greater level of spend that they typically have in

423
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:14,830
our terminals.

424
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,649
Um, and we also currently pay

425
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,769
an amount to a third party in order to

426
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,389
provide this service to us. So bringing it

427
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:24,009
in-house was, was something that was also

428
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:25,690
very, very, um, relevant.

429
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,269
Now, all sounds good doesn't it, but we

430
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:31,729
didn't just want to start charging ahead.

431
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:33,808
um there were some

432
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,750
very, very real, very pertinent considerations

433
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,609
that we needed to make.

434
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:39,379
Um

435
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,700
Alarm bells would probably be ringing across

436
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,599
organizations from cyber teams,

437
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,279
people teams perhaps,

438
00:15:46,558 --> 00:15:48,639
security teams about how we're

439
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,719
going to ensure that we have the right

440
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,099
level of security,

441
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,418
um, accuracy of the solution

442
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:56,038
and reliability. So

443
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:57,099
you can imagine,

444
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,320
um. How are we authenticating

445
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,639
the user as they connect to submit their absence?

446
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,408
What if it's not them that's calling up because

447
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:07,509
they've been in an incident?

448
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:10,489
How, how do you secure and determine

449
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:12,489
who would call up on their behalf or or

450
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:14,590
use an use the app or web app front end

451
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,629
in order to submit that absence on their behalf?

452
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,119
Accuracy.

453
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,229
They're rostered for a shift,

454
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,859
but how much of a shift are they unable to attend?

455
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,859
Does that have an impact

456
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:27,418
on how we re-roster?

457
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Does that have an impact on their end of

458
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,058
month take home pay cos they've worked less?

459
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:34,500
Reliability.

460
00:16:35,178 --> 00:16:37,599
We operate a 24/7

461
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:38,678
operation across the airports.

462
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,129
This needs to be uh accessible,

463
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:42,609
it needs to be available.

464
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,379
It needs to have a low degree of of latency.

465
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:48,408
So A summary

466
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,739
of those impacts down the left that I've I've mentioned

467
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:53,129
are the considerations that we had to

468
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:53,690
um

469
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:55,700
that we, you know, that we had to discuss.

470
00:16:56,038 --> 00:16:57,200
Ensure we had

471
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:58,200
suitable

472
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,210
um

473
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:02,158
solutions and and mitigations around

474
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:04,779
because at the, at the core, this is acting

475
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:05,318
over

476
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,769
PII data,

477
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:09,459
you know, it's impacting employees' pay.

478
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:12,269
And we're an airport group. We, we

479
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:14,709
operate over critical national infrastructure.

480
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:16,989
We are subject to an amount

481
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:18,779
of legislation, um,

482
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,739
to an amount of um.

483
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,500
To an amount of activity that is not uh

484
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:26,150
not equivalent for other organizations.

485
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:27,699
And so that was built into

486
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:29,269
some of the solution design,

487
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:32,199
uh, it informed how we structured our guardrails,

488
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,199
uh, it, it informed how we evaluated

489
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:37,400
how successful the the model and the solutions

490
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,000
were being,

491
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,939
and it also went into determining

492
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:42,989
um what our production architecture would

493
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:45,170
look like. So

494
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,430
Tom's gonna come and tell us a little bit more about why

495
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,568
Agentic is suitable here

496
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,098
and then we'll dive into the tech.

497
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,519
Great, thanks Steve.

498
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:56,769
So why do we think agentic AI is the

499
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:59,150
right fit for Mag's digital colleague workplace?

500
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,559
Let's first consider how generative AI

501
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,000
solutions evolve with increasing

502
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,380
autonomy in the context of Mag's use case.

503
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:11,140
At one end of the scale, we have generative AI

504
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,299
assistants, which can take the form of chatbots

505
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,289
or tools built for specific purposes,

506
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:16,959
such as document processing.

507
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:19,769
These can help to automate workflows,

508
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:22,140
but require humans to define and execute the

509
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,759
tasks.

510
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,259
Moving up the scale, AI agents have

511
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:27,239
much more autonomy.

512
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,108
They're given goals and focused on achieving

513
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:32,309
outcomes rather than just completing specific

514
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:32,969
tasks.

515
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:35,868
They're able to adapt dynamically under

516
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:36,848
uncertainty,

517
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:39,259
coordinating across multiple systems.

518
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,279
For Mag,

519
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,799
the unplanned absence reporting use case

520
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:44,979
would fall into this category.

521
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,390
Finally, at the other end of the spectrum,

522
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,750
we have fully autonomous agentic

523
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,348
systems.

524
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:54,430
These systems can not only accomplish the goals

525
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,338
that are given to them,

526
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:57,828
but can independently set and execute

527
00:18:57,828 --> 00:18:58,568
on goals.

528
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,939
These systems are able to coordinate multiple agents.

529
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:05,160
With minimal human oversight.

530
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,739
Whilst quite rare today,

531
00:19:08,118 --> 00:19:10,469
for Mag, this is the ultimate vision for the digital

532
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:11,338
colleague workplace.

533
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:15,469
Now let's take a look at the capabilities of agents

534
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:16,930
that are relevant to this use case.

535
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:21,670
Agents are given goals and instructions

536
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:23,759
and access to a set of tools to use

537
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:25,400
to help achieve these goals.

538
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:28,328
These could be in the form of a data source,

539
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,219
such as an employee data system.

540
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:31,588
Or

541
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:33,890
access to APIs for taking action in other

542
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,670
systems,

543
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,969
such as rostering an employee for a shift.

544
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,449
Agents are also given access to memory

545
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:42,549
so they can recall their short-term and long-term

546
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,170
interactions with the user for additional context.

547
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:47,469
Finally,

548
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:50,068
agents use their reasoning capabilities to

549
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:52,068
break down their goals into subtasks and

550
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:52,750
form a plan.

551
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,150
They take action using their tools to execute

552
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,729
that plan.

553
00:19:57,598 --> 00:19:59,719
And observe the impact of those actions.

554
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:03,160
This observation may lead to more planning and

555
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,759
more action.

556
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,519
And so the loop continues until the

557
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,380
goal is achieved.

558
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:10,689
Equipped with these capabilities,

559
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:12,989
agents can also interact with other

560
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:13,969
AI agents.

561
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,838
Each with their own specialized set of goals and

562
00:20:16,838 --> 00:20:17,380
tools.

563
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,150
This agent to agent interaction

564
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:22,838
allows for the creation of multi-agent systems,

565
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,209
which is Mag's ultimate vision for the digital

566
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:26,068
colleague workplace.

567
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,959
So returning to the question of why agentic

568
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:33,140
AI for Mag's digital colleague workplace.

569
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,779
Or to ask the question in a different way,

570
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,439
why wouldn't we have not just used a simple

571
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:40,509
automation tool or a generative AI

572
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:41,699
assistant for this use case?

573
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,439
The airport is a dynamic environment

574
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:49,380
with non-deterministic processes requiring

575
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,118
coordination

576
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:52,920
across many interdependent functions.

577
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,420
We've already talked about the complexity and the unplanned absence

578
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,459
reporting use case.

579
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,259
3 different airports,

580
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:01,900
many different process flows based on job type.

581
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:04,848
And numerous different types of absence,

582
00:21:05,368 --> 00:21:06,150
each with their own

583
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,029
HR policy attached.

584
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:10,818
And quickly we're into hundreds of different workflow

585
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:11,660
permutations.

586
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,368
For example,

587
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,818
being absent due to childcare invokes

588
00:21:15,818 --> 00:21:18,078
a different policy as opposed to illness.

589
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,818
And this is just one

590
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:21,660
of hundreds of processes

591
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:24,000
that Mag want to bring under the control of this system in

592
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,598
the long run.

593
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:27,880
For example, it'll also cover

594
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,979
fault reporting and asset management.

595
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:33,640
So what if a staffing decision in one part of the airport

596
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,439
is impacted by equipment being out of order in

597
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:37,318
another part of the airport?

598
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,539
And what if that's further compounded by a

599
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:42,000
large number of flights being delayed?

600
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:45,390
Agentic AI gives the ability to think through

601
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,969
these scenarios dynamically.

602
00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:50,348
Whereas an automation tool would require

603
00:21:50,348 --> 00:21:52,650
programming of hundreds of different workflow permutations

604
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:54,789
and still wouldn't capture all of the edge cases.

605
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,959
Agentic AI is also modular and extensible

606
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:00,578
by design.

607
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,539
Allowing Mag to iteratively add

608
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,259
functionality by deploying more agents

609
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,118
as they build towards the ultimate vision

610
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,118
of the digital colleague workplace.

611
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,959
We're laying the foundations for an intelligent

612
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:14,699
airport

613
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:17,160
where multiple different functions can interact

614
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,239
together to optimize operations.

615
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:23,680
The flexibility of agentic AI to handle

616
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,539
exceptions

617
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,789
where input received from the user is incomplete

618
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:28,858
or ambiguous,

619
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:31,358
is also key to making this work in the real

620
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:33,939
world. For example,

621
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:36,500
what if a user uses colloquial language

622
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,838
or misses key bits of information because they're

623
00:22:38,838 --> 00:22:40,059
reporting in an emergency?

624
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:43,289
AI agents can use their inherent natural

625
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:44,500
language understanding

626
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:47,209
to engage in a multi-turn conversation with the user

627
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:49,309
until they have the information that they need.

628
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,479
Automation tools lack this inherent

629
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,029
understanding,

630
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:56,380
can only execute predefined paths,

631
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,420
and rarely handle exceptions gracefully.

632
00:22:59,818 --> 00:23:01,858
Now, agentic AI is certainly not the right

633
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:03,328
fit for all use cases.

634
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:05,848
If you have a predictable, deterministic

635
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:06,479
workflow.

636
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,229
Then an automation tool may well be the way to go.

637
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:11,828
However, in Mag's case,

638
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:13,029
the combination

639
00:23:13,568 --> 00:23:15,868
of complex non-deterministic processes.

640
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:18,009
The need for extensibility.

641
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,039
And high potential exception rates.

642
00:23:21,939 --> 00:23:23,519
Made agentic AI the right choice.

643
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,549
So now that you know why we chose this approach,

644
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,170
let's see how we built the solution.

645
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:33,630
Thank you, Tom.

646
00:23:34,618 --> 00:23:36,459
So you heard from Tom and Steve

647
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:39,098
why the type of problem that we're trying to tackle

648
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:41,160
here and why we chose

649
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,239
Agentic AI.

650
00:23:42,858 --> 00:23:45,140
Now I'm gonna be telling you about exactly how

651
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,858
we went about building this solution.

652
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:49,920
I'll be talking about our development journey,

653
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,130
how we decided to build each component,

654
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,868
each component of our solution,

655
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:56,328
and also I'll be telling you about all the lessons

656
00:23:56,328 --> 00:23:58,368
that we learned along the way that informed our

657
00:23:58,368 --> 00:23:59,469
implementation patterns.

658
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:04,328
First, let's start with the current workflow.

659
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:06,410
What are we trying to solve here? OK,

660
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:09,118
so say you have an employee that comes,

661
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,699
uh, is unable to come to work. They have an unplanned

662
00:24:11,699 --> 00:24:12,789
absence. Say they're ill.

663
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:14,680
The first thing that they do is

664
00:24:14,979 --> 00:24:16,439
reach out to a point of contact.

665
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:18,969
This can be, uh, a line manager, a

666
00:24:18,969 --> 00:24:20,459
rostering manager,

667
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:22,910
someone within the organization that can quickly rely to

668
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:25,130
whose full-time job is also something else. It's

669
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,219
managing other people and other workflows.

670
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:30,519
This point of contact needs to make sure they have

671
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:33,118
enough information about this employee to

672
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:35,318
know who they are and why they're reaching out.

673
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:38,809
They need to they need to know what the relevant HR

674
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:41,160
policies are for unplanned absences.

675
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,949
They also need to know what type of absence we're talking

676
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:47,189
about. A sickness absence

677
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:49,709
is not the same as a stuck in traffic absence.

678
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:53,930
Then they need to record this absence into an

679
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:54,838
HR system.

680
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,959
And notify all the relevant personnel, so

681
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,939
maybe another line manager or

682
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:01,420
something someone else.

683
00:25:01,838 --> 00:25:04,000
And if this employee is a roasted employee, there's

684
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,078
additional steps you need to record the

685
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:08,180
absence into a shift record system

686
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,858
and you need to notify even more people.

687
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:15,630
So what I'm gonna be telling you about is how did we go from

688
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:16,469
this

689
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,588
current solution.

690
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:20,939
To our target solution.

691
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,670
And I know it looks complex, but don't worry,

692
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:25,338
we're going to build it little by little.

693
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:28,969
OK,

694
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,009
so the first thing, this is our solution.

695
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:34,000
This is, this is the current business workflow.

696
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,390
The first thing that we did looking

697
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,969
at this is how can we automate

698
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,108
each of these steps so that they can be done

699
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:43,130
by a software.

700
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,969
So for example, we can connect to an API,

701
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:49,150
uh, we can connect to an HR rostering

702
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:49,729
system

703
00:25:50,098 --> 00:25:51,170
with an API call.

704
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:54,229
We can look at HR policies with a

705
00:25:54,229 --> 00:25:55,049
knowledge base,

706
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:57,309
we can classify absences through

707
00:25:57,309 --> 00:25:57,969
an LLM,

708
00:25:58,229 --> 00:26:00,588
and we can notify a manager through Amazon SNS,

709
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:01,529
our messaging

710
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,529
solution. Now,

711
00:26:04,818 --> 00:26:06,410
let me simplify this a tiny bit.

712
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:08,920
OK. So

713
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,140
we started testing this

714
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,598
and you know instead of having a point of

715
00:26:12,598 --> 00:26:14,670
contact you can have a deterministic workflow because these are

716
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,500
all just tools.

717
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:17,108
But

718
00:26:17,568 --> 00:26:19,650
this doesn't quite always work. So if an

719
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,328
employee comes in and gives incomplete

720
00:26:22,328 --> 00:26:24,439
information. Then our tool

721
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,420
doesn't work already

722
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,140
because it can't quite record the full absence.

723
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:32,049
This is why we really need an agentic

724
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:32,789
workflow here.

725
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,660
We need a natural conversational pattern that

726
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,959
is able to collect all the relevant

727
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,670
information from the employee.

728
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:43,309
Now we can connect this agent to all of these tools,

729
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,459
quite. Pretty much the

730
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:47,640
same way as they were done deterministically before

731
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:49,818
and give it a prompt that will tell us exactly what it's

732
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:50,439
meant to do.

733
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:54,029
And

734
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:56,390
I know you guys have heard about agents before,

735
00:26:56,509 --> 00:26:58,588
but Let's make sure

736
00:26:58,588 --> 00:27:00,588
we're all on the same page here. Agents go with

737
00:27:00,588 --> 00:27:01,489
the react pattern

738
00:27:01,868 --> 00:27:03,910
where, given a human input,

739
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,049
they would.

740
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:07,910
Reason? Act

741
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:09,509
Observe

742
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:11,289
And give you a response.

743
00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:15,209
So here our agent is implemented with strands,

744
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,750
and each reasoning step is logged

745
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,989
in an S3 bucket for observability.

746
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:23,699
And what do our tools look like?

747
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:25,239
So our tools are

748
00:27:25,608 --> 00:27:27,618
like this one, for example, which extracts all

749
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:29,979
the information from the user that

750
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:32,088
the agent needs to take the further

751
00:27:32,088 --> 00:27:35,519
steps. OK,

752
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:37,309
so we have our first agent.

753
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:40,189
And we were excited.

754
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,660
It worked in our demo.

755
00:27:43,189 --> 00:27:44,828
And then we started testing it.

756
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:48,509
And we got some unwanted

757
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:50,559
behavior. We looked

758
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,959
into it and we came to our first

759
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:53,618
big learning.

760
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,989
You need to adapt your tools for agents.

761
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:59,358
You will all have tools in your current work

762
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:01,439
streams that are like software tools

763
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:03,519
that already give you the right answers that an agent

764
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,189
can use,

765
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,559
but agents can be so much

766
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,880
more accurate and fast

767
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:09,900
if you give them,

768
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,500
if you manage to tweak your tools a tiny bit.

769
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:16,529
So engineer Verbose error catching.

770
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:19,049
Tools like humans

771
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,500
need to know why an error is appearing, otherwise

772
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,779
they're not able to find an alternative path to your

773
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:25,789
solution. Make

774
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,529
the tool's output human readable.

775
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:30,390
Sure, LLMs can like

776
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,068
understand all J's and formats,

777
00:28:32,348 --> 00:28:34,469
but just like us they're gonna be quite a lot faster if you tell

778
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:36,549
them the information that they need to look in

779
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,338
these outputs.

780
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,670
So if you already know what information exactly you're gonna have

781
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,539
to extract from it,

782
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:42,509
just do that extra step for them if you can.

783
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,229
Then combine sequential tools. This is really

784
00:28:46,229 --> 00:28:47,519
important for latency.

785
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:49,799
If you have a sequence of tools that you know that are

786
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,259
always going to be called in the same sequence, just

787
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,160
do them together.

788
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:56,338
So in our example about extracting

789
00:28:56,338 --> 00:28:57,368
employee information,

790
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,939
this is the type of output that we want

791
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:00,759
to achieve

792
00:29:01,338 --> 00:29:02,459
as opposed to this really.

793
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
So lesson number one,

794
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:08,108
adapt your tools for agents.

795
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,279
OK, So we have

796
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,680
our text to text solution.

797
00:29:16,449 --> 00:29:18,618
Text to text solution we have our first solution

798
00:29:18,618 --> 00:29:20,108
which is reachable by text

799
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,189
and

800
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,269
it worked

801
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:24,108
on my laptop. It was great,

802
00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:26,529
but of course not all the employees are gonna come to my

803
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:28,750
laptop and play with it. We need scale.

804
00:29:29,588 --> 00:29:31,588
What if 50 employees need to use it at the same

805
00:29:31,588 --> 00:29:33,598
time? And

806
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:36,289
of course you can start, you can start going

807
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:37,699
down the realm of

808
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,598
hosttigen on a lambda, and then you need to think about a

809
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:42,420
wet socket state management.

810
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:45,539
These were like weeks of work to make sure that

811
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,650
everything would work correctly, how you intended it to

812
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,539
work. But then

813
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,368
We actually have a really good solution for this that

814
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:54,199
encaptures all of that complexity,

815
00:29:54,699 --> 00:29:55,400
and that's

816
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,269
Agent Corey Vheim.

817
00:30:00,318 --> 00:30:02,500
OK. So Adrian Cora on

818
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,439
time solved this in one afternoon.

819
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:08,009
I know you heard about Agent Core

820
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,439
quite a bit throughout these 5 days,

821
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:11,809
but just to give you a quick overview

822
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:12,390
if you

823
00:30:12,848 --> 00:30:13,449
haven't.

824
00:30:14,338 --> 00:30:15,219
Agent Core

825
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,019
uh gives you the skill and security to deploy

826
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:19,779
your agents securely.

827
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,039
And right now I'm talking about Agent Corre

828
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,799
runtime where you can host your agents.

829
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:27,328
It comes in a wider ecosystem of

830
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,568
tools that Agent Corre

831
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:29,989
has built.

832
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,858
And a wider set of capabilities

833
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:35,858
that are actually even wider than what I have on the

834
00:30:35,858 --> 00:30:36,750
screen right now.

835
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:39,420
But the main reasons why I like Agent Core

836
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,539
runtime is because it's compatible with

837
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,598
all open source infrastructure

838
00:30:43,598 --> 00:30:45,739
such as NTP servers and various

839
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:47,719
frameworks where you can host your agents.

840
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,739
So we are using runtime here with trans agents,

841
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,969
and I'll be talking about the model context

842
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:54,660
protocol that we built with it.

843
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:00,279
OK, and now so we have one employee coming

844
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:02,338
in. A 2nd,

845
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:04,049
a 3rd, and a 5th

846
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,670
agent core runtime solves our issue by

847
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,130
being a server-less solution

848
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:10,689
that connects directly with the front end

849
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:13,229
and has state persistency

850
00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:15,189
so that each one of these employees

851
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:16,209
gets an answer.

852
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:21,390
So we have a solution

853
00:31:21,848 --> 00:31:24,309
that handles conversations with runtime.

854
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:26,699
And now we started thinking about the future.

855
00:31:27,939 --> 00:31:29,969
What happens if we expand the scope of

856
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:30,880
this agent?

857
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,920
What happens if in the future we want

858
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,618
an employee that reports something different apart from an absence?

859
00:31:36,858 --> 00:31:37,650
For example,

860
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:38,519
a

861
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:40,150
broken escalator.

862
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:43,939
Now we have an issue because our

863
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:46,299
current solution cannot handle this.

864
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,699
So we can either take the solution apart

865
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,078
and tweak it and we put it out,

866
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,219
but this is a monolithic

867
00:31:53,838 --> 00:31:55,880
approach to this problem. You'd need to make sure

868
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,078
that everything is working all over again.

869
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:00,910
What if you can separate concerns? What if you can

870
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,269
separate the concern of all of your tools

871
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:04,630
from the concern of your agent?

872
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,519
This is why we decided to

873
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:12,539
host our tools on an MCP server.

874
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,049
An MCP server gives you a standard way of

875
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:18,299
exposing the tools, which means that not only

876
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:20,660
I can change the tools, but I can also then reuse

877
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,979
these tools in a new set of circumstances

878
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:24,880
with a different agent if I want to.

879
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:29,650
And these tools are now hosted in Agent

880
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,608
Core Gateway.

881
00:32:30,969 --> 00:32:33,009
Agent Core Gateway makes sure that

882
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:33,930
the agent

883
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:37,209
can discover all of these tools automatically.

884
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:42,549
How does it work?

885
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:45,380
An employee comes in with a question to Agent Core

886
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,469
on time or the agent hosting on Agent Core on

887
00:32:47,469 --> 00:32:49,469
Time. Agent Coreravo Time connects

888
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,568
to Agent Core Gateway and searches for the correct

889
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:53,338
tool to answer that question.

890
00:32:54,318 --> 00:32:56,299
It then is able to query that tool,

891
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,719
get the results.

892
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,529
And answer the

893
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:01,189
user's question.

894
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:02,509
Crucially,

895
00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:04,729
we can add more tools on the fly.

896
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:08,549
And all of this is through a single API call

897
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:09,670
to Agent Corey Gateway.

898
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:15,479
So our working text-based solution

899
00:33:15,858 --> 00:33:16,799
was working beautifully.

900
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,318
In testing.

901
00:33:19,489 --> 00:33:20,588
And we took the leap

902
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:22,989
and we went through our security review

903
00:33:23,489 --> 00:33:25,519
and our security reviewer looked at us and was like,

904
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,170
OK.

905
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,390
What stops someone from social engineering

906
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,750
the agent into doing something malicious?

907
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,279
We're like, yeah, that's a great question.

908
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:36,299
Well, of course,

909
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:39,618
We would add, we would add guard rails.

910
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,618
So we started adding guard rails and it

911
00:33:42,618 --> 00:33:43,660
worked really well.

912
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,150
For extreme solutions.

913
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,709
But what if a user is

914
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:50,910
a bit sneakier or if they're trying

915
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,269
to engineer a conversation over multiple

916
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:53,789
steps.

917
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:56,670
And keep in mind here we're talking about an airport.

918
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,719
If an absence is misrecorded, this

919
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:02,239
means issues with like checkpoints, flight

920
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:04,559
systems. This has like high

921
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,868
impact. So

922
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:08,628
this.

923
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:10,958
Of course,

924
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,260
without the proper security this would go

925
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,478
through. And

926
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:17,320
it led us to our second lesson.

927
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,188
You have to think broader than standard guardrails.

928
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,398
Write custom guardrails for compliant and

929
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:24,378
responsible AI.

930
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:27,498
Current Pedro guardrails only look at

931
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,759
the last message that the

932
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:31,478
uh person has written.

933
00:34:33,427 --> 00:34:35,467
When you think about guard railing, of course the first

934
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:37,728
thing that you should always think about is the

935
00:34:38,028 --> 00:34:39,637
principle of least privilege.

936
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:41,938
Make sure that whatever tool the agent is

937
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:44,228
using. Can only be used

938
00:34:44,228 --> 00:34:45,969
by the person that is authenticated,

939
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,809
but sometimes you kind of just need to leave a bit of flexibility

940
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:50,530
to an agent to use multiple tools.

941
00:34:51,438 --> 00:34:53,989
In this case, you really want to define unwanted

942
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,878
conversation patterns.

943
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,280
And build guard rails that have a context

944
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,780
of the conversation so that they can actually track that

945
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,079
conversation pattern and react in case

946
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:05,418
the pattern is deviating from a stand-up

947
00:35:05,418 --> 00:35:07,719
pattern that you want your agent to interact with.

948
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:11,110
So in,

949
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:12,840
in our scenario,

950
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,699
we added a context aware guard rail

951
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,780
through a um lambda,

952
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,500
and this is based on recovering the

953
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,539
memory of the agents and

954
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:25,030
having an LLM as a guard

955
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:31,280
rail. Now,

956
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:33,989
we have a microservice-based agent

957
00:35:34,648 --> 00:35:37,978
with Guardro. But

958
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:40,260
we still have one crucial component

959
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,648
missing. What

960
00:35:42,648 --> 00:35:44,889
if Macy, who is in her car, she's

961
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:46,628
driving to work, she's sitting in traffic,

962
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,369
and she can't quite make it in time for her shift?

963
00:35:49,688 --> 00:35:50,590
What happens then?

964
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,128
In her previous solution, she would have like picked up her

965
00:35:53,128 --> 00:35:55,239
phone, she would have called her manager, she would have been, I'm

966
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,260
sorry, I'm late,

967
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:58,679
and this would have all been solved for her.

968
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,208
Now she would really have to take off, take out

969
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,590
her phone, open an app,

970
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:04,079
write some texts,

971
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:06,349
all things that you really cannot do in a car.

972
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:09,148
Hence we need a speech to speech solution.

973
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:14,429
Here we built our speech to speech solution

974
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:16,090
thanks to Amazon Novasonic.

975
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:18,389
If you're not familiar with Amazon Novasonic, it's

976
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:20,389
a speech to speech model that is able to

977
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:21,449
interact with you

978
00:36:21,978 --> 00:36:22,550
verbally.

979
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:26,179
Now speech to speech adds a

980
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:28,039
real-time streaming complexity.

981
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:29,219
So

982
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:31,820
Novasonic expects continuous audio

983
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,059
input and gives out continuous audio

984
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:34,719
output.

985
00:36:35,418 --> 00:36:37,579
And so this can't really go through a

986
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:39,659
request response pattern like our text to text

987
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:41,769
model. So we have to

988
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:43,570
handle this with a web socket

989
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:45,869
connection, and this is managed by

990
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:46,909
the ECS.

991
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,550
Which buffers the audio frames

992
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:52,010
and coordinates the bidirectional stream.

993
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:55,510
Great, so now we have the infrastructure

994
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,789
to make sure that the user can speak

995
00:36:57,789 --> 00:36:59,148
to Novasonic.

996
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,168
But now Novasonic is a model, we

997
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:04,239
need to prompt it. And so we're like, great, we're gonna

998
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,289
use the same prompt that we use for the text model and we're

999
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:07,829
gonna go to Novasonic and it's gonna work.

1000
00:37:09,898 --> 00:37:11,619
Let us do our next lesson.

1001
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,938
Read speech to speech model prompts out

1002
00:37:15,938 --> 00:37:17,938
loud. Speech to

1003
00:37:17,938 --> 00:37:20,188
speech models have actually been trained

1004
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:22,208
on speech and so

1005
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:24,688
they they can't think as complexly.

1006
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:27,239
As a text to text model.

1007
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,239
Don't rely on chain of thought,

1008
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,820
no human will actually tell you what

1009
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,039
it's thinking about before actually saying it.

1010
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:38,898
Write out enumeration patterns. These

1011
00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:40,938
are great on a text prompt to give an

1012
00:37:40,938 --> 00:37:42,978
idea to the model of what you're about to do,

1013
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,500
but no one enumerates their sentences when they

1014
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,869
speak. And

1015
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:48,869
think about spelling.

1016
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,849
Your model just like you might not know all

1017
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:53,929
the names of all the different nationalities that are

1018
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:56,090
around you, so help the model think about

1019
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,090
how to deal with these edge cases

1020
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,070
and situations.

1021
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,340
So read your speech to speech to speech model

1022
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,398
prompts out loud.

1023
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:07,219
So we did this, we redrafted our prompt

1024
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:09,269
to be more speech-based as opposed

1025
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:10,079
to text-based.

1026
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:12,809
And then

1027
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,128
we had our model that connected to our user

1028
00:38:15,389 --> 00:38:17,389
for now for a front end but in the future

1029
00:38:17,389 --> 00:38:18,329
through a phone line

1030
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:20,949
and now this model needs to connect

1031
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:22,978
with all the tools that we built for the text to text

1032
00:38:22,978 --> 00:38:24,688
model, which led to

1033
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:27,429
a bit of a concern because as we just said, you

1034
00:38:27,429 --> 00:38:29,750
want a speech to speech model to interact

1035
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,059
with uh a verbose

1036
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,090
answer like something that you can read out loud

1037
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,250
and all of these tools.

1038
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,059
Are mainly like software outputs. Yes,

1039
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:40,378
we've improved them a tiny bit with lesson number one, but

1040
00:38:40,378 --> 00:38:41,829
they're still mainly like

1041
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:42,918
systems.

1042
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,099
But then we had an aha moment.

1043
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,159
There's a part of this infrastructure

1044
00:38:47,418 --> 00:38:49,418
that is already trained to give you a

1045
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:51,458
human readable response, and that's your

1046
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,648
text to text model. That's the agent, the

1047
00:38:53,648 --> 00:38:55,739
text agent that we built as the initial

1048
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:57,019
solution, the written solution.

1049
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,719
So instead of connecting Amazon Novasonic

1050
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:00,840
directly to the tools,

1051
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,699
we connected Amazon

1052
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:03,820
Novasonic

1053
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:06,199
to the text agent

1054
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,300
that we had already built.

1055
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,800
Like this, we have an agentic hierarchy

1056
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,378
where Novasonic calls as

1057
00:39:13,378 --> 00:39:15,059
a tool the text tool,

1058
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,860
the text model that then calls all the tools.

1059
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,070
And this also solves other problems that we

1060
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:22,179
would have encountered.

1061
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,809
Instead of having two sources of truths about

1062
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:27,128
how to use these tools and how to think about these problems

1063
00:39:27,128 --> 00:39:29,530
in the text and in the speech to speech models,

1064
00:39:29,878 --> 00:39:32,148
now we can just keep it in the text to text model

1065
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,329
and leave the speech model to just know when it

1066
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:35,389
has to call that tool.

1067
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:40,989
And

1068
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,849
this is great, but we still have a cru crucial

1069
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:45,909
concern, which is if you're calling

1070
00:39:45,909 --> 00:39:46,610
the model,

1071
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:48,228
then you're not authenticated.

1072
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,228
If you're

1073
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,688
using a text to text model through an app, you're usually

1074
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:53,780
authenticating before you get exposed to that model.

1075
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,869
But here we had an authentication problem.

1076
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,469
So we built an authentication tool.

1077
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:00,809
We asked Navasonic to collect all

1078
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:02,809
the relet, all the relevant information from

1079
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:03,469
the user.

1080
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,820
And then pass it to an authentication tool

1081
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,059
that would compare this information to

1082
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,780
the information stored in the HR system

1083
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,039
and return an answer on whether or not that

1084
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:15,360
user gave the right information and could be authenticated,

1085
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,769
after which Novasonic was allowed to use the

1086
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:18,639
text to text tool.

1087
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,360
So,

1088
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,820
think about your authentication with speech to speech models.

1089
00:40:24,628 --> 00:40:26,030
OK, so here it is.

1090
00:40:26,398 --> 00:40:28,679
This is the full architecture, our gentic

1091
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,898
AI solution from unplanned absence reports.

1092
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,648
So we got here and we demoed this to

1093
00:40:34,648 --> 00:40:35,909
our business stakeholders.

1094
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,780
So we showed them the architecture,

1095
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:40,360
we showed them a demo

1096
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,878
where a person would come in and be like they're sick,

1097
00:40:42,918 --> 00:40:43,728
they can't come in.

1098
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,239
And as expected, our agents started

1099
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,739
by authenticating the user,

1100
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:49,719
categorizing the absence.

1101
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,898
Recording absence with the HR system.

1102
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,449
Notifying the managers,

1103
00:40:55,918 --> 00:40:58,418
and all this while the employee was getting no response.

1104
00:40:58,878 --> 00:41:01,070
And it got to this point and our business stakeholder was like,

1105
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,699
oh, is it frozen?

1106
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,478
Lesson number 4, and perhaps the most crucial

1107
00:41:08,478 --> 00:41:09,059
lesson.

1108
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:11,610
You can have the most amazing backend

1109
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:14,510
that can do all the most amazing tasks,

1110
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,099
but agentic still requires an agent

1111
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,099
to go through a set number of tools which

1112
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:21,199
actually will always take some latency,

1113
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,378
which will always feel too much for an end user,

1114
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:25,079
and UI is king.

1115
00:41:25,418 --> 00:41:27,280
You need to keep your user engaged.

1116
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:30,219
So you need to add intuition on

1117
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:32,260
what the agents are doing behind

1118
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,090
the scenes.

1119
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:35,780
Well keeping this high level enough so that you're not

1120
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,860
revealing all your infrastructure in the

1121
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,458
back end.

1122
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:40,688
UI is king.

1123
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:44,898
So what does, what does this look like?

1124
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:46,639
Let me show you this in action.

1125
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:49,918
So this is our UI.

1126
00:41:50,418 --> 00:41:52,539
We have a person coming in so that they can't come into

1127
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:54,519
work, and they give you a good reason why.

1128
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,239
And

1129
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,059
the agent starts processing this

1130
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:01,418
information, retrieving all the user

1131
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,590
information. Then classifying

1132
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,750
the type of absence that this user is coming

1133
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,949
with and then realizing it doesn't

1134
00:42:07,949 --> 00:42:10,559
quite have enough information to fully

1135
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,849
record the absence.

1136
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:14,090
So it asks for more information

1137
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,889
that the user then provides.

1138
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:26,688
And then the agent is back to work.

1139
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,628
Figuring out what day it is, when is the person

1140
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:32,208
coming back in the calendar,

1141
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,789
and then creating all the records

1142
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:35,889
of absences.

1143
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,668
In this case, the user is a rostered

1144
00:42:38,668 --> 00:42:40,989
user, so we need to record both the absence

1145
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:41,889
into an HR system

1146
00:42:42,148 --> 00:42:44,309
and the rostering system and notify

1147
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:46,500
both their manager and their rostering

1148
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,898
manager. And then also

1149
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:51,119
making sure that the user is aware of

1150
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,789
what has been done behind the scenes,

1151
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,139
so it also sends a message to

1152
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:55,840
the user

1153
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:56,679
about.

1154
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:58,849
All the tasks that have been done.

1155
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:03,219
So this is it, our solution.

1156
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,610
So our key takeaways

1157
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,789
are 4.

1158
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,599
The first is adapt

1159
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,918
your tools for agents.

1160
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:17,570
Make sure you use verbose error catching.

1161
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:20,250
And minimize consecutive tool

1162
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,489
calls by merging them.

1163
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:24,010
Second

1164
00:43:24,429 --> 00:43:26,688
is ride guard rails for multi-turn

1165
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:27,300
conversations.

1166
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:30,739
Make sure that your agent cannot be strayed away from

1167
00:43:30,739 --> 00:43:31,739
its intended use.

1168
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:35,949
The 3rd is read your speech to speech

1169
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,329
model prompts out loud.

1170
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:41,320
And the 4th is UI is king.

1171
00:43:41,938 --> 00:43:43,360
Keep your user engaged.

1172
00:43:45,688 --> 00:43:47,148
So how did this work for us?

1173
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,309
But we've managed to standardize the way the absences

1174
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:51,570
are recorded in the system,

1175
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:54,030
and we now have a 99% consistency in

1176
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,188
absence reporting.

1177
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,128
This is unleashing a lot of potential into analyzing

1178
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,889
what the patterns in the absences are downstream.

1179
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:03,668
And we also reduce the time it takes for recording

1180
00:44:03,668 --> 00:44:05,728
these absences by 90%.

1181
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,030
But I'm going to let Steve tell you more about what's

1182
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,648
the what's in stock with Mag for

1183
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:14,800
the future. Thanks,

1184
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:15,329
Margarita.

1185
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,110
So. That's

1186
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,179
just a small window into I I guess

1187
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:21,769
what we've achieved this time round.

1188
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,269
Um, we are well on our

1189
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:26,349
way to becoming uh or achieving

1190
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:27,570
our strategy which is

1191
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:30,010
um to become the world's most intelligent airport group.

1192
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:32,878
You can obviously see what some of the next steps are, right,

1193
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:35,070
so why not automated rostering?

1194
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,519
Um, think about the operational size of the airport, spinning

1195
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:39,679
up certain bits of the terminal depending on

1196
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:42,239
which, um, stands are going to be used

1197
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:44,418
or or not when they're out of use.

1198
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,869
Um, there is a whole stack of of

1199
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:48,958
more use cases that we intend to apply this

1200
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:50,000
to. Um,

1201
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,360
it, it will ultimately uh result

1202
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,438
in us having more agents with the

1203
00:44:54,438 --> 00:44:55,938
right level of humans in the loop.

1204
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,760
A great number more tools that we're leveraging

1205
00:44:58,898 --> 00:45:01,219
and ultimately a more autonomous, efficient

1206
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:02,918
and effective er airport.

1207
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:07,469
Great, thanks Steve.

1208
00:45:09,128 --> 00:45:11,260
Margarita and I are part of a team at AWS

1209
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,559
called the Generative AI Innovation Center.
