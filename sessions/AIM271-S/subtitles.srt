1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,480
- Okay, everybody, we're gonna
go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,300
So if you're on the outskirts,
come on into the outskirts.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,460
We're gonna be talking
about using Amazon Nova Act

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,080
to simplify login workflows.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,400
Please put your hands together,

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,900
give a warm welcome to your speakers,

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,814
Anand Srinivas and Floris van der Grinten.

8
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:21,814
(audience applauds)

9
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:24,510
- Hey, what's up, folks?

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,160
First off, we're super excited.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,780
Thank you very much for coming in.

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,770
And we're super excited

13
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,950
to be talking about being
a Nova Act launch partner

14
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,420
and using Amazon Nova Act
to simplify login workflows.

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,220
And my name is an Anand Srinivas,

16
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,830
I'm the VP of product
and AI here at 1Password,

17
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,840
and I'm here with Floris van der Grinten,

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,443
who's a senior developer
in AI at 1Password as well.

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,353
Perfect.

20
00:00:48,353 --> 00:00:51,747
So the thing I want to get
started with is 1Password,

21
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,600
we're pretty well-known
for our security model.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,940
There's actually a 70-page
white paper out there

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,610
if anyone wants some bedtime reading

24
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,530
about exactly how that works.

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,700
And we recently updated that
security model for agentic AI

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,890
and what we think is important.

27
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,560
And so I just want to go
through a couple of these

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,880
that are key here.

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,760
The first is this idea
that secrets stay secret.

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,450
We have a very strict zero knowledge model

31
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,910
where any system hosted by 1Password

32
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,040
cannot decrypt your credentials.

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,710
And that's the model
that we intend to keep

34
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,303
with agentic AI as well.

35
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,820
The second and third here,

36
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,480
authorization should be
deterministic, not probabilistic,

37
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,310
and that raw credentials
should never enter

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,170
into a model's context,

39
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,540
those have to do with things like MCP.

40
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,970
So, for instance, sending raw credentials

41
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,650
down the MCP channel

42
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,720
is probably not best practice, right?

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,760
Is how we look at that.

44
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,790
And so we look for deterministic workflows

45
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,890
to transfer credentials in that way.

46
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,630
And then the rest of the principles

47
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,780
are all around transparency, auditability,

48
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,980
and other aspects of it.

49
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,300
So overall at 1Password,

50
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,460
the way we look at AI in general

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,020
is there's a component of this

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,140
which is using AI within our products.

53
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,900
And so we might call that AI for security.

54
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,630
And actually, Floris will be
covering that later on today.

55
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,210
And that's exactly how we
use the Nova Act models

56
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,247
to make the 1Password
product better, right?

57
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:21,840
And so he'll cover that.

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,480
The other side of this is security for AI,

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,630
which is using 1Password's products

60
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,110
to help secure agentic
AI as they're deployed.

61
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,750
And so that's the part I'm
gonna talk about a little bit

62
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,223
before I hand off to Floris.

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,710
But before I do,

64
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,990
what I want to sort of
talk about a little bit

65
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,580
is a sort of taxonomy

66
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,810
that will make this discussion

67
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,750
a little bit more clear
and useful hopefully.

68
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,140
So the way we look at AI
or agentic AI in particular

69
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,660
is on the vertical axis of this,

70
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,180
we classify it into two broad categories.

71
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,250
The first is agentic AIs

72
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,100
that interact with other
applications and services

73
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,110
by clicking around in a web browser

74
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,420
or more generally computer use, right?

75
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,920
They're mimicking a person

76
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,960
in terms of, like, that interaction.

77
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,530
The other type of agentic
AI uses programmatic means.

78
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,750
So think MCP, APIs,

79
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,690
other kinds of standard
approaches that way.

80
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,210
And then on the horizontal axis at the top

81
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,760
is where these agentic AIs are deployed.

82
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,550
Are they deployed on your
device, like, on your laptop,

83
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,560
or are they in the cloud, right?

84
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,740
And so if you look at what
this looks like in practice,

85
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,150
just some examples,

86
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,180
so when a browser-use style agentic AI

87
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,830
is running on your laptop,

88
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,200
examples of this are
things like Perplexity

89
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,560
or OpenAI's Atlas browser, right?

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,700
And the use cases here,

91
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,930
you're just automating something

92
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,450
on behalf of yourself, right?

93
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,670
Whereas in the cloud,

94
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,290
now we're talking about Nova Act

95
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,870
plus something like
AgentCore Browser Tool,

96
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,820
where the use cases are,

97
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,070
hey, I don't want to have
to sit in front of my laptop

98
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,903
and run this.

99
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,090
I can run this
asynchronously in the cloud.

100
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,280
It can be automation for myself,

101
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,790
it can be an internal
application for employees,

102
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,040
or it can be a production application

103
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,570
that's deployed in the cloud

104
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,000
that's deployed on behalf
of customers, right?

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,713
So any of those use cases.

106
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,653
The other side of this is programmatic.

107
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,710
And so, again, on your laptop,

108
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,500
what this looks like is
something like Cursor, right?

109
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,110
Or Loveable or Claude desktop, right?

110
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,930
And the use cases here are
a lot about vibe coding,

111
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,640
but it's just about automating

112
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,920
and making yourself
more efficient as well.

113
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,000
And then the cloud version of
this are deployed applications

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,910
or, you know, applications that are built

115
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,140
through agent builders

116
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,810
or AI that's embedded in,
you know, other applications

117
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,850
like Notion, for example, Notion AI.

118
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,580
And the use cases here,
again, are very similar

119
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,330
to the use cases for
the cloud applications

120
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,730
for browser-use agentic AI as well.

121
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,700
And so what we're gonna
focus on for this talk,

122
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,070
because it's relevant to
Nova Act in particular

123
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,290
and our launch partnership with AWS,

124
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,170
is the first side of this
or the top half of this,

125
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,810
which is around browser-use agentic AI.

126
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,720
But hopefully we'll be back at another day

127
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,970
to talk about the
programmatic AI stuff as well

128
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,113
and how 1Password can help
secure that side of it as well.

129
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,483
So getting into that,

130
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,630
the first one I want to talk about

131
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,430
is remotely deployed
browser-use style agentic AI.

132
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,540
So think about this

133
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,320
as there's a headless browser
running in the cloud, right?

134
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,680
And there's an LLM that's
driving that headless browser.

135
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,990
And basically you can prompt that LLM

136
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,150
and just let it run asynchronously.

137
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,030
And obviously for it to be of any value,

138
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,590
it has to log into things, right?

139
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,450
It has to log into different websites,

140
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,390
access different services,
and so on and so on.

141
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,700
So how do we solve that problem, right,

142
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,210
of getting those
credentials securely filled

143
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,280
on behalf of the agentic AI

144
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,220
without actually giving those
credentials to the agentic AI

145
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,570
into the context window

146
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,460
and also without, you know, a person

147
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,020
having to pause the thing

148
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,160
and manually type it in

149
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,540
and remember their password?

150
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,850
Hopefully we've gotten over
those kind of problems.

151
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,010
And so we recently made an announcement,

152
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,750
we're gonna be making
many more announcements

153
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,190
with partners on this,

154
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,120
where our solution

155
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,570
is we actually have a
1Password browser extension

156
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,660
running inside the headless
browser in the cloud.

157
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,220
And what we're able to do

158
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,530
is when that agentic or that LLM

159
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,630
wants to access some website,

160
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,587
it asks that browser extension,

161
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:33,510
"Hey, I would like to
fill in this website."

162
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,090
And previously, you
would've actually connected

163
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,490
the service and 1Password, right?

164
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,770
So in this example, we
made an announcement

165
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,390
with a company called Browserbase.

166
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,580
And so you would beforehand

167
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,857
connect Browserbase with 1Password

168
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,570
and sort of that sets it up.

169
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,820
And what happens is in the flow,

170
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,867
the LLM asks the browser extension,

171
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,210
"Can I fill this website?"

172
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,390
The browser extension asks
you, the person, right?

173
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,897
It gives you an auth prompt and says,

174
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:01,320
"Hey, Browserbase headless browser

175
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,600
is trying to access
this particular website

176
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,070
and wants your credentials for it.

177
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,300
Do you authorize it?"

178
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,040
And so you would approve that flow

179
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,840
and basically the credentials are sent

180
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,550
end-to-end encrypted, right?

181
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,520
Where they're only decrypted
inside the browser extension

182
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,890
that is actually in that headless browser.

183
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,620
And so that's the solution
that we've come up with here

184
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,760
that solves this problem

185
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,030
of, again, filling the
credentials on behalf of the agent

186
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,040
in a secure, encrypted way

187
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,610
without exposing the
credentials to the agent.

188
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,310
And some of the things going
forward that we're working on

189
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,440
are things like asynchronous
workflows, right?

190
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,990
So how do you set policy on the fact

191
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,970
that, okay, well, maybe
I don't want to approve

192
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,440
every single credential.

193
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,540
There's some low-risk ones
that can just go through,

194
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,650
no problem, right?

195
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,270
But maybe some higher risk ones,

196
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,840
I do want like an explicit
human-in-the-loop auth prompt.

197
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,390
And so some of the things
like that we're working on.

198
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,650
But that's an example

199
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,370
of browser-use agentic AI in the cloud,

200
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,570
how we're securing that.

201
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,880
The next part of this is what
about browser-use agentic AI

202
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,470
that is running on your laptop?

203
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,060
How do we secure that?

204
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,170
And so here,

205
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,650
recently we've announced
partnerships with Perplexity

206
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,310
as well as OpenAI's Atlas browser as well.

207
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,010
And we are launch partners with them

208
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,500
and the only security
launch partners with them.

209
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,070
And basically the idea is the
1Password browser extension

210
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,050
can work on these browsers

211
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,880
and so it solves at least the problem

212
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,100
of, again, you're not
manually typing passwords

213
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,660
into these things, right?

214
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,690
You're able to fill it
from your vault, right?

215
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,340
And then going forward,

216
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,010
what we'll be looking to
do is add more automations

217
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,320
to this particular workflow as well.

218
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,440
And so, you know, hopefully
that kind of gives you an idea

219
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,540
that at least on the browser-use side,

220
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,860
that's the breadth of how we're looking

221
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,290
at sort of how to secure agentic AI.

222
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,640
And as I said earlier,

223
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,800
you know, hopefully we'll
be back in the future

224
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,650
to talk about the
programmatic AI stuff as well.

225
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,630
So with that, what I'm gonna do

226
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,110
is I'm gonna hand off
to my colleague, Floris,

227
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,660
and he's gonna get into
how we're actually using

228
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,780
the Nova Act models within
the 1Password product

229
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,720
to solve important production use cases.

230
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,553
Floris?

231
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:11,386
- Cool.

232
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:14,100
Hi, I'm Floris from the
engineering team at 1Password,

233
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,240
and I'm gonna be showing you

234
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,020
how we're using agentic AI at 1Password

235
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,000
to improve our own product

236
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,570
in a way that just wouldn't
be possible in a pre-AI era.

237
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,290
And the star of the show here
is really Amazon's Nova Act,

238
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,420
which launched here at re:Invent,

239
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,513
and it's their browser-use
agent agentic AI solution.

240
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,027
So let's talk about autofill.

241
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:41,790
1Password comes with a browser
extension, as you may know.

242
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,790
And this adds a small
icon in login form fields.

243
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,100
And if you click that icon,
you can choose a credential,

244
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,560
the credential that you want
to use to log into the website,

245
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,920
and then 1Password does the
tedious work of logging in

246
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,303
and filling out the form.

247
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,330
So that's how it works today.

248
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,960
But we're working on the next
generation now of autofill

249
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,360
and we're calling it Universal Sign On.

250
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,190
And with Universal Sign On,

251
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,880
we really wanna take the
experience of logging in

252
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,700
from, "Hey, 1Password, fill
in this login form for me,"

253
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,640
to a more holistic, like, "Hey,
1Password, just log me in.

254
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,710
Do whatever it takes to log me in,"

255
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,340
and so regardless of the login method,

256
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,140
so whether that's a username/password,

257
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,823
a TOTP for MFA, enterprise SSO,

258
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:30,690
a passkey, or sign in
with GitHub or Google,

259
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,250
which you probably
forgot which one you used

260
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,810
for which website again.

261
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,673
And so here's how that looks.

262
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,370
So I click on a website

263
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,130
and it automatically
goes to the login page,

264
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,733
signs me in, enters the
password, enters the TOTP,

265
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,420
and I'm logged in with
just a single click,

266
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,570
hands off the keyboard.

267
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,673
Now, so how does this work?

268
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,880
Unfortunately, there's
not a standard protocol

269
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,170
for logging into websites.

270
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,040
It's free-for-all HTML
with lots of ambiguity.

271
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,260
And for classic autofill,

272
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,840
we have more or less solved the ambiguity

273
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,250
with a one-size-fits-all or a
one-size-fits-most algorithm

274
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,470
that's based on heuristics.

275
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,360
And it's been working great

276
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,233
and it's being used millions
of times per day by many users.

277
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,540
But now for Universal Sign On,

278
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,940
we're running into the
limits of the heuristics

279
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,640
that we can articulate in our code

280
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,830
because now the browser extension,

281
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,380
it wouldn't just need to
know how to fill in the form,

282
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,540
it also needs to know how to navigate to

283
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,440
and through the form,

284
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,053
which is much more complex to do.

285
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So ideally we would have
website-specific logic here

286
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,766
because every website is different.

287
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:56,340
And to make this a success

288
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,593
and to realize the
Universal Sign On vision,

289
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:01,140
this is what we're gonna need.

290
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,970
The problem is, though,
as you probably guess,

291
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,930
as you can probably guess,

292
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,900
this doesn't scale if you
have to do this by hand

293
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,500
because, yeah, there are
millions of websites out there

294
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,490
that offer a login, that offer logins.

295
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,990
And also, even if we were to do this,

296
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,100
it's gonna be brittle

297
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,950
because at the scale we'd operate on,

298
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,000
we would see breaking
changes every single day.

299
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,530
So that's not really an option.

300
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,043
So now with Nova Act,

301
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,130
we can finally solve this.

302
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,450
We can scale this up.

303
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,283
So what we've done,

304
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:36,690
we've built an AI agent using Nova Act

305
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,930
that goes out on the web,
browses these websites for us,

306
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,050
and it gathers the
intelligence that we need

307
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,263
around how different
websites offer logins.

308
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,480
And the intelligence is then
validated by a second agent,

309
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,610
which also uses Nova Act

310
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,680
to validate whether the information

311
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,500
that we get about the login
experience is correct.

312
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,970
And then it gets fed into

313
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,100
what we call the Site Intelligence Engine

314
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,980
and that exposes it to
our browser extension

315
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,030
and the browser extension

316
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,490
then uses the intelligence to
enhance the existing algorithm

317
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,723
for a smooth login experience.

318
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,030
And what's nice about this is
that it can run out of band,

319
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,470
so it can run in our infrastructure

320
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,940
and gather the intelligence

321
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,560
and pass that to the browser extension

322
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,150
so that the browser extension,

323
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,390
the login experience there
will just stay blazingly fast

324
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,683
and also deterministic.

325
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,820
And what's also nice is that
we can run the validation agent

326
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,020
periodically in the background

327
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,110
to see if the intelligence
is still correct or not,

328
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,493
and if not, invalidate it.

329
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:54,210
So let's have a look at how
the Nova Act agent does this.

330
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,210
So we're gonna have it browse
to the re:Invent website

331
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,807
and the instructions that we give is,

332
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,580
"Find how this website offers login."

333
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,260
And this is a pretty simple example

334
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,160
because there's a big login
button on the top, right?

335
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,263
So it should be able to find it here.

336
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,520
Let's see if, yes, clicked it.

337
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,560
And it's able to find the login form

338
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,130
and it knows this is the login form,

339
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,960
so I'm gonna return.

340
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,900
If we look at a slightly
more complex example,

341
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,600
here is the website for Duolingo.

342
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,010
And this is a bit more difficult

343
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,410
because it doesn't have a
traditional login button.

344
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,827
It just says, it has a button that says,

345
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:37,620
"I already have an account."

346
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,450
And to make it a bit more complicated,

347
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,760
it's not a standard
button within with an href

348
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,500
that links to the login button,

349
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,020
but it's a JavaScript click handler.

350
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,850
And this would be much more complicated

351
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,090
to build it in a
heuristic-based algorithm.

352
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,539
But for humans, it's easy.

353
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:54,750
Humans just click, "I
already have an account."

354
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,740
And because Nova Act uses the
same human kind of reasoning,

355
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,280
it's still easily able
to get to the login page,

356
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,380
which is really great.

357
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:10,320
And along the way, Nova
Act also logs every step

358
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,480
in the evaluation loop that it takes.

359
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,510
And as you can see, it really
thinks like a human here.

360
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,590
It reasons like a human.

361
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,180
So it finds a button that says,
"I already have an account,"

362
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,030
which likely links to the login form,

363
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,040
then it knows, "Okay,
I need to click that,"

364
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,980
and then it actually is
able to perform the click.

365
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,680
And lastly, it will evaluate it again

366
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,920
and then it reasons about,
"Hey, this is the login form,

367
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,477
so I'm done with my task."

368
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,340
So to recap, website-specific intelligence

369
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,950
can meaningfully improve
the 1Password product

370
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,983
in a way that just wouldn't
be possible in a pre-AI era.

371
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,070
And we really just only
scratched the surface

372
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,320
of what agentic AI can do for our product,

373
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,700
but if you want to try it out

374
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,520
and get a glimpse of this new
universal login experience,

375
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,250
you can install the beta
of the 1Password extension,

376
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,040
which already has this new UX

377
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,550
and the first data intelligence

378
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,593
powered by Amazon Nova Act.

379
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,263
So thank you for listening.

380
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,548
- [Anand] We can take
some questions, yeah.

381
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:22,042
(audience applauds)
