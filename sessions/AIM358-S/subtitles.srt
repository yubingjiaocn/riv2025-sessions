00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:01,538
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:03,119 --> 00:00:05,238
I'm Ora Lenner. I'm the CEO of Bright Data,

3
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:07,099
and today we're gonna talk about

4
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:09,739
something that sounds trivial but actually it's

5
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:11,829
not. It's intelligent models

6
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:13,460
versus knowledgeable models

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,250
and what does that mean?

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,699
So it's been exactly 3 years

9
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,219
since the launch of ChaGPT 3

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,260
and that magical moment.

11
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:24,879
To me, the magic continues. I

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,239
keep working with these tools

13
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:27,940
like everyone

14
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:29,158
else here.

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,228
And

16
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,158
we're experiencing this same magical moment

17
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,270
only almost on an hourly

18
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,700
basis when we're using the tools, right? It's

19
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:40,228
super intelligent models. They

20
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:42,298
know everything about the world.

21
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,158
They actually answer very

22
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:46,158
complicated

23
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,098
questions. They're winning gold

24
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:51,359
medal, uh, in, in the meth Olympics,

25
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,759
so their intelligence level is extremely

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,840
high. By definition, the models that

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,319
we're using today are the smartest

28
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:59,639
the world has ever seen,

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,158
and their next version that might come

30
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:04,349
up tomorrow or the next

31
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,219
foundational model builder that we might

32
00:01:06,558 --> 00:01:08,138
launch their model in a week

33
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:11,219
by definition will be smarter,

34
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:14,019
so the intelligent level keeps on

35
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,659
growing and expanding and it's just

36
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,319
magical. However,

37
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,019
all of you know the feeling that you're using

38
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:22,418
this intelligent model.

39
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,819
And at the same time it can

40
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,819
be, I don't have any other

41
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,219
better word to use,

42
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:30,040
extremely stupid

43
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:32,659
on various things that you actually

44
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,760
want to achieve on

45
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:36,260
just a daily routine, you

46
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,459
know, buying something on

47
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,510
just asking something simple

48
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,939
that every 5 years old can answer,

49
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:45,719
but if it's lacking the knowledge,

50
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,338
intelligence is not enough, and this is

51
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:49,838
what we're going to talk about today.

52
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,388
And we're going to look at it from the

53
00:01:52,388 --> 00:01:53,528
data perspective.

54
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:56,888
Pausing this thought for a second, I want

55
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:58,650
to introduce briefly Bright Data

56
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,569
and kind of show you the reason

57
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,109
that

58
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,189
or, or, or the, the, the

59
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,668
ability of Bright data to look into

60
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,349
this um

61
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,949
intelligence versus knowledge

62
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,610
and model ecosystem and our unique

63
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,409
position

64
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:18,008
into, into the AI

65
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:20,409
industry. So

66
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:23,179
Bright Data serves 20,000 customers

67
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:24,270
today that are

68
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,088
obsessed about getting the data they

69
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:29,210
need that they need from the public web

70
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,689
in order to do various things

71
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:32,569
including AI.

72
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,210
So this includes most of the large

73
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,210
language models and foundational models

74
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,569
and pretty much every other AI company

75
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,610
that builds on top of the, of

76
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,508
these models

77
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:45,288
and they, when they need data for training

78
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:47,050
or even data for real-time.

79
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:49,479
They come to us. It also means

80
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:52,008
that the largest e-commerce platforms

81
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:54,219
that needs to understand what's going on in the world

82
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:56,338
and be competitive when you're coming

83
00:02:56,338 --> 00:02:58,338
to their website to buy something are

84
00:02:58,338 --> 00:03:00,379
also using our infrastructure to get

85
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:01,179
web data.

86
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:04,460
Same goes for financial services.

87
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,599
Think of the largest American banks that

88
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,830
need to get smart

89
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:09,389
investment decisions.

90
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:10,990
They need data for that.

91
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,258
Cybersecurity as well,

92
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,500
to find a threat

93
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,338
in this

94
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,838
huge ecosystem of the World

95
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:22,000
Wide Web, you actually need to collect a

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,860
lot of data.

97
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:25,740
And many other industries

98
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,058
and vertical news cases that all

99
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:29,080
need web data.

100
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,439
This creates massive scale.

101
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,520
We see roughly 50 billion

102
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:36,860
web pages a day. Our customers

103
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,058
are using the Bright Data platform to

104
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:39,868
collect data

105
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,599
from this huge amount

106
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:44,558
of internet on a daily basis.

107
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,659
That's 3/3 times

108
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:50,460
more of all of the Google search queries

109
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,699
globally, worldwide, every single

110
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,000
day. So the scale is massive.

111
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,610
And it's not an easy thing to do.

112
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,860
We invest a lot in research

113
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,860
and development and considered to be one

114
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,758
of the leading companies in the world

115
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,319
when it comes to different technologies

116
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,899
around web data collection, web scraping.

117
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:14,169
We also keep a very large portion

118
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:15,919
of the internet that we're seeing,

119
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,548
and we are increasing

120
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,629
our web archive that just passed 450

121
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,910
billion webpages and growing

122
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,088
very, very fast.

123
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:28,449
And to do all of that we have

124
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:29,970
the largest known

125
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:32,629
um pool of bots that

126
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:34,629
are actually using and browsing

127
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:35,309
the web

128
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,769
every second of the day

129
00:04:38,108 --> 00:04:39,649
to collect this information.

130
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,569
So when we are talking about

131
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,750
AI in the form of or in

132
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,879
the sense of data,

133
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:48,350
we know what we're talking about because we are

134
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,600
the largest vendor for the AI industry

135
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:51,809
when it comes to data.

136
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,329
Now

137
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,649
When you want to build an intelligent model.

138
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,108
You need 3 major ingredients and that's

139
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:02,480
kind of obvious today for everyone, right?

140
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:05,139
One is very smart people to ride the

141
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,470
sophisticated algorithm of the large language

142
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,509
model. Then you also need a lot

143
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,910
of compute to train the model and

144
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,309
obviously you need a lot of data to feed

145
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:17,290
those massive clusters of GPUs

146
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,329
that needs to

147
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:19,488
train the model.

148
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,069
Now, the trends that we're seeing as

149
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:24,670
the largest web data provider for this

150
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,899
industry. are as follows we see

151
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:27,910
that on the

152
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,088
Algorithm side,

153
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:32,790
the open source and open weight

154
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:35,809
models are already in par

155
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:38,670
with the closed source closed weights models,

156
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,920
right? So

157
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,389
you will get almost identical

158
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,389
performance on almost all of the evil

159
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:46,290
tests out there when you compare

160
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:48,790
open source open weights to closed source close

161
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,988
weights. In addition to that,

162
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:53,389
we see that training is becoming

163
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:55,838
cheaper. It's not just

164
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:58,819
the cost of acquiring the compute

165
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,889
and the GPUs, it's also what

166
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:02,238
you can do today

167
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,980
with previous generations of GPUs,

168
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,040
but also the cost of energy

169
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:09,540
and the cost of cooling, which is essential

170
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,199
to training large language models,

171
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:13,699
is decreasing and actually it's, it's

172
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:14,838
going down pretty fast.

173
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:18,238
So if the starting point to

174
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:19,778
train new models is

175
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,358
actually easier than ever before, I'm

176
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:24,358
not saying it's easy, but it's easier

177
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:25,338
than ever before.

178
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,309
Then what we're seeing as a data company

179
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:30,790
is that the data becomes the major mode.

180
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:33,769
Because if you can all get the same compute

181
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,970
and use the same open source, open

182
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,269
weight models, then the data

183
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:39,209
matters the most.

184
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:42,350
Now, with that background of our scale

185
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,910
and what we're seeing and the fact that we're servicing

186
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:47,548
the vast majority of the foundational model

187
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:48,209
builders,

188
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:49,369
let's get back

189
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:52,790
to the subject we started with, intelligent

190
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,170
versus knowledgeable.

191
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:55,759
LLMs.

192
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,988
Now, an, an, an analogy

193
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:00,889
I like to use is

194
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,889
physics.

195
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,009
Can a theoretical physics prove a new

196
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:05,829
phenomenon?

197
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,189
Just think about the brain of

198
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,730
a physic.

199
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:12,869
The answer is no. What they can

200
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:15,269
do is describe the new phenomenon.

201
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,569
They have a theory. They can describe it.

202
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,439
They can propose and develop theories

203
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,379
and models

204
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:25,000
in order to prove or disprove

205
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,959
this theory.

206
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:29,189
But it stops there, so they

207
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:31,759
can be very, very smart, very

208
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,778
intelligent,

209
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:34,559
but it stops there.

210
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,809
What they can do afterwards is

211
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:40,588
work with their colleague that experimental

212
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:41,230
physics.

213
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,338
To run an experiment

214
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,959
in order to provide evidence and

215
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,259
prove or disprove

216
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,040
this new theory or this new phenomenon.

217
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:54,069
LLMs today works the same.

218
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:57,629
So using the same analogy, I'll ask

219
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:58,540
a different question.

220
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,149
Can an LLM purchase the right product

221
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:02,379
for you today?

222
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,108
And we'll also talk about the future.

223
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,769
But

224
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,858
today it's very,

225
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,119
it is very intelligent and

226
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,178
sophisticated

227
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:13,778
model that you can use,

228
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:16,358
the answer is no, it can't actually

229
00:08:16,358 --> 00:08:16,939
do that

230
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:19,420
simple task of, let's say,

231
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,488
buying milk that you

232
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:23,509
can pour into the

233
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,559
bowl of cereals that you want to eat

234
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:27,678
tomorrow morning in your breakfast.

235
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,178
It just can't do that.

236
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,358
So

237
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,820
today the models are more like the theoretical.

238
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:34,960
Physics

239
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,048
And they're still lacking that knowledge

240
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:40,750
to actually do that experiment

241
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,529
in physics, but in the real world

242
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:45,609
to buy that carton of milk

243
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,629
so you can

244
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:48,149
eat your cereals.

245
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:51,210
So, if it doesn't have

246
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,408
the real-time price, just one example

247
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,599
of a crucial piece of

248
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,989
information so that for you to use the model

249
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,609
to make it both efficient, smart,

250
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:01,908
and useful for you,

251
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:03,830
then it's not there yet.

252
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:07,288
And as the Internet, that

253
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:08,349
World Wide Web,

254
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,729
last 30 years of information that

255
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:11,450
was, you know,

256
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,609
built by the largest tech companies

257
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:17,129
out there and all of the data that is generated

258
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:19,690
is becoming that infrastructure layer

259
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,090
for the new Internet, these chatbots

260
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,349
that we're all using,

261
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:24,629
we see

262
00:09:25,168 --> 00:09:27,529
two major trends that are taking

263
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:29,340
shape in 2025

264
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,269
and.

265
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:33,479
Something big is gonna happen in 2026,

266
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,739
which is only a few weeks away, and we're gonna

267
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,940
cover that as well, but what we're seeing

268
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:40,308
is that everyone is consuming

269
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:42,019
as much data as they can

270
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:44,259
to build the most intelligent

271
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:45,259
models

272
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,519
and if this graph represents the

273
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,379
usage growth.

274
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:51,590
Of data for training, you can see

275
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,668
that it is growing and it's not

276
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:54,928
gonna stop growing.

277
00:09:55,349 --> 00:09:57,428
However, it is growing in a linear

278
00:09:57,428 --> 00:09:59,428
manner. And

279
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:02,029
you already have these very sophisticated intelligent

280
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:02,548
models,

281
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:04,330
right? So let's use this

282
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,830
example of milk again. These models

283
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,200
can tell you

284
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,048
everything about the ingredients of the milk.

285
00:10:11,469 --> 00:10:12,619
They can tell you

286
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:15,190
about the class action lawsuit that

287
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,369
the milk company

288
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:18,710
got 10 years ago and what

289
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,710
was the outcome.

290
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:21,830
They're perfect for that,

291
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,788
but what we're seeing now

292
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:26,369
is an absolute explosion

293
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:28,428
and an exponential growth

294
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,308
when it comes to real-time data

295
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:34,210
to add also the knowledge layer

296
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,529
on top of the intelligent layer to

297
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:38,609
also tell you what is the

298
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:40,729
price of the milk, not just

299
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:43,058
everything about the ingredients of the milk.

300
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:45,729
This is not a vision, this is what we're seeing

301
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,928
from our perspective as the largest

302
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:49,450
data vendor for this industry.

303
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:54,219
And OK.

304
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,830
Got back and we're seeing that

305
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,149
not just in milk obviously

306
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:02,029
everywhere just think about the world around you

307
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,058
think about what you're doing every

308
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:06,489
day. You wanna

309
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,908
know everything about the Las Vegas

310
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:10,989
sphere but also you wanna go to a

311
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:13,070
show so the intelligent

312
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,149
layer of the model will tell you

313
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:17,629
everything about the construction of the sphere

314
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,070
and how much it cost and who was the

315
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,269
construction company.

316
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,070
And everything you wanna know about it, but

317
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,009
to buy a ticket

318
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:27,408
to tonight's show in the sphere,

319
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:28,960
you can't do that

320
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,570
unless you're adding the knowledge layer

321
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,989
and giving it to the uh uh allowing

322
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:36,029
the LLM to access that layer, and this

323
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,029
is the current trend that is starting

324
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:39,090
to take shape

325
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,750
again, it's not there yet, but this is the trends

326
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,750
that we're seeing adding knowledge

327
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,090
on top of intelligence.

328
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,808
Now I took

329
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:51,788
um a very um popular

330
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:53,869
evil test that is working

331
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:56,129
specifically or testing specifically

332
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:57,989
reasoning and knowledge,

333
00:11:58,269 --> 00:11:59,849
exactly what we're here to talk about.

334
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:02,509
And you can see all of the models

335
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:04,168
performing one way or another.

336
00:12:04,538 --> 00:12:06,629
And for this event

337
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:09,109
I was focusing on the Chat GPT

338
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:11,239
open source 120 billion

339
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,428
tokens

340
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,889
that everyone can use and test

341
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,070
as an open source tool and what

342
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,129
we're gonna see now.

343
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:20,849
is an example for using

344
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:22,889
only that intelligent

345
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:24,869
and again very intelligent.

346
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:28,129
In this case, the open source of

347
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:28,668
GPT.

348
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:31,940
But lacking that knowledge layer,

349
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,149
and that will be on the left hand side.

350
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,389
On the right hand side, we will see

351
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:38,969
the same model exactly using

352
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:40,369
that knowledge layer.

353
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,979
In this case, the bright data MCP.

354
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,109
So giving

355
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:46,229
that open source LLM

356
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,849
access to real-time information from

357
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:49,428
the web.

358
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:50,769
Let's take a look.

359
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:54,250
It's a bit hard to see from far, so

360
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,219
I'll explain.

361
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:58,389
We are asking about salaries

362
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:00,769
from Glassdoor in different companies.

363
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:03,450
We just wanna know that because we wanna recruit

364
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:05,889
on the left hand side without access

365
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:08,168
to web to, to real-time web

366
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:08,739
data.

367
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:11,489
The model kind of says in, in, in a

368
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:12,989
very apologetic way,

369
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:15,729
sorry, I can't get this information.

370
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:17,989
So actually completely useless. I just

371
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:20,750
got the most sophisticated model out there.

372
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,210
That is completely useless for a daily task

373
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,210
that I want to perform.

374
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,129
On the right hand side with the bright data MCP,

375
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:29,928
it actually got you a complete table

376
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:32,308
with all of the information you wanted to get

377
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:35,428
everything, the salaries, per position

378
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:36,609
in different companies.

379
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,298
As a human, you can do it in 5

380
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:39,889
minutes,

381
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,639
but taking that super smart

382
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,808
model that can win a gold medal in

383
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:45,908
math Olympics,

384
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,288
you just can't do that without that

385
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:50,349
knowledge layer that gives you access

386
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:50,928
to the web.

387
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,479
We're seeing by working

388
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:56,979
with these companies that in 2026,

389
00:13:57,058 --> 00:13:59,139
the the knowledge layer

390
00:13:59,139 --> 00:13:59,798
and the

391
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:02,558
intelligent layer are gonna merge.

392
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:04,099
This is

393
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,658
something huge for us, for

394
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:08,259
humanity I would even say,

395
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,979
because this is where it is actually going

396
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:11,840
to automate

397
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,399
everything that we're doing.

398
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,149
It's not gonna happen in one day.

399
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,779
But you're starting seeing that in e-commerce,

400
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,119
in travel, when you're not

401
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:23,538
just using these models to plan

402
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:26,239
your, your trip or you're not using

403
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,739
these models just to

404
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,619
um ask a question about the product.

405
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,558
We're starting to see and sense the ability

406
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:35,599
of actually getting the relevant

407
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,918
real-time information like the availability

408
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,639
of the product,

409
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,158
the price of the product, the shipping time

410
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:42,820
of the product to your

411
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:45,629
location. Or the price of that

412
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:47,048
flight or hotel room.

413
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,210
And

414
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,710
again, from our perspective, from

415
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,859
the data perspective, we're seeing that in 2026,

416
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:55,808
this is going to unlock

417
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,048
a huge

418
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,479
Huge opportunity for

419
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,519
everyone who's working on

420
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,038
AI with AI and just for

421
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:07,178
everyone in the world who is using these tools

422
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:10,418
because when you combine knowledge with intelligence,

423
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,538
It's really unlocking

424
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:15,820
everything that we're doing as humans. It, it can

425
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:18,279
and will replace a lot of the tasks that we're

426
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,700
doing on a daily basis

427
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,080
that you don't really need to put in effort

428
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,139
anymore. You can use your time doing

429
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,019
other things.

430
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,408
I'll finish by

431
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,109
