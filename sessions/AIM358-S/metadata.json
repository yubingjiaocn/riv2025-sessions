  "title_cn": "AWS re:Invent 2025 - 通过数据视角看智能模型与知识模型 (AIM358)",
  "abstract": "Intelligence vs. knowledge is a vital consideration for current AI models. While these models possess the intelligence to solve complex, PhD-level mathematical problems, they require more extensive knowledge to enhance real-world applicability. For instance, despite their advanced calculation abilities, they may not be aware of current market prices for items like Nike shoes. To bridge this gap, models must access real-time data and information. By doing so, they can incorporate accurate, timely details into their mathematical frameworks, improving both their decision-making capabilities and practical implementation across various domains. This synergy between intelligence and knowledge will redefine AI's potential. This presentation is brought to you by Bright Data, an AWS Partner.",
  "abstract_cn": "智能与知识是当前AI模型的重要考量。虽然这些模型具备解决复杂博士级数学问题的智能，但它们需要更广泛的知识来增强现实世界的适用性。例如，尽管具有先进的计算能力，它们可能不了解Nike鞋等商品的当前市场价格。为了弥补这一差距，模型必须访问实时数据和信息。通过这样做，它们可以将准确、及时的细节融入其数学框架中，提高决策能力和在各个领域的实际实施效果。智能与知识之间的这种协同作用将重新定义AI的潜力。本演示由AWS合作伙伴Bright Data为您呈现。",
