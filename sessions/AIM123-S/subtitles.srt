1
00:00:01,032 --> 00:00:02,477
- Good afternoon.

2
00:00:02,477 --> 00:00:03,510
- [Audience] Good afternoon.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,040
- Lovely.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,820
We are gonna talk about
the zero migration path

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,503
from data to enterprise agentic AI, okay?

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,490
It's a provocative title,

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,613
but hopefully, the conversation
will live up to the hype.

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,973
A quick word about Trianz.

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,990
We are an AWS ISV partner.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,543
We work with AWS in multiple disciplines.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,100
We bring a completely
different approach and a model

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,260
to help our customers transform,

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,010
and we call that as services as software.

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,100
We're gonna talk very quickly
about what our approach is

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,540
and what our capabilities are,

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,810
and then dive into this concept of

17
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,053
zero migration data to agentic ai.

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,203
We lead with a massive
platform called Concierto.

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,990
Concierto has five big
transformative solutions in it.

20
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,360
Number one is modernization.

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,360
Modernization of infrastructure
of data and applications

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,130
all at the same time, okay?

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,530
Number two is migrate.

24
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,950
Concierto can assess,
map out dependencies,

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,080
create waves, all of that stuff,

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,560
and move all the three
layers at the same time

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,623
to any of the three clouds
and between the clouds.

28
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,730
Number three, Concierto
allows you to manage

29
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,940
all of these environments
from a single pane of glass

30
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,613
with a single abstracted process.

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,000
Number four is maximize,

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,360
we use the word maximize
in sort of observability,

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,190
because what Concierto does

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,099
is it looks at consumption
patterns, capacity ,

35
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:52,050
events and all of that stuff,

36
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,050
and uses AI and ML to remediate
the use of these anomalies

37
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,060
so that you're able to optimize
how you're using the cloud.

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,980
And then the last piece
is insights in agentic AI,

39
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,950
which is what we are going to dive into.

40
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,320
Concierto us hosted on AWS.

41
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,040
We have over 60, 70 customers
in the last five months alone

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,450
who have adopted this,

43
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,000
not to mention a number
of customers worldwide

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,423
who are using the platform
through Concierto partners.

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,550
Before we talk about this
concept of data to agentic AI,

46
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,850
a quick word about our
experience and all things data,

47
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,020
and I'm double flicking here
specifically on federated data

48
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,410
and connecting with a
federated model, okay?

49
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,990
We have done a lot of work in this space,

50
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,833
but what is relevant here is
about four to five years ago,

51
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,790
we were the first company
to connect the AWS cloud

52
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,683
with data sources anywhere on the planet.

53
00:02:53,683 --> 00:02:57,360
AWS subsequently acquired
the software from us,

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,270
and we ended up becoming a
very close strategic partner.

55
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,960
And we do a lot of engineering
services for AWS as well.

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,630
So this is the foundation on which

57
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,000
we are gonna be talking about this concept

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,540
of data to agentic AI without migrations.

59
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,930
Yesterday, AWS released
about a dozen connectors

60
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,326
to third party ISVs from the AWS Cloud.

61
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:21,960
Concierto and Trianz is the company that

62
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,460
built those connectors.

63
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,050
And we're gonna keep doing that

64
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,870
over the course of the next several years

65
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,870
until we are able to
create or co-create or help

66
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,030
in the design and the build
out of agentic cloud, okay?

67
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,840
So we are also working with AWS

68
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,580
in connecting the different layers

69
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,130
of the cloud itself, okay?

70
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,530
So that is the experience and perspective

71
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,033
that we bring to the table.

72
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,440
So let's dive into our subject today.

73
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,430
There are two really, really
big existential questions

74
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,800
that everybody in the board is asking.

75
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,193
And if you are anywhere
in the data landscape,

76
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,850
there is no hiding from
these two questions.

77
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,240
Question number one,
how much time do we have

78
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,713
to get ahead of AI?

79
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,830
It's not about getting too AI

80
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,190
because everybody else in your
industry is doing the same,

81
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,190
and therefore, you have to
put yourself in a position

82
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,250
where you're innovating
and coming up with ideas

83
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,230
that are ahead of the industry.

84
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,940
And you can only do that

85
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,190
when the foundation that you require

86
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,803
to reinvent the business using AI is late.

87
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,923
Number two is how much time
do we have to get there, okay?

88
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,010
So when we look at the way data
platforms are created today,

89
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,900
data platforms are modernized,

90
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,663
purchase, deployed,
whatever be the model, okay?

91
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,450
For a large company, a large enterprise,

92
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,893
it takes a minimum of 18
to 24 months to get there.

93
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,752
Now, until several years ago,

94
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:01,443
this approach was fine
because we all had time.

95
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,110
Now, what's happening around the world,

96
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,400
thanks to the innovators and
the leaders in any industry,

97
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,190
is that the change cycle,

98
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,630
the time in which

99
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,240
transformation of an entire
industry takes place,

100
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,820
or at least in the big spots, okay?

101
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,340
It's now less than 11 months.

102
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,830
No matter what industry you are in,

103
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,830
something big is changing
within 11, 12 months at most.

104
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,500
And so therefore, business in reality

105
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,883
is living on borrowed time.

106
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,920
So why take an approach that is expensive,

107
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,870
doesn't guarantee an outcome,

108
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,504
and is most likely going to be obsolete

109
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:44,493
by the time it is done, right?

110
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,660
The other thing that
we have to keep in mind

111
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,708
is fundamentally your data
is screaming and saying,

112
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,503
I don't want to move,

113
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,830
a large chunk of your data, okay?

114
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,943
And why is that?

115
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,480
Because there are compliance issues

116
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,760
due to which you have to
keep some data on prem,

117
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,590
you have stuff sitting on SaaS,

118
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,410
you make an acquisition,
you sell a business.

119
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,290
There are 15 different things above data,

120
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,030
technically speaking, that
are always changing, okay?

121
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,640
We may have a majority
of our data on one cloud,

122
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,410
which is fine, okay?

123
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,960
But the goal is not to
move the data itself,

124
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,053
the goal is to make use of
the data wherever it is.

125
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,850
And what is going to happen.

126
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,920
I'm sure we all read the same news.

127
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,910
Everybody is immersed these
days in understanding AI

128
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,160
and its effects and so on and so forth.

129
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,450
But what I'd like to suggest is

130
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,150
that ultimately the outcome
is going to be binary.

131
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,220
There are those that will succeed,

132
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,440
and there are those that will fail.

133
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,024
The old way of looking at
the middle of the ground,

134
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:51,090
the middle of the pack,

135
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,390
I don't think that that
middle of the pack paradigm

136
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,240
is gonna survive for a long time, okay?

137
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,830
Those who get it right,

138
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,950
obviously those who don't get it right

139
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,230
will see a very, very troublesome,

140
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,470
painful pattern in front of them, okay?

141
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,350
Slow obsolescence, customers walking away,

142
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,330
revenues going up and down, and so on.

143
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,040
And you'll come to a point where

144
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,603
you cannot reverse the trend.

145
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,290
We have seen enough examples in,

146
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,790
let's say the entertainment industry.

147
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,050
We have seen that in real estate,

148
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,050
we've seen that in retail,
we've seen that in fashion,

149
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,130
and it is going to happen

150
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,310
pretty much in every single
industry as we move forward.

151
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,430
But on the other hand,
those who get it right,

152
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,980
they're going to start
seeing revenue spiked.

153
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,970
Because there's customers

154
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,970
who are going to leave the
companies that are obsolete,

155
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,000
still need the services,
they still need the product.

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,550
So they're going to
move to those companies

157
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,780
that appeal to them and that
give them a better value

158
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,230
and what they're looking for.

159
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,390
So what we did specifically in this space

160
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,100
is we tore up our playbook

161
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,730
and we said we're gonna look at everything

162
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,290
from a clean sheet.

163
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,700
And what we set out to do is

164
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,650
to change the paradigm and build

165
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,600
a very, very different approach

166
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,990
to get from data to insights

167
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,900
as fast as possible, okay?

168
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,433
As quickly as possible.

169
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,888
Number two is make it
really, really simple

170
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:20,400
for the business to be able to use.

171
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,483
And number three is make it
scalable across the company.

172
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,670
In order for us to do this,

173
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,250
we examine six fundamental questions

174
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,513
that keep data leaders
awake all the time, okay?

175
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,110
How do we enable AI

176
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,483
on our existing assets
without moving them?

177
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,350
How do we productize data

178
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,840
and look at data in small pieces

179
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,790
as opposed to running expensive,

180
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,510
time consuming queries
and so on and so forth.

181
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,833
How do we break the
bottleneck of business to IT?

182
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,703
I need something today.

183
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,957
And the data guy says,

184
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:08,067
"I have a six weeks SLA
to deliver that, right?"

185
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,800
Business doesn't have time anymore.

186
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,750
How do we break that, okay?

187
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,690
How do we achieve governance
in large enterprises

188
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,060
without the bureaucracy
that goes along with it

189
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,070
and the time that we lose?

190
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,380
And number five is how do we get people

191
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,540
in the data universe,

192
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,750
your architects, your data scientists,

193
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,030
your governance folks,
your security folks,

194
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,460
they all need to be able to
look at the same picture.

195
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,760
And then finally, how can we
do this as fast as possible?

196
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,490
So we artificially put a
stake in the ground and said,

197
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,800
we should be able to do this in 90 days.

198
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,990
And here is how we solve problems.

199
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,270
Number one is we connected with data

200
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,840
structured and unstructured in real time

201
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,840
using a federated concept, okay?

202
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,690
We can connect with data pretty
much anywhere on the planet,

203
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,650
and if we can't,

204
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,000
we'll be able to build
it in four to six weeks.

205
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,620
Number two is we productize data

206
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,030
based on how it is used,

207
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,110
not based on how it is stored, okay?

208
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,970
Really, really fast using AI,

209
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,270
by your business domains,
by your data domains.

210
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,113
Number three, the entire
platform is built on zero code.

211
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,500
So nobody has to type any queries

212
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,560
and do a lot of technical stuff

213
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,660
in order to get to the results.

214
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,390
Number four is we use governance

215
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,230
that companies have built
over decades at source,

216
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,750
and we enhance those governance rules

217
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,480
as opposed to lifting and
shifting all of the data

218
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,153
and then rewriting and
rebuilding the stuff, okay?

219
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,550
Number five is that we assess
everything in one shot.

220
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,260
And about four to five weeks,

221
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,500
we are able to get
everybody from data teams,

222
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,580
including your business on the
same page as to where we are

223
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,450
and where we are going

224
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,370
and what does it really take for us

225
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,950
at the applications
level, at the data level

226
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,950
and infrastructure level to
be ready for agentic AI, okay?

227
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,670
And yes, we are being able
to break the 90 day barrier.

228
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,400
So I'll now leave you with
some concepts, some visuals,

229
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,540
so that you can understand

230
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,950
what this Concierto Insights

231
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,473
and agentic AI platform is about, okay?

232
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,220
Number one is federated data connectivity.

233
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,570
No matter where your data is,

234
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,210
on-prem, on cloud, on SaaS,

235
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,510
wherever it is, we are able
to connect to it instantly.

236
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,410
Number two is we are able to
productize data and catalog it.

237
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,370
Number three, we publish
the data in a marketplace

238
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,510
that is very similar to
Amazon Prime Video or Netflix.

239
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,220
Take your pick, okay?

240
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,068
So it's very intuitive for business users

241
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:45,150
to be able to see data,

242
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:49,440
just like you see movie
titles by genre, okay?

243
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,050
Sales, sales finance, sales compensation,

244
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,690
sales ops, and so on and so forth, okay?

245
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,690
So we organize data
very, very intuitively.

246
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,190
And number four is we have Native Gen BI,

247
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,950
native conversational AI,

248
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,450
but you can also integrate

249
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,663
with tools that you may have
invested in already, okay?

250
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,790
Conversational AI and then
ultimately agentic marketplaces.

251
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,153
Let's take a very quick
look at this, okay?

252
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,460
So Concierto brings universal
connectivity, as I said.

253
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,400
Number two is we use AI
to rapidly productize,

254
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,620
within hours and days.

255
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,780
Your entire data the
way you want to see it

256
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,480
and the way you're going
to consume it, okay?

257
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,853
Real time, zero copy.

258
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,873
Concierto doesn't store any of your data,

259
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:40,890
it sits at your source.

260
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,440
It only brings the results from queries

261
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,840
to generate the insights that you need.

262
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,230
On the other hand, if you
want to start migrating data

263
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,840
and do just the incremental stuff,

264
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,070
we can create a copy on
the cloud as well, okay?

265
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,560
Intelligent caching, that's
what we are talking about

266
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,100
and it accelerates future
queries and so on and so forth.

267
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,443
Governance, as I said, it's at source.

268
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,260
Number two, enterprise data marketplace.

269
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,430
Each of these cool tiles that
you see has a bunch of icons.

270
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,480
What those icons are showing
business and IT teams

271
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,660
just like a movie title user
ratings or a TV show rating

272
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,120
is discovery, lineage, okay?

273
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,040
You can join two data products

274
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,170
and create a super data product

275
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,960
and still see the entire lineage, okay?

276
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,540
Data quality, usage,

277
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,870
and how ready this particular data set is

278
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,930
for agentic tech stuff, okay?

279
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,930
Now, this exposes data to users
as they want to consume it,

280
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,640
but it also tells data teams

281
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,920
as to what their target should be.

282
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,920
For example, if I have
a data quality problem

283
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,240
across the enterprise,

284
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,550
I don't have to solve it across the board,

285
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,230
I can solve it for my
high priority data sets

286
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,980
to make sure that the results of those

287
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,783
are much more accurate, okay?

288
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,810
Those stuff like that.

289
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,760
Now, every company today has
invested large enterprises,

290
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,020
especially in some sort
of BI capabilities.

291
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,020
We're not here to ask
companies to replace those

292
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,300
and buy yet another tool.

293
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,220
Concierto is automatically connected

294
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,360
to Tableau and Power BI and
AWS QuickSight and so on.

295
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,760
But in order to truly help democratize,

296
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Concierto also has Native
Gen BI capabilities, okay?

297
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,660
It brings your cost down

298
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,010
and it helps everybody in
the company truly used data.

299
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:48,173
So this is data democratization
in real life, okay?

300
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,610
Concierto is built on the AWS stack, okay?

301
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:58,610
So Anthropic, Claude,
Bedrock, SageMaker, et cetera.

302
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,830
On top of that, we've
written thousands of rules,

303
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,110
which make your queries
much more intelligent,

304
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,990
much more precise, and very, very fast.

305
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,170
And so your business users
can essentially come in

306
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,570
and start having a
conversation with their data.

307
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,260
You don't need to create canned reports

308
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,560
and keep feeding them every
week, every three days,

309
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,950
whatever the periodicity is, okay?

310
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,700
So what the conversational AI
piece does for any data set

311
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,190
that a user has access to,

312
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,580
it automatically read through
what data needs to be read

313
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,530
to answer the query

314
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,040
and give you quantitative
insights, charts,

315
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,040
and even decisions that the
user needs to make, okay?

316
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,840
And then the last piece in this obviously

317
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,190
is enterprise agentic marketplaces, okay?

318
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,850
Now, when we've gotten our
applications and our data ready

319
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,880
after seeing the scores
and making improvements

320
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,320
and so on and so forth,

321
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,780
Concierto has a capability where

322
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,760
the data teams and the application teams

323
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,860
can start designing agents

324
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,590
and make those agents available to users

325
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,090
to embed in their processes

326
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,518
and automate decision making

327
00:16:10,518 --> 00:16:13,433
and execution and so
on and so forth, okay?

328
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,710
Now, this whole journey starts

329
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,710
with a very simple exercise
called DALAI, right?

330
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,530
Called name, as in Dalai Lama, right?

331
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,470
It's about wisdom, it's
about getting informed,

332
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,913
getting educated, right?

333
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,800
So when you deploy
Concierto in your landscape,

334
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,680
the platform will
generate a report for you,

335
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,500
covering your data, it's demographics,

336
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,140
where it is stored physically, virtually,

337
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,770
how is it growing, what is the
profile of your database is,

338
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,990
what exists out there, what goes out,

339
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,240
what is end of life
and so on and so forth?

340
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,230
What is your provisioning?

341
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,730
What is your storage?

342
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,830
Quality, security, all of this stuff

343
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,480
is laid out very neatly.

344
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,800
And on top of that,

345
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,760
you and our teams will work
together to create a scorecard

346
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,603
for agent AI readiness.

347
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,240
You give the rules, you add the rules

348
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,030
to the rules that are
already in the platform.

349
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,070
And for each of the data sets,

350
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,950
by business function, by data domain,

351
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,690
the platform is gonna tell you

352
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,960
whether or not that data
is ready for agentic AI,

353
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,083
if not, what needs to be done, okay?

354
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,570
Once all of this is done,

355
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,850
we lay neatly in the form of a report

356
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,850
that your business users and
your IT leaders can consume.

357
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,410
And then we are off and running.

358
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,240
But the beauty of this approach

359
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,253
is while we are doing the assessment,

360
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,560
teams can work together and configure

361
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,890
Concierto insights and
agentic AI for real world use.

362
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,250
So what we begin with is a 90 day exercise

363
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,790
in which we take one business
unit or one business function,

364
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,650
create a template for you

365
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,410
for using the platform
the way I described.

366
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,690
And in parallel, we train teams

367
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,890
so that this becomes a
self-service capability

368
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,720
inside the organization

369
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,810
as opposed to data teams needing an SI

370
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,950
or some consulting firm

371
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,800
to come and do all of
this work for you, okay?

372
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,800
So while the leaders are
consuming the feedback

373
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,590
from the agentic AI and the
data assessment that we do,

374
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,330
the platform gets ready

375
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,670
and in 90 days, you'll
be able to turn it on

376
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,433
and make it available to your users.

377
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,100
The good news in all of these assessments

378
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,883
is that they are funded by AWS, okay?

379
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,580
So you do not have to spend a lot of money

380
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,323
just to get an assessment done.

381
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,330
We and AWS are partnering
to fund this for customers

382
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,540
and deliver these reports for free, okay?

383
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,720
After that, you can choose
to continue if you like it.

384
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,620
There's no obligation.

385
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,600
You don't have to continue the platform

386
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,330
if for whatever reason, you don't, right?

387
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,740
So that's the offer

388
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,502
that we are bringing to the table

389
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:06,720
for every customer and even partners

390
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,354
who want to use this platform

391
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:12,093
for their end customers as well, right?

392
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,220
I was not supposed to say that,

393
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,810
but in the background,

394
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,080
if you are truly married to
moving your data to the cloud,

395
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,078
now that we have decoupled it,

396
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:25,950
Concierto can also migrate
your databases, modernize them,

397
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,460
and move the data itself
to the cloud, okay?

398
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,030
And it can create lake houses on the fly

399
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,490
on cloud native technology

400
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,373
as opposed to very, very
expensive third party tools.

401
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,486
So that really is the path

402
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:46,923
from getting from data
to agentic AI in 90 days.

403
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,223
Good?

404
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,113
Perfect.

405
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:51,946
(audience clapping)

406
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:52,779
Thank you.

407
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,500
Exactly 13 seconds.

408
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,020
So no time for questions, unfortunately.

409
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,890
But Trianz is at booth 1381.

410
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,230
There are a number of folks
here from Trianz as well.

411
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,870
Please stop by and let's
have a conversation.

412
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,870
Thank you very much.
