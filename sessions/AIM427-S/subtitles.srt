1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,334
- Good evening, everyone,

2
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:06,660
and welcome here for
this wonderful session

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,290
on how many of our esteemed clients here

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,864
are gonna be putting AI at
the core of transformation.

5
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:18,630
So we are very privileged
to have this opportunity

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,810
to be sharing a bunch
of our client stories

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,750
on how we worked together
with some of these clients

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,953
and they've transformed
their enterprises using AI.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,930
With me today, you're gonna
see a set of speakers.

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,603
We're gonna first invite Keisha Garcia.

11
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:39,780
Keisha Garcia is with BP.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,780
She's a VP for Digital
Enterprise Platforms and Systems.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,190
Following Keisha, you're
gonna hear Srini Upadhyaya.

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,820
Srini is with Transamerica,

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,190
and he's Head of Business Services.

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,190
Following Srini, you're
gonna see, we had Chaitanya,

17
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:02,190
but then Chaitanya had to leave

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,960
because of a personal emergency,

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,820
so we're gonna have Sada come over.

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,380
Sada is with Hertz,

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,320
and he's the SVP for Platform Engineering.

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,950
And last but not the least
is Krishna Srinivasan.

23
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,260
Krishna is with United Airlines.

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,950
He's the Director of
Architecture, Cloud, and DevOps.

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,790
So before we hand over to each
of these esteemed speakers

26
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,830
and have them share their stories

27
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,960
of how they've gone through
this transformation,

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,520
I want to take a minute

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,793
to talk about how Infosys sees this space.

30
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,730
So we're looking at three
stages of transformation.

31
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,110
We've seen a lot of our clients...

32
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,540
We've gone through this
transformation ourselves,

33
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,860
and we've seen a lot of our clients

34
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,600
go through this transformation.

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,100
Stage one is really making
their enterprises more digital,

36
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,924
how have they all embraced cloud.

37
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:54,930
So we are at AWS re:Invent,

38
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,870
and a lot of us are thankful for AWS

39
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,030
for all the capabilities
that they've delivered

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,103
that's enabled our clients to be,

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,900
that have made them more
resilient and more scalable.

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,250
The second stage of transformation

43
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,434
is really about how they've made,

44
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:12,720
created composable capabilities,

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,900
how have they got
enterprises ready for AI.

46
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,810
So how did they get
their data ready for AI,

47
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,550
how did they build capabilities,

48
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,040
how did they modernize
all of their platforms

49
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,160
that's enabled them to drive
a lot of business experiences.

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,080
Third stage is all about

51
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,850
all the experiences that you've seen.

52
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,560
You're gonna hear some
very interesting stories

53
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,730
from each one of them

54
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,980
on how all of these capabilities

55
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,910
have enabled some very
interesting experiences

56
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,490
for their customers,
within their enterprise,

57
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,737
and with their supply chain.

58
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:45,390
So without much ado,

59
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,930
what I wanna do is to invite
our first speaker, Keisha.

60
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,280
Keisha, why don't you
come on stage. Thank you.

61
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:55,622
(audience applauding)

62
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:02,490
- Thank you, and thank
you for having me here

63
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,460
to talk through our
journey with you, with us.

64
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,460
So BP is navigating one of our
most profound transformations

65
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,800
and transitions in the energy industry,

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,640
balancing both reliability
with sustainability,

67
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,390
as well as leveraging technology
and driving innovation

68
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,270
to deliver energy for today and tomorrow.

69
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,670
So BP is one of the world's

70
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,710
leading integrated energy companies,

71
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,520
and we operate in over
61 different countries,

72
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,540
with a workforce of over 100,000+ people,

73
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,430
and our heritage dates
back to as far as 1908.

74
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,240
And BP, where we are today,
we're focusing today,

75
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,960
is delivering our energy
safely, as well as reliably,

76
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,960
and increasingly lowering
our carbon intensity.

77
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,680
So our scale matters,

78
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,680
and 21,200 retail sites is
what we have with the scale,

79
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,880
as well as 39,000 EV charging points,

80
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,790
and 2.4 million barrels
of oil equivalent per day

81
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,213
in our upstream production.

82
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,350
So over a decade ago, BP
set out on a bold mission

83
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,130
that I had the privilege of
working with quite a few teams

84
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,630
to transform our digital
landscape with cloud,

85
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,900
and our cloud-first vision was back then

86
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,950
our footprint spanned over
eight mega data centers

87
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,040
hosting over 18,000 servers,

88
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,595
and today we've migrated
10,000+ applications,

89
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:49,595
and, I'm sorry, over 10,000+ applications,

90
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,650
and also we closed 27+ data
centers across the globe,

91
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,740
decommissioned over 15,000 servers,

92
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,690
as well as moved over one
petabyte of data to the cloud,

93
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,643
turning our vision into reality.

94
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:11,370
And now more than 93% of BP's
applications run in the cloud,

95
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,950
actually 95% as of today.

96
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,150
We've moved a few more.

97
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,460
So delivering speed, resilience,

98
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,593
as well as innovation at scale.

99
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:24,710
So this journey was never
just about technology.

100
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,610
Along the way, we embraced Agile, DevOps.

101
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,490
We modernized our platforms,

102
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,970
and we unlocked the power of data.

103
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,635
We reduced technical debt

104
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:40,713
by addressing our end of serviceable life.

105
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:42,840
We streamlined our processes,

106
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,630
we built the foundation
for what comes next

107
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,690
in our AI-first future,

108
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,580
and the cloud transformation program,

109
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,500
which is what it was called, CTP,

110
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,280
has not only modernized BP's IT estate,

111
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,920
but it ensured zero process safety,

112
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,780
or we also were able to get through that

113
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,240
with zero process safety events.

114
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,400
We strengthened our security,

115
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,213
and we created a resilient
digital core for the future.

116
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,770
So this achievement reflects
the collective effort

117
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,420
of BP's digital teams, our
businesses, our integrators,

118
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,773
and our enablers.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,430
Our cloud journey is
proof of what's possible

120
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,430
when vision, as well as
action, comes together.

121
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,430
And now, as we step into the era of AI,

122
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,690
we are ready to unlock
even more potential,

123
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,880
driving innovation, sustainability,

124
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,840
as well as transformation
for BP and beyond.

125
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,550
So by moving to the cloud,

126
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,740
it's unlocked all of these capabilities,

127
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,670
and it's made what we thought
was impossible possible.

128
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,470
So the scale of our compute power

129
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,470
is to train and deploy
advanced AI models at speed,

130
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,450
centralize and secure data platforms

131
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,860
that enable real-time analytics
and predictive insights,

132
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,340
and modernize and develop
our development environments

133
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,143
that's faster, agile, DevOps,
and continuous innovation.

134
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,280
So our global collaboration tools

135
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,090
that empower talent to experiment, learn,

136
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,700
and innovate without boundaries,

137
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,520
as well as cloud has created a culture

138
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,510
where ideas can also take
shape and move faster,

139
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,860
teams work smarter, and the
data drives every decision.

140
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,230
It also enables our BP people

141
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:42,230
to harness all of our AI
capability for smarter operations,

142
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,983
optimize our energy systems,
and breakthrough solutions,

143
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,850
so accelerating our journey
towards our digital-first

144
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,353
and our sustainable future.

145
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,820
So when I think about how we're
driving innovation with AI,

146
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,090
so with our customers and products,

147
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,990
if I think about some of the examples,

148
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:10,650
for our customers, AI is
redefining what energy means.

149
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,160
It's personal, predictive, sustainable.

150
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,290
AI helps us forecast demand

151
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,520
so we can deliver the right
products at the right time.

152
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,260
It also powers our smart
mobility solutions,

153
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,260
ensuring EV drivers find charging stations

154
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,515
when they need them,

155
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:37,230
and it also gives our customers
the needs or the tools

156
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,960
that track and reduce
our carbon footprint.

157
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,370
So because innovation isn't
just about technology,

158
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,443
it's about trust as well,

159
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,090
and it's about trust with our customers.

160
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,390
So in our P and O, our
production and operations area,

161
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,390
on the front lines of production,
AI is our silent partner.

162
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,910
It predicts equipment failures
before they even happen.

163
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,400
It's saving millions, and
keeping our people safe.

164
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,400
It's optimizing drilling
and refining processes.

165
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,900
It's also squeezing the inefficiencies

166
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,210
and reducing our emissions.

167
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,673
Every sensor and every
data point becomes a voice,

168
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,480
and AI listens and learns,

169
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,290
and acts to make operations
smarter and safer.

170
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,460
So digital transformation
is a big part of our story,

171
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,990
and we are working with partners
like Microsoft and Palantir

172
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,990
to use AI to optimize and
to build digital twins,

173
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,760
as well as for predictive maintenance

174
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,760
and developing tech stacks
for sustainable aviation fuel,

175
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,350
as well as on the engineering side,

176
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,640
we're developing
remotely-operated platforms

177
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,650
and advanced seismic imaging

178
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,370
to also improve our efficiency and safety.

179
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,023
In our people and culture area,

180
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,520
our most powerful transformation
isn't in the machines,

181
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,990
it's in our people,

182
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,300
and AI is helping us upscale,

183
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,100
as well as upscale our workforce

184
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,000
and turning curiosity into capability.

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,470
It's also breaking down
barriers, fostering diversity,

186
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,370
as well as creating a culture
where innovation thrives.

187
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,880
So with AI, our teams collaborate faster,

188
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,960
we share knowledge,

189
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,173
we seamlessly make
decisions with confidence,

190
00:10:41,714 --> 00:10:46,714
because technology without
people is just code, right?

191
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,383
So, but with people, it's revolution.

192
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,190
At BP, we're not just adapting AI,

193
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,590
we're shaping the future in energy,

194
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,200
as well as together we're building a world

195
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,130
that's safer, cleaner,
and we're more connected.

196
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,923
And this is more than
innovation; it's transformation.

197
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,050
So our vision for our drivers,

198
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,060
we accelerated our business transformation

199
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,060
through intelligent experimentation,
architectural leverage,

200
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,230
and our close partnerships
with our digital teams,

201
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,260
and our goal is to move beyond pilots,

202
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,770
improve measurable value first and fast,

203
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,120
and delivering capability
that's owned and scalable

204
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,563
and production-ready.

205
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,170
The journey ahead is really our strategy

206
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,320
is prioritizing immediate cost reduction

207
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,200
over the next 18 to 24 months,

208
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,840
which we've started well on that journey,

209
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,020
while building foundational
AI capabilities,

210
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,780
as well as building those capabilities

211
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,980
that are sustainable

212
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,950
and that gives us a competitive advantage.

213
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,463
So by adopting and giving a
surround and conquer approach,

214
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,020
we will first transform
our cost functions,

215
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,810
demonstrating clear and measurable ROI,

216
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,630
as well as drive broader
solutions and adoption

217
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,880
across our business units.

218
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Success requires building
AI-savvy leadership,

219
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,940
as well as cost-focused talent,

220
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,450
and then also pragmatic
buy/build decisions.

221
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,180
We'll operate within the data and talent,

222
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,930
and we'll prioritize rapid savings

223
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,010
over slow, lengthy ROI processes,

224
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:46,010
but focusing on initiatives at
the 18-month payback or less.

225
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,850
We'll continuously evaluate
emerging technologies

226
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,723
through lean experiments
before significant investments,

227
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,432
and then those guiding principles

228
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:00,300
that's kind of like our North Star

229
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,420
is our business-driven attitude

230
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,270
with technology doesn't lead the way.

231
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,300
It's our people, it's
vision, and vision does.

232
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,800
Every AI initiative begins
with a clear business purpose,

233
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,030
and we're not just doing things

234
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,890
just for the sake of doing it.

235
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,870
We're looking at the value focus things.

236
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,630
We don't just chase the shiny objects,

237
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,390
although there are times where
we have to remind ourselves

238
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,880
that, again, getting ahead
of the curve is great,

239
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,310
but again, not chasing the shiny objects,

240
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,120
but starting with real
challenges, real pain points

241
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,393
that will solve what matters most for us.

242
00:13:37,898 --> 00:13:39,690
So sometimes you have to look at it

243
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,750
with the "build it, and
they will come" mindset,

244
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,300
but only doing that, using that mindset

245
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,140
only for bold, high-potential bets.

246
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,015
That means when you're
dealing with AI ideas

247
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:58,015
that could fundamentally
reshape a workflow,

248
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,180
or create a new revenue stream,

249
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,840
or unlock a step change, efficiency,

250
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,236
something with genuine
transformational upside,

251
00:14:08,236 --> 00:14:13,236
you sometimes do build
ahead of the proven demand,

252
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,470
but you take calculated leaps,

253
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,500
because the payoff is
worth the uncertainty,

254
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,040
and you look at it from a
risk-based approach as well.

255
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,040
So for everything else, you
earn adoption the hard way.

256
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,100
You validate the problem,
you test the demand,

257
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,417
and you prove ROI
pressure test feasibility.

258
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:40,023
So with that being said, and
I'm sorry I went on too fast,

259
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:45,360
those are the things
that we are doing at BP

260
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,360
to help prove out all of the
things that we need to do.

261
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:53,760
We're looking at the
routine automation ideas

262
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,760
that must earn its business
case before you build it.

263
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,820
As I said, even though you
do the build versus buy,

264
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,820
but also on the fact of those
moonshot predictive systems

265
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,750
that could change how the
entire asset class is run,

266
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,880
we must justify building early

267
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,360
and iterating into the demand.

268
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,720
So as I said, the discipline around ROI

269
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,070
has to be there, though,

270
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,330
so the ambition matters,
but outcomes matter more,

271
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,870
and every initiative must
drive measurable impact.

272
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,800
And we commit to tracking performance.

273
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,539
We are committing to
learning from those results,

274
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:36,480
improving value.

275
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,300
But also, because transformation
without accountability

276
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,250
isn't transformation at all,

277
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,480
you have to be able to operate
it and also track those ROIs.

278
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,960
So our cost function, first,
is our target finance,

279
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,960
our HRIT, for immediate
improvements in bottom line.

280
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,740
And then from a build
shared infrastructure

281
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,740
to avoid vendor lock-in
and build muscle for later,

282
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,973
and strategic bets.

283
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:08,880
And then also from an automation
and offshoring perspective,

284
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,130
accelerate our AI automation

285
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,720
instead of solely relying
on labor arbitrage,

286
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,940
as well as data AI synopsis,

287
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,900
using AI to solve our data
quality as well as issues,

288
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,973
and not waiting for perfect data.

289
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,530
So again, our teams
are working really hard

290
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,390
to ensure that we're working together

291
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,200
with all of our partners to
do what we can to transform,

292
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,580
and driving and allowing our people

293
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,740
and our business goals and
our business aspirations

294
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,000
to get us there.

295
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,710
So that is what we're doing at BP,

296
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,650
and that is how AI is
really taking the forefront,

297
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,260
and the cloud transformation
helped to get us there

298
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,380
and set us up quite well
for what we're doing.

299
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,792
Thank you.

300
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:56,959
(audience applauding)

301
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:01,067
- Thank you.

302
00:17:19,176 --> 00:17:21,780
Okay, good afternoon, everyone. Sorry.

303
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,783
Good afternoon, everyone. My
name is Srinivas Upadhyaya.

304
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,930
I'm the Head of Business Services

305
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,720
and Digital Technologies for Transamerica,

306
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,643
been there for like about six years.

307
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,387
For the first five years

308
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:38,454
I ran all of architecture engineering,

309
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:40,890
basically cloud as well
as cloud migration.

310
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,030
So again, super excited to be here

311
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,360
to talk about like, you know,

312
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,270
how we are accelerating our business value

313
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,443
using cloud and AI.

314
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,953
Where's the clicker?

315
00:17:57,935 --> 00:18:01,200
So little bit of an intro on
like in Transamerica, right?

316
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,033
What do we do?

317
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:06,000
We offer a broad range of,
you know, kind of products,

318
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,720
life insurance, annuities,
and also retirement plans,

319
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,670
and also some other investment products.

320
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,470
Like, you know, again,
most of you are familiar

321
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,079
with our 401(k), 403(b),

322
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,713
like, you know, kind of IRA solutions.

323
00:18:19,872 --> 00:18:22,860
We have about close to
10.7 million customers

324
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,763
all within U.S., and
about 7,000 employees.

325
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,150
So when we think about like
in our business applications,

326
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,400
as we went through this
modernization, right,

327
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,990
like, you know, there
were two main factors,

328
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,460
like, you know, agility,

329
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,550
and like, you know, kind
of delivering products

330
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,960
at a faster pace.

331
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,353
And now we are onto our AI
adoption journey, right?

332
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,410
So three main things

333
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,900
I want to like, you
know, kind of emphasize.

334
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,310
All of our retirement,

335
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,770
like, you know, kind of
record-keeping ecosystem,

336
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,950
that's like about 60% of our workloads.

337
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,470
You know, they're working in AWS Cloud.

338
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,410
We went through a major
transformation journey.

339
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,630
We also, like, you know, as
part of the modernization,

340
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,050
like, you know, built
two major data lakes,

341
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,510
again, one for retirement datasets,

342
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,120
and the other one for like,
you know, life and annuities.

343
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,450
And that actually is helping,
you know, kind of advance,

344
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,940
like, you know, whether it's BI-based,

345
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,230
like, you know, reporting insights,

346
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,654
or, you know, using AI, right?

347
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:23,093
And we are making strides there.

348
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,006
So this is an interesting slide, right?

349
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:33,333
Like, and again, like why?

350
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:35,910
You know, why this
transformation journey, right?

351
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,540
So there were four main
strategic priorities, right,

352
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,850
again, our global CIO laid out:

353
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,150
monetization, customer
centricity, simplification,

354
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,810
and like, you know, scalability
and like security, right?

355
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,330
So when we think about
like in a modernization,

356
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,620
this is all about like, you know,

357
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,105
we migrated all of our
retirement workloads,

358
00:19:56,105 --> 00:19:59,553
we retired like in our
complete mainframe footprint,

359
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,300
you know, we converted to
like in a modern tech stack.

360
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,680
I'll talk about it a little bit.

361
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,470
And also with all of these
applications in the cloud,

362
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,720
as well as the data lake in the cloud,

363
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,620
we are able to like, you know,

364
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,483
kind of build products faster.

365
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,920
The other thing also, it's
a great benefit, right?

366
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,630
Like, you know, tech debt,

367
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,319
I know every company deals with it.

368
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,960
We were able to reduce,

369
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,097
like, you know, quite a bit of tech debt.

370
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,562
So the second is like, you know,

371
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:28,830
when it comes to customer centricity,

372
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,750
it's all about, like in
our digital journeys,

373
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,390
we want to really wow our customers

374
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,830
with better, like in our UI experiences.

375
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,644
And, you know, again, with
the data in the lakes,

376
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:44,034
we are able to, like, you know,

377
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,295
kind of take advantage of that,

378
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:48,303
and like, you know, build more
advanced insights using AI.

379
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,840
Then the third is simplification.

380
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,604
This is all about like, you know,

381
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:55,254
straight through processing,

382
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,730
as well as like, you
know, automation, right?

383
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,664
So we have about close to 300+

384
00:21:00,664 --> 00:21:02,464
like, you know, kind of business services,

385
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:04,290
and another like, you know,
500+ business services

386
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,460
in the life and annuity
space total, right?

387
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,500
So again, you're constantly figuring out

388
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,920
how to like, you know,
kind of leverage those

389
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,240
to do straight through processing.

390
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,500
And we have also automated
all of our CI/CD DevOps,

391
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,940
like, you know, basically
pipelines, right?

392
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,070
So both from an infra and a code,

393
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,980
so we are able to like, you
know, do the deployments faster,

394
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,380
at least for the critical applications.

395
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,543
We also, like, you know, invested
in blue-green deployments,

396
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,024
right, so that way we are trying

397
00:21:34,024 --> 00:21:37,623
to keep our, you know,
application downtime to minimal.

398
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:42,420
Then again, the last
strategic priority, right,

399
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,330
again, stability, scalability,

400
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,624
and like, you know, security, right?

401
00:21:47,624 --> 00:21:49,770
So we are seeing like, you
know, improved performance.

402
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,375
Like actually,

403
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,510
when we went through the
whole batch migration, right?

404
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,730
Like, you know, a lot of
it is mainframe batch.

405
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,890
It's actually running
in like half the time,

406
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,133
like in as to what it used to be before.

407
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:05,640
Again, from a scaling, we take advantage

408
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,339
of like, you know, again,
auto-scaling capabilities,

409
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:10,890
of course, like, you
know, variable pricing.

410
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,660
That's always, like, you know, great.

411
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,000
And then in terms of security, again,

412
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,550
a lot of the security features,

413
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,820
you know, kind of network segmentation,

414
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,387
you know, again, advanced
access management features,

415
00:22:24,387 --> 00:22:28,530
and also being able to like,
you know, kind of be stable,

416
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,110
like in, again, multi-AZ,
multi-region support,

417
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,443
we are able to like, you
know, take advantage of it.

418
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:37,230
Just the retirement ecosystem,
you can see the scope.

419
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,477
It's like about 100, 120 applications,

420
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:44,107
about 400, you know, kind of services,

421
00:22:44,107 --> 00:22:47,460
and we have about, like, you
know, 4,000 batch workloads,

422
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,490
out of which at least 1,000 of them

423
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,327
are like in our kind of
COBOL mainframe base,

424
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:56,827
and 400+ terabytes of data.

425
00:22:56,827 --> 00:23:01,080
And in terms of the mainframe,
the code that was converted,

426
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,920
it was almost close to 2.3
to 2.5 million lines of code.

427
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,503
We transformed all of
the COBOL code to Java,

428
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,550
and, you know, again, the whole migration,

429
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,140
end to end, start to finish,

430
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,043
like, you know, we did
it in 2.5 years, right,

431
00:23:16,043 --> 00:23:17,085
two and a half years.

432
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:18,600
Again, Infosys was our
implementation partner.

433
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,300
Great, great, like, you know,
I would say partnership.

434
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,937
So next slide. So this is
an interesting slide, right?

435
00:23:27,937 --> 00:23:29,580
Like, you know, it's like you can see

436
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,660
this is nothing but like technology stack,

437
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,970
like, you know, before and after.

438
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,500
As you can see, you know,

439
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,140
before, you know, pretty
much like older versions

440
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,180
of Java, .NET,

441
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,480
this is a tech debt stuff
I was talking about,

442
00:23:42,497 --> 00:23:47,250
you know, C, C++, Python,
.NET, older versions,

443
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,860
or compute was, like, you
know, VMs or physicals,

444
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,313
but older versions of like,
you know, kind of VMware tech,

445
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,162
all of the runtime technologies,
like, you know, WebLogic,

446
00:23:58,162 --> 00:24:00,518
JBoss, TOMCAT, you name it, right,

447
00:24:00,518 --> 00:24:01,818
like in very old versions.

448
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:06,000
And, you know, we had like,
you know, whole flavors

449
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,050
of like, you know, database technologies,

450
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:13,200
you know, Oracle, SQL Server, DB2,

451
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,770
and, you know, once the migration,

452
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,300
we kind of like, you know,
went through it, right,

453
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,980
like, you know, again, we
were able to take advantage

454
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,980
of Amazon Corretto Java,
you know, upgraded versions

455
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,410
of like, you know, all
of the .NET, Angular,

456
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:33,410
compute, again, ECS, EKS,
Fargate, you know, Lambda.

457
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,000
And also we upgraded

458
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,943
a lot of our runtime
platforms versions too.

459
00:24:40,308 --> 00:24:43,170
And from a databases, again,
we are heavily leveraging,

460
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,580
like in RDS.

461
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,032
I'll talk a little bit
about the mainframe stuff.

462
00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:48,510
On the mainframe, again,

463
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,100
on the left side, you can see, right?

464
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,053
COBOL, CICS, JCL, DB2, like,
you know, again, on z/OS.

465
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,192
So a lot of the CICS screens,

466
00:24:57,192 --> 00:24:58,200
like, you know, your batch workloads,

467
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,020
everything was sitting
on a huge mainframe box.

468
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,593
It's like almost consuming
14,000 MIPS at any point of time,

469
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,090
to, we actually used AWS Blu Age.

470
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,530
I think there's a name change.

471
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:14,730
It's called AWS, like,
you know, Transform now,

472
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,210
but, you know, it's like, you
know, it's an amazing tool.

473
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,070
So we went through that,

474
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,750
the entire conversion to the mainframe

475
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,510
in less than, like, you
know, 12 months, right?

476
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,380
So the final cutover was
on June 9th last year.

477
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,209
We went from 14,000 MIPS

478
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:34,796
to like, you know, like six
or seven MIPS just right away,

479
00:25:34,796 --> 00:25:35,933
right, after that conversion.

480
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,950
Again, just from a technology stack,

481
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,019
you know, after the conversion, right,

482
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:46,920
we are leveraging, again,
Amazon Corretto Java,

483
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,870
all of the CICS screens that
were, you know, previously run

484
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,770
on, like, you know, kind of mainframe,

485
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:57,055
like, you know, we, you
know, kind of replaced them

486
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:02,055
with Angular, Spring Boot, and
also DB2 z/OS to DB2 Linux.

487
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:05,998
That's like, you know,
was our conversion path.

488
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,400
And we are leveraging quite a bit

489
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,950
of like, you know, RDS
technologies as well, right?

490
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,770
And as I mentioned, about close
to 2.5 million lines of code

491
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,700
with the AWS Blu Age,
we kind of converted it.

492
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,100
And also in the process, right,

493
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,528
we developed about close
to 7,000+ functional

494
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:28,858
and regression test feed, right?

495
00:26:28,858 --> 00:26:30,660
So it's automated, now
it's part of our arsenal,

496
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,220
so anytime there's a major release,

497
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,428
we can actually quickly run that,

498
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:35,663
like, you know, make
sure nothing's broken,

499
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,820
especially for the batch, right?

500
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,810
Because the nightly batch,

501
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,815
that's when like, you know,

502
00:26:41,815 --> 00:26:43,693
you're basically selling and buying,

503
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:46,805
you know, mutual funds,
ETFs, so ETFs and all,

504
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:47,700
it's actually pretty intense

505
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,440
in terms of how many billions of dollars,

506
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,630
like, you know, more every night.

507
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,680
So we did about close to
100+ parallel test runs,

508
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,923
especially for our batch workloads

509
00:26:57,923 --> 00:27:00,270
with different datasets, right?

510
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,740
Like, you know, we use datasets,

511
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,520
like, you know, whether
it's daily, weekly,

512
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,050
you know, tax day datasets,

513
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:10,440
your monthly, quarterly,
yearly, your peak volumes,

514
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,673
you name it, right?

515
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,990
So this is, again, we do a lot
of customer reference calls,

516
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,865
and all of this stuff, references.

517
00:27:21,865 --> 00:27:24,185
This is like, you know, a little bit

518
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:25,907
of like, you know, lessons learned, right?

519
00:27:25,907 --> 00:27:28,440
Like, you know, if you are
going through this journey,

520
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,600
you'll find this really useful, right?

521
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,240
The first one is data gravity,
right? Think about it.

522
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,220
Like in a lot of these
application services,

523
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,620
they're so intertwined, right?

524
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,720
So, and of course you're not gonna be able

525
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,720
to do the whole thing
big bang, just by itself,

526
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,833
so we did about 800 releases
in like two and a half years.

527
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,410
So pay attention to data gravity.

528
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,835
What it means is like, you
know, you need to understand

529
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:53,610
what are the interdependencies

530
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:57,210
so that you can bundle the
applications logically,

531
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,799
so that way, you know what,

532
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,660
you don't have, like, you
know, your database on-prem

533
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,114
and the rest of the services in cloud.

534
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,470
So now with the latency,
you have performance issues

535
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,148
and all this stuff, right?

536
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:07,373
You need to really pay attention to it.

537
00:28:08,468 --> 00:28:10,590
With the Blu Age thing,

538
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,230
when we went through this
whole mass migration,

539
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,850
they actually do something pretty cool

540
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,260
called calibration phase, right?

541
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,860
So what the calibration phase
really is, you take a sample,

542
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,450
you can take probably like,
you know, 100 batch jobs,

543
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,613
like, you know, 30, 40 CICS screens,

544
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:29,040
they'll run it through the calibration,

545
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,607
and they'll tell you,

546
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:32,880
like, you know, how easy or hard it is,

547
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,160
like, you know, for the conversion, right?

548
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,850
So that way you can know
for your entire scale,

549
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,290
what is it that you're
getting into, right?

550
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,523
That was really helpful.

551
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:45,930
Like I said, testing, testing,
testing, parallel testing,

552
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,700
we invested quite a bit.

553
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,450
So actually one of the things is

554
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,593
we did like for the
last mainframe migration

555
00:28:54,593 --> 00:28:56,283
cutover on June 9th.

556
00:28:57,425 --> 00:28:59,250
Prior to that we did three,

557
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,960
what we called as mock runs, right?

558
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,680
So think about it like
the entire mainframe

559
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,720
and the rest of the application services,

560
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,830
the whole ecosystems,

561
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,610
including the satellite databases
and everything like that,

562
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:14,700
we flipped in production,
you know, over a weekend,

563
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,410
and then we used to flip back, right?

564
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,810
So, and again, there's a lot
of testing that happened.

565
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,970
So that way for the first mock run,

566
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,950
when we ran it, we had
about 100 bugs, right?

567
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:26,190
This is after all the other
crazy testing we went through.

568
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,075
And then after the second one,

569
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:32,820
we kind of like, you know, ended
up with like maybe 60 bugs.

570
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,830
The third one, we brought it down

571
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,080
to like, you know, almost nil,

572
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,472
and then the final one,

573
00:29:38,472 --> 00:29:40,260
like, you know, was the
real cutover, right?

574
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,063
So we invested quite a bit on that.

575
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,610
The other thing, so,
like, you know, again,

576
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,588
talent upskilling, think about it, right?

577
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:49,770
Like, you know, insurance industry,

578
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,920
a lot of times there's a
lot of legacy tech folks

579
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,899
invest in like, you know,
kind of training them up,

580
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:56,902
but also at the same time,

581
00:29:56,902 --> 00:29:59,276
we had Infosys as our
implementation partner.

582
00:29:59,276 --> 00:30:02,489
It was awesome partnership, as I said.

583
00:30:02,489 --> 00:30:05,010
Software rationalization.
Think about it this way, right?

584
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,630
A lot of your on-prem contracts,
software contracts, right,

585
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,160
you gotta really see, like, you know,

586
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,340
how they can be translated to AWS, right?

587
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,310
Like, so we invested, it was
like almost like six months

588
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,500
with working with
procurement on all of that

589
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,915
so that we know,

590
00:30:20,915 --> 00:30:23,107
especially for the
budgeting purposes, right,

591
00:30:23,107 --> 00:30:24,813
you know, what that means.

592
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,950
Communication, this is
extremely important.

593
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,900
You need to like, you know, make sure

594
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,940
you have alignment with
your business partners,

595
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,290
because think about it, right?

596
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,200
It's a long journey,
and along this journey,

597
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,430
of course they're gonna continue

598
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,970
to like, build, you know, new products

599
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,930
and all of this stuff, right,

600
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,210
and a lot of times there's coalitions,

601
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,150
you need your own blackout
periods, and all of this stuff.

602
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,820
They'll say that, "Hey, the
products are more important.

603
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,800
We gotta like, you know,
keep our revenues going,"

604
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,507
and all this stuff.

605
00:30:54,507 --> 00:30:55,555
So having that alignment,

606
00:30:55,555 --> 00:30:58,350
and continuing to like, you
know, explain the benefits

607
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,440
of like, you know, this
migration, that goes a long way,

608
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,850
especially like, you
know, they're the ones

609
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,370
who are really gonna help
you with the UAT testing

610
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,860
and whatnot, right?

611
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,583
So that really helped out.

612
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,489
Actually, one other thing I
wanna say is like, you know,

613
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:16,290
just in terms of how this
is getting translated

614
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,340
to like, you know, AI, right?

615
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,010
Again, we are, you know, we use Copilot

616
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,306
like all of our employees,

617
00:31:22,306 --> 00:31:24,977
like, you know, they have
Copilot for their tasks.

618
00:31:24,977 --> 00:31:27,060
You know, we are heavily invested

619
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,800
in like, you know, kind of Amazon Q

620
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,720
for our software developers,

621
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,040
and we are using other techniques

622
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,710
to like, you know, for building
the regression test cases

623
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,210
and all of that stuff,

624
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,610
and the best part is like, you know, now

625
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,430
with the data lakes in cloud,

626
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,737
we are continuously,
like, you know, trying

627
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,540
to like, you know, kind of hydrate those

628
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,030
with the newer datasets
and all of this stuff,

629
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,513
it's becoming so much better for us

630
00:31:50,513 --> 00:31:52,320
to like, you know, kind of
be on the AI journey, right?

631
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,970
Again, it's still a journey.

632
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,250
We have about 10 or 15 use cases

633
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,980
that we are, you know,
taking advantage of,

634
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,270
but most importantly, like, you know,

635
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,034
it's an awesome journey.

636
00:32:02,034 --> 00:32:03,448
We don't have to worry
about the foundation,

637
00:32:03,448 --> 00:32:04,281
because the cloud and the data,

638
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:06,330
that foundation has been
established already.

639
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,770
So again, thank you, Infosys.

640
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,257
I know IBM, like, you
know, they helped us,

641
00:32:13,257 --> 00:32:16,282
like, you know, with the z/OS DB2

642
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:18,180
to like, you know, DB2
Linux conversion as well,

643
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,418
and incredible like, you know,
Transamerica team, right?

644
00:32:21,418 --> 00:32:23,902
And thank you for listening
to our story. I appreciate it.

645
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:27,069
(audience applauding)

646
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:35,493
- A big hand to Srinivas and
Keisha for a job well done.

647
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:38,077
(audience applauding)

648
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:39,933
Let me walk you through our journey.

649
00:32:40,837 --> 00:32:43,710
I'll go what happened four years back.

650
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,730
I'll talk about the present,

651
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,851
and I'll talk about the next two years.

652
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:47,760
I don't think I can
read the next two years,

653
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,093
but I'll certainly try to
read the next two years.

654
00:32:51,812 --> 00:32:52,837
My name is Sada Iyer.

655
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:56,216
As it says, I'm the SVP
of Technology at Hertz.

656
00:32:56,216 --> 00:32:58,980
When I joined four years ago,

657
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,983
I was literally given a playbook,

658
00:33:00,983 --> 00:33:05,983
a playbook with end of
life, end of support,

659
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,970
incidents happening on a daily basis.

660
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,870
And guess what? I'll use a car analogy.

661
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,760
My job was how do I change the tires

662
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,923
of a running car, right?

663
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,930
So that was the challenge
that was given to me.

664
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,703
Before I continue too much
further, I work for Hertz,

665
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,023
so I'm gonna ask a quiz, right?

666
00:33:28,888 --> 00:33:29,753
I'll give you four options.

667
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:35,990
Hertz is in the car rental
business, Hertz sells cars,

668
00:33:38,508 --> 00:33:41,853
Hertz partners with Uber and Lyft,

669
00:33:43,093 --> 00:33:45,453
and number four, Hertz
sells cars on Amazon.

670
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,262
If I give you an option,

671
00:33:48,262 --> 00:33:51,900
option A, which is Hertz,
the car rental company,

672
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,550
by show of hands, how many
want to raise their hands?

673
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:01,310
If I tell you that Hertz does
all the four, show of hands.

674
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,240
So did you know that Hertz
actually sells cars on Amazon?

675
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,720
So tomorrow when you go home

676
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,790
and you're shopping for
your milk and your bread

677
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:15,033
and your supplies, go and
shop for a car on Amazon.

678
00:34:15,994 --> 00:34:20,463
(chuckling) Again, before
I fo go too much into it,

679
00:34:20,463 --> 00:34:21,296
I need to thank my team.

680
00:34:21,296 --> 00:34:23,250
Without my team that have stood besides me

681
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,540
for the last four years,

682
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,340
I would've not been where I'm today.

683
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:34,654
That's not me.

684
00:34:36,902 --> 00:34:37,735
Yeah.

685
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,782
So if you look at the references
that I've got on the slide,

686
00:34:42,782 --> 00:34:46,848
it's all about voyage,
tune-up, the wrenching, right,

687
00:34:46,848 --> 00:34:48,156
the journey.

688
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:51,630
But like I said, four
years ago where I started,

689
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,480
we had a high cost of standing still.

690
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:57,990
End of life services, end
of life hardware, software,

691
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:02,156
like I said, incidents happening,
and we had two choices.

692
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:04,095
Either we invest in the data center,

693
00:35:04,095 --> 00:35:06,094
or we do it all-in migration to the cloud.

694
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:07,758
And guess what did we choose?

695
00:35:07,758 --> 00:35:09,450
We chose an all-in migration
to the cloud, right?

696
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,163
It was not an easy feat.

697
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:17,213
We had HP-UX, critical
applications running on HP-UX.

698
00:35:17,213 --> 00:35:18,046
What did we do?

699
00:35:18,046 --> 00:35:18,879
Working with Amazon,

700
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:21,337
we actually ran it on
emulation software in AWS,

701
00:35:22,173 --> 00:35:23,006
so that's working fine.

702
00:35:23,006 --> 00:35:24,300
Our second challenge was

703
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,000
how do you scale our applications, right?

704
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,930
I'm gonna throw a number,
3,000 TPS on the front end.

705
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,790
When you think about 3,000
TPS on the front end,

706
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,770
it's not a big number, right?

707
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,500
But the backend was not able

708
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,402
to go more than 5,000
transactions per second.

709
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:43,440
So our first order of magnitude was

710
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,200
how do we scale the backend,
and that's what we did, right?

711
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,570
That backend was extremely critical.

712
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,570
It's running COBOL on Micro Focus Linux.

713
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,270
Micro Focus COBOL on Linux, right,

714
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:55,530
and therefore we were
able to migrate to AWS.

715
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:59,700
Not only did we scale the
application horizontally,

716
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,380
but we also scaled the application

717
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,870
from an application sharding perspective.

718
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,120
So I'm giving you pointers
in terms of what we did

719
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,950
so you can decide on whether
it's gonna be helpful for you

720
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,783
in the future.

721
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,640
As we were doing that migration,

722
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,470
the third one was what we
call our rates ecosystem.

723
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:19,530
We have one master, and on a daily basis

724
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,533
it's about 1.6 billion
rates requests per day.

725
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,430
So as you can imagine, we had
to scale our rates ecosystem.

726
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,300
And what's a rate?

727
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,520
If you go to shop on hertz.com,

728
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,650
and you go and look for a shop,

729
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,890
and it pulls up a given,
let's say, Nissan or a Toyota,

730
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,720
there's a rate along with it, right?

731
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,393
That's the rate request
that I'm talking about,

732
00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:40,800
about 1.6 billion rate request per day.

733
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,550
Yes, we were using Oracle,
yes, we are still using Oracle,

734
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,235
and we had to figure out
a way to scale, right?

735
00:36:47,235 --> 00:36:48,068
And we had to scale with low latency.

736
00:36:48,068 --> 00:36:49,620
So at any given point in time

737
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,872
we have about 16 to 20
replicas running in AWS.

738
00:36:53,872 --> 00:36:55,470
So again, that was a migration
that we had to take care of.

739
00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:00,300
So if you look, if you think
about the journey that we did,

740
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,375
it about took about two and a half years

741
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,193
of all-in migration to AWS.

742
00:37:07,295 --> 00:37:09,345
Fast forward to today, earlier this year,

743
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:12,720
you know, you learn from your failures,

744
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,700
you learn from your mistakes.

745
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,730
A developer, unfortunately
he did something wrong

746
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,290
in production environment.

747
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,678
And guess what? It brought our
production environment down.

748
00:37:22,678 --> 00:37:23,760
And that's the reason we built

749
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,100
what we call blue-green stacks

750
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,551
or active-passive environment, right?

751
00:37:28,551 --> 00:37:31,770
Now we have, in a single region,
active-passive environment.

752
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,180
With few incidents that have happened

753
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,170
over the last few weeks,

754
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,970
we are also planning to
have multi-region stack

755
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,503
running in AWS, right?

756
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,140
So that's our journey.

757
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,710
If you think about from an AI perspective,

758
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,570
obviously we are using GitHub, Copilot,

759
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,560
we are using Bedrock,

760
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,050
and if you think about where
we are using AWS Bedrock,

761
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,240
it's all about our...

762
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:56,100
When a customer calls with
a problem, with a complaint,

763
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,040
we are using AWS Transcribe,
we are using AWS Bedrock

764
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,390
to figure out, okay, why is
the customer calling, right?

765
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,080
And typically it's about,
"Oh, where is my invoice?"

766
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,700
or, "I have a flat tire," right?

767
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,320
So we are trying to see the reasons

768
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,171
why the customers are calling

769
00:38:09,171 --> 00:38:10,004
and make it easier for the customer

770
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:12,633
to be able to transact with
Hertz on a day-to-day basis.

771
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:17,050
So where are we right now?

772
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,380
We are on a journey to
modernize legacy platforms.

773
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,400
And let me tell you a story.

774
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,340
About six months back,
my CIO at that time,

775
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:27,060
and we traveled about
four cities in five days,

776
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,510
in three different locations.

777
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,190
We actually met four partners,

778
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,634
and each and every partner
was given the same problem.

779
00:38:35,634 --> 00:38:36,570
Take this 10 pieces of COBOL program

780
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,370
and tell me how you are convert it.

781
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:41,187
These COBOL programs were
running on the NonStop, right?

782
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:43,680
And I think you might have
heard about HPE NonStop,

783
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,330
or it's also called the Tandem.

784
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,423
These programs were
running on the NonStop.

785
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:52,387
Three partners, three
vendors give the typical,

786
00:38:52,387 --> 00:38:54,870
"Oh, we will do analysis,
we will do design,

787
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,880
we'll do unit testing, we'll do..."

788
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,830
I'm like, "No, that's not of interest."

789
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:02,160
The day we walked into Infosys office,

790
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,450
in the first one hour,

791
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:06,420
they showed me a working
prototype working model

792
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,505
of the converted code, right?

793
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:10,530
No presentations. I was
not interested in PPTs.

794
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,600
I wanted to see a working model, right?

795
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,340
And that is what actually impressed us

796
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,200
to partner with Infosys.

797
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,380
So if you think about what we did,

798
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,780
they have a platform called iLead.

799
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,440
iLead helped us do the documentation.

800
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,910
These programs have been existing

801
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,337
for the last 20, 25 years, right?

802
00:39:30,337 --> 00:39:31,170
As you can imagine,

803
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,344
and NonStop has been in
operation for the last 25 years.

804
00:39:34,344 --> 00:39:35,520
Documentation doesn't exist.

805
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,220
Nobody knows why a program was written.

806
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,030
Nobody knows how to test a
migrated COBOL program, right?

807
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,190
Nobody knows what scale to test it at.

808
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,937
So the documentation
actually helped me big time

809
00:39:46,937 --> 00:39:49,320
to say, "Program A talks to
program B, talks to program C."

810
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,840
It also showed me the
database dependencies,

811
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,021
the table dependencies, right?

812
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:55,770
So in one sheet of paper, I could now see

813
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,140
that a given program,
what it was dependent on,

814
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,490
as well as the tables.

815
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,990
So obviously we had a part of a journey

816
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,700
where we are migrating,

817
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,180
we are about six months into a journey.

818
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,530
Without the iLead platform,

819
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,170
I think we were taking
about four years to convert.

820
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,040
With the iLead platform,

821
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,440
I think we are targeting about 18 months.

822
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,650
We are expecting production
drops every month starting now,

823
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:20,205
with our development
complete by end of March.

824
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:22,890
We are gonna spend a
significant amount of time

825
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,600
in shadow testing, right,

826
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,000
making sure that the data in production

827
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,170
in the NonStop environment,

828
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,260
data in the converted actually matches.

829
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,420
And until we do shadow testing,

830
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,700
and they'll only then give
it to the users who test it,

831
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,320
we'll not plan to go live.

832
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,980
But as of now, all indicators
are we are on track to go live

833
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,630
by end of Q3,

834
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,070
and that's a critical timeline for us

835
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,533
because of our contract reasons, right?

836
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:47,640
So we are marching towards it.

837
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,560
If you look at the last bullet website,

838
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,930
it's a partnership-driven model, right?

839
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:54,076
We didn't want to go to a vendor

840
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,550
that were going to be task takers.

841
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,080
We wanted some thought leadership.

842
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,133
Maybe I got lucky.

843
00:41:00,497 --> 00:41:02,370
I got a good team of architects,

844
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,200
I got a good team of test people

845
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,330
that were actually came
with the thought leadership,

846
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,330
which is why we are partnering
with Infosys on this journey.

847
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:15,360
So if you think about what's next for us

848
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,623
in terms of summary,

849
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,977
it's called reading the old manuals,

850
00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:23,255
which is reading the
old COBOL codes, right?

851
00:41:23,255 --> 00:41:24,454
It's talking about writing.

852
00:41:24,454 --> 00:41:26,550
So not only did the iLead platform

853
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,770
did the reverse engineering,

854
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,710
not only did the iLead
platform did the discovery

855
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,940
and the dependencies,

856
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,550
it also did the forward
engineering, right?

857
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:38,160
And the forward engineering
adheres to a template.

858
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,303
The template is based on
your specifications, right?

859
00:41:41,303 --> 00:41:42,585
If you say, "These are
my coding standards,

860
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:43,740
these are my coding guidelines,"

861
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,930
it adheres to that template, right,

862
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,490
which is extremely critical.

863
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,913
So in terms of what I think
the future holds for us,

864
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,810
I personally think that all the things

865
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,223
from an AI perspective,

866
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,392
what are the things that
we don't like to do?

867
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,416
Number one, documentation.

868
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:03,990
There's no engineer in this
world who likes to do document.

869
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,480
I think we can probably have an agent

870
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,683
that does documentation.

871
00:42:08,682 --> 00:42:10,740
What's the second thing
that we don't like to do?

872
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,470
Testing, right? We think we
write the best code, right?

873
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,919
Guess what?

874
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:15,975
I'm thinking there's gonna be an agent

875
00:42:15,975 --> 00:42:17,659
that's gonna help us test.

876
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:19,301
Third, observability, right?

877
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:21,450
We don't like to implement metrics, right?

878
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,070
And obviously integration with PagerDuty,

879
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,140
I think we can have an
agent for doing that, right?

880
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,240
So those are the areas that I'm exploring.

881
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:31,383
Also from an incident response standpoint.

882
00:42:32,463 --> 00:42:34,320
Look at the amount of
logs we are generating.

883
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,640
I'm anticipating an agent

884
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,060
that's going to help me
mine through all my logs

885
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,070
and be proactive about when
an incident is gonna happen,

886
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,903
right?

887
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,423
So when I think about the possibilities,

888
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:50,550
yes, there's this fear about
AI replacing jobs, right?

889
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,110
I think that it's a time for us

890
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,660
to go deep in a specific skill,

891
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,210
because AI can replace general skillset

892
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,103
but not deep skillsets, right?

893
00:43:00,765 --> 00:43:01,765
Managing...

894
00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:05,001
How many of you are knowledgeable
about EKS, Amazon EKS?

895
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:06,051
Show of hands? Right?

896
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:10,199
Yes, AWS did a pretty good job
of keeping the control plane

897
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:11,439
out of your sight, right,

898
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:12,684
and you are only dealing with pods

899
00:43:12,684 --> 00:43:13,517
and deploying out on nodes.

900
00:43:13,517 --> 00:43:16,200
But when things go wrong, guess what?

901
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,850
You need your kubectl commands, right?

902
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:21,742
So you need your expertise,
whether it's a service services,

903
00:43:21,742 --> 00:43:23,520
whether it's a node port
service, ingress service,

904
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,050
you need to know your technical knowledge

905
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:29,190
to be able to interpret what
AI is telling you, right?

906
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,800
So in closing, thanks to my team,

907
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,872
thanks to Infosys for the partnership.

908
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:36,630
The thing that I always ask myself is,

909
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,400
whenever you have a challenge at hand,

910
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,400
whether it's test automation,
whether it's documentation,

911
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,640
ask the question, what can AI do for you?

912
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,640
Thank you very much.

913
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:49,933
(audience applauding)

914
00:43:55,714 --> 00:43:58,218
- Thanks, Sada. Good afternoon, everyone.

915
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,270
So I'm Krishna Srinivasan,
a director at United

916
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,810
responsible for enterprise
architecture, cloud, and DevOps.

917
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:07,170
And before I get into this,
just wanted a show of hands,

918
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:10,683
how many of you guys flew
United for coming to re:Invent?

919
00:44:11,813 --> 00:44:12,930
Thank you very much, guys.

920
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,558
For guys who haven't flown
on United, please try.

921
00:44:15,558 --> 00:44:17,518
You'll have a wonderful experience.

922
00:44:17,518 --> 00:44:18,780
So as many of you know,

923
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,730
United is one of the largest airline,

924
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:24,330
or not one of the, it's the
largest airline in the world,

925
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,940
and our mission every
day is to connect people,

926
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,140
unite the world.

927
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,810
And like we do this at
a very massive scale.

928
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:33,990
And like we fly about like
more than 2,000 aircrafts

929
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,738
to 360 destinations,

930
00:44:35,738 --> 00:44:40,443
and like carrying over 175
million customers every year.

931
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:43,290
That's about half a million
customers every day.

932
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:46,920
And then like we have
about 107k employees,

933
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,650
talented professionals that
are working hard every day

934
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,470
to make sure our customers

935
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:54,030
are getting to their destinations safely.

936
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,840
So on the systems side,
the technology landscape

937
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,270
is complex and very intricate, right?

938
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,720
So we have complex integrations
of our modern systems

939
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,990
with our legacy systems.

940
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,620
We have a big legacy footprint.

941
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,935
So we have a global infrastructure

942
00:45:09,935 --> 00:45:14,935
in airports, data center,
cloud, all over the place

943
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:18,658
and orchestrations through
4,000 APIs, 300 business events.

944
00:45:18,658 --> 00:45:21,120
And like we are registering transactions

945
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,000
about 5 billion hits on
our digital channels,

946
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,768
and 1 billion events

947
00:45:25,768 --> 00:45:28,650
on the backend operational systems, right?

948
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,850
So that's the scale.

949
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,860
And this is what enables United

950
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,472
to be able to deliver that
exceptional customer service

951
00:45:34,472 --> 00:45:37,800
that each and every one
of you deserve, right,

952
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,053
all of our customers deserve.

953
00:45:40,053 --> 00:45:45,053
And United has demonstrated
remarkable, like adaptability,

954
00:45:46,617 --> 00:45:49,981
like reinventing itself multiple times

955
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:52,740
through a lot of the
technology revolutions,

956
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,842
through economic upheavals,

957
00:45:54,842 --> 00:45:57,300
like the pandemics, like global events,

958
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,980
and each and every time coming out

959
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,350
establishing itself as the
pioneer in commercial aviation.

960
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:06,210
So, just like how like we saw Sada

961
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:11,210
use some of the car lingo,
the car rental lingo,

962
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:16,170
I'm gonna use the airline lingo, right?

963
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,350
So our flight plan for
digital transformation

964
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,150
started with cloud-first.

965
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,130
Cloud-first, right?

966
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:25,200
So we started looking into cloud-first

967
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,610
for building any new capabilities,

968
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:30,390
because we knew it was gonna
help us innovate, be nimble,

969
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,752
quickly react to changes,

970
00:46:31,752 --> 00:46:35,520
and more, like, importantly,
run reliable operations.

971
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,564
So very quickly we realized
that like we needed

972
00:46:37,564 --> 00:46:39,750
to start like automating repetitive tasks

973
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,150
so that we could kind of
like make the migrations,

974
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:44,693
modernizations more
efficient and effective.

975
00:46:44,693 --> 00:46:46,757
And then like we end up,

976
00:46:46,757 --> 00:46:49,860
and we started bringing in
modern integration platforms

977
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,435
like connecting these capabilities,

978
00:46:51,435 --> 00:46:54,300
centralizing the data across
all of our business domains,

979
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,540
crew, operations, finance, HR,

980
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,220
and this set the stage for us

981
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,400
to be able to run AI/ML models,

982
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,530
and we started focusing on use cases

983
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,880
for optimizing our flight plan,

984
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,917
for like how much fuel
we put on the planes,

985
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:11,190
customer notifications.

986
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:13,260
And then like we started
seeing ourselves transform

987
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,680
into this AI-first enterprise,

988
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,540
where we started looking at AI,

989
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,480
embedding AI into everything
that we do, right?

990
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,730
Like everything we do, not
only like everything we do,

991
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:27,000
how we do too, we wanted to
start infusing AI into that.

992
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,985
And now, like we are kind
of like unlocking the power

993
00:47:29,985 --> 00:47:33,120
of agentic AI for the compounding value.

994
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,280
We are gonna be getting out
of like this agentic AI,

995
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,480
as well as the human-in-the-loops
systems, right?

996
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,620
So when we started the journey to cloud,

997
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,770
obviously like coming from
a data center organization,

998
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:49,636
right, like it was with the
heavy mindset we got in there,

999
00:47:49,636 --> 00:47:51,409
very quickly we learned

1000
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:54,810
to start leveraging the AWS
well-architected framework,

1001
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:58,080
the standards, best practices,
to start implementing it

1002
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,212
the more like the cloud way, right?

1003
00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:05,009
But then, so we started seeing
varying implementations,

1004
00:48:05,009 --> 00:48:07,440
right, like different
tool sets being used,

1005
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,610
like different like deployment
strategies being used, right?

1006
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:14,310
Like there was like a lot of
things all over the place.

1007
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:18,180
That's where like we
engaged a strategic partner

1008
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:23,180
like Infosys to help us start
creating the building blocks,

1009
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,960
right, like the foundational blocks

1010
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,210
for how we would enable the teams

1011
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:30,480
to be building cloud workloads

1012
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,180
in a much reliable, secure way, right?

1013
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,880
So what we did is we
created a tool set, right?

1014
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,580
Like we coined this program as Cloud 3.0.

1015
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,413
Basically we took out,

1016
00:48:39,413 --> 00:48:41,880
we started creating the
reference architectures

1017
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,164
for the design patterns.

1018
00:48:43,164 --> 00:48:45,300
We started templatizing them,

1019
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,310
and like we made this
open source for people,

1020
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,470
for teams to contribute back to this,

1021
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:51,330
so that helped with that option.

1022
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,240
And then like we started
building starter kits

1023
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,090
so teams could take this to
kind of set up their environment

1024
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:00,660
and start getting into
kind of coding, right?

1025
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,480
And then we started giving
them all these power packs

1026
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,338
for observability, for
like doing their recovery,

1027
00:49:06,338 --> 00:49:08,130
like region failovers.

1028
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:11,160
And also we wanted to
embed like the practices,

1029
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,612
so we started building kits

1030
00:49:13,612 --> 00:49:17,370
for the teams to be able
to integrate chaos testing

1031
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:18,890
as part of the pipeline, right?

1032
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:21,033
So this pretty much helped us.

1033
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,880
So this helped us

1034
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,208
like accelerate our
transformation to cloud.

1035
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:28,470
So today we have 60%,

1036
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:31,110
more than 60% of our
like mission critical,

1037
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,990
business critical workloads in cloud.

1038
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,660
And also like teams using the starter kits

1039
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,820
were able to get it done much faster,

1040
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:42,810
15% faster going from
design to development,

1041
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,039
development to deployment.

1042
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:46,950
And then like this also
had a very positive impact

1043
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,220
on our MTTR, and we were
able to see a 7% reduction,

1044
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,390
which we were able to attribute

1045
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:54,600
to these like this
resiliency, the recovery,

1046
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,466
like solutions that we had
to quickly record service

1047
00:49:58,466 --> 00:50:01,053
moving to another region, right?

1048
00:50:01,976 --> 00:50:05,790
So this basically helped
us set the stage, right?

1049
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,992
So not only we started
building consistently,

1050
00:50:08,992 --> 00:50:12,312
but we started building
faster, very secure,

1051
00:50:12,312 --> 00:50:15,180
reliable, scalable workloads,

1052
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,760
and this basically kind of
set the foundation for us

1053
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,610
to be able to layer the
AI strategy on top of it.

1054
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,130
So our strategy on AI is everyday AI.

1055
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,607
It keep our employees
with AI capabilities,

1056
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:30,326
so that like it helps
boost the productivity

1057
00:50:30,326 --> 00:50:33,810
and helps them with
making decisions, right?

1058
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:35,850
And then like start embedding AI

1059
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:39,570
in all of our like design, development,

1060
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:40,920
process improvements,

1061
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,040
in the lifecycle of our
products and services.

1062
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,219
And then evolutionary, right?

1063
00:50:46,219 --> 00:50:47,884
So continue to evolve this,

1064
00:50:47,884 --> 00:50:49,140
start like looking

1065
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:53,460
for the next horizon intelligent systems.

1066
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,005
Look at like do some experiments
and keep innovating, right?

1067
00:50:57,005 --> 00:50:59,370
And so, and how are we
enabling this, right?

1068
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:00,720
So yes, the strategy is great,

1069
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,100
but how are we enabling this?

1070
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,380
Following the path of Cloud 3.0,

1071
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,652
we started building this AI/ML platform

1072
00:51:06,652 --> 00:51:10,110
and providing a toolkit for the teams

1073
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:13,110
to be able to start like
looking up like models

1074
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:14,790
that's already available for them,

1075
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:17,670
giving them a UI to help
create the workflows

1076
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:18,690
for their use case,

1077
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,610
or provide them one-click solutions

1078
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:24,810
to convert their APIs to
MCPs, or like for agents.

1079
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,900
And then like add in all
the observability part of it

1080
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,132
to detect like model
drifts, auto-restraining,

1081
00:51:31,132 --> 00:51:33,930
and give it all as part of the platform

1082
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:36,060
so the teams would be able to focus more

1083
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,090
on building these agents
for their use case

1084
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,005
or leveraging the agents, existing agents,

1085
00:51:41,005 --> 00:51:42,480
for like their use case

1086
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,880
to start delivering
value for the business.

1087
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,830
So what we had seen,
the benefits out of that

1088
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:53,692
is application teams were
able to build their agents

1089
00:51:53,692 --> 00:51:57,330
for the use cases, rag
models, like their MCPs,

1090
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,460
anonymous agents, whatever, right?

1091
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,900
So they were able to build this like

1092
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,470
from the time got reduced
from weeks to days, right?

1093
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,570
So we saw that 80% improvement in teams

1094
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,240
being able to kind of quickly
churn out like what they need

1095
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,220
and trying it out, trying it out.

1096
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,290
And today we have more than 50+ models

1097
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,580
running in our platforms,

1098
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,466
and about 200 of our applications,

1099
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:21,466
like 10% of our applications
like having like AI capability.

1100
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:26,010
And so what is the value
for the business, right?

1101
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,979
Like these are some of the use cases,

1102
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:30,522
like successful use
cases, success stories,

1103
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:34,410
where like we had seen
AI being like put to use

1104
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,240
to solve a very specific problem,

1105
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,360
and it was done in a
very quick way, right?

1106
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,824
The contact centers,
the team, they launched

1107
00:52:41,824 --> 00:52:45,930
a care CoPilot, a customer care CoPilot,

1108
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:48,900
which could help in looking into the cases

1109
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,440
that like we get
submitted by the customers

1110
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,680
through the portal or
through sending an email

1111
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,305
so that we had this AI agent

1112
00:52:57,305 --> 00:52:59,430
start like looking into these emails

1113
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:02,040
and start looking at how
they've been solved in the past,

1114
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,470
how the service agents
were able to address it,

1115
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:06,245
and start like responding to that, right?

1116
00:53:06,245 --> 00:53:09,182
So we saw like the
resolution time coming down,

1117
00:53:09,182 --> 00:53:12,150
and like now today we are
like able to resolve it

1118
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:15,420
or resolve like issues
and like two times faster.

1119
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,980
And another success story
is the flight updates.

1120
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,090
Whenever the flight gets delayed

1121
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:22,410
you would've seen getting notifications

1122
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:23,670
saying your flight is delayed.

1123
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:26,580
So we used to create those
notifications very manually,

1124
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,230
and on a bad day we were able to do that

1125
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,420
for 15% of our delayed flights,

1126
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,070
because like there are like people sitting

1127
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,720
and looking into all of the systems,

1128
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,640
finding out what really happened,

1129
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,440
and curate that story and send it out.

1130
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,205
But today we have like
AI agents doing that,

1131
00:53:39,205 --> 00:53:42,960
and we are able to send it
out for 50% of our flights,

1132
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,640
and also we are getting into sending

1133
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,530
more personalized messages, right,

1134
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,030
saying like, "Hey, your flight is delayed,

1135
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,992
but don't worry about your connection.

1136
00:53:49,992 --> 00:53:51,300
You're gonna be able to make it."

1137
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,844
So we are able to get
it from a flight level

1138
00:53:53,844 --> 00:53:57,480
to a passenger level notifications.

1139
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,452
And on the technology side,

1140
00:53:59,452 --> 00:54:03,060
we are able to bring
in, leverage AI, right,

1141
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,400
like running in these
platforms for like code assist,

1142
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,740
code development, code fixes, testing,

1143
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,260
and we are already started
seeing 15% efficiency

1144
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,222
in our the development time, right?

1145
00:54:13,222 --> 00:54:17,280
So again, so what's the journey?

1146
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,680
The next step in our journey
is to push the boundaries

1147
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,627
of this AI, look into frontier models,

1148
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:27,750
so aligned with our like
data, domain, language,

1149
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,425
and start looking at agentic efficiency

1150
00:54:30,425 --> 00:54:33,710
through multipurpose architecture,

1151
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:37,680
and also like start looking
at autonomous agents,

1152
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,180
which could take decisions,

1153
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,670
decisions like that the
humans would do, right?

1154
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:43,980
So this has basically kind of set us up

1155
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,960
to start reimagining our business

1156
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,714
in a much bigger, bolder way.

1157
00:54:47,714 --> 00:54:50,880
So like to thank Infosys
for this opportunity,

1158
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,980
and I want give it back to Gopal.

1159
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,525
Thank you much.

1160
00:54:54,525 --> 00:54:57,570
(audience applauding)

1161
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:00,453
- Thank you. Sure, good.

1162
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,300
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1163
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,830
Thank you for being here.

1164
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:06,990
I know this is probably the
last session of the day.

1165
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:09,450
I wanna take a moment to
thank each of our speakers,

1166
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:13,350
Keisha, Srini, Sada, and Krishna.

1167
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:16,470
Amazing stories, fantastic transformation.

1168
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:19,110
We've seen each of them embrace Cloud

1169
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,813
to create scalability and resilience.

1170
00:55:20,813 --> 00:55:23,010
They've modernized their applications,

1171
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:24,696
they've gotten their data ready,

1172
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:27,500
they're all ready for
delivering amazing experiences

1173
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,380
to each one of us.

1174
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,439
So all of these companies
touch us every day.

1175
00:55:30,439 --> 00:55:31,860
They touch our lives every day,

1176
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,450
and we are really looking forward

1177
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:35,850
to seeing amazing
experiences being generated.

1178
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,549
Thank you again. Thank you for being here.

1179
00:55:37,549 --> 00:55:40,770
We are gonna be out here
for a few more minutes

1180
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,970
in case you've got questions.

1181
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:43,314
Otherwise we hope to see some of you

1182
00:55:43,314 --> 00:55:45,540
at our reception happening,

1183
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,280
starting at six o'clock in the evening.

1184
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,510
Thank you again for coming here.

1185
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,280
Thank you for each of our
speakers for being here.

1186
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,750
Thank you for the partnership.

1187
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,610
Thanks, AWS, for this opportunity.

1188
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:54,443
Thank you.
