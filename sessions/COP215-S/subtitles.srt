1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,183
- Good evening. I hope you can hear me.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,490
I'm Shreeni, and I lead
the business for innovation

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,143
and emerging technologies.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,130
We at Tech Mahindra,

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,990
one of the largest SI
IT companies from India,

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,990
partner with AWS in multiple areas,

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,500
and we work with them in AI,

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,113
in metaverse, and quantum computing.

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,990
In today's session,

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,460
we would like to cover
how Tech Mahindra and AWS

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,150
have helped companies reduce their TCO

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:47,150
by doing joint offerings
in the generative AI space.

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,503
I'll just, yeah.

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,520
So I'll give you some important stats.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,240
Lots of IT companies
have actually been doing

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,050
a lot of POCs in the generative AI space,

17
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,000
and everybody talks about the work they do

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,830
in agents and all.

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,090
But do we know how many of these POCs

20
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,163
actually get converted to production?

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,753
It's a measly 5%.

22
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,930
Let me give you three more statistics.

23
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,930
In any given company that we work,

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,700
we spend a quarter of our
time typically to find out

25
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,820
data that we require for our daily work,

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,850
or we try to find out
who's the right person

27
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,710
who can give the data.

28
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,843
That happens in all the organizations.

29
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,990
Similarly, each company
is now spending money

30
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,010
to see how it can make their
associates more productive

31
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,590
by giving them co-pilots and other things.

32
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,530
So that is coming to up to 7%.

33
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,530
But the most surprising thing that we have

34
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,650
is that a lot of
investment in technologies

35
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,780
are actually not getting used.

36
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,450
One third of the investment that we do,

37
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,230
typically in areas like
GPUs, technologies,

38
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,663
softwares, are not getting used.

39
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,980
So, where do we go from here?

40
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,010
So TechM and AWS have said that,

41
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,080
let us define some parameters

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,910
on how do we actually make POCs

43
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,403
which are production-grade.

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,070
And these are some of the
principles that we follow.

45
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,020
So what typically happens is,

46
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,150
when we try to do a POC,

47
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,270
we will look at it only
as a proof of concept.

48
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,070
But can we look at POC
as a full-term project?

49
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,560
As the deliverables that we want to give?

50
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,450
As the data that we need to look at?

51
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,880
As the latency that we need to look at?

52
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,340
Is that making a difference?

53
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,990
The second point is,

54
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,050
the most important thing that
people talk in the AI space

55
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,390
is how do we provide security?

56
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,310
How do we do governance?

57
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,450
And are we inculcating that
in the first stage itself

58
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,953
when we are doing POCs?

59
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,950
The third thing is,

60
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,460
AI is something that
will improve over time,

61
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,980
so when we are thinking of production,

62
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,250
are we thinking of
staggering our production

63
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,203
with learnings from each phase?

64
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,730
The fourth thing, and a
big misnomer that we have,

65
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,383
is that agentic AI will
not need human beings.

66
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,603
It's a big misnomer.

67
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,413
Agents are there to augment what we do,

68
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,620
and we need to plan in such a way

69
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,870
that agents do bulk of the work.

70
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,260
And as we go ahead, can they ensure

71
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,860
that the presence of human
beings required is very less?

72
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,480
But plan it in such a way.

73
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,160
And the last and most important thing

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,470
for anything that we do is,

75
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,140
are we evaluating what we are doing?

76
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,433
Are we evaluating?

77
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,480
Are we benchmarking the
POC that we are doing?

78
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,150
Are we looking at what results
we want to get out of it?

79
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,340
So these are key things
that we need to look at

80
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,503
when we try to create a POC.

81
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,983
So in TechM,

82
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,110
we actually found a strategy
on how do we deliver AI.

83
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,490
So any company that
comes to us asking for AI

84
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,860
is looking at four key things.

85
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,500
Either they're trying to do productivity,

86
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,930
or they're trying to do transformation,

87
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,140
or they're trying to do
innovation, or governance.

88
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,210
So we came with a strategy saying,

89
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,780
can we ensure that we
deliver AI delivered right

90
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,640
in the first instance?

91
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,770
And to do that, TechM has come up

92
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,170
with a product called TechM Orion.

93
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,880
Now, what is TechM Orion?

94
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,050
So TechM, along with NVIDIA
as an infrastructure player,

95
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,060
has come up with a platform

96
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,270
which will give you access
to models for fine-tuning,

97
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,510
which will help you to
create RAG repositories,

98
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,840
and also help you to launch agents

99
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,343
to automate your tasks.

100
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,930
So what will that give us?

101
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,930
Speed, interoperability, and
security, and governance.

102
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,810
Now, this is the entire
architecture of Orion.

103
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,190
I will not go into detail,

104
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,650
but I would request all of
you to come to our booth,

105
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,650
which is 1284, which is
where we are talking about

106
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,390
what is Orion, what are the key use cases

107
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,760
that we have developed on Orion,

108
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,450
how do we launch agents
at breakneck speed,

109
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,550
what are the repositories that we create,

110
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,130
how is AWS a part of the entire Orion.

111
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,900
So when you come to our
booth, we'll talk about them,

112
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,173
but this is the general
architecture of Orion.

113
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,563
So what are we doing with AWS typically?

114
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,400
We are partnered with them in Orion.

115
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,820
Orion is actually hosted on AWS.

116
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,770
Second is, in their agent core,

117
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,339
we are developing agents
for some of our customers,

118
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:14,013
typically in BFSI and manufacturing side.

119
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,880
And Tech Mahindra has a large repository

120
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,530
of certified people who have
different belts from AWS,

121
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,050
and we are actually doing
joint research with them

122
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,553
in some of the core areas.

123
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,177
So, between Tech Mahindra and AWS,

124
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,930
there are multiple case studies

125
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,490
that we have done with customers,

126
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,420
but I'll highlight two use
cases or two case studies.

127
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,710
The first one is a US-based company.

128
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,910
This is into developing
engineering services.

129
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,633
Has been in presence since 1950.

130
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,263
For the last 50, 60
years, it's been there.

131
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,330
And it had one typical problem
that they approached us,

132
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,480
is they have 75 human agents

133
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,193
who work on the customer support.

134
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,130
And these customer support
agents who were there

135
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,050
were getting bogged with multiple calls

136
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,650
that they were getting,

137
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,040
which resulted in long queues

138
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,250
for people trying to access
their customer center,

139
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,530
which affected the productivity.

140
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,020
So, what did TechM do?

141
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,440
So TechM and AWS gave out a joint solution

142
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,880
where we said that we'll
create you a chatbot,

143
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,753
a generative AI-based chatbot,

144
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,810
which will help you
solve all these queries.

145
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,833
How did we do that?

146
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,120
So the first thing we did was that

147
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,640
we powered this by Amazon Lex.

148
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,230
Now, what is Amazon Lex?

149
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,310
Amazon Lex is a tool that uses

150
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,100
natural language understanding.

151
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,760
So whenever a customer puts in a query,

152
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,883
it tries to understand what is
the intent behind that query,

153
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,860
and then it passes this
information to AWS Lambda,

154
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,060
which actually orchestrates

155
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,070
the entire information which is there.

156
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,330
It could be a repository

157
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,880
or the inventory of the
things that represent,

158
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,320
it'll be pricing.

159
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,610
It fetches it and gives
it to Claude Sonnet.

160
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,988
Now, what happens typically in AWS is,

161
00:08:22,988 --> 00:08:26,850
AWS Bedrock has multiple models

162
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,810
which are from AWS and Anthropic.

163
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,410
So Claude Sonnet is one of
the models from Anthropic,

164
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,460
and this is used for typically
solving complex use cases.

165
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,180
So this use case will take
the information from Lambda

166
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,560
and pass it on to Lex in the
way that human beings can read,

167
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,080
and that information goes to the end user.

168
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,740
By doing this, we actually automated

169
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,440
50% of the calls they were getting,

170
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,130
and we could bring in
productivity to the customer.

171
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,670
Now, what has happened is
using the same 75 agents,

172
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,370
they've been able to spend more time

173
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,040
in terms of actually selling more

174
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,960
and generating $50,000 of revenue.

175
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,690
So this is the first use case that we did

176
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,850
for an engineering company.

177
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,130
Now, the second use case that we did

178
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,920
was for a company in Philippines.

179
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,933
This was a BFSI company,

180
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,940
primarily into mobile,

181
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,850
and doing remittances.

182
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,830
Now, this company has been doing well

183
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,380
for the past few years, and by 2024,

184
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,980
they had 94 million consumers

185
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,770
and a market capitalization of $5 billion.

186
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,750
Now, if you look at
Philippines as a country,

187
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,180
there's a lot of focus on remittances.

188
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,940
And you see that remittances as an area

189
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,753
is growing at 13.3% every year, till 2030.

190
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,960
But this customer hit a roadblock.

191
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,280
What typically happens
is, in the finance world,

192
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,770
there's something called
as account takeover,

193
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,950
where people will impersonate your details

194
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,570
and take over your account,

195
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,480
and then start doing
malicious things around that.

196
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,450
Now, the moment I get to know

197
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,580
that something wrong has
happened with my account,

198
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,070
I immediately write to
the customer support.

199
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,640
Now, the same thing used to
happen with this customer,

200
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,920
but the customer support
team used to typically take

201
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,870
seven days to solve it.

202
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,150
Now, if you are in finance business

203
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,130
and you are taking seven days,

204
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,893
you're actually talking
of credibility loss.

205
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,020
You're talking of credibility
loss for the company.

206
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,000
So the company approached us,

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,490
and we actually created a platform

208
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,100
for them called FraudSentinel.

209
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,630
Now, what did we do that?

210
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,880
There are two things
that we basically did.

211
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,300
One is we automated the
entire fraud detection process

212
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,810
using Step, which is an AWS product.

213
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,590
So, typically, what used to
happen as a manual thing,

214
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,020
now happens to a process flow,

215
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,630
and fraud detection happens much simpler.

216
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,330
The second thing is we also created

217
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,700
a generative AI-based chatbot,

218
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,100
which could be used by the fraud analysts

219
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,450
to actually talk to the
chatbot or to the experts

220
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,790
using normal business language.

221
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,360
Now, doing this, what we could do is

222
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,640
bring down the resolution

223
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,850
of the ATO cases that were happening

224
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,850
from about seven days
to less than 24 hours.

225
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,760
Now, not only did we bring
the time to resolve slow,

226
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,240
but we also brought the SLA to one day.

227
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,200
Now, for a company that has
been losing credibility,

228
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,150
doing this has actually
helped it increase its CSI

229
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,050
or what we call as customer
satisfaction index by 10%.

230
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,750
And now they're back into the business,

231
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,440
they're still leading
that area in Philippines,

232
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,553
and they're expanding.

233
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,403
So,

234
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,690
these are two use cases
that I wanted to talk about,

235
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,530
but primarily the objective is that,

236
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,363
when we focus on business,

237
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,663
what is that we are looking at?

238
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:19,320
So more what generally happens

239
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,750
is when we technologists
go and meet customers,

240
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,450
we are happy to discuss technology,

241
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,650
or to tell them what the
latest technology will help.

242
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,320
But the focus here should be,

243
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,390
what is the business
outcome they are looking

244
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,130
and how can we solve it?

245
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,940
Can a normal automation
solution help the customer

246
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,690
do the job rather than
giving them an idea of using

247
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,500
a large language model
and a RAG repository?

248
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,290
So are we focusing on
what business outcomes

249
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,790
is the customer looking from us,

250
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,940
or is he looking at us on technology?

251
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,240
So that's the first thing.

252
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,590
The second thing that we are doing is,

253
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,810
are we focusing on cost?

254
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,130
And when I say cost

255
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,920
is right from the time we
are looking at the solution,

256
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,360
are we looking at cost economics?

257
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,860
Do we need these things?

258
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,810
A lot of times, what happens is,

259
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:14,190
we tend to use, say,
ChatGPT or any other models

260
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,900
where the tokens are costly.

261
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,550
Is that taken into consideration?

262
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,920
I'm not saying they're good or bad,

263
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,200
but I'm saying are we taking
that into consideration

264
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,300
when we are doing the economics?

265
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,240
The third one is, are we
planning the POCs properly

266
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,550
into a production-grade
that I was talking about?

267
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,340
So these are some of the
things that we are doing.

268
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,340
And the last and most important
thing that we need to do is,

269
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,510
measure all the work that we are doing.

270
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,153
Measure the POCs that we are trying to do,

271
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:46,650
measure the projects
that we are trying to do.

272
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,210
How can we build...

273
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,840
And what is the output that
we want to get out of that?

274
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,350
Is the most important thing
that we are trying to focus on.

275
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,160
So, if you look at typically the way

276
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,470
we have been orchestrating things

277
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,100
is that in the discussion
with the customer,

278
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,073
we've been trying to understand
what has been the problem,

279
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,500
and how does the problem
actually impact the customer.

280
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,570
So like the first case, where we said

281
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,450
this company was typically losing business

282
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,790
because the customer service executives,

283
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,490
who were supposed to sell or cross-sell,

284
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,440
were busy handling the queries,

285
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,080
and they were taking
more time to handle that.

286
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,680
In the second case, we
found out that customer,

287
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,790
while gaining business, was
actually losing credibility,

288
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,710
which in the long-term could affect

289
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,900
in a growing market for remittances.

290
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,230
So the focus was on how do
we look at business outcomes,

291
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,840
and then we come back to
the drawing board and say,

292
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,280
am I going to use AI?

293
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,920
Am I going to use generative AI?

294
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,120
Am I going to use a RAG repository for it?

295
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,620
What is the solution
that we want to derive?

296
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,020
So, I think, overall, the focus has been

297
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,463
on how do we derive business
outcomes in terms of it.

298
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,890
So, the last point I wanted to talk was,

299
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,800
like we said that we
thought agents are a panacea

300
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,900
for all the problems that we have,

301
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,200
the large language models
are also not the panacea.

302
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,990
So if Tech Mahindra has created a model,

303
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,720
which is 1.2 billion called Indus,

304
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,750
and we benchmarked with GPT and others,

305
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,310
and independent bodies found out

306
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,870
that our ratio of tokenization

307
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,670
was much better than them,

308
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,600
it means that it also tells us the fact

309
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,550
that we are not looking
at large language models

310
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,170
just based on parameters,

311
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,940
but based on how they have been fine-tuned

312
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,950
and how they have been built.

313
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,400
So, coming back to the same premises,

314
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,430
we look at cost, we look
at business outcomes,

315
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,630
and we try to do our POCs
as a production-grade.

316
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,230
I think this is what we learned

317
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,260
when we did the journey
with both the customers.

318
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,309
The next point I wanted to say was that

319
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:02,760
we would like to extend this discussion

320
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,710
when you come to our booth at 1284

321
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,443
to see what are the problems
that you have in your areas.

322
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,500
In the AI space,

323
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,360
what are the problems that
your customers are facing,

324
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,770
and how we can work it together?

325
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,650
How we can involve AWS whenever required?

326
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,610
The third point was we as a
company also look beyond AI,

327
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,880
and I have my metaverse expert here,

328
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,730
where we are trying to see how we can use

329
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,850
immersive experiences combined with AI

330
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,580
to simulate a lot of business processes.

331
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,480
It could be digital twins
for a mining company.

332
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,810
It could be digital twin on
how fiber has to be laid out

333
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,280
for a telecom company.

334
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,000
Or digital twin on how a
financial process gets solved.

335
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,500
These are things that we are trying to do,

336
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,230
but this is a culmination of both AI

337
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,640
and immersive experience,
or metaverse as we call it.

338
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,710
And the last area that we are focusing on,

339
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,690
again, working with AWS is,

340
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,480
how do we bring quantum
computing into practice?

341
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,860
How do we look at quantum computing

342
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,990
to solve cases like fraud detection?

343
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,220
How do we bring route
optimization using quantum?

344
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,740
And this is something that
we are working on Braket,

345
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,093
which is an AWS product.

346
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,960
But I think that is where
I'd like to end my session.

347
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,360
If there are any questions,
I'd like to take it.

348
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:24,377
(audience clapping)
