  "abstract": "Not all disaster recovery strategies can address the complex, dynamic nature of modern cloud infrastructures, leading to gaps in system resilience and compliance adherence. Discover how to enhance resilience and disaster recovery on AWS empowered by AI. This approach bridges infrastructure insights and application-level testing, enabling more effective disaster recovery preparation. You will learn how to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) with AWS Resilience Hub and AWS Systems Manager to modernize testing, analyze infrastructure, and generate targeted AWS Fault Injection Service experiments and recovery runbooks. Walk away with practical examples of automated test generation with templates and learn to design prompts.",
