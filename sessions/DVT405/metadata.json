  "abstract": "AI-powered coding agents are one of the most promising applications of generative AI. In this talk we will start from their humble beginnings as inline code completion tools and explain their evolution into sophisticated autonomous coding agents. Throughout the talk, we will ground our discussion in empirical evidence, presenting evaluations from public benchmarks that demonstrate the progressive improvements in each evolutionary stage. By walking through concrete examples and real-world applications, attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of AI-powered development tools and insights into future directions in this rapidly advancing field.",
  "abstract_cn": "AI驱动的编码代理是生成式AI最具前景的应用之一。在本次演讲中，我们将从其作为内联代码补全工具的起步阶段开始，解释其演变为复杂自主编码代理的过程。在整个演讲中，我们将以实证证据为基础，展示来自公共基准测试的评估结果，这些结果展示了每个演进阶段的逐步改进。通过具体示例和实际应用案例，与会者将全面了解AI驱动开发工具的当前状态，并洞察这一快速发展领域的未来方向。",
