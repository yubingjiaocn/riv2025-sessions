  "title_cn": "I understand you're asking about the AWS re:Invent 2025 session \"How to prep Telemetry data for AI consumption (DVT222)\". However, I don't have access to specific session content from AWS re:Invent 2025, as this would be current conference material that's beyond my knowledge cutoff.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information about this session, I'd recommend:\n\n- Checking the official AWS re:Invent 2025 session catalog\n- Looking for session recordings on the AWS Events YouTube channel\n- Reviewing AWS documentation on telemetry data preparation for AI/ML workloads\n\nIf you have specific questions about preparing telemetry data for AI consumption in general, I'd be happy to help with best practices around:\n\n- Data collection and ingestion patterns\n- Data preprocessing and cleaning techniques\n- AWS services like Amazon Kinesis, AWS Glue, or Amazon SageMaker for telemetry data pipelines\n- Storage formats and schemas optimized for AI workloads\n\nWhat specific aspect of telemetry data preparation for AI would you like to explore?",
  "abstract": "Engineering team are stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to observability: either collect all the data on how your system is behaving or risk not having that one thing needed during an incident. Grepr acts as a proxy between your observability agents and your observability vendor and uses real-time ML to understand the behavior of every piece of data. Grepr's Intelligent Data Engine automatically reduces noise, while keeping all the original raw data in low-cost storage, automatically handling new usage patterns or spikes. The result: minimal configuration, immediate 90% reduction in costs, with no migrations needed. Learn how Grepr works and see it in action in this session. This presentation is brought to you by Grepr, an AWS Partner.",
  "abstract_cn": "工程团队在可观测性方面面临两难境地：要么收集系统行为的所有数据，要么冒着在事故期间缺少关键信息的风险。Grepr作为可观测性代理和可观测性供应商之间的代理，使用实时机器学习来理解每个数据片段的行为。Grepr的智能数据引擎自动减少噪音，同时将所有原始数据保存在低成本存储中，自动处理新的使用模式或峰值。结果是：最少配置，立即降低90%的成本，无需迁移。了解Grepr的工作原理并在本次会议中观看实际演示。本演示由AWS合作伙伴Grepr提供。",
