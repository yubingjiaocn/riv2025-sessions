1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:03,059
Great, uh, thanks for taking

2
00:00:03,059 --> 00:00:05,110
the time to see our presentation.

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:07,288
We are gonna be having a

4
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:08,000
conversation with Grupore

5
00:00:08,778 --> 00:00:09,659
Internacional,

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,060
particularly Armando Valenzuela is

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,939
going to share

8
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,538
with us their transformation

9
00:00:15,538 --> 00:00:18,059
process using AWS Transform4.NET.

10
00:00:18,798 --> 00:00:21,149
Uh, the service, uh, was,

11
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:22,649
uh, launched, um,

12
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:25,039
a few months ago, so they started

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,199
in a fair release.

14
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,600
Now a event

15
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:30,000
there are a lot of launches that you have already

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,098
seen, so we are gonna go in, uh,

17
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:33,079
through those as well.

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,548
But let's hear what are, um,

19
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,978
Grupore's challenges regarding

20
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,079
their modernization efforts, right?

21
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:43,658
So this is the agenda we're gonna go

22
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:45,679
through a quick introduction. We're gonna

23
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,880
present a group of Tres International

24
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,590
what they do.

25
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,959
Armando is going to dive deep into their

26
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:53,060
challenges. He's gonna share with us

27
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:55,798
their transformation path, the transformation

28
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:57,118
journey regarding

29
00:00:57,478 --> 00:00:58,929
all the, uh,

30
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:01,520
key lessons learned that they got

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,639
into their path while transforming

32
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:04,359
their solution.

33
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:07,069
And this is very interesting. Uh, he's going

34
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:09,388
to dive deep into the architecture, as

35
00:01:09,388 --> 00:01:11,549
you know, this session is a level 200,

36
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,989
so expect, uh, deep, uh, technical

37
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:16,790
content and also the demonstration

38
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,790
of the service and benefits that it's going

39
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:19,650
to be led by,

40
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,579
uh, Tiago and, uh, what's,

41
00:01:22,588 --> 00:01:24,829
uh, next in terms of lessons learned

42
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:26,028
and what's the,

43
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,750
uh, next adventure from Group of Trece.

44
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,930
Now who is Grupores International?

45
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:35,689
So, uh, Grupores is

46
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:37,769
a leading Mexican company. They

47
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:39,808
are, uh, focused on human

48
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,870
resources management,

49
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:43,430
payroll processing, and attendance control

50
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,028
solutions.

51
00:01:44,528 --> 00:01:46,609
Uh, they have a long heritage.

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,448
Uh, they have been, uh, uh, building software

53
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:50,790
since 1991,

54
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:53,129
so you can imagine that

55
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:55,159
they have a lot of, uh, legacy code

56
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,230
out there. And their solution has been

57
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,250
evolving and during

58
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,549
these years. They are headquartered

59
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,418
in Tijuana, not so far from here,

60
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:05,400
and by 2024,

61
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:06,209
uh,

62
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:10,250
GTI as we call them, reached 68%

63
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:12,788
coverage of all Mexico's

64
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:13,830
manufacturing.

65
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:15,139
Uh, employees,

66
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,469
so imagine that you

67
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:20,028
are receiving your payroll and

68
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:22,429
you are working at a manufacturing sector.

69
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,028
You may want to receive your payments

70
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,429
week by week or

71
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,088
every 15 days.

72
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,830
So this is how it works for the manufacturing

73
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,849
sector, uh, in Mexico in particular.

74
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,960
And they reach more than

75
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:37,360
1200 customers

76
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:39,778
and up to 4.4

77
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:41,020
million employees,

78
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:41,879
so

79
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:44,240
they have a pretty large impact out

80
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,110
there. So

81
00:02:47,118 --> 00:02:49,319
let me introduce Armando Valenzuela

82
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,300
who is the head of engineering.

83
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,469
Um, buenos dias, uh, bomtia

84
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,909
in Portuguese, right, Tiago,

85
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:00,719
and good morning everyone.

86
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:03,588
Uh, let me just introduce myself

87
00:03:03,588 --> 00:03:04,389
really quickly.

88
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:06,838
I have been working in Grupores for more

89
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:07,899
than 20 years,

90
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,639
and, uh, I started working on

91
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,778
a legacy Windows and premise

92
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:13,319
applications.

93
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,319
Yeah, we,

94
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,679
I worked with Delhi in that time.

95
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:18,740
Uh, no, no shame on that.

96
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,360
Then I moved to working on cloud

97
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,819
native, uh, serverless

98
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,879
applications, and now I work as a part

99
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,199
of the architecture enablement

100
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,360
team that we, and we serve,

101
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:32,439
uh, multiple product development teams as

102
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,099
well. I

103
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,389
So,

104
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,199
uh, picture this, uh, you have

105
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,808
more than 4 million

106
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,528
of users trying to request your,

107
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:44,469
to your app,

108
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,439
right? They're trying to do something meaningful

109
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,679
with your application in a Friday

110
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:50,199
evening.

111
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,550
Um, customers are calling technical

112
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,050
support for your help.

113
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:56,149
Uh,

114
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,449
the product teams are really stressful,

115
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:01,110
and this application is running on

116
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,389
a legacy code of more than 10

117
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:04,050
years

118
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:07,770
running on a Windows being installed that doesn't escalate

119
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,689
as you think

120
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:10,189
or as you wish.

121
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,699
Well Um,

122
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,939
surely that is not a happy Friday

123
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:16,858
for everyone,

124
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,819
and that happened to us earlier

125
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:20,459
this year.

126
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,519
Week by week and well,

127
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:25,658
a lot of people was involved in that.

128
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:28,928
And um including an infrastructure

129
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:30,399
team and support.

130
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:32,189
And I mention this quote.

131
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,879
The leading sources of technical debt are architectural

132
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,428
choices

133
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:38,220
because it's important to remark

134
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,639
that migration the code to a newer

135
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,879
version of .net

136
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,548
is not the important

137
00:04:44,548 --> 00:04:45,338
issue here.

138
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,250
You need to,

139
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,838
to think broader,

140
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:50,579
to not, uh, derive in a

141
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,369
technical debt that you're going to heritage

142
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:53,959
to your

143
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,000
new employees of your company in the following

144
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,540
years.

145
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,858
Right. So

146
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:04,338
this modernization approach is

147
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,338
something that we

148
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,720
think in our organization

149
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:09,259
because our mission is,

150
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,170
is just

151
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:12,980
experience the joy of improving lives.

152
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,119
And the lives that we are improving

153
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,019
is not just

154
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,619
our customers

155
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,000
or the employees but also

156
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,980
our developers.

157
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,129
So, with this modernization,

158
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:27,730
we could do the both things, right?

159
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,759
One, deliver a better service

160
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,769
to our end users and

161
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,170
also improve the developer experience

162
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,108
for our developers.

163
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,009
What challenges

164
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:43,250
do we have?

165
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:44,608
Well,

166
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:46,069
uh, basically

167
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,838
more than challenges, these are the pillars

168
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:51,410
that we follow in this migration.

169
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:54,439
One is stay customer centric,

170
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,149
right? We need,

171
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:58,629
we needed to meet scalability and

172
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:59,548
performance needs.

173
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,689
Sta the second one stay cost

174
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:04,350
effective

175
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:05,730
and this way.

176
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,869
Uh, we need to reduce the progressional

177
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,410
cost

178
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,069
and simplify the modernization and maintenance

179
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,309
efforts and that, and, and that's related to the,

180
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,730
uh, developer experience.

181
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,100
Also zero downtime

182
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,160
requirements.

183
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,040
This was a crucial

184
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,238
need. Uh, when

185
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:29,869
you migrate, uh,

186
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:32,358
a critical production workload,

187
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,939
yeah, you need to do it with, without

188
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:37,100
disrupting, uh, payroll operations

189
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,379
or customer SLAs.

190
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,028
OK,

191
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:44,809
let me explain

192
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,459
the application context.

193
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:50,189
This is a very good, very Mexican

194
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:50,809
thing

195
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:53,670
because the Mexican government

196
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,009
requires for every payroll,

197
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:57,850
uh, slip

198
00:06:58,379 --> 00:06:59,410
to be notified

199
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:02,149
to the Mexican Tax Administration Service.

200
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:05,528
It's like the IRS but in Mexico.

201
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:08,399
So basically the process

202
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:08,980
begins

203
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,738
when the um payroll

204
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,699
manager

205
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,100
or administrator.

206
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,420
Using our HR management suites,

207
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,548
in this case, we have Systemares on-premises

208
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:22,548
and Revolution as a software

209
00:07:22,548 --> 00:07:23,410
as a service

210
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,869
that it's running on AWS.

211
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,100
They send all the payroll

212
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,178
data through the uh payroll stamping

213
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:35,298
services that we provide to them.

214
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,619
Uh,

215
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:40,559
because, well, we have security guidelines.

216
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:42,660
I'm not allowed to explain you all

217
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,178
the VPCs, all the integration with

218
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:46,209
networking and such,

219
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:49,220
but I tried to, um.

220
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,389
Uh, explain the features that

221
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,769
uh payroll stamping

222
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:54,988
services provide.

223
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:58,838
Then,

224
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,838
after the uh

225
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,949
payroll managers and all the data,

226
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,720
then the employee through the our

227
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,170
self-service HR application.

228
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:11,428
The employees able to download

229
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:12,189
to get

230
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:13,608
the payroll slip

231
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:15,850
and that's.

232
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,278
That's a huge deal for the

233
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:21,350
employees in Mexico and I'm sure here

234
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,608
in the US as well,

235
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,059
but for legal reasons,

236
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:26,608
the

237
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,528
companies are

238
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:31,149
obligated to report those payroll

239
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:31,970
on time.

240
00:08:32,837 --> 00:08:35,008
If that does happens, the uh

241
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:37,239
company could have some legal

242
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,369
issues with

243
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:41,087
with their unions or with their

244
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:41,928
employees directly.

245
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:45,347
So what it works

246
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:47,888
uh that we have here a

247
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:50,067
legacy XML PDF engine

248
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:52,967
that actually generates the the

249
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:55,369
uh PDF of the invoice,

250
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:58,168
right? And we're replacing,

251
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:00,188
we replace this service.

252
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,500
With a, with a lambda service practically

253
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,239
and this lambda has around

254
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,979
2 million requests,

255
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,129
uh,

256
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,099
daily

257
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,479
and some days on peak days

258
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,798
we have up to 4 million of requests.

259
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,599
And

260
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,580
for for

261
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,158
our services this is the most

262
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:21,849
used

263
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,000
endpoints.

264
00:09:23,668 --> 00:09:25,570
In our office infrastructure.

265
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,048
OK. This

266
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,609
is just an overall

267
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,469
view

268
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:35,808
of the monolith architecture. This

269
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,609
is basic and elastic

270
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:39,820
pin stalk, sorry,

271
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,369
containerized application that runs on

272
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:44,769
two availability zones and multiple regions

273
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:45,308
as well.

274
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:48,489
And I don't want to say that uh

275
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,609
Beanstalk is not, is not running well.

276
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:52,308
Actually, it's running phenomenal.

277
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:55,298
But the issues that we have with beanstal is

278
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:56,639
that it doesn't increase.

279
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:58,840
Uh, the, uh,

280
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,379
instances as we expect,

281
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,879
right? It's not has the,

282
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:04,859
the,

283
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:07,658
hasn't the same velocity than a lambda.

284
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:10,889
So,

285
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:13,389
using NWS Transform,

286
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:15,690
what was the art transformation approach?

287
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:19,308
Well, I recommend to

288
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:20,029
be prepared.

289
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,668
And I'm not talking about the product uh

290
00:10:23,668 --> 00:10:25,889
developers or engineers. I'm, I'm talking

291
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:26,889
about your code,

292
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,849
right? The first thing that I

293
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,408
suggest to do is to analyze

294
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,989
which projects are

295
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:35,330
the most

296
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,229
um

297
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,389
or the best candidate to migrate.

298
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,619
You surely need, after that,

299
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,570
after selecting the best project

300
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:47,619
that match your needs to uh of this migration,

301
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,168
you need to organize

302
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:51,090
your legacy projects.

303
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:54,029
Uh, talking about our experience,

304
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:57,330
we had a lot of dependencies,

305
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,379
uh,

306
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,219
talking about new good packages on our

307
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:01,928
solutions,

308
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:04,469
and I would like to ask

309
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:05,269
you something.

310
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,739
Uh, please raise your hand if you are dealing

311
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:10,519
with nougat or packages

312
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:12,038
dependencies issues late.

313
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,038
Yeah, just a few.

314
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,538
Perhaps it was just a house, but

315
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:19,119
um,

316
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,250
yeah,

317
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:21,450
when

318
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,219
our projects we had like 70

319
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,340
new get packages involved, some private

320
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:26,899
and some

321
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:27,940
public,

322
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:30,379
right, and we removed um

323
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:32,840
around 23 unneeded packages.

324
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:35,729
That's normal because developers

325
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,928
actually uh get

326
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:41,129
an add you get packages that they need and

327
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:43,070
with the uh inherited

328
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:44,500
dependencies

329
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:47,109
they uh add multiple

330
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,369
and unneeded naked packages,

331
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,479
right. That's common.

332
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,739
Also just to report that we

333
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:58,558
had more than 135,000

334
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:00,580
lines of code. This is lines of code

335
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,279
of the entire uh

336
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:03,700
um

337
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,038
uh suite, right?

338
00:12:06,469 --> 00:12:08,469
You also need to have your, you do

339
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:09,489
test in order,

340
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:12,178
and if you don't have them, that's OK,

341
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:14,469
you can create it later, but you need to,

342
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:16,908
to have it in mind to compare

343
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:17,849
the before and after.

344
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:22,639
OK, with LBS transform,

345
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,190
we were able to automatically

346
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,548
uh migrate from 46

347
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:29,580
to .NET 8 and

348
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,340
AW transfers helps us to validate

349
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,548
most of the code.

350
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,279
And also the packages were updated.

351
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:40,418
But we need to take care

352
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:42,849
about the less of the 100% of the code.

353
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,200
There was a lot,

354
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,750
that there are not just a few lines,

355
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:49,109
but with the help of

356
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:52,200
ASN Q. Right?

357
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,019
We were able

358
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,700
to do some manual fixes and.

359
00:12:57,558 --> 00:12:59,678
And we can run local and

360
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,678
functional tests

361
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:03,019
with AmazonQ now named

362
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:04,798
well now Quiro,

363
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:07,558
right? we're able to multiply

364
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:09,500
our efforts rapidly

365
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:11,940
to jump onto

366
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,058
uh production,

367
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:18,928
right? After

368
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,989
the adjustment and the

369
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,509
running local application,

370
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,609
of course we needed to build a

371
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:27,879
standalone application. The application would

372
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,269
uh to, to test

373
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,450
the transformation.

374
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:35,369
We enter in a multiple cycles of a factory,

375
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:37,250
right? We move

376
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,969
the packages

377
00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:40,558
to the core artifact,

378
00:13:40,908 --> 00:13:42,908
and I'm, I'm not talking about the new get

379
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:43,590
packages

380
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,979
we decouple our

381
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:47,989
application or our service and

382
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:48,690
multiple,

383
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,609
uh, artifacts

384
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:51,769
to be

385
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:53,450
to not create

386
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,788
a, a micro service

387
00:13:56,788 --> 00:13:57,690
with all

388
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:00,279
the code involved, right?

389
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:01,609
There is not.

390
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,109
I was in a

391
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:04,599
in a session

392
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:06,080
this Monday

393
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:07,859
and and

394
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:11,590
ma'am MAM 402,

395
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,178
there was a cool talk and they

396
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:15,178
mentioned that

397
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,759
you, the thing is not to create

398
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,750
a shared monolith,

399
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:21,950
right, or a distributed monolith,

400
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,500
right? So do you, you need to

401
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,779
think right and decouple your code

402
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:28,899
before migrate to Yolanda.

403
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:32,889
Also, we are able to automate our builds

404
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,158
via CDK and called Pipeline.

405
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,940
And I'm going to go through

406
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,469
our timeline.

407
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:41,889
In a more

408
00:14:44,298 --> 00:14:45,558
Explainable way.

409
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,219
We started this effort in April.

410
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,570
And we were able to transform the code

411
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,389
and do the manual fixes

412
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:56,308
in less than 2 weeks.

413
00:14:57,489 --> 00:14:59,019
They take a little bit long

414
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,070
because we needed to,

415
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,599
to decouple the service correctly, right?

416
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,058
And

417
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,769
During this migration we were able to

418
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:11,759
replace the legacy NG server

419
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,879
to use code artifact CDK

420
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,090
and code pipeline to integrate those.

421
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,460
Then on the run

422
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:26,340
we don't jump directly from elastic

423
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,840
pistol to lambda.

424
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:29,440
We took,

425
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,369
uh, a step with AWS Fargate,

426
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:34,389
right, the microservices.

427
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:36,899
Firstly we tried to run

428
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,500
it on ECS Fargate and ran

429
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,700
some tests.

430
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,190
And it, well, in,

431
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:46,418
and the behavior was OK with uh Fargate,

432
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,548
but

433
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:50,408
we don't have uh we don't want

434
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,048
to.

435
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:53,548
Um, have more

436
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:55,649
things to administrate

437
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:58,190
or more things to do around

438
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,239
UCS Firegate. That's not our, our

439
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,340
traditional model.

440
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,928
We tend to use more lambdas

441
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,349
to, uh, our applications,

442
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,979
so we moved the, the,

443
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:11,058
uh, we removed the continuization

444
00:16:11,058 --> 00:16:11,729
practically

445
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:14,349
and changed the project to not use,

446
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:16,469
um. An image, a docker

447
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:17,330
image for that

448
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:19,428
and uh

449
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,229
and we use um in a sip

450
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:24,798
model right. Uh,

451
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,298
but the most important issue here

452
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:29,178
is to add

453
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,489
X-rate

454
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,099
metrics,

455
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,479
right, uh, cloud watch,

456
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:36,099
and of course

457
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,779
get metrics inside of your

458
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:39,820
running application,

459
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:41,029
running service,

460
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:42,158
because

461
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,000
when you migrate your code,

462
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,979
the environment of, of the operational

463
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:49,200
environment, it's quite, it's

464
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,558
much different, right?

465
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,139
So you need to keep what is

466
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,739
not behaving as you expected.

467
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:59,529
Well this is a high level solution and

468
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:00,700
then simple like that

469
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,808
right it's an

470
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,989
it's a lambda the name is document generator

471
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:07,568
it's almost the same uh

472
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,568
all are the same buckets that

473
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:10,368
we're managing.

474
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,519
Uh, it has their own app database,

475
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:15,499
so we were able to decouple

476
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:16,999
the database as well

477
00:17:17,698 --> 00:17:19,898
and all behaves, uh,

478
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:22,019
integrates well with the payroll stepping

479
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:23,087
service, right?

480
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:24,358
So the,

481
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:27,038
our, uh, self-service

482
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:28,208
application named Mazorden

483
00:17:29,138 --> 00:17:30,048
hasn't to

484
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:32,659
change their endpoints or anything. All

485
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:33,638
it's managed

486
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:34,827
inside

487
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:35,909
this,

488
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:38,327
uh, context, right, of the

489
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:42,219
application. Right,

490
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:44,598
so what were the benefits of this

491
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:45,578
migration?

492
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:47,828
Firstly,

493
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,469
we could do this in a rapid way.

494
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:51,930
Uh,

495
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:54,529
when I started the conversation with you,

496
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:57,130
I said that the product teams were really

497
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:57,719
busy,

498
00:17:58,088 --> 00:18:00,239
so we have to help on

499
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:02,549
that as an architecture and

500
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,769
enabling team.

501
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:06,910
We don't use to invest the time

502
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,130
on developing new things, right? We,

503
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,250
uh, we help the teams to

504
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,170
design, to organize, to,

505
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:14,568
uh, training them,

506
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:17,358
but we were help,

507
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:19,739
uh, we were able to help with this

508
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:20,630
migration,

509
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:23,809
so we calculate almost 70%

510
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:26,068
of reduction in that human

511
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:27,630
hours, right.

512
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,489
We saved

513
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,959
like 2 months of the team on manual

514
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,779
code testing and validation.

515
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:36,709
This, this is was not just migrating

516
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:37,479
the code, right?

517
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,250
We needed to also generate new

518
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:40,890
tests,

519
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,049
uh, new integration test,

520
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:44,289
and,

521
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,650
and, and such, right.

522
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,259
Another thing was the strategic refactoring.

523
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,299
The team was focused on value

524
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,539
driving refactoring rather than tedious

525
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:56,318
metal work

526
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:59,098
and Not

527
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:01,170
that I'm not saying that

528
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,299
we because we have the time we invest the

529
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:04,939
time in in architecture.

530
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,479
No it's the other way

531
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,479
we because with this product

532
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,199
we were able

533
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,818
to not just react to the problem

534
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:14,608
that we had.

535
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:17,618
Um, rapidly do the migration manually

536
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:19,549
and, and then go to production. No,

537
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,039
we were able to think this browser

538
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:24,189
and decouple all the monolith

539
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:26,779
for further migrations, not

540
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:28,779
just the document generation that

541
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:29,459
I explained.

542
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,769
Also cost savings.

543
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,578
We were able to reduce the infrastructure

544
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:38,779
cost by over 40%

545
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:40,979
using graviton-based lambdas.

546
00:19:43,338 --> 00:19:44,338
So

547
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:46,848
we. What I'm trying to

548
00:19:46,848 --> 00:19:48,858
say is that we were not just

549
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:50,979
going through the basic lambda

550
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:51,759
configuration.

551
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,640
In this case, the AWS AWS,

552
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:55,719
sorry, Mexico,

553
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:57,670
uh, architects team

554
00:19:58,098 --> 00:19:59,160
helped us to go farther.

555
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,618
They, they say, hey, you can go graviton

556
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,640
directly and our packages.

557
00:20:04,608 --> 00:20:07,439
That we are using to generate PDFs

558
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:10,338
are well tested on Windows environments.

559
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,539
So we were worrying about not

560
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:13,739
having the same results.

561
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:16,140
So with Amazon Q,

562
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:17,900
we,

563
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,338
we generate a uh more

564
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:22,578
than a couple of Python scripts

565
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:25,358
that automatically help us to validate

566
00:20:25,618 --> 00:20:26,459
A B tests,

567
00:20:26,729 --> 00:20:28,750
right? So

568
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:31,059
So in the run,

569
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,039
Uh,

570
00:20:34,578 --> 00:20:36,838
we, we also eliminate

571
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:38,660
the Windows licensing costs.

572
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,828
That's an indirect cost that we have

573
00:20:41,828 --> 00:20:43,049
on, on,

574
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:44,939
on beanstalk, right?

575
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,709
But so that's something

576
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:48,989
that was good for us.

577
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:50,809
Elasticity

578
00:20:52,939 --> 00:20:53,779
Uh,

579
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:56,000
in, on average, we have

580
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,979
11.3 million

581
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:01,180
of payroll documents processed

582
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:01,739
daily.

583
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:04,578
Um, we don't

584
00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:06,618
have an issue with that, with the lambda

585
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:07,239
right now.

586
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,500
Serial manner scaling.

587
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,759
Of course we were not doing

588
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:15,078
manual scaling and be install, but

589
00:21:15,078 --> 00:21:17,199
we had to be aware of

590
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,479
what's happening on the peak days. And

591
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,118
then infrastructure team,

592
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,118
uh, did some changes on it.

593
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,039
So

594
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,868
that's something that we don't need to be careful

595
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,838
for now with our landda, of

596
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:32,420
course you need to follow the metrics

597
00:21:32,598 --> 00:21:34,640
and, and, and, and

598
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,180
perhaps,

599
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,239
uh,

600
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,618
you can do some,

601
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:38,880
uh.

602
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:41,719
Um, changes in your lambda

603
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,838
to in case you, your

604
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:45,838
demand increase, right? But for now,

605
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,959
we are calculating that with the

606
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:49,559
lambda, we're OK.

607
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,439
Then we had 0 downtime during payroll

608
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:54,098
spikes.

609
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,338
This is just an example of what we

610
00:21:57,338 --> 00:21:59,459
uh had running the uh

611
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,318
the AB testings

612
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,358
uh earlier this year.

613
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,680
And as you can see

614
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:07,430
we have the

615
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:09,088
duration

616
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:12,088
between half of a

617
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:14,150
second. Um,

618
00:22:14,588 --> 00:22:15,890
during the peak,

619
00:22:16,229 --> 00:22:17,529
uh, invocations,

620
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:19,608
the lambda still has

621
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:21,449
better results than

622
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,640
the invocations are low,

623
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,118
so. That's,

624
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,269
that's that wasn't good for us.

625
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,299
Lesson learned.

626
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,000
Well, I'm going to try

627
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,828
to summarize this really quickly,

628
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:39,269
as I said before.

629
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,598
Uh, you have, if you have a

630
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:43,380
running

631
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:44,939
legacy application.

632
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:47,848
You have the privilege to compare

633
00:22:47,848 --> 00:22:48,750
with the new version,

634
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,489
right? And in case

635
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:53,449
you can run a task

636
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:54,989
more than once

637
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,529
like. We do with the payroll

638
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:59,650
slip. Right, you can

639
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,719
compare the results of

640
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:04,108
your legacy versus the new version,

641
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:07,299
so. That

642
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:09,739
when I talk about the uh Python scripts

643
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:12,160
that compare the PDFs basically

644
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,519
we did it on production

645
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,640
right we um.

646
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:19,630
We deploy this.

647
00:23:20,578 --> 00:23:22,818
Uh, at the same time we were

648
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,939
delivering the PDF that we built in

649
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:25,509
Beanstalk

650
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:27,719
and at the back end we were having

651
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,078
the lambda

652
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,180
generated.

653
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:34,430
Version so we were able to compare

654
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:35,750
the uh

655
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,209
the SA by pixel by pixel

656
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,729
and text by text.

657
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,108
So in that way,

658
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:42,868
we were confident

659
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,170
that we can switch.

660
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:47,338
Gradually with a canary release,

661
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,299
uh,

662
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,539
uh, the new version

663
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:52,479
so if you are in that case, I

664
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:54,618
recommend. To do

665
00:23:54,618 --> 00:23:56,699
this in case your

666
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:58,078
process cannot be executed

667
00:23:58,578 --> 00:23:59,680
more than once,

668
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,618
of course, you can go canary always and,

669
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,818
and select your start users as well, so.

670
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:06,509
Otherwise

671
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,618
There is a win on this.

672
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,160
The other other thing that we learned.

673
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:13,759
In a sense,

674
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:15,229
is to adapt.

675
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:18,479
Modernization is not just code migration.

676
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:21,578
So, don't expect to just

677
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:24,049
transform and be on the other side

678
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:25,358
the next day,

679
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:27,039
right? But

680
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,029
also.

681
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:31,979
You need to be aware if you're going to migrate

682
00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:34,098
your application with the help of Qiro.

683
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:36,068
Uh, to lambda

684
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,630
You need to be aware of of call

685
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,269
starts, provision concurrency, snapstart,

686
00:24:41,348 --> 00:24:43,328
and package sites optimizations

687
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,750
because you're going to migrate something

688
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,989
that was running on a monolith and and

689
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:49,368
works perfectly because

690
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,250
all your singletons, your, your connections

691
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,739
are well oiled in

692
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:56,630
the in the production environment,

693
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,219
not with the lambda. With the lambda you need

694
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:01,660
to be aware of your connection pools,

695
00:25:01,989 --> 00:25:03,729
your memory setups,

696
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,368
and your connection with.

697
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,529
Other services, right?

698
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:11,009
So, Uh, in

699
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,358
case your, your internal

700
00:25:13,358 --> 00:25:14,670
developer say something that

701
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,568
is with being installed was faster

702
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,719
than lambda,

703
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,029
don't hesitate

704
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:23,239
and procure this in this,

705
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,289
uh. Uh,

706
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:27,640
this Probably

707
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,900
issues with cold stars

708
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:31,459
and just to have a question that I want

709
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:32,118
to ask you.

710
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,479
I don't know if you have many have issues with

711
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:36,088
cold stars or time slander.

712
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,529
Yeah, that.

713
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:44,039
Do be aware of that if you are migrating

714
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:44,568
from data

715
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,868
automation we achieve, uh,

716
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,959
fully automated validation that I

717
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:51,519
mentioned before, the patent scripts

718
00:25:51,838 --> 00:25:54,318
and other kind of spreads with uh

719
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:55,459
J reader as well.

720
00:25:56,358 --> 00:25:57,880
To do uh

721
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:00,699
um critical benchmarking tests.

722
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:05,559
Right. So

723
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,219
now let's get technical.

724
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:09,500
Back to you, David. Thank you.

725
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:16,559
That Thank

726
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,680
you very much Hernando. Thank you for sharing with

727
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,719
us your uh case. It's

728
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:22,719
pretty amazing what you have achieved in this

729
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:25,078
time. Also, if you have any

730
00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:27,598
questions, you can approach to the Groupres

731
00:26:27,598 --> 00:26:30,039
team that is here by the end of this session

732
00:26:30,318 --> 00:26:32,539
so you can discuss it, uh, further.

733
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:35,670
Now let's get into the AWS

734
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,670
Transformer and how it works.

735
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Why to modernize your applications?

736
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,199
That's a pretty simple question. You may

737
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:46,199
already know the answer,

738
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,959
but there are a lot of factors in

739
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:51,078
here. For example, Armando

740
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:53,019
mentioned we improved, uh,

741
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,358
uh, for example, response times of the

742
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:57,439
services we moved from elastic

743
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,039
beanstock

744
00:26:58,439 --> 00:26:59,670
to lambdas.

745
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:02,318
So from there we can deduce

746
00:27:02,318 --> 00:27:04,479
that we are gonna have

747
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,858
some cost optimizations.

748
00:27:06,318 --> 00:27:08,358
We will, uh, as you can

749
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:10,338
see the performance improvements.

750
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,160
And also the scalability

751
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,838
having lambda for example instead of a monolith

752
00:27:15,838 --> 00:27:18,239
will allow uh the teams to actually

753
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:20,439
have more manageability and

754
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,660
also more scalability in terms

755
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,759
of what they are doing and what they are

756
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,880
prospecting in terms of

757
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,199
uh application growth.

758
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:31,568
Something interesting that Armando mentioned

759
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,588
is that the service, the AWS transform

760
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:35,588
service moves the monolith

761
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,108
to actual uh microservices

762
00:27:38,108 --> 00:27:38,729
in.

763
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,209
Uh, containers

764
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,680
you can deploy, for example, to transform

765
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,779
code to EC2 with

766
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:47,219
Linux or ECS Fargate,

767
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,680
but uh what Arman Armando did

768
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,660
and the team did

769
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,519
was to actually migrate

770
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,519
directly to a serverless architecture,

771
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,759
and that's possible and that's

772
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,759
something that maybe you don't see

773
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:02,039
in AWS transform right now but

774
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,118
with the integration of Qiro

775
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:04,920
and other.

776
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,779
Tools, it is actually possible

777
00:28:08,108 --> 00:28:10,108
and it took a group of res 2 weeks

778
00:28:10,108 --> 00:28:12,229
to actually reach this stage

779
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:13,068
of maturity.

780
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,578
So porting uh to cross-platform.net,

781
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:20,739
it's hard and it's slow and you already

782
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:21,259
know that

783
00:28:21,578 --> 00:28:23,029
that's why you are here, right?

784
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,858
And also

785
00:28:25,348 --> 00:28:26,939
the AWS transform service.

786
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:29,049
We'll take your code.

787
00:28:29,348 --> 00:28:31,549
So as you can imagine, everything is gentic

788
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:32,430
now, so.

789
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,868
AWS transform is iggenic.

790
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:37,789
Now this week it was launched the

791
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:39,828
uh next uh generation of

792
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:41,858
AWS transform that will allow you

793
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:42,549
to have

794
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:45,189
multi-agent capacity. What does

795
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:45,969
this mean?

796
00:28:46,469 --> 00:28:48,568
You're gonna be able to actually

797
00:28:48,838 --> 00:28:50,989
drive at the uh modernization

798
00:28:50,989 --> 00:28:52,368
process the way you like it.

799
00:28:52,868 --> 00:28:55,338
So through this agent that it

800
00:28:55,338 --> 00:28:56,578
was released this week

801
00:28:56,979 --> 00:28:59,019
you are able to actually drive the

802
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:01,348
process of modernization maybe if you are

803
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,029
looking toward um

804
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,900
changing the architecture of your services

805
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,900
and only porting the code to this new

806
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,900
architecture you're gonna be able to do

807
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,259
so instead of uh actually

808
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,699
depending entirely on the agent capacities

809
00:29:14,699 --> 00:29:15,739
to design this plan

810
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:17,739
so this is a huge improvement

811
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:20,078
compared to what we had in the past.

812
00:29:21,318 --> 00:29:23,578
Also detecting incompatibilities

813
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:25,799
as Armando mentioned before, uh, they

814
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,019
were able to

815
00:29:27,318 --> 00:29:29,750
clean their coat and they found that

816
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,289
23 dependencies

817
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,059
were just they're hanging around.

818
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,650
They just removed them

819
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:38,160
and the code actually

820
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,930
became cleaner.

821
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,979
Then we port the code.

822
00:29:42,318 --> 00:29:44,439
The transform agent, after analyzing and

823
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:46,559
detecting incompatibilities, is

824
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,739
going to design a modernization plan

825
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:50,209
and what's going on here?

826
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,000
So the uh agent is going to

827
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,078
design a plan based on your source code

828
00:29:55,078 --> 00:29:56,699
and projects that you want to migrate.

829
00:29:57,549 --> 00:29:59,868
As humans we need to validate that

830
00:29:59,868 --> 00:30:02,009
process, so we need to be involved in

831
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,299
this validation stage of this

832
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:05,509
modernization plan.

833
00:30:06,969 --> 00:30:09,289
After having the modernization plan and porting

834
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:09,848
the code,

835
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,209
we are gonna be able to deploy directly

836
00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:15,618
to ECS Fargate or EC2

837
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:16,489
with Linux,

838
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:18,009
and, well,

839
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,608
in this case, uh, it was, um,

840
00:30:20,689 --> 00:30:22,890
very manual labor as Armando mentioned. They

841
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,289
would take like months to

842
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,650
do what they do in, uh, a couple

843
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,269
of weeks.

844
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:32,118
And uh a lot of stuff going around

845
00:30:32,118 --> 00:30:34,239
in terms of how teams

846
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:36,838
will manage the uh migrated

847
00:30:36,838 --> 00:30:37,529
services.

848
00:30:38,068 --> 00:30:40,078
So what we are looking uh here

849
00:30:40,078 --> 00:30:40,660
it's

850
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:42,979
how long projects can be shorter.

851
00:30:43,828 --> 00:30:45,809
How licensing costs can be cut

852
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:48,709
and also suboptimal and net porting

853
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:49,328
quality,

854
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:51,949
so the transformation process is not

855
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:53,568
porting the code only,

856
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:56,108
it's going to find uh

857
00:30:56,108 --> 00:30:58,328
fixes that can be made within your code

858
00:30:58,469 --> 00:31:00,670
and it's going to recommend a code that

859
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,269
has

860
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:03,750
improvements in terms of quality of

861
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,189
the code that is being imported

862
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:07,469
and also a quality in

863
00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:09,289
terms of security.

864
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:11,430
So this is very important to have in mind.

865
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:14,959
And uh well this is the

866
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:17,358
introduction to AWS Transform for .NET

867
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,368
that has two experiences the ID

868
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:22,828
that is the one that we are gonna

869
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:23,500
show you

870
00:31:24,108 --> 00:31:26,489
today and also the web ID

871
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:28,789
both behave similarly in

872
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:31,150
terms of functionality and the agents

873
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,769
that are behind the service,

874
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:35,348
but, uh, you need, for example, in

875
00:31:35,348 --> 00:31:37,868
the case of the uh.net porting

876
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:40,068
into the ID that is the second picture

877
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:42,209
here. The integration with

878
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:44,289
the AWS toolkit from there you

879
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:46,809
can grab the AWS transform component

880
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:48,769
and start uh your modernization.

881
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,868
In terms of the web

882
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,150
interface, you just need to connect your source

883
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,769
code that could be

884
00:31:56,229 --> 00:31:58,358
a place, for example, in Azure

885
00:31:58,358 --> 00:32:00,750
DeBop, GitHub, Gitlab, or Bitbucket,

886
00:32:00,828 --> 00:32:02,068
such as in the case of

887
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,229
Group of trace.

888
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,039
And once we have that,

889
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,750
we have connected our code, we have integrated

890
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,640
Visual Studio,

891
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:11,939
we can start the process.

892
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,118
Of analyzing the code base,

893
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,160
so what's going to happen here?

894
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,539
These agents are going to index your

895
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,618
code, are going to process

896
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:23,519
uh this part.

897
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,920
The code is being moved to

898
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,318
AWS processing to actually

899
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:31,539
understand what's uh your code, how it

900
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:33,739
behaves, the dependencies it has.

901
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:36,608
And once we have completed this part.

902
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,568
Here came the,

903
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:40,890
here comes the transformation process.

904
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,328
The transformation process, again, it really depends

905
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,729
on a transformation plan.

906
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,049
And once we have this transformation plan, we

907
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,088
can iterate here, and this is something

908
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:52,118
new you can interact with the agent

909
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:53,189
to

910
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:54,328
actually

911
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,568
drive the transformation process.

912
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,618
And finally, the validation, the human

913
00:32:59,618 --> 00:33:01,489
interloop part of every single

914
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,868
agentic solution.

915
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:06,078
What's the purpose here and this is,

916
00:33:06,088 --> 00:33:08,279
uh, like the whole that this,

917
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:08,848
um,

918
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,368
this slide presents is how we can

919
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:13,469
take this .NET framework

920
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:13,979
applications

921
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:15,509
to the new

922
00:33:15,818 --> 00:33:17,939
Linux.NET 8 applications

923
00:33:17,939 --> 00:33:19,568
and now uh .NET 10.

924
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,170
This is a more deep dive, uh,

925
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,269
a component that I want to highlight here is

926
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:26,949
this part,

927
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,410
the dependencies.

928
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:32,670
For example, the analysis process is

929
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,750
a little bit more complex within the

930
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,289
service.

931
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,949
It really requires to analyze

932
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,769
code for incompatibilities.

933
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:42,630
Identified a generates a

934
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,229
replacement code that is going to substitute

935
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:47,209
uh your actual code

936
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:50,309
AWS transform once the transformation

937
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:52,650
is completed, is going to push

938
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,670
this transform code into a

939
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,650
version system.

940
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,979
It will use the version system

941
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:00,989
you connected to and

942
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:03,578
once again you need to generate a branch

943
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,680
to

944
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:07,299
so can the transformation

945
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:09,438
process can deposit code into that

946
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:10,250
uh branch

947
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:12,739
so we can have a full control

948
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,739
of how the ported code

949
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:15,789
is going to

950
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:17,159
going to be placed.

951
00:34:18,628 --> 00:34:20,909
And here are two dependencies. If you

952
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:23,260
develop your nuggets yourself, you can,

953
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,648
uh, share those

954
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,829
with a double transform service so you can uh

955
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:30,179
reach this uh dependency management

956
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,188
controls. If no nuggets are

957
00:34:32,188 --> 00:34:34,389
provided or if the service does not

958
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:36,570
find in their in its knowledge base

959
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:39,099
those uh nugget uh packages,

960
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,510
the service is going to try to do

961
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,168
the best

962
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,849
to actually

963
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,969
understand what those packages are doing,

964
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:49,918
so. Once we have done this,

965
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:52,579
we apply code modifications. We can verify

966
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:54,579
the code. It's something that didn't

967
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,617
go as expected. We can get

968
00:34:56,617 --> 00:34:58,018
back and try again.

969
00:34:58,498 --> 00:35:00,498
So this is a process that

970
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,539
it's usually led by,

971
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:05,259
by the developer or the architecture

972
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:08,619
team. Now,

973
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:11,878
this slide is regarding

974
00:35:11,878 --> 00:35:14,019
the .NET transformation for .NET

975
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:14,539
framework.

976
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:17,829
It also will transform this

977
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:20,389
MVC Razor interfaces.

978
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,789
We have web forms to blazer

979
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:23,530
integration

980
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,239
and also take cross-platform .NET

981
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:27,829
8 and .NET 10.

982
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,469
So there are a couple of targets

983
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:32,469
more for this, uh, transformation that

984
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:34,269
it's going to help us,

985
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:37,389
uh, build modern .NET architectures.

986
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:40,530
And also er the

987
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,969
previous projects that it's wind farms and

988
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,469
Windows presentation

989
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:46,909
er for desktop projects, uh

990
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:48,409
hammering, for example,

991
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,429
and er everything else

992
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,789
here. For large

993
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:54,909
scale modernization you can take

994
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:57,228
uh several projects uh at one

995
00:35:57,228 --> 00:35:59,389
single shot or you can choose

996
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:01,329
between all those uh.net projects

997
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,050
to start developing and transforming

998
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,409
one by one or

999
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,829
uh take or grab all

1000
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:10,188
of your code base and start transforming

1001
00:36:10,188 --> 00:36:15,168
from there. Now,

1002
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:17,510
the NBC race part that

1003
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,628
is uh pretty interesting uh Costa has

1004
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:21,628
been asking a lot for this one,

1005
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:24,030
it's going to take and transform your

1006
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,590
code and port it to

1007
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,110
ASP.NET core.

1008
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,769
And also um

1009
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,250
Apple Store and just transformation that it's

1010
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,958
supported as well and it's below here,

1011
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,148
that it's going to take your word forms,

1012
00:36:37,409 --> 00:36:39,648
and it's going to transform into

1013
00:36:39,648 --> 00:36:41,860
player. So, uh, this one's

1014
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,769
pretty new as well.

1015
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,820
And how does it look like?

1016
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,340
Here? Tiago is going

1017
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,820
to share with us a demonstration

1018
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,039
on how this works

1019
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,780
and how to integrate into ID

1020
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,000
to AWS transform components.

1021
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:01,599
And before diving deep, er, this is just

1022
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,719
a reminder of the connections for

1023
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:06,228
code. You can connect

1024
00:37:06,228 --> 00:37:08,398
GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Azure

1025
00:37:08,398 --> 00:37:10,728
Repos, and also Amazon

1026
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,889
S3 code for analysis.

1027
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,469
If you don't want to actually connect your,

1028
00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:17,969
uh, source code repositories, you can

1029
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,349
uh share them using,

1030
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:20,889
uh, Amazon S3.

1031
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,360
Also, the view assessment, this is a summary

1032
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,059
report that you're gonna be able to see

1033
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,340
when the transformation process is complete,

1034
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,280
and also you will be able to provide

1035
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,030
once I get the you get packages.

1036
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:35,639
This could be developed internally

1037
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,639
or this could be uh from

1038
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,418
third parties.

1039
00:37:41,949 --> 00:37:43,989
Now, here, the console experience is

1040
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:44,820
pretty the same,

1041
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:47,228
but uh in this case, uh

1042
00:37:47,228 --> 00:37:49,309
we are gonna have a full support

1043
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,469
of an agent and a chat console

1044
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,829
that you're gonna be able to interact

1045
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:55,869
with. What's the advantage of this part?

1046
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,780
Having uh the capacity

1047
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,019
to actually drive the modernization

1048
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:03,780
efforts to a certain architecture

1049
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,719
to a certain

1050
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:07,139
way of uh coding that you have

1051
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:09,179
in your companies is crucial

1052
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:11,539
for uh driving the modernization

1053
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,719
efforts you are paying attention to

1054
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,378
and this is uh very important and

1055
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:17,320
we are gonna be

1056
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:19,398
reviewing this as well.

1057
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,269
This is the integration.

1058
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,688
Kiro is going to help us as Armando already

1059
00:38:25,688 --> 00:38:27,719
mentioned. They use Quiro at the last

1060
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,030
stages. So what's the recommendation here?

1061
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,769
Start with AWS Transform. Once

1062
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,030
you have ported your code to

1063
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,250
.NET 8 or .NET 10,

1064
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,769
use Quiro to actually

1065
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:42,090
improve code, make fixes

1066
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,289
or or ports to lambda, for

1067
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,648
example, which was

1068
00:38:46,168 --> 00:38:47,010
what, uh, Grupores did.

1069
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,228
And, well, the SQL Server transformation,

1070
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,760
maybe you are wondering uh what happens

1071
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,688
to the databases.

1072
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:00,128
Well, this is uh pretty straightforward. We

1073
00:39:00,128 --> 00:39:02,250
can also support uh databases

1074
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:05,449
including SQL Server and manage dependencies

1075
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:06,309
within your code.

1076
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:08,969
How do we do that?

1077
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:12,898
Here is the part before and after

1078
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:13,840
the transformation.

1079
00:39:14,128 --> 00:39:15,159
So this is a

1080
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:18,000
uh transform full stack windows

1081
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:20,378
and you will have everything here

1082
00:39:20,378 --> 00:39:22,139
starting from your application,

1083
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:24,000
your database layer,

1084
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,458
and your virtual machine running

1085
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:27,739
on Windows server.

1086
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:30,530
The intention of this part of AWS

1087
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,188
transform

1088
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:33,659
is to actually modernize the

1089
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:34,300
full stack.

1090
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,898
Not just uh leave it with uh

1091
00:39:36,898 --> 00:39:38,918
application transformation. You can focus on that

1092
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,958
as well if you want to keep your databases,

1093
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:42,110
but if you are

1094
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:44,219
managing to migrate

1095
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:45,780
everything to Linux,

1096
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,510
this is the way to go.

1097
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:48,530
So

1098
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,019
the target is to have a cross-platformNT

1099
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,438
application, run your, uh, databases

1100
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:55,809
in AuroraPostress,

1101
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:58,639
and also having, uh, the infrastructure

1102
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,898
components regarding ECS and

1103
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:01,500
EC2

1104
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:02,780
with Linux.

1105
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,349
So

1106
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:07,829
Let's get to the demo.

1107
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:10,349
Thank you, Tiago.

1108
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:11,699
Thank you, David.

1109
00:40:16,398 --> 00:40:17,039
Good morning.

1110
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:20,550
What a great achievement Gruppores

1111
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,168
did with uh modernization of

1112
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:24,188
their application.

1113
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:25,349
And today

1114
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:27,659
I will demonstrate how you

1115
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,320
can achieve the same.

1116
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:31,019
My name is Chago Gonzalez.

1117
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,500
I'm a solutions architect in AWS

1118
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,139
and for the past 20 years, I

1119
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:38,139
have, I have been developing and

1120
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:39,840
modernizing applications.

1121
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:45,978
Yes. So

1122
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:46,898
when we,

1123
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,340
when we talk about uh AWS

1124
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,619
transform, as David

1125
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:52,159
mentioned,

1126
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:54,820
we have two options. One is the web

1127
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,478
experience.

1128
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:56,679
If you are

1129
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,019
in a devs teams and you want to

1130
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:01,000
modernize

1131
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,688
applications in batch,

1132
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:06,260
you will use the web

1133
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:06,878
experience.

1134
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,728
But if you are a developer and you want

1135
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:12,110
to modernize one application at a time,

1136
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:13,760
you will use.

1137
00:41:14,188 --> 00:41:16,188
Um, the ID version of

1138
00:41:16,188 --> 00:41:17,389
AWS transform.

1139
00:41:17,869 --> 00:41:19,228
So what I have in here.

1140
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:21,969
It's the Vizo Studio,

1141
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,599
it's the ID for .NET

1142
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:25,559
application development,

1143
00:41:26,139 --> 00:41:28,619
and if you want to modernize your

1144
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,090
application, using AWS Transform,

1145
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:32,438
the first step

1146
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,878
is to install.

1147
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:37,110
The AWS took it,

1148
00:41:37,398 --> 00:41:39,039
so you are going to extension.

1149
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,179
And search for AWS 2 kit with

1150
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:42,849
Amazon Kill,

1151
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:45,458
and this is the first step. You need

1152
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:47,780
to have the extension installed

1153
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,039
in Visual Studio ID.

1154
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:55,000
With the

1155
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,599
the plug-in, the station installed.

1156
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,128
You will have the option to enable

1157
00:42:03,128 --> 00:42:05,179
AWS transform in IDE, and we

1158
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:07,219
have a few options in here. If you

1159
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:09,250
want to use only AWS Transform,

1160
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,280
you can choose

1161
00:42:10,938 --> 00:42:11,898
the first option,

1162
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,228
the option in the right side,

1163
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:16,969
and we have the Amazon Q developer,

1164
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:19,519
which now is the Quiro subscription

1165
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:21,938
where you have the AWS transform and

1166
00:42:21,938 --> 00:42:22,478
plusative AI

1167
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,500
options to help you modernize

1168
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,199
your application.

1169
00:42:27,668 --> 00:42:29,918
So in this case for this demonstration, I will

1170
00:42:29,918 --> 00:42:32,280
use the Amazon Kill developer subscription.

1171
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:35,269
OK,

1172
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:38,809
With the extension.

1173
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:40,989
Enabled

1174
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:42,829
in Visual Studio.

1175
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,989
In the right side

1176
00:42:47,978 --> 00:42:50,760
I have one solution here. It's a .NET

1177
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,958
application. In here, I

1178
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:55,780
have a project with .NET framework.

1179
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:01,530
We can see here that it's the

1180
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,030
version .NET framework

1181
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:04,489
4.7.

1182
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:07,869
And as we know,

1183
00:43:08,648 --> 00:43:10,969
the .NET framework is no longer

1184
00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:13,168
supported by Microsoft, and what I want to

1185
00:43:13,168 --> 00:43:15,688
achieve is to modernize this

1186
00:43:15,688 --> 00:43:16,969
application to .NET Core

1187
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:18,250
version 8.

1188
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:21,320
So how can I accomplish this?

1189
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:24,878
In the Solution Explorer,

1190
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:27,340
I right click in the solution,

1191
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,050
and I have this option, Port solution

1192
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,530
with AWS Transform.

1193
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,188
Thank you.

1194
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:35,369
And will ask me

1195
00:43:36,148 --> 00:43:37,208
what is the target

1196
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:39,628
right now. We only support .NET

1197
00:43:39,628 --> 00:43:41,688
8, but soon we will support

1198
00:43:41,688 --> 00:43:43,050
.NET 10 as well.

1199
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:50,039
And I will start the job transformation.

1200
00:43:54,418 --> 00:43:57,250
No. So

1201
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,369
as we can see here,

1202
00:43:58,869 --> 00:43:59,590
the first thing,

1203
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,329
your application needs to be in a state of

1204
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:03,349
build, otherwise,

1205
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,809
the transformation job will not start.

1206
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:18,300
OK, now my, my application. er

1207
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:20,239
Is building

1208
00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:22,579
and what is going to happen right

1209
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:24,938
now. The AWS transform

1210
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:27,570
will package all your source, source

1211
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,599
code, the package required to your

1212
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:30,628
application to execute,

1213
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,168
and this source code will be sent

1214
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:35,989
to uh AWS account, a sandbox.

1215
00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:38,188
Uh, it will create a um

1216
00:44:38,728 --> 00:44:40,969
a security connection with an AWS

1217
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,969
account. It will send your search

1218
00:44:42,969 --> 00:44:43,610
code there.

1219
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:46,239
And the transformation happens

1220
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:47,719
in AWS account.

1221
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,019
The transformation job doesn't

1222
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:52,519
happen in your local computer.

1223
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,829
So right now nothing changes in

1224
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:55,599
your solution.

1225
00:44:57,148 --> 00:44:59,159
So the search the search code will

1226
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:00,539
be analyzed

1227
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,079
and transformed in

1228
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:04,280
an AWS account.

1229
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:07,110
And this process, it will take,

1230
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:08,590
this is a small solution,

1231
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:11,010
and this process, it will take like

1232
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,500
15 to 20 minutes,

1233
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:15,039
so I will not wait until the transformation

1234
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:17,369
job. It's

1235
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:19,570
done. I have one solution in here

1236
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,869
that I already did this transformation.

1237
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:25,639
And

1238
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:27,458
when your source code

1239
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,938
is transformed, when the job is done,

1240
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:33,250
You will get the response in

1241
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:35,110
the ID.

1242
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:37,969
And this is how it looks like.

1243
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:42,148
So in here, I have a summary of what

1244
00:45:42,148 --> 00:45:43,429
has changed,

1245
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,610
the projects that I have,

1246
00:45:46,148 --> 00:45:46,829
in the,

1247
00:45:47,168 --> 00:45:49,188
in this uh part in here,

1248
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,489
uh, in the bottom of the screen,

1249
00:45:51,869 --> 00:45:52,668
I can see.

1250
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:55,519
That new files was added

1251
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:56,409
in my solution.

1252
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:58,739
So before I had

1253
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,159
uh a web config in .NET Core.

1254
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,239
I no longer need a web config.

1255
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,628
Now I have app settings.

1256
00:46:05,918 --> 00:46:08,099
So the AWS transform

1257
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:10,829
automatically added the files that

1258
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:11,769
was missing

1259
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,648
for .NET Core

1260
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:17,898
application. So

1261
00:46:17,898 --> 00:46:19,938
all new files that I need to

1262
00:46:19,938 --> 00:46:22,099
have this application running on .NET

1263
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:23,820
car is now available.

1264
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:26,579
And files that are no longer

1265
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,659
needed like Global ASA and other

1266
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:30,369
files that are no longer in need,

1267
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,398
the files was renamed.

1268
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:36,010
And I can see there is some change

1269
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,139
in my search code, and I can see the

1270
00:46:38,139 --> 00:46:38,688
change

1271
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:42,269
that was done in my search

1272
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:46,030
code. So

1273
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,438
in here I can see uh some

1274
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,269
half phrases

1275
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,809
was replaced and some small

1276
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,829
changes was done in my source

1277
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:57,378
code. There

1278
00:46:57,378 --> 00:46:59,469
is a charge. And I

1279
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:00,409
can download

1280
00:47:00,668 --> 00:47:03,228
the summary of everything that was

1281
00:47:03,228 --> 00:47:04,378
changed in my application

1282
00:47:05,228 --> 00:47:05,949
and see.

1283
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:09,489
Um, all the changes

1284
00:47:09,949 --> 00:47:12,369
and the packages that uh

1285
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:14,949
is changed or needs some

1286
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:17,099
attention. So in the left side,

1287
00:47:17,188 --> 00:47:18,668
I have this Linux,

1288
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,519
um, redness.

1289
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:24,148
which demonstrate for this transformation.

1290
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:27,469
The job was not able to

1291
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,469
replace entity framework to entity

1292
00:47:29,469 --> 00:47:30,628
framework core,

1293
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:33,148
so this is something that I need to

1294
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:35,889
To change manually if I want to

1295
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:38,099
make this application running or

1296
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:39,889
to execute on .NET Core.

1297
00:47:40,168 --> 00:47:42,539
So with this report, I have an overview

1298
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:44,648
of everything that was done in my

1299
00:47:44,648 --> 00:47:49,510
solution. So

1300
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,628
as I said, right now, nothing

1301
00:47:51,628 --> 00:47:53,228
has changed in my solution.

1302
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,780
So if I want to apply the chains that

1303
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,789
the job did in my source

1304
00:47:57,789 --> 00:48:00,188
code, I need to select all the chains.

1305
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:02,539
And apply the chains.

1306
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,360
And since the project file was changed,

1307
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,739
it's asking to reload the

1308
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:19,519
solution. Now

1309
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:22,000
I have, I have all the changes applied

1310
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,938
in my solution. In the right side,

1311
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:26,688
I can see now that I have the app settings,

1312
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,539
the startup CS,

1313
00:48:29,438 --> 00:48:31,438
program CS, all the new files required

1314
00:48:31,438 --> 00:48:33,559
to have this application running, uh, to

1315
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:34,780
run in .NET Core.

1316
00:48:35,489 --> 00:48:36,590
If I look in here,

1317
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,070
The framework now is .NET 8,

1318
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:50,510
so all the changes required to

1319
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,688
this application to execute on .NET

1320
00:48:52,688 --> 00:48:53,489
on .NET.

1321
00:48:54,938 --> 00:48:55,559
8,

1322
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,360
it's done now.

1323
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,030
OK, this is the first step.

1324
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:05,530
What about the changes that I mentioned that

1325
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,648
I need to replace manually? OK,

1326
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:08,648
my application,

1327
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:11,489
now it's ready to work on .NET

1328
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,750
.NET 8.

1329
00:49:15,918 --> 00:49:18,039
The has transformed jobs.

1330
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,699
It doesn't

1331
00:49:19,978 --> 00:49:21,019
allow me to choose

1332
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:25,719
more interactions or to interact with

1333
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:27,478
the the transformation, so

1334
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:29,050
it knows how,

1335
00:49:29,389 --> 00:49:31,398
how it works, the transformation, what needs to

1336
00:49:31,398 --> 00:49:33,418
replace, what needs to be changed,

1337
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:35,860
but I don't have much more options

1338
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,300
to interact with my source code. So

1339
00:49:38,878 --> 00:49:41,260
the only mission or the only goal

1340
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,739
of AWS Transform

1341
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:45,199
is to make your application available

1342
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:46,159
in .NET 8.

1343
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,360
If you have, if you need more interactions

1344
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,688
with your source code,

1345
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,800
we have another option in here.

1346
00:49:54,188 --> 00:49:56,228
Which is Amazon kill shed.

1347
00:49:57,378 --> 00:49:58,590
So this is a

1348
00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:02,668
This is the next step when you have your

1349
00:50:02,668 --> 00:50:04,179
application transformed.

1350
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:06,760
So as I mentioned, I have tit framework.

1351
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:09,760
And I need to change to entity framework

1352
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,269
core.

1353
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,820
So what I'm gonna do now is

1354
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:13,780
ask

1355
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:15,679
Amazon Killhat to replace.

1356
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,340
Entity framework.

1357
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:23,969
To Entity.

1358
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:27,119
Framework

1359
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:33,349
Core. So

1360
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:34,619
this is very powerful because

1361
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:38,269
he can access my search code, the

1362
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,329
solution, understand what's happening with my

1363
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,929
application. Read

1364
00:50:42,929 --> 00:50:43,820
the files

1365
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:45,280
and replace

1366
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,139
the files as needed.

1367
00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:52,918
So it's asking

1368
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,159
to have access

1369
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,699
to my solution.

1370
00:50:56,378 --> 00:50:57,438
I say yes.

1371
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:33,369
Oh So

1372
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,628
Oh. So

1373
00:51:39,628 --> 00:51:42,070
he knows that I need to execute some comments.

1374
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:44,510
He knows what comments need to be executed

1375
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,429
in my solution.

1376
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,378
And we start to replace.

1377
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:51,739
The packages,

1378
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:53,168
the references.

1379
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:57,128
And we will change as well

1380
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:59,610
the source codes, my files

1381
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,918
that need to be changed in order

1382
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,728
to have the Entity Framework core.

1383
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,398
Working in my solution.

1384
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,780
And I can see all the changes

1385
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,280
that he's making in my source

1386
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:21,559
code. Yeah

1387
00:52:33,418 --> 00:52:34,159
So with these

1388
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:36,958
two tools, AWS Transform

1389
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:38,239
and Amazon Killhat,

1390
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,938
I can interact with my source code,

1391
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,458
add new classes,

1392
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,059
ask to add new pages,

1393
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:47,469
add new routes in my

1394
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:50,000
application. All of this,

1395
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,320
just typing what I want in

1396
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,340
just uh

1397
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,639
plain English.

1398
00:52:56,128 --> 00:52:58,369
So it's very powerful when we are, when

1399
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:00,530
we are modernizing, or if you want to

1400
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,809
understand, I'm a new developer, and I want to

1401
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:04,648
understand what's going on with my application,

1402
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,369
how the connection with database is uh

1403
00:53:07,369 --> 00:53:07,949
going on.

1404
00:53:08,969 --> 00:53:09,869
Uh, I can

1405
00:53:10,168 --> 00:53:11,719
debug my application,

1406
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,530
fix errors, or just typing

1407
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:16,769
the errors, uh, or message that I

1408
00:53:16,769 --> 00:53:17,489
want to,

1409
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,530
the goal that I want to accomplish in the chat.

1410
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:23,489
All of this without

1411
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:26,688
Leaving the ID.

1412
00:53:37,369 --> 00:53:40,519
OK. And

1413
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:42,619
this is the first step when we are talking

1414
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,978
about modernizing our application.

1415
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:46,519
It's not just moving from .NET

1416
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:48,079
framework to .NET Core.

1417
00:53:49,668 --> 00:53:52,090
After this, if you want to accomplish

1418
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:53,050
a more

1419
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,409
performatic or reduced costs,

1420
00:53:57,239 --> 00:53:58,228
The next step

1421
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,668
is to move our application

1422
00:54:00,489 --> 00:54:02,168
to execute on Graviton.

1423
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,668
So now that we have our

1424
00:54:04,668 --> 00:54:05,909
application able to

1425
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,449
run on Linux,

1426
00:54:07,929 --> 00:54:10,168
we can take advantage to

1427
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,369
move our application to execute on

1428
00:54:12,369 --> 00:54:14,449
Graviton, and we did a performance

1429
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:16,750
test with one application

1430
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:19,219
and compared the cost of

1431
00:54:19,219 --> 00:54:21,570
this application running on a Windows

1432
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:23,648
machine and then later converted

1433
00:54:23,648 --> 00:54:25,949
this application to run on an AMED.

1434
00:54:26,438 --> 00:54:28,599
And then comparing with Graviton,

1435
00:54:28,878 --> 00:54:30,378
you can see the cost

1436
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,760
after modernize your application and

1437
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,958
execute the same application on

1438
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:36,958
Graviton, the cost difference is

1439
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:37,500
huge.

1440
00:54:38,659 --> 00:54:40,260
And not only the costs.

1441
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:43,969
The latest, the performance of this

1442
00:54:43,969 --> 00:54:46,148
application. It's much better.

1443
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:48,829
So it's not only about to modernize

1444
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:51,050
your application from .NET framework

1445
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:54,030
to .NET Core. It will give you,

1446
00:54:54,228 --> 00:54:56,030
uh, it gives, give you

1447
00:54:56,989 --> 00:54:59,030
a better cost and a better

1448
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,429
performance when executing on

1449
00:55:01,668 --> 00:55:04,269
a modern modern architecture.

1450
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:06,168
So,

1451
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,918
thank you, and now we have

1452
00:55:08,918 --> 00:55:09,688
Armando.

1453
00:55:11,648 --> 00:55:13,719
Say more words. Oh, thank you. Thank you,

1454
00:55:13,918 --> 00:55:14,519
Tiago,

1455
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:16,619
and thanks everyone for listening to us.

1456
00:55:18,389 --> 00:55:18,989
Uh,

1457
00:55:19,469 --> 00:55:20,628
what's next for us?

1458
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:23,228
Well, this was just the tip

1459
00:55:23,228 --> 00:55:25,668
of the iceberg of our migration

1460
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:26,628
road map.

1461
00:55:27,188 --> 00:55:29,530
So basically we're going to continue

1462
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,610
modernizing our net net

1463
00:55:31,938 --> 00:55:33,949
framework projects using the strangle fake

1464
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:36,039
pattern. But now,

1465
00:55:36,219 --> 00:55:38,599
with what we have learned and reinvent,

1466
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:40,570
we need to rethink this model, right?

1467
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:43,168
We, we need to go further with Quiro

1468
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,958
to accelerate the code development and modernization

1469
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:47,989
as well. Uh,

1470
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:50,228
of course we need to adopt a composable

1471
00:55:50,228 --> 00:55:52,628
serverless architecture to speed delivery

1472
00:55:52,628 --> 00:55:54,050
and boost efficiency,

1473
00:55:54,628 --> 00:55:56,628
so. And

1474
00:55:56,628 --> 00:55:58,208
of course we need to enhance

1475
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:00,668
for the other features that we

1476
00:56:00,668 --> 00:56:02,869
have in our uh

1477
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:04,409
payroll stamping services

1478
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:07,570
we need to enhance the SQL database integrations

1479
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,148
so perhaps we're going to migrate

1480
00:56:10,148 --> 00:56:11,208
from SQL server

1481
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:12,110
to another.

1482
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:13,369
Um,

1483
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:15,500
Databases models.

1484
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:18,409
So I just want to want to

1485
00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:19,869
end with the

1486
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:20,829
with the.

1487
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:23,500
Uh, this code, um,

1488
00:56:23,909 --> 00:56:26,148
it is not about migra

1489
00:56:26,148 --> 00:56:28,079
migrating your code, right?

1490
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:30,708
You need to, to think broadly

1491
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,309
and involve you,

1492
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:34,909
uh, key members of your team,

1493
00:56:35,449 --> 00:56:36,418
and this time

1494
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:39,110
we were able to, to work with

1495
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:41,708
Mauricio, Roberto, and Pedro's

1496
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:43,148
team, the architecture team,

1497
00:56:43,628 --> 00:56:45,668
and they got really involved in

1498
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:46,728
this solutioning.

1499
00:56:47,219 --> 00:56:48,320
So we

1500
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:49,659
can go farther

1501
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,579
and deliver this on time and with the

1502
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:54,559
expected results. So don't leave

1503
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,019
your developers

1504
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,059
alone on this.

1505
00:56:58,139 --> 00:57:00,188
And well, that's all from my

1506
00:57:00,188 --> 00:57:02,389
sight. Thank you.
