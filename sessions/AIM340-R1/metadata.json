  "abstract": "Security teams face alert overload and compliance complexity. This code talk shows how to build AI-driven automation that transforms security operations. Through live coding demonstrations, we'll develop intelligent agents that process security events, analyze threats, and orchestrate automated responses. You'll learn to implement real-time detection systems, incident management workflows, and smart remediation patterns. Walk away with reusable code and architectural approaches for creating autonomous security systems that reduce noise and accelerate response times.",
