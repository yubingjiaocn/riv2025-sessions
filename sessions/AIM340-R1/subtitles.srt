1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,960
- [Omar] Good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,090
Thank you for coming to our Code Talk.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,650
Today we're gonna be talking about

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,780
AI agents for cloud operations,

5
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,880
how you could automate
infrastructure management.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,890
One of the key topics we're
gonna discuss today is

7
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,950
also how you could operate
security operations.

8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,050
And one thing that we're gonna discuss,

9
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,140
the way we formatted today's Code Talk is

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,150
we're gonna start off talking
about the core components

11
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,760
of what an agent is, the
type of integrations,

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,490
tools, and some fundamental concepts.

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,590
From there, we're gonna
jump into the AWS console

14
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,420
and walk through a real demo

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,030
and talk through the code and
look at some of the outputs

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,840
that come outta this agentic
application that we develop.

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,220
So my name is Omar Tabbakha.

18
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,070
I'm a solution architect here at AWS.

19
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:41,845
- [Shawn] Hi, everybody.

20
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:42,678
My name is Sean Abdi.

21
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:44,640
I'm also solutions architect here at AWS.

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,690
- [Omar] So before we get started,

23
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,160
by a show of hands,

24
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,070
how many of you have
built out an agent before?

25
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,770
It could be as simple as a
weather application agent.

26
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,780
We have one hand, two hand, okay.

27
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,030
So decent amount of you
have built out agents

28
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,330
within the, my guess is AWS,

29
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,740
maybe some other framework that we use,

30
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,610
but it looks like some of us have

31
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,040
already built out an agent, awesome.

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,420
So let's go ahead and get started.

33
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,430
- [Shawn] With that, let's jump right in.

34
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,860
So let's imagine that it's 2:00 AM

35
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,300
and you're a security engineer

36
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,250
that's just been received a call

37
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,620
and now you're thrust into
a high pressure situation

38
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,120
regarding a security incident.

39
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,360
You log in and your first task is

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,850
to go through a mountains of
mountains in different logs,

41
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,657
all in different formats,
whether that's JSON

42
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:27,180
or plaint text,

43
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,390
that could be stuff like VPC
Flow Logs, firewall logs,

44
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,490
API logs, CloudTrail logs,

45
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,950
even third-party vendors
that you might use

46
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,840
for your on-premise or cloud environment.

47
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,403
Nothing native to AWS.

48
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,400
So hours pass by

49
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,350
as you try to piece together
these different fragments,

50
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,183
like I mentioned.

51
00:01:44,183 --> 00:01:46,380
You might have something
like GuardDuty alerts,

52
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,810
CloudTrail logs, DynamoDB logs,

53
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,520
Security Hub findings,

54
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,900
and you're still trying to find out

55
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,450
how all these different
resources talk to each other.

56
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,800
You know, they're from separate systems

57
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,240
speaking a different language

58
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,040
and are really not meant to
communicate with each other.

59
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,960
So the clock is ticking.

60
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,000
You try to identify a suspicious IP,

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,680
see if it was really a security incident,

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,990
or if it we have a false
positive on our hands

63
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,730
and you've just spent hours and hours

64
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,130
searching, trying to
figure out what's going on.

65
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,640
At this point, you're
starting to get exhausted.

66
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,080
You've done all the grunt work

67
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,360
that something like AI
might be able to handle.

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,160
You spent searching
through these resources

69
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,140
with different tools because
they're in different formats

70
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,190
like we mentioned,

71
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,540
whether that's JSON, plain text

72
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,240
or some other standardized schema.

73
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,780
And you're figuring out
what do I need to do now?

74
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,000
So what if we can take this problem

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,430
and use some sort of
specialized, intelligent system

76
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,400
like some agents that can comb
through all of these logs,

77
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,110
comb through these different tools

78
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,120
and be able to provide you some insights

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,660
that are actionable on your current risk,

80
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,903
giving you more precise
path to tackle this issue.

81
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,090
And that gets us to why AI
for security operations.

82
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,410
So the reality today is

83
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,230
that everything is
moving super fast paced.

84
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,480
Attacks are becoming automated,

85
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,950
people are trying to spend hours

86
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,930
identifying what's going on.

87
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,030
And we just, traditional approaches

88
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,520
with this manual process
just doesn't seem to work

89
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,353
for everybody.

90
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,120
So AI has become the game changer

91
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,160
in the sense that we can now analyze

92
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,310
vast and complex data sets in seconds.

93
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,900
You can detect the patterns and anomalies

94
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,040
that a human might miss for
that error-prone manual process.

95
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,320
And you can automate the repetitive tasks

96
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,260
like triage and log correlation.

97
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,260
And then you use these
surface key insights

98
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,290
to have something to focus on real threats

99
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,850
and not the grunt work that you might see

100
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,830
from a typical security engineer's work

101
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,273
on a day-to-day basis.

102
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,800
So let's start off with
what's a typical LLM

103
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,260
versus agentic AI?

104
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,700
On the left-hand side here, you can see

105
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,770
that we have our usual LLM.

106
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,200
And what this does is
it takes the knowledge

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,760
that it's already been trained on,

108
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,670
providing a simple, you
know, concise answer

109
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,050
without doing many iterations

110
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,880
or any thought process or reasoning.

111
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,700
So for example, you ask it the question,

112
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,860
when did the French Revolution take place?

113
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,050
And it'll respond back to
you with the simple answer

114
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,823
of 1789.

115
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,650
Now on the right-hand
side we have agentic AI,

116
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,050
and this is where things get interesting.

117
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,720
The agent is able to think on its own.

118
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,060
So let's go ahead and
check a weather website

119
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,980
for the forecast.

120
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,390
Let's take a look and dive in

121
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,790
and see what the forecast
looks like for the next week.

122
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,590
We've got some rain and it,

123
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,380
but it's also sunny and warm next Friday.

124
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,450
And then we can evaluate and reiterate

125
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,580
until it comes to a proper answer for us

126
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,160
with its reasoning capabilities to say

127
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,210
next Friday is the ideal
day for Mount Fuji hiking.

128
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,520
And the difference here,
again, as I mentioned,

129
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,580
rather than just having a
concise answer on knowledge

130
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,320
that it's already been trained on,

131
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,240
this can think for itself and iterate

132
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,220
until it has a valuable response

133
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,120
that you can use for your triage

134
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,610
or to get further
information from the agent

135
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,473
by asking follow-up prompts.

136
00:05:08,093 --> 00:05:09,690
So the key thing that I wanted to mention

137
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,150
to start us off is like
it's very important

138
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,040
that your data is the key source

139
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,720
for all of this agent building.

140
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,000
You wanna make sure that you
have the right data sources,

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,410
that you have everything centralized

142
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,540
in a location that's easy to read,

143
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,230
formatted specifically for
your security use case.

144
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,320
This is where Amazon Security
Lake comes in to play.

145
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,880
For those of you that are not familiar,

146
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,650
this is basically a service that we have

147
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,330
that allows you to centralize

148
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,770
all of those different
tools that I mentioned,

149
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,410
all the different logs,
whether it's JSON, plain text

150
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,640
or something else into a data
lake in your AWS account.

151
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,950
And by doing that,
you're able to normalize

152
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,690
that data from the different schemas

153
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,330
in an easy, ready
available format to read,

154
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,280
which is called OCSF,

155
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,520
the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework.

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,130
And that way, you can use a singular tool

157
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,490
or a singular method of approach

158
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,620
for your log analysis
without having to worry

159
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,930
about these data silos and how they are

160
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,613
disparate to begin with.

161
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,830
Now with that,

162
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,390
I'm gonna go ahead and hand it off to Omar

163
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,580
to do a brief overview of our solution

164
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,350
before we dive into the console.

165
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,820
- [Omar] Awesome, thank
you for that Shawn.

166
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,530
So let's cover our solution, right?

167
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,360
The first thing I wanna talk about today,

168
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,790
we're gonna introduce a
multi-agent application.

169
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,810
So this means we're gonna have

170
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,060
a team of different, specialized agents.

171
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,560
The way I like to introduce this is

172
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,030
think of a team that
you have today, right?

173
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,290
Usually you have a data scientist,

174
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,480
you have a computer scientist,

175
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,430
you might have a sales
team, marketing team,

176
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,840
and each team or person is

177
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,600
specialized in a specific skill

178
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,580
and they're able to come
up with skilled outputs

179
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,080
based on the knowledge they have.

180
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,890
So we take that same exact
paradigm to the agentic world.

181
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,520
For example, in this case
we have this agent, right?

182
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,870
I'm gonna call it subagent

183
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,010
because it's one of the agents

184
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,330
of many that are gonna work together

185
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,520
to help us find the
different security events

186
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,350
and also automate the cloud operations

187
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,940
of remediating those problems.

188
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,590
So this first subagent is gonna be

189
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,880
able to tap into DynamoDB

190
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,687
and pull real business context

191
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:08,250
from our environment.

192
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,440
Another big one here is gonna be an agent

193
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,360
that's able to use a security lake, right?

194
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,060
Key component here is if
you have servers on premise,

195
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,080
other cloud providers,

196
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,050
maybe you're working with
different SaaS providers as well,

197
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,110
we can centralize, normalize all our data

198
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,160
in a central security data lake

199
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,020
with one specific schema,

200
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,730
and that way our agent can tap in

201
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,950
and access these logs and
provide that information

202
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,050
to the overall system.

203
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,240
Another big one is cloud operations.

204
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,190
Does anyone know here what MCP is?

205
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,540
Has anyone heard that term?

206
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,230
Great, so that stands for
Model Context Protocol.

207
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,640
So a lot of times in today's talk

208
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,320
we're gonna build out custom functions

209
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,700
that you could use as tools.

210
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,340
Again, tools are essentially
APIs or data sources

211
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,310
that our large language models can use

212
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,950
as additional context to provide answers.

213
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,030
And with cloud operations,

214
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,260
we could do different things, right?

215
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,330
We have a cloud control MCP server

216
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,270
that lets you do different
things like, let's say,

217
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,280
add block rules to specific IP addresses

218
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,480
that might be malicious.

219
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,760
Let's say you wanna isolate EC2 instances

220
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,730
or you wanna take forensic snapshots

221
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,290
of your ABS volumes, right?

222
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,390
We could automate our cloud operations.

223
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,800
Obviously, one key concern is, hey,

224
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,330
do we really want to hand the keys

225
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,430
to our production environment to an agent?

226
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,050
That's a big question in everyone's mind.

227
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,640
And that's where we look
into like different things

228
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,340
like guardrails and also implementing

229
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,300
human in the loop, right?

230
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,070
We could actually take a
summary of all the findings

231
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,110
and ask the user, hey, is
this the correct approach?

232
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,640
So like even the best agentic
applications today have

233
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,220
around a low 90% success rate.

234
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,530
So for key, critical operations,

235
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,060
you always wanna have a human in the loop

236
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,800
within that process.

237
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,170
And of course, incident
response playbooks, right?

238
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,000
Some security events might have

239
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,470
nonsensitive data, right?

240
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,210
We're gonna approach those a different way

241
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,650
than in an account that's gonna have

242
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,230
the more highly critical environments.

243
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,990
So here we could have
these agents work together

244
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,210
and we could have a
supervisor agent up front

245
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,000
and this supervisor
agent is going to be able

246
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,650
to use his team of subspecialists

247
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,300
to actually coordinate different tasks

248
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,160
and get different answers
and synthesize them

249
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,483
into a final response.

250
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,710
This could work in two different ways.

251
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,820
The first one could be

252
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,520
approach like an event-driven app,

253
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,040
event-driven architecture
where we could take

254
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,940
GuardDuty findings.

255
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,690
So GuardDuty is our threat service,

256
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,740
our threat detection service.

257
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,480
So we could take GuardDuty findings

258
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,030
and automatically feed
that to our agentic system.

259
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,670
Let's say, for example,
that someone opened

260
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,040
a public S3 bucket, right?

261
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,950
This will trigger some
sort of GuardDuty finding

262
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,930
and send that directly to our agent

263
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,400
and our agent's able to look at that,

264
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,290
understand, okay, what
account was this coming from?

265
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,220
Lemme look at the logs.

266
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,090
Who did this?

267
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,790
How, what steps do I need
to do to remediate this?

268
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,680
And it could do different things

269
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,050
like either raise alerts
to the security teams

270
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,610
that bucket belongs to

271
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,410
based on the business context,

272
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,450
or we could interact
directly with the agent.

273
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,730
So if you want to dive
deeper into the events

274
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,770
or do more advanced things,

275
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,090
we could interact with the agent.

276
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,213
So let's see what that
actually looks like here.

277
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,420
So this is a front-end application

278
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,590
that Shawn and I developed.

279
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,370
We're using a streamlet to
come up with this application.

280
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,440
And the left-hand side
we have example queries

281
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,260
our security engineers could
actually look at and use.

282
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,370
One example here is going to
be the threat detection query.

283
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,540
So here we're saying find

284
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,710
any failed login attempts

285
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,900
exceeding 10 tries in the last hour,

286
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,260
analyze the source IPs
and affected accounts,

287
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,860
and then block the suspicious
IPs and create snapshots.

288
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,450
So this prompt here is
gonna take advantage

289
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,060
of multiple different agents
to complete this task, right?

290
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,380
If we hit submit, we could actually see

291
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,420
that the agent's gonna go like, okay,

292
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,790
let me analyze the authentication logs.

293
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,950
So it's gonna call those specific tools.

294
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,620
So those tools are able to
look at the different tables

295
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,630
we have within our security lake.

296
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,393
It finds CloudTrail events
and Security Hub findings.

297
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,120
It's able to then go ahead and query it

298
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,740
to find what are the source IPs.

299
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,750
Here, it finds three primary source IPs

300
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,250
across different regions.

301
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,260
And then we can execute
our cloud operation agent

302
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,480
that could actually go ahead and block it.

303
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,593
So here you go,

304
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,460
it's showing the different
IPs that are being blocked.

305
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,090
And here it shows the
automated response actions.

306
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,800
So again, this is more
of an automated approach.

307
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,120
One thing you could do is it can give you

308
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,740
the different summaries of what I found.

309
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,270
And then it can ask you,
do you want me to block

310
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,500
these IP addresses?

311
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,620
Do you want me to put
the limited STP controls

312
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,790
within our account?

313
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,590
So again, those are things
that you want to think through.

314
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,260
Some processes, you want to
give full autonomy to the agent,

315
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,760
but other ones that are more critical,

316
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,553
you definitely wanna think
about human in the loop.

317
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,360
And the left-hand side, again,

318
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,950
we have different agents
and we're gonna go

319
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,650
through a few core agents
in the console today

320
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,650
and show you how we actually wrote this.

321
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,503
So the way we developed this is,

322
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,460
let's go to the next slide, okay?

323
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,310
The way we developed this
is using Strands Agents.

324
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,470
This is an open source SDK.

325
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,590
And this is gonna help
you build out agents

326
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,090
with just a few lines of code, right?

327
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,920
It's very intuitive, easy to use.

328
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,480
When I first started looking at agents

329
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,730
and started building
'em around a year ago,

330
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,230
I didn't have my Python,

331
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,550
I haven't done Python since college.

332
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,840
So I was a little rusty,

333
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,810
but with Strands I was able to
pick up very quickly, right?

334
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,760
You're gonna see later
today how it abstracts

335
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,880
a lot of the complexity
of building an agent.

336
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,700
Another core thing is the native tools.

337
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,230
Today we're gonna build the tools,

338
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,180
we're gonna define those Python functions

339
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,890
and make them tools,

340
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,210
but there's also community tools

341
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,620
that you could tap into that already exist

342
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,870
so you don't actually have to code them.

343
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,190
Also easy integrations

344
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,930
with different FCP servers.

345
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,970
AWS has a bunch of different FCP servers

346
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,223
that you could take advantage of today.

347
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:41,400
And other providers as
well have MCP servers

348
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,250
that you can use.

349
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,810
You could support any
model providers, right?

350
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,180
You're not stuck with just Amazon models.

351
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,540
If you go to Bedrock, we have
over 10 foundation models

352
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,880
that you could use, if you
wanna use OpenAI, Gemini, right?

353
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,860
You're not locked to any sort of provider.

354
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,210
And one thing I wanna talk about is

355
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,580
for these sub-agents,
depending on the task,

356
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,740
we could play around
with the different models

357
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,540
that's powering that specific agent.

358
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,530
So at its core,

359
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,700
what Strands is doing is

360
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,470
it's implementing this agentic loop.

361
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,060
So the way it works is if we look

362
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,640
at the weather application example,

363
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,340
let's say again we want to
check the weather for tomorrow.

364
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,410
Again, the foundation
model has no knowledge

365
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,000
of what the weather's
like next week, right?

366
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,710
It wasn't trained on that kind of data.

367
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,380
So what happens here is the prompt is

368
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,030
going to be sent to the agent

369
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,840
and the agent has access to
the model and the tools, right?

370
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,560
Here in this case, we're
using a react orchestration

371
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,330
where we're actually going to invoke

372
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,890
the model with the user prompt

373
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,230
and the model is gonna
have all the context

374
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,060
around the tools it has access to.

375
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,650
It's gonna be able to do
the reasoning like okay,

376
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,290
I need to get the weather for tomorrow.

377
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,120
Wait, I have these list of different tools

378
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,290
like get weather.

379
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,300
So it's gonna pass that
response back to the agent,

380
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,440
letting it know, hey,

381
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,090
execute the specific tool.

382
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,100
In this case it could be a Python function

383
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,830
that goes to the weather.com API

384
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,780
and grab that weather for tomorrow,

385
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,370
it's gonna return that result

386
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,990
and then send it back to the model.

387
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,240
And this loop is gonna keep on happening

388
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,270
until you get your final response, right?

389
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,110
It could also prompt the user, right?

390
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,210
If some tools require specific inputs

391
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,800
and they're not there,
we could ask the user,

392
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,050
hey, you're asking about
weather for tomorrow,

393
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,280
but I need a state, right?

394
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,300
I can't just give you weather,

395
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,220
weather on what location
you're talking about.

396
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,583
So those are some things
we'll talk about as well.

397
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,710
So just a quick visual on the differences

398
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,303
between using some sort of,

399
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,300
so whether they're using an
SDK like Strands or CrewAI.

400
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,890
As you could see, you go
from 350 lines of code to 55

401
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,660
for a weather app agent.

402
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,220
So for the tool registration,

403
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,480
the conversation management,

404
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,920
API communication,

405
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,180
all that's abstracted away,

406
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,590
it's handled automatically.

407
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,180
And again, when we talk
about when you go through

408
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,013
the Code Talk,

409
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,580
you're gonna see there's
not that many things

410
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,413
you need to define.

411
00:14:51,413 --> 00:14:54,003
Again, our goal is to
simplify creating agents.

412
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,640
Same with the agent loop, right?

413
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,580
Beforehand, I had to build out
the iteration logic manually,

414
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,920
but now I could literally
just call in the agent class

415
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,750
and have it do it for me.

416
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,270
So a process that took four to six hours

417
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:11,270
can now take 15 to 30 minutes, okay?

418
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,860
So let's go ahead and jump into

419
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,160
the AWS console

420
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,290
and look at our first agent.

421
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,581
Go ahead, Shawn.

422
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:21,414
- [Shawn] So before we
jump into the console,

423
00:15:21,414 --> 00:15:23,278
I wanted to take a quick
look at the first agent

424
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:24,111
that we'll be building out

425
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:27,240
and this is our business
context metadata agent.

426
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,350
So as you can see here,

427
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,080
the agent is going to
ask for an account ID

428
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,490
based off of your AWS account.

429
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,320
That's a 12 digit number that you give it.

430
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,440
You say, tell me about so-and-so account,

431
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,750
our metadata tool that we're gonna attach

432
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,850
to the agent before we instantiate it.

433
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,280
We'll be able to look
through a DynamoDB table

434
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,500
or specific API that you might be using

435
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,510
that holds all of that information.

436
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,980
And the information
that we're talking about

437
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,520
when it comes to business context is

438
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,760
gonna be something like
your business unit,

439
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,050
the criticality,

440
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,580
a point of contact in case

441
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,170
something needs to be reported,

442
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,300
the scope of compliance and so forth.

443
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,710
And we'll take a look
at that in the console

444
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,170
once we open up the DynamoDB table.

445
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,730
But what this allows us to do is

446
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,790
take what most people fail to realize is

447
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,640
that the context and the business context

448
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,380
related to a security incident is

449
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,750
just as important as
the technical details.

450
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,940
You'll be able to sift
through all of these things

451
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,980
within seconds to be able to identify

452
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,470
if this is something that
your team should prioritize

453
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,330
or if you can just leave
it alone, it's low risk,

454
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,260
and maybe come back to it

455
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,440
for a more priority
adverse security incident

456
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,630
that might have already been happening.

457
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,860
So with that, let's go ahead

458
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,570
and jump into the console

459
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,510
and take a look at what
we've got to build out.

460
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,590
- [Omar] Yeah, and real quick,

461
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,000
before we jump in the console

462
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,440
and get to the fun part that
we're all excited about,

463
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,820
I just wanted to see if
there's any questions

464
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,840
on what we discussed,

465
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,880
make sure we handle those questions

466
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,350
before we get into the code.

467
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,090
So does anyone have any
questions about what we discussed

468
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,803
so far around Strands or agents?

469
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,210
Great, okay, awesome.

470
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,380
Let's get right to it.

471
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,420
- [Shawn] Cool, so here
you can see we have

472
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,290
the AWS console, just your
standard landing page.

473
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,590
And what we want to do is
go to Amazon SageMaker AI.

474
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,170
Now we use Amazon SageMaker AI

475
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,290
because there's notebooks
available for us to use.

476
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,483
If you all are familiar with Jupyter,

477
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,410
Jupyter Notebook is an interactive IDE

478
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,500
that's available for you
all to build out your code,

479
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,360
visualize the outputs,

480
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,340
and then experiment in real time.

481
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,200
And this is super helpful as we build out

482
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,290
this agent together in
the room step by step.

483
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,690
So just a quick little
refresher for you all.

484
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,400
Now, the first thing that we want to do

485
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,070
for this agent is install
all the dependencies.

486
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,430
That's things like Bodo 3,
Pandas and other libraries

487
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,570
that you might need.

488
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,020
So we'll go ahead and
install those dependencies.

489
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,680
Once the dependencies are installed,

490
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,330
we're gonna go ahead and use

491
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,560
another import code snippet
right here to get the JSON.

492
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,030
We're gonna import from Strands

493
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,830
the agent and tool functions.

494
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,920
We're also gonna import
Strands models, Bedrock models

495
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,470
that we'll be using for
the sake of this Code Talk.

496
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,180
So we'll go ahead and run that.

497
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,310
And then now we're
getting to the fun part.

498
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,690
So this is where we wanna start off

499
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,150
by making a connection to our data source.

500
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,790
And in this case, we're using DynamoDB.

501
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,350
So we'll create the Bodo 3 session

502
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,920
so that we can interact
with our AWS resources

503
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,450
programmatically.

504
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,360
And we are using DynamoDB
as the data source.

505
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,370
As you can see, the resource is DynamoDB.

506
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,230
We're based outta US East two.

507
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,230
Now for this particular code snippet,

508
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,840
we defined the region
that we're working out of.

509
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,340
There are ways to auto detect that

510
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,470
and you don't have to
hardcode US East two,

511
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,450
you can have it detect whatever
region you're working out of

512
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,323
if you need to.

513
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,440
And we wanna create a metadata table

514
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,900
and define that for
the sake of this agent.

515
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,850
So we're gonna name
that meta_metadata_table

516
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,230
and we are linking that
to a DynamoDB table

517
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,240
that we've already
pre-created in our console.

518
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,073
Yes.

519
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,903
Zoom in a little bit, yeah.

520
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:57,136
Is that better?

521
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,270
Awesome, so the database that
we currently have set up,

522
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,640
it's called SOC account metadata.

523
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,100
And if we switch back
over to the console, Omar,

524
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,950
and look up, go to DynamoDB,

525
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,780
we can see that all the things

526
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,860
that I was mentioning earlier,

527
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,410
the account ID, the scope of compliance,

528
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,230
the criticality and so forth are

529
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,190
visible right here.

530
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,190
So as you can see, we've
got the account ID,

531
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,220
account name, compliance scope,

532
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,710
and then if we scroll over to
the right a little bit more,

533
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,530
you can see that we have the criticality,

534
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,180
the environment that we're working out of,

535
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,390
determining if it's production,
development and so forth

536
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,353
to help you prioritize
what you want to act on.

537
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,630
So this is just to see

538
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,040
the type of data that we'll be pulling

539
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,460
when we return the business
context using the agent.

540
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,920
Now if we go back to the code,

541
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,910
the first thing we want to do

542
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,507
now that we've connected
to our DynamoDB table is

543
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:52,050
define the tool.

544
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,630
So we start off with the @tool decorator.

545
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,130
And for those of you that may not be

546
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,180
super familiar with tools,

547
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,430
these are just specialized capabilities

548
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,750
that we give our agent

549
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,660
that allows it to act beyond
its core reasoning abilities.

550
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,310
So in this particular case,

551
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,440
a tool to retrieve account metadata

552
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,120
from an AWS account.

553
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,613
So we'll define that as
get_AWS_account_metadata.

554
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,140
We are giving it the
information instructions

555
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,960
to retrieve metadata about an AWS account

556
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,330
given an account ID.

557
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,220
And the argument that we're giving it is

558
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,510
again, this is an AWS account,
we need metadata for it.

559
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,300
The ID will always be 12 digits.

560
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,280
It's important to distinguish that here

561
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,540
because like I mentioned,

562
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,010
in the case of AWS,

563
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,290
it's a 12-digit account number.

564
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,910
If you put in a number smaller than that,

565
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,410
it'll return results saying

566
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,670
hey, we can't find this account.

567
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,830
So however granular you wanna make that,

568
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,810
we'll find that in the argument.

569
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,120
And then the agent, the
tool is gonna return to us

570
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,730
a dictionary containing
that metadata context

571
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,080
like we just looked at,

572
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,660
the scope of compliance, the account name,

573
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,370
what environment belongs to,

574
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,010
who we should contact and
if we should prioritize this

575
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,500
or maybe move on to something else.

576
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,610
And as you can see here, the response is

577
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,850
gonna be based off of
the account ID string

578
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,800
that we saw in the DynamoDB table.

579
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,260
And we'll get that list
in a dictionary format

580
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,110
once we've instantiated and run the agent.

581
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,150
So let's go ahead and run that code

582
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,270
and now we're ready to
initialize our agent.

583
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,260
So an agent, who can tell me
what an agent consists of?

584
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,710
What are the three components
that make an agent?

585
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:28,763
No worries.

586
00:21:28,763 --> 00:21:30,720
So an agent is a model,

587
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,720
a system prompt and a tool.

588
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,460
So you can, you maybe notice here

589
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,040
that there's no model
defined here in this agent

590
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,230
and we'll cover that in just a second,

591
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,320
but we'll name the the
agent metadata agent,

592
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,797
we'll give it the system prompt,

593
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:46,680
"You are a helpful agent
that looks up metadata

594
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,380
about an AWS account
based on the account ID."

595
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,150
Like I mentioned, if the account number is

596
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,100
not 12 digits or it can't find it,

597
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,010
it'll let the user know so
that they can try that again.

598
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,050
And then the tool that
we're giving the agent is

599
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,090
that get_AWS_account_metadata

600
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,390
that we just created up above
in the previous code snippet.

601
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,240
So let's go ahead and
initialize the agent.

602
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,590
And this next piece right here,

603
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,423
as I was mentioning,

604
00:22:08,423 --> 00:22:10,830
we don't have a model defined

605
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,720
and that's because I was perfectly fine

606
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,060
using the default model
that Strands provides us,

607
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,040
which is Claude Sonnet 4.0.

608
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,110
So when we run this model config command,

609
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,760
we can verify that.

610
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,500
Obviously, if you have a specific need

611
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,480
for your use case for a different model,

612
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,800
you're more than welcome to change that

613
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,720
and put the model that you want to use.

614
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,400
Claude Sonnet 4 worked perfectly fine

615
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,813
for this example right here.

616
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,740
So now that we've got all the
necessary resources compiled

617
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,940
and ready to go,

618
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,760
we can go ahead and send
a message to our agent

619
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,890
to get a response with that dictionary.

620
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,853
Tell me about account 67981713.

621
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,710
Maybe we didn't run everything.

622
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,933
- [Omar] Yeah, should we run the blocks?

623
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,200
- [Shawn] There we go.

624
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,640
So if that ever happens, just make sure

625
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,430
you ran all the previous
code snippets beforehand.

626
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,680
And as you can see here,
we've got the account name,

627
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,120
it's Production-Main,

628
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,490
the ID that we gave the
agent in the first place.

629
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,100
You can see the business
unit that it belongs to.

630
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,420
You can also see that it is

631
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,070
a production environment,

632
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,690
critical criticality.

633
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,880
And then if we wanna let
the security contact know,

634
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,330
security@company, and
the incident priority,

635
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,370
for example, highest priority.

636
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,440
This is the type of context
that you might spend

637
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,270
hours trying to gather
from the information

638
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,210
that you have stored
from your data sources.

639
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,700
The agent was able to pull that
in just a matter of seconds

640
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,903
given an account ID.

641
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,380
So with that, I'm gonna
hand it back off to Omar

642
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,590
to show how we use that business context

643
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,890
and how we use the data that
we have for log analysis.

644
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,660
- [Omar] Thank you, Shawn.

645
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,700
So one key thing that I
would like to bring up

646
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,200
when we're talking about agents is

647
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,240
if you're new to building agents,

648
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,400
always start off with a
more simple use case, right?

649
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,720
Something that's a little
more straightforward.

650
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,190
So you could actually
get the hang of defining

651
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,900
different tools, understanding what works

652
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,520
and what doesn't work.

653
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,530
So in this case we start
off with the DynamoDB,

654
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,080
obviously business context agent is,

655
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,970
it is simple but it's also a key component

656
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,503
of our overall architecture.

657
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,747
So let's look at the next agent right here

658
00:24:14,747 --> 00:24:16,350
that we're working on to
build out on the console.

659
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,700
And this one is going to be

660
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,410
the Security Lake agent.

661
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,630
This is definitely a core one here.

662
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,420
So the way this agent's gonna work is

663
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,670
it's gonna use Amazon Athena.

664
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,810
This is going to be a serverless
interactive query service

665
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,730
that actually lets us run SQL Query

666
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,560
directly on all the data sources we have

667
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,360
in our security lake.

668
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,860
So the way this works is

669
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,070
the agent's gonna able to
take a specific prompt,

670
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,750
it's able to convert natural language.

671
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,310
Like for example here,

672
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,900
if you look up at the screen,

673
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,820
we're saying show security group changes

674
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,073
followed by unusual traffic patterns.

675
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,160
So can anyone tell me where do we store

676
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,150
security group changes?

677
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,670
What sort of logs will that be placed in?

678
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,440
Can anyone tell me?

679
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,850
CloudTrail, exactly.

680
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,610
So we have, that's one of the
log sources of CloudTrail.

681
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,413
How about unusual traffic patterns?

682
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,700
VPC Flow Logs, that's right.

683
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,250
So just based on this
natural language query

684
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,960
that we have here, it's
gonna understand, okay,

685
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,490
I need to query,

686
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,260
I need to query the SQL code

687
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,300
to actually query this Security Lake,

688
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,360
pull in any sort of security
group changes that have

689
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,340
unusual traffic patterns.

690
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,730
So this is an example of the
power of the agent by itself.

691
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,460
Down here is sample queries
for multi-agents, right?

692
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,080
So here if we're saying
correlate unusual API activity

693
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,170
with network anomalies and
then contain the threats,

694
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,353
does anyone know what two
agents we need to use for this?

695
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:44,310
So the first one is how do you
correlate the API activity?

696
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,060
What agent would you need for that?

697
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,320
So hint is we're looking at right now.

698
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,160
What was that?

699
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,340
Yes, so one agent is gonna
be the Security Lake agent

700
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,890
and then for the containing the threats,

701
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,380
if anyone remembers the name of that one.

702
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,060
Let's go back.
- [Audience] Cloud Ops.

703
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,670
- [Shawn] Yes, the Cloud
Ops agent, exactly.

704
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,890
So these two are gonna work together

705
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,200
to actually handle that
query and solve that problem

706
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,693
that we have, okay?

707
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,530
And yeah, let's jump in
into the actual console

708
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,980
and see what this looks like.

709
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:20,652
You need a drive?

710
00:26:20,652 --> 00:26:21,900
- [Omar] I got it, appreciate it.

711
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,333
So let's go to demo,

712
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,263
okay,

713
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,263
okay, so let's go into the
Security Lake Notebook.

714
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,823
So like Shawn, I'm gonna
install the dependencies.

715
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,290
We're going to then import
different things, right?

716
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,930
The key two things is
gonna be the agent class.

717
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,310
This is what lets us actually define

718
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,690
the agent with the different tools,

719
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,850
foundation model, and prompt.

720
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,530
We're also importing the tool class

721
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,430
so we could actually define
the Python function as a tool.

722
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,430
Sure, zoom in, okay, how's that?

723
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,800
Awesome, okay.

724
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,930
Here I'm just doing some
Security Lake configuration.

725
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,970
I'm giving agent permission to access

726
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,460
my Athena work group that's associated

727
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,570
with my Security Lake.

728
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,600
Again, my Security Lake has
the vlogs across the board

729
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,420
from VPC Flow Logs, Security Hub findings,

730
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,923
and also CloudTrail events.

731
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,180
Here I'm initializing
different AWS clients

732
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,850
so I can actually interact
with Athena, or not me.

733
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,950
The agent can actually
interact with Athena,

734
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,500
Bedrock to actually access
different foundation models.

735
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,460
And then also Glue.

736
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,100
Glue helps us grab the schema information

737
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,120
so we could build that.

738
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,070
So we could actually build the queries.

739
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,570
Here we're defining a Bedrock model.

740
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,490
So I think one of the
strongest points here is

741
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,560
being able to define the
model that you wanna use

742
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,540
for your agent with just one line of code.

743
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,270
So Claude Opus 4.5 probably
came out a week or two ago

744
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,880
and I was able just by changing
one line of code to replace

745
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,470
a different foundation model.

746
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,270
And again, one thing
you want to think of is

747
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:57,900
depending on the agent and
the complexity of its task,

748
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,880
you might want to adjust which
model you want to use, right?

749
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,870
You wanna think about latency,

750
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,130
you wanna think about cost.

751
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,990
So if we think about the metadata agent,

752
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,700
it's just gonna create a DynamoDB table.

753
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,040
It's a pretty simple task,
there's not much going on there.

754
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,970
So in that case, we could use

755
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,680
a lightweight model
that's faster and cheaper,

756
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,300
like Haiku for example.

757
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,750
Something like this that needs
to look up natural language,

758
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,330
look up schema, create an actual query,

759
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,340
grab the data and then
create the correlations

760
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,480
between activities,

761
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,130
we'd wanna use something
a little more advanced

762
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,660
with more capability.

763
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,960
In that case, we're gonna
use Claude Opus 4.5.

764
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,300
Okay, so now this is,

765
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,580
so now we're gonna actually
define the tools, right?

766
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,170
So now what tools,

767
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,580
does anyone know what sort of tools

768
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,320
my agent would need access to

769
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,970
for the Security Lake agent?

770
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,220
There's no wrong answers.

771
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,453
There's a hint right here.

772
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,380
I'm gonna have to pick someone.

773
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,450
- [Shawn] How do we query the data?

774
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,351
What's the best way to query that?

775
00:28:56,351 --> 00:28:57,870
What was that?

776
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,900
Athena, Athena, yes.

777
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,830
So that's one tool we need.

778
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,780
We need to create a tool for our agents

779
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,280
to actually use Amazon Athena.

780
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,870
And that's what we're doing here.

781
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,460
Here is the context.

782
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,860
So we feed, if you notice a lot of these,

783
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,930
every tool's gonna have
this metadata description.

784
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,490
And that's because we
feed this to the model.

785
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,370
The model knows I have
a tool that can query

786
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,160
the Security Lake using Athena.

787
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,750
And the only argument I need,

788
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,260
I need a SQL query to do this

789
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,590
and this is the returns, right?

790
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,290
I'm gonna return the
results as a string table

791
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,910
or error message if I
don't get anything back

792
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,280
from the Security Lake.

793
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,580
So here I'm just
connecting to Amazon Athena

794
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,590
and I already defined
Athena database up top.

795
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,390
So we're connecting to Athena

796
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,320
and we're actually gonna grab

797
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,690
the unique query execution ID

798
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,190
that belongs to Athena.

799
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,660
And this is just gonna go through

800
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,090
and actually pull in the
results for Amazon Athena.

801
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,140
So that's one tool.

802
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,333
One tool is to actually do the querying.

803
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,420
Can anyone tell me what
the other tool's gonna do?

804
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,870
There's a hint on the screen.

805
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,260
So the second tool is
going to actually list

806
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,430
the tables, right?

807
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,930
'Cause the agent is not gonna know

808
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,090
what sort of data sources I have, right?

809
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,067
So it could be VPC Flow Logs,

810
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:09,570
it could be CloudTrail Security Hub.

811
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,670
Or if using other third-party providers,

812
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,870
security services,

813
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,320
you could have unique
tables over there as well.

814
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,330
And that's what makes
Security Lake so powerful is

815
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,060
you have one normalized,
standardized data format.

816
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,290
So the agent doesn't have to go in

817
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,750
and really like change up the queries.

818
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,823
It has one unified way of approaching it.

819
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,110
And then finally, we
have get_table_schema.

820
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,060
And this retrieves the schema information

821
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,220
from the Glue Data Catalog

822
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,886
and the agent needs to
grab the schema, right?

823
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:39,030
It has to look at the column information

824
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,650
and how the data is partitioned,

825
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,510
and based on that it could actually create

826
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,060
queries that can be executed
against Amazon Athena.

827
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,500
So we define the three tools over here,

828
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,240
we're gonna run that.

829
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,040
And now what we're gonna do is

830
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,840
after we define the tool,

831
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,870
we're going to go ahead
and call the agent class

832
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,703
that we have.

833
00:30:58,703 --> 00:31:00,390
And again, for the agent, like Shawn said,

834
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,550
there's three core components.

835
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,860
We need the Bedrock
model that we want to use

836
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,693
or any model, right?

837
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:06,930
You're not tied to only Bedrock.

838
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,390
If you wanna use OpenAI or
these other foundation models,

839
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,920
feel free to do that.

840
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,810
And then we define the different tools

841
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,403
that this agent has access to.

842
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,110
And I think one very
important component of agents

843
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,460
that a lot of people usually
sleep on is the system prompt.

844
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,290
The system prompt is
essentially the persona,

845
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,600
the personality of the agent.

846
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,810
In this case, we're letting it know

847
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,340
that you're a cybersecurity analyst

848
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,980
with access to an AWS Security Data Lake.

849
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,470
And I give it important database context

850
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:38,160
and if you notice here, I
also give it a workflow.

851
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,060
The thing is with agent,

852
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,470
it could actually go
through the agentic loop

853
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,730
and figure out the workflow.

854
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:46,110
But in this case, there is one
good way to actually generate

855
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,250
the actual query.

856
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,640
And that is list the tables, the schema,

857
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,620
and then build queries based on the tape,

858
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,840
the actual data and the schema.

859
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,360
That's one workflow that I define.

860
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,280
And one thing that you wanna
do when you build agents,

861
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,170
you'll notice sometimes
hey, like it's taking

862
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,240
two, three iterations to do something.

863
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,040
I could just tell it in the prompt

864
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,450
that information and we can get rid of

865
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,370
a lot of the latency and extra tokens

866
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,233
that it would usually cost.

867
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,950
And in terms of outputs,

868
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,530
I tell me, gimme specific
remediation steps.

869
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,360
I want data-driven insights

870
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,430
and then key findings with the risk,

871
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,843
the risk assessments.

872
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,233
And that's it.

873
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,730
We defined our Security Lake agents

874
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,470
with its different tools.

875
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,750
And the first prompt that
I want to test out is

876
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,423
what kind of data do I
have in my Security Lake?

877
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,840
So we run that and as you can see,

878
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,983
the first thing it does is

879
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:43,590
it's gonna list the Security Lake tables.

880
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:46,170
It realizes we have
three different tables.

881
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,430
So let's get the schema details

882
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,200
so you can get the full picture.

883
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,140
So it runs as you see
three different executions,

884
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,720
one tool call for every single table,

885
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,070
and it grabs that information, right?

886
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,440
It tells us, okay, you
have the CloudTrail events,

887
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,260
which has API activity,

888
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,050
user role and authentication information,

889
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,643
source API calls.

890
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,100
Same with Security Hub findings, right?

891
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,620
It tells you everything
that is usually involved

892
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,540
with these specific findings, right?

893
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,843
Vulnerabilities, remediation
guidance, compliance status.

894
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,843
And the same with VPC Flow Logs.

895
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:23,327
There we go.

896
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,600
- [Omar] So now that we built
that Security Lake agent,

897
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,540
let's look at how we
could actually build out,

898
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,220
how we could build out
that supervisor agent

899
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,270
so we could use multiple agents together.

900
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,070
So here,

901
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,530
the next step is we have
this log analysis agent

902
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,600
that could actually
generate its own SQL queries

903
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,580
based on the different events coming in

904
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,980
or interaction with the
agent and return results.

905
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,690
And we also have the metadata, right?

906
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:58,050
So how do we actually set up
these two to work together

907
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,550
in a multi-agent architecture?

908
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,185
So when I first started, we
talked about native tools

909
00:34:12,185 --> 00:34:13,530
that are created by the community.

910
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:16,310
So two ones that I wanna use
for this specific agent is

911
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,400
gonna be file writes.

912
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,080
This is gonna give our agent the ability

913
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,350
to actually write files to our computer.

914
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,610
Another one is current time.

915
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,200
So if you have specific queries

916
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,210
like tell me about events
that happened yesterday,

917
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,050
this is a native tool.

918
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,140
Again, you don't have to write
any sort of logic for it.

919
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,300
It's already built in and
we just need to import it

920
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,643
from the Strand tools class.

921
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,470
So we'll import those two.

922
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,870
So here, this metadata agent

923
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,000
that Shawn went through was
defined in another notebook.

924
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,140
So I'm just gonna redefine it.

925
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:50,643
So this specific notebook
has awareness of the agent.

926
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,370
So let's look at how we
actually define multiple tools.

927
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,380
So the way we do this in this example is

928
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,720
we define the agents as tools.

929
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,800
So the supervisor agent,

930
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,840
if we think back to that agentic loop

931
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,250
that SDK operates,

932
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,440
it now has access to different agents

933
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,540
that it can use to complete task.

934
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,730
So in this case, all I'm doing is

935
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,580
I'm defining that Security Lake agent

936
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,350
as one of the tools, right?

937
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,820
The logic was already defined above

938
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,650
in terms of the different tools

939
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,690
it has access to, its persona.

940
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,970
So here I just need to provide the context

941
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,613
so our supervisor agent
knows what has access to.

942
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,154
Same with the get_ AWS_account_metadata,

943
00:35:31,154 --> 00:35:33,690
I'm just gonna define the metadata

944
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,490
and then put some error handling

945
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,073
in case the ID is incorrect.

946
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,640
And then here again,

947
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,380
inputting the agent
class and we're defining

948
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,420
the different tools.

949
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,356
In this case, we have two native tools

950
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:48,300
that are native to Strands

951
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,000
and we also have two different tools

952
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,473
which are actual agents.

953
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,190
Here again, again, the big
key is the personality,

954
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,410
the persona, which is a system prompt.

955
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,940
When you start building out agents,

956
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,110
that's one thing I highly recommend is

957
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,510
put out the different
prompts and you're gonna see

958
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,833
widely different results.

959
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,050
So in this case, I define
an investigation workflow,

960
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,820
get the metadata, right?

961
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,150
Use the Security Lake agent
to find the findings overview,

962
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,580
get the CloudTrail, network IP analysis.

963
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,260
And then finally, I want
you to generate a report

964
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,060
that gets sent to our security team.

965
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,310
I give it a list of available tools

966
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,140
and then also the output, right?

967
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,633
I want account context, criticality,

968
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,820
account summary,

969
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,770
the risk assessment
based on available data

970
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,200
and also recommended actions.

971
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,210
And if there's any data gaps that require

972
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,320
manual investigation, right?

973
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,820
Sometimes the agent doesn't have

974
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,860
all the necessary context or reasoning

975
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,980
to actually give you some
sort of remediation plan.

976
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,300
So it could tell you
what sort of data gaps

977
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,950
you have within your environment.

978
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,060
So run that

979
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:01,770
and for when you use different
native tools like file write,

980
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,600
Strand sees it as a sensitive operation

981
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,130
to actually write to your computer.

982
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,660
Usually you'll ask for consent

983
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,160
whether or not you could
write to the computer

984
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,630
in the middle of the invocation.

985
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,370
In this case, right,
agents are autonomous.

986
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,020
We don't want it to stop halfway through

987
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,110
and let us know that hey, could
I invoke this specific tool?

988
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,210
So I'm just gonna run this and just say

989
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,770
bypass any sort of tool consent.

990
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,210
You're allowed to use any tool you want

991
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,060
without human in the loop permission.

992
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,690
So now let's actually use
the SOC orchestrator agent

993
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,593
we just built out.

994
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,970
So we have this account
ID, it's been compromised,

995
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,970
what are the affected resources
actually be concerned about?

996
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,750
So if we run this,

997
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,140
so me and Shawn have
actually been populating

998
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,790
the Security Lake for the
last two, three months

999
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,080
with almost 60 events a minute.

1000
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,550
So we have a lot of logs in there

1001
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,680
and it's still performing very well

1002
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,800
and it's gonna actually go
ahead and start querying

1003
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,350
the different data sources,
getting the schema.

1004
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,090
This probably takes around
maybe a minute or two

1005
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,380
to complete so I'm gonna show you a report

1006
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,360
that I generated last night.

1007
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,250
So if I come back to home,

1008
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,340
look at all my reports, right here,

1009
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,080
these are the different
reports I generated.

1010
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,240
Let's look at the one from

1011
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,133
let's do four hours ago.

1012
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,370
So this is the report
that I generated, right?

1013
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,200
It's gonna gimme the account ID

1014
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,463
and know is based on the business context

1015
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,170
that this is a production account.

1016
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,119
So it's a highly critical
environment, right?

1017
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,980
It's a P1 priority and it's critical

1018
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,030
and it gives you a summary.

1019
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,830
It says this account has
confidential information

1020
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,430
with PCI information with
active compromise, right?

1021
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,950
You need immediate containment required.

1022
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,810
So it gives you all the context,

1023
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,023
the security contact within
that specific AWS account.

1024
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,330
Here's the executive summary.

1025
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,320
Me and Shawn are definitely in trouble.

1026
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,350
We have over 10,000 security
findings within AWS account.

1027
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,810
So definitely a lot of work to do there.

1028
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,490
Again, we've been
blasting the Security Lake

1029
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,050
with a lot of different events

1030
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,160
and here it breaks it down, right?

1031
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,460
You have 859 critical within S3 buckets.

1032
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,500
IAM users, EC2 instances,

1033
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,930
security groups that have been modified

1034
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,340
and it tells you the risk, right?

1035
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,440
Data exposure, IAM user,

1036
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,140
there's a credential that's
been compromised and used.

1037
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,220
It shows the attack analysis, right?

1038
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,060
The source IP, which user is compromised

1039
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,673
and also the VPC traffic.

1040
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,673
Here we go,

1041
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,270
different API operations
that are happening.

1042
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,830
People are, that user is

1043
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,850
creating security groups,

1044
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,620
it's deleting security groups

1045
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,540
and it's authorizing specific ports

1046
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,373
within existing security groups.

1047
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,970
And it actually runs down
through immediate actions

1048
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,170
that are required, right?

1049
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,330
Rotate all the credentials immediately,

1050
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,833
especially the admin IAM,

1051
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,250
and it tells you the
things that are critical

1052
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,420
that need immediate action,

1053
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,250
the short-term actions,

1054
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,270
and then some more information

1055
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,253
on the compliance impact assessment.

1056
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,140
And then let's see if it
generated this report.

1057
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,220
So it's still working through,
we can come back here,

1058
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,530
but that probably takes
around another minute.

1059
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,673
So yeah, let's go ahead and
go to the next slide here.

1060
00:40:14,074 --> 00:40:15,030
- [Shawn] So now that
we have our agent code,

1061
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,100
we wrote it out, we're
confident it's working,

1062
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,290
we tested it within Jupyter Notebooks

1063
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,150
and it's doing what we
wanted it to achieve,

1064
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,200
the next big question is

1065
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,150
how do I run this within
a production environment?

1066
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,070
That's one big, key
thing that we're seeing.

1067
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,620
And with that, we have
the AgentCore Runtime.

1068
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,190
This is a managed service
that came out a few months ago

1069
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,660
and it lets you run your agent code,

1070
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,980
AI agent code so you don't have to worry

1071
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,780
about the underlying infrastructure.

1072
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,890
So in this case, again,
similar to Strands, SDK,

1073
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,140
any sort of foundation model you want,

1074
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,390
whether it's from OpenAI, Gemini,

1075
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,180
or one of the handful
of models in Bedrock,

1076
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,080
same with framework, right?

1077
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,060
You don't have to use Strands
SDK if you're comfortable

1078
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,670
with LangGraph, CrewAI,
you're already using them.

1079
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,890
You're open to these as well.

1080
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,330
So what happens here is, let's say we have

1081
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,620
this Python file that I have,

1082
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,630
what you could do is you
could either containerize it

1083
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,427
in a GACAR file or upload the code as is

1084
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:04,500
to AgentCore and they'll do the packaging

1085
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,150
and host it for you.

1086
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,220
So what's gonna happen here
is AgentCore Runtime is

1087
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,170
gonna create a runtime endpoint.

1088
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,760
And this is the endpoint
that was integrated

1089
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,260
in that frontend application that I showed

1090
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,610
in the beginning of the talk.

1091
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,340
It's sending all those
prompts to the endpoint

1092
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,290
and the endpoint is
actually able to scale up

1093
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,960
the amount of compute resources
based on demand, right?

1094
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,160
So when there's a lot of users coming in

1095
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,680
and using it during actual incidents,

1096
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,580
it's able to scale up and also
scale back down by default.

1097
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,010
There's also a lot of cool,
different integrations,

1098
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,690
whether that's through identity,

1099
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,830
whether you wanna set up observability

1100
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,744
and also if you wanna integrate

1101
00:41:37,744 --> 00:41:38,760
different MCP servers, right?

1102
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,710
We talked about the
cloud control MCP server

1103
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,500
to automate cloud operations.

1104
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,270
If you haven't checked those MCP servers,

1105
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,350
I strongly recommend you do.

1106
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,930
It shows you the different range of things

1107
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,930
that you can give access to your agents.

1108
00:41:53,306 --> 00:41:54,639
Okay, that's it.

1109
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,653
So any questions?

1110
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,313
Yes.

1111
00:42:02,556 --> 00:42:07,530
- [Audience Member] (indistinct).

1112
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,270
- [Omar] Yeah, so your question is

1113
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,340
you're already using a lot
of these services and tools,

1114
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,593
what's the value of
using a security agent?

1115
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,557
- [Audience Member]
Basically (indistinct).

1116
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:24,713
- [Omar] Yeah, is it automated currently?

1117
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,693
Okay.

1118
00:42:26,693 --> 00:42:29,760
- [Shawn] Yeah, so I guess
the complexity of setting up

1119
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,550
the automation in terms
of are you automating

1120
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,354
remediation security findings?

1121
00:42:34,354 --> 00:42:38,521
- [Audience Member] (indistinct).

1122
00:42:52,672 --> 00:42:53,970
- [Shawn] Yeah, no, it's
definitely a good concern.

1123
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,410
If you want, let's connect after.

1124
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,523
I'm curious to explore
more about the tools,

1125
00:42:56,523 --> 00:42:58,080
what you're doing and
then how this would fit

1126
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,010
in the overall.

1127
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,840
There's some questions I wanna ask you.

1128
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,670
Yeah, appreciate the question.

1129
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,720
Any other questions?

1130
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,311
Yes.

1131
00:43:05,311 --> 00:43:09,478
- [Audience Member] (indistinct).

1132
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,480
- [Shawn] Yeah, for
registry specification,

1133
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,220
is this related to registering tools

1134
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,543
or what is this relate to?

1135
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,833
- [Omar] Are you currently using that?

1136
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,840
Are you currently doing a
registry for your for setup?

1137
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,673
- [Audience Member] It's my headache

1138
00:43:22,673 --> 00:43:26,393
because trying to allow
authentication to the agent,

1139
00:43:27,494 --> 00:43:29,384
let's say we might (indistinct).

1140
00:43:29,384 --> 00:43:30,217
- [Omar] Yeah.

1141
00:43:30,217 --> 00:43:31,894
- [Audience Member] And I
think we need have a unified

1142
00:43:31,894 --> 00:43:34,394
(indistinct).

1143
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,700
- [Omar] Yeah, so I know with AgentCore,

1144
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,320
it's not in this specific slide,

1145
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,610
but there's also a core component,

1146
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,440
a future called AgentCore Identity.

1147
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,970
And that's one thing where we could unify

1148
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:47,130
the different access and authentication

1149
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,563
for our agents within that area.

1150
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,020
And if you want, we
could, I could dive deeper

1151
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,020
after the talk about how that
works at a higher level, yeah.

1152
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,283
Yes.

1153
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:02,093
We'll go this way and then
we'll come back to you.

1154
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,267
- [Audience Member] So in
the cloud (indistinct).

1155
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,840
- [Omar] So is it more of,

1156
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,520
is ensuring that the agent is up to date

1157
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,470
with your infrastructure environment?

1158
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,470
Like your Terraform.

1159
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,160
- [Audience Member] Like
just for like, I guess

1160
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,770
a naive example like
let's say a (indistinct)

1161
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,380
or some environment sitting
in a Terraform configuration

1162
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,140
somewhere in a natural workflow,

1163
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,108
like totally separate thing.

1164
00:44:27,108 --> 00:44:29,058
And then there's an event (indistinct).

1165
00:44:36,045 --> 00:44:36,910
- [Omar] Oh, I see what you're saying.

1166
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,520
- [Audience Member]
Configuration reflects reality.

1167
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,890
How should I think about
that in this environment

1168
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:44,622
where an agent is potentially
making 10 changes,

1169
00:44:44,622 --> 00:44:45,690
dozens of changes a day?

1170
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,540
- [Omar] Yeah, yeah, and
that's one thing I recommend

1171
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,550
for production environment changes

1172
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,040
at the current state of
agents and how they operate.

1173
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,440
That's one thing where we
would look at implementing

1174
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,600
the human in the loop where
look at the different changes,

1175
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,250
recommendations and then
you implementing them

1176
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,300
manually yourself within the environment.

1177
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,830
- [Shawn] There's still some
necessity for human in the loop

1178
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:05,970
when it comes to that
'cause you don't want

1179
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,730
automated remediation
happening behind your back,

1180
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:09,563
you know what I mean?

1181
00:45:09,563 --> 00:45:12,052
And then you have to go reconcile that.

1182
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:12,885
- [Omar] Yeah, yeah, we're getting there.

1183
00:45:12,885 --> 00:45:14,850
Hopefully the, maybe next
year you could automate

1184
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:15,683
the whole stack.

1185
00:45:15,683 --> 00:45:17,820
But as of now, we take
those recommendations

1186
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,920
of what changes need to be made

1187
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,560
and you could actually feed
the Terraform code to you.

1188
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,640
So you could have the Terraform code,

1189
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,620
you could review it and then feed it

1190
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,780
and upload it to your main code repository

1191
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,773
and then sync that.

1192
00:45:29,718 --> 00:45:30,990
- [Audience Member] Perfect, all right.

1193
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,550
Can you have the agent, you know,

1194
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,187
run through the same (indistinct)?

1195
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,950
- [Shawn] You could.

1196
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:38,910
- [Audience Member] Then
you wouldn't have any drift

1197
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,050
because the agent would be, you know,

1198
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,370
using Terraform in the same way

1199
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:42,990
that you are using Terraform, right?

1200
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:43,823
- [Shawn] Exactly, yeah.

1201
00:45:43,823 --> 00:45:46,500
So you could have a, let's say
part of the overall solution,

1202
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,000
you could have an agent
that specifically is

1203
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,740
working to developing and working with

1204
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,270
that specific environment.

1205
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:53,973
So that's true, that's
also another option, yeah.

1206
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,224
- [Omar] Had a question over here.

1207
00:45:56,224 --> 00:46:00,740
- [Audience Member] Yeah, (indistinct).

1208
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,550
- [Shawn] Into Security Lake?

1209
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,750
Or with other sources
besides Security Lake?

1210
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,590
I'd have to double check on that.

1211
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:12,060
Let me talk with you afterwards to see

1212
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,400
what other sources that
you might be trying to use.

1213
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,310
I know that most of those resources,

1214
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,200
people have been centralizing
them within Security Lake,

1215
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,560
but is there a reason why you
want to keep them separate

1216
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,830
from Security Lake?

1217
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,050
- [Audience Member] (indistinct).

1218
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,050
- [Shawn] I'm sorry?

1219
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:31,227
- [Audience Member] (indistinct).

1220
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:37,890
- [Shawn] Gotcha, I'd have
to double check on that one

1221
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,350
for you and I'll get back to you on it.

1222
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:42,570
Yeah, did you have
something to say on that?

1223
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:45,113
- [Omar] No, I'll talk to
him after, I couldn't hear.

1224
00:46:46,358 --> 00:46:48,113
- [Audience Member] So just
to summarize at this time,

1225
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:54,579
should we say that this technically
monitor for information?

1226
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,340
- [Shawn] Yeah, I'd say at this time it's

1227
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,320
more of not only monitoring

1228
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,180
but also doing the correlation for you.

1229
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,440
Like for example, jumping between

1230
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,400
the different data sources,

1231
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,360
running the SQL queries

1232
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,890
and actually looking at the correlations

1233
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,710
between this specific
security group being deleted,

1234
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,450
tied to specific IPs.

1235
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,280
So a lot of that grunt work of doing

1236
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,803
that manual process
definitely could be automated.

1237
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,670
And even the,

1238
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,920
in terms of like actually automating

1239
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,460
the infrastructure as
code and deploying things,

1240
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,410
that's something that
the Claude MCP server

1241
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,490
actually has access to, right?

1242
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:27,630
It could write Terraform for you

1243
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,580
and actually execute it and run it.

1244
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,350
But again, back to the
point of at this time,

1245
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,820
like you were saying,

1246
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,790
I wouldn't feel confident
enough with agents

1247
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,900
to actually perform production changes

1248
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,250
without me actually
looking at what it's doing.

1249
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,702
Awesome, should we, let's
go ahead and wrap it up.

1250
00:47:46,702 --> 00:47:47,790
- [Omar] Let's wrap it up, yeah.

1251
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:50,880
- [Shawn] So hopefully
some of that was useful,

1252
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,460
you know, to the people in the room,

1253
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,590
and on the left-hand side we have

1254
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:56,700
our Strands Getting Started.

1255
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,210
You know, this is all of the
documentation and everything

1256
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,190
you'll need to build an
experiment with Strands

1257
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:03,690
if you'd like to test
something like this out

1258
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,130
in your own environment,

1259
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:07,590
highly recommend getting
hands on and doing so.

1260
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,510
And if you're also
interested in deploying,

1261
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,700
you know, Strands Agents
to the Amazon Bedrock,

1262
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,170
AgentCore Runtime,

1263
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:16,260
please scan the QR code
on the right-hand side.

1264
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,810
This gives you the
operationalized capabilities

1265
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:21,240
to test this in your own AWS environment.

1266
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,933
Everything that you need to
get started is right there.

1267
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,010
And then one last thing I
wanna leave you all with.

1268
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:32,250
If you haven't heard of
SkillBuilder.AWS yet,

1269
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,960
whether you're new to
the cloud or new to AWS

1270
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,640
or just want to get some hands-on,

1271
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,780
more hands-on experience
to enable yourself,

1272
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,300
we've got thousands of free,
different learning resources,

1273
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,760
hands-on labs, immersive,
real-life situations

1274
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,880
where you can get that experience
to build these things out.

1275
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,800
If you're pursuing an AWS certification

1276
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,870
and need some extra
tools to study for that,

1277
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:54,000
we also have that available on our site.

1278
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,160
And if you need to validate
some practical skills

1279
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,240
for some micro-credentials,

1280
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,460
whether that's for
yourself or for your team,

1281
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,770
if you need that, that's also available

1282
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,153
on AWS Skill Builder.

1283
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,350
So with that, we'd like
to thank you all so much

1284
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:10,470
for joining us today and
if you have any questions,

1285
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:11,711
thank you.

1286
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:12,544
(audience applauds)

1287
00:49:12,544 --> 00:49:13,590
And great job, Omar.

1288
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:15,300
If you have any questions, we'll be here

1289
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,590
for the next 10 minutes.

1290
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,640
Please feel free to come by.

1291
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,870
We'd love to chat with you.

1292
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,220
If we didn't get to one of your questions,

1293
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,980
mentioned we wanna talk to
you, please stick around.

1294
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,690
We'd love to chat.

1295
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:25,920
Hope you all enjoy the rest of re:Invent.

1296
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,323
Thank you.
- [Omar] Thank you.
