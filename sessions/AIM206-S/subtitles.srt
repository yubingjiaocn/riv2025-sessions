1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,210
- Hey, folks, hope you're
all having a great day.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,960
So it's been a very buzzing morning.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,200
I think there are a lot
of sessions going around.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,340
Just to give a quick introduction.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,400
I'm Ananth and I'm part of the
leadership in ManageEngine,

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,060
which is one of the major
divisions in Zoho Corporation.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,490
Today I'm here to talk about
one of the most important

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,090
and engaging aspects that
impacts the day-to-day operations

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,480
of most of the modern-day
digital businesses.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,930
And that's nothing but AI,
so at the end of the day.

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,270
But here's the interesting part,

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,320
it has two sides.

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,720
So it has two sides, two perspectives.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,630
And only when you kind
of bring them together

15
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,390
and introspect a lot more on that,

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,810
you'll get the real value out of it.

17
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,250
So let me not begin with
the definition to bore you,

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,513
but with a question.

19
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,840
If AI is the watcher, who
is really watching AI?

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,813
So this has been stayed
with me for quite some time.

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,543
If you look at the systems,

22
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:05,190
like there are so many
booths running here,

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,770
so many networking done over here.

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,630
They're no longer small or simple.

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,550
It's pretty clear. So what did we do?

26
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,430
Like we handed over some of the jobs to AI

27
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,430
to maybe detect the
anomalies that are happening

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,950
with maybe a Wi-Fi connection problem

29
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,630
across any sort of a booth.

30
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,970
And even fix them to certain extent,

31
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,030
like automate them in
an autonomous manner.

32
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,510
But on the hindsight, on the
flip side, if you look at this,

33
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,850
what happens if the AI itself goes wrong?

34
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,000
So that is something that is
kind of a lot more interesting

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,670
and when it does, in
most of the situation,

36
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,700
it doesn't give you a very
big alarming red flag and all.

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,933
It fails very quietly.

38
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,760
So this is the reason we
always think about this part

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,940
in ManageEngine and a lot of
products across the ecosystem

40
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,620
and we keep introspecting.

41
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,470
And I wanted to share my thought process

42
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,510
on both the sides of the story.

43
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,830
So on one side, it'll be
more on how observability

44
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,060
is powered by AI and how it
helps us to manage the chaos

45
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,410
and on the other side,

46
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,080
how observability for
AI itself is required

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,340
and it's more crucial

48
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,980
so that we can keep AI itself in check.

49
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,360
On the due process,

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,700
I will try to share some exciting stories

51
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,070
or usual stories that you
would've already heard

52
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,600
but closer to AI part,

53
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,730
I'll try to present my thought process

54
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,733
and take this as engaging as possible.

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,290
So let me just rewind for a moment.

56
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,960
I think that we have a
lot of veterans over here,

57
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,960
so if you rewind yourself,
take yourself maybe a decade

58
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,350
or two back, monitoring was pretty simple.

59
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,930
So we had a set of monolithic applications

60
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,120
that got deployed in cluster set up

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,820
or grid set up in colocation data centers.

62
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,130
And you have networking that is done

63
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,580
across all the applications
and bytes being captured

64
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,100
and you used to record a lot of things

65
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,960
so that whenever there is a problem,

66
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,100
you get the root cause analysis

67
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,720
from the monitoring solutions

68
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,450
and you kind of go towards
it, try to figure out

69
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,420
what is the problem and we
kind of sometimes take the logs

70
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,390
and debug it and fix it and life moved on.

71
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,540
But if you look at the current scenario,

72
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,120
it is no longer this simple.

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,550
The reason being we have
multiple cloud providers

74
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,383
apart from AWS,

75
00:03:18,383 --> 00:03:21,000
we have multiple cloud
providers with multiple regions,

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,833
and what is the problem

77
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,620
is like you are being
given the option to deploy

78
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,000
in just a click of a button.

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,370
And apart from this containerization,

80
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,500
you have thousands of
containers spawning up

81
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,150
and down on a random basis,

82
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,580
which sometime goes out of control.

83
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,630
And moving from here, you
have containers calling APIs

84
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,600
and the APIs are calling
other APIs in endless chains

85
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,550
in the agentic era.

86
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,090
And finally, you have a set of users

87
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,920
and behaviors of users

88
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,540
who leave the app the moment
it is spotted to be slow.

89
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,510
So if you consider this entire scenario,

90
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,510
it's no longer a system anymore,
it is more of like a jungle

91
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,010
that we are actually dealing with.

92
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,830
So full stack observability
is some sort of a solution

93
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,050
that we are trying to
figure out still to kind

94
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,150
of map this jungle.

95
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,470
And if you ask me whether we
can navigate this jungle easily

96
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,600
by creating more dashboards or more alerts

97
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,980
or more workflows, the answer
is going to be a big no.

98
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,860
It is going to be how
efficiently we use AI

99
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,860
to solve and automate this entire workflow

100
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,313
as much as possible.

101
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,520
So you see that there is a lot

102
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,550
of ecosystem-related
problem in this scenario,

103
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,530
but AI acts like a copilot.

104
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,710
So most of the people fail to
realize the fact it acts more

105
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,140
of like a copilot to the existing humans

106
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,060
in the observability ecosystem.

107
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,400
So it scans millions of
events that are going

108
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,630
to go across networks, end
user experience, servers,

109
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,083
applications and it scans
almost all the events,

110
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,410
correlate all those events together

111
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,090
and clusters those signals

112
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,180
and helps us to connect
the dots across every layer

113
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,710
in the application ecosystem.

114
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,500
And sometimes it even helps us to predict

115
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,880
what might break next.

116
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,440
So that's the most important aspect

117
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,633
that we actually rely on AI for.

118
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,630
So it is more of like

119
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,250
if you check out this
particular visualization,

120
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,620
it acts like a traffic control system

121
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,450
in case of the modern digital world.

122
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,160
There could be thousands of planes

123
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,870
that are actually flying across the sky.

124
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,890
You are facing a lot of
delays right now in flight

125
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,990
and there are a lot of
cancellations happening.

126
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,950
But if you look at AI, it
helps us to spot exactly

127
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,500
what are the flights that we
have to look into right now

128
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,170
to make sure we give a
convenient experience

129
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,480
to the customer at the end of the day.

130
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,159
So this could be a little
bit like a gibberish kind

131
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,230
of an example.

132
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,775
So I'll just give you an
AI-on-AI event routine

133
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:55,980
that happens on a routine basis
just before the re:Invent.

134
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,420
I've been driving here for a decade

135
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,670
so every time when I come here,

136
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,150
I see Black Friday
happening the week before.

137
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,100
So just imagine that you're
using an e-commerce app

138
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,700
and you are actually kind of
doing a promotional aspect,

139
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,470
like say you're doing a marketing campaign

140
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,880
for a discounted product,

141
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,100
say that is an (indistinct) premium

142
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,070
or a Omera Premium that is being sent out

143
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,110
for 50% off, who doesn't like it?

144
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,470
So a lot of users just come
in and bombard your app

145
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,580
and they all face a
single checkout problem

146
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,550
at some point of time
when the load is going

147
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,653
to be unimaginably huge.

148
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,830
So with traditional monitoring systems,

149
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,410
this situation could turn
out to be a big chaos.

150
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,250
So what you'll get

151
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,170
is like you'll have a
single pane of glass,

152
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,370
like it's a common word
and you'll have CPU memory

153
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,340
or API response team,
everything will be spiking up

154
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,580
and again, your operations team,

155
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,590
tensions will also be flying very high

156
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,780
and they'll be coming to a single desk

157
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,210
and they'll be collating all this data

158
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,820
but by the time they arrive at a solution,

159
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,010
you would've lost all those users

160
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,960
who are actually in a checkout process

161
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,570
and millions of dollars will be also out

162
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,913
of your bank balance
at the end of the day.

163
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,620
So what you got to realize
is like how can we do better

164
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,590
with AI-powered observability
in this scenario?

165
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,390
So with solutions

166
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,090
that actually have
AI-powered observability,

167
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,030
it kind of seamlessly brings together

168
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,590
all the events together,

169
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,630
correlates among itself

170
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,480
and gives you an efficient
root cause analysis

171
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,520
in a smaller timeframe.

172
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,990
So that is the most important aspect

173
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,750
because if you're doing
it all in a manual manner,

174
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,390
it takes a longer time
to uncover a problem

175
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,890
than you do it with AI.

176
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,020
So that's the best part you get from that.

177
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,090
And once you get the RCA,

178
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,650
maybe the RCA is kind of figuring out

179
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,180
to a normal broke query
that is routinely happening

180
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,950
or it can also kind of suggest
you capacity-related issues

181
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,600
and give you the suggestions

182
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,940
on how much you got to
provision appropriately

183
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,340
to get out of the situation.

184
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,700
But wait, so AI is doing
all these jobs for you

185
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,580
but what happens, the
root cause analysis itself

186
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,450
can drag you down to a
different problem statement.

187
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,200
So we used to face this more often.

188
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,180
So like we have seen
these problems happening

189
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,130
in our own production
ecosystem inside Zoho,

190
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,660
as well as ManageEngine.

191
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,630
Like, it'll give us a anomaly

192
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,163
or else a false prediction,

193
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:32,250
which takes our entire operation team

194
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,590
towards a completely different direction.

195
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,030
It's more of like a ghost hunting trial

196
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,650
if you look at the situation.

197
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,590
They will go towards one
particular problem statement.

198
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,400
And the scariest part here
is like when AI is failing,

199
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,080
it fails with utmost confidence.

200
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,930
It makes you believe
that I'm always right.

201
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,237
I think most of you folks
would've used ChatGPT

202
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:54,030
and you would've believed its responses.

203
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,730
On the hindsight, it's
a view, you may think

204
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,520
that you might have a different assumption

205
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,680
but you won't question
the assumption of ChatGPT

206
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,860
because it's having huge
amount of data to work on

207
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,820
to give you the right answer,

208
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,330
so you keep believing in that scenario.

209
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,210
So imagine this side of the story as well.

210
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,460
So I use a lot of weather apps,

211
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,150
so on a routine basis I
rely on it to book meetings

212
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,690
and go across zones to
actually meet customers.

213
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,860
So just imagine that I need
to go to New York right now.

214
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,290
So there's a huge snowfall
happening in New York,

215
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,120
so it is a given event.

216
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,780
Say I plan about this almost
a week ahead right now

217
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,520
and I am planning to go to New York

218
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,230
in the December, third week.

219
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,050
My weather app states that there
is not going to be any sort

220
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,690
of a snowfall that is going to
happen in New York right now.

221
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,300
So the problem here is
like I take a flight,

222
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,150
I go and land, I make a
check-in and wait for two

223
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,920
or three days to meet my customer

224
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,380
but suddenly, there is a huge snowfall

225
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,080
and there is a pile of snowfall
that is getting piled up

226
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,270
and there are missions that are trying

227
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,000
to actually clear the
snowfall problem for you.

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,020
So my entire week is gone just
without meeting the customer

229
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,960
because they cannot come out,
I cannot get to their place

230
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,830
and that is a pretty much like
a very big problem statement.

231
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,440
Now, if you think, whether
the weather app is wrong,

232
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,600
no, the weather app has been in use

233
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,490
for more than a couple of decades.

234
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,820
I cannot question it but the
problem here is like the model

235
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,400
that is used to forecast
this weather pattern

236
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,350
could have gone without any update

237
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,910
or else just consider the API

238
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,280
that the weather app itself relies on

239
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,800
to actually collect the
data, to update the model.

240
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,050
Maybe that has gone out of service.

241
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,770
All these details are
actually kind of hidden gems

242
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,380
or hidden dragons which
do not get uncovered

243
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,970
in most of the scenarios.

244
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,690
And this is where we
could go for observability

245
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,373
for AI search.

246
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,740
So what do I mean by
observability for AI search?

247
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,080
Just like we monitor the CPU memory,

248
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,390
all those infrastructure-related metrics

249
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,150
to make sure that everything is healthy

250
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:11,150
and it is in sanity, we have
to actually have a close eye

251
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:12,720
or a third eye on top

252
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,550
of all the AI-related workflows

253
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,070
and its behaviors on a continuous manner.

254
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,140
If AI is part of your tech stack,

255
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,660
you need to have same level of visibility

256
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,000
and data collection that
you have already had

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,180
for a existing tech stack all the time.

258
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,310
So how do we do this?

259
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,900
Now, I will just take you
through a classic example

260
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,190
of how we do
infrastructure-based auto scaling

261
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,890
nowadays in most of the scenarios.

262
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,230
Just consider that you
have an operations team

263
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,380
and it has actually created a blueprint

264
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,860
for doing auto-scaling that is AI driven

265
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,630
for your entire Kubernetes ecosystem.

266
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,463
And they have run

267
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:55,800
this AI-driven auto
scaling multiple times.

268
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,050
It is bulletproof, stress tested

269
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,913
for multiple overnight scenarios.

270
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,900
Your operations team has been
loaded with a lot of work

271
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,370
for the entire Black Friday.

272
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,510
They're kind of exhausted

273
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,640
and they want to take
a Thanksgiving weekend

274
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,140
without taxing them off.

275
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,640
So what they do

276
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,670
is like they turn on this
auto scaling mode button

277
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,050
and enable this blueprint

278
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,533
and they go on a vacation
for those couple of days.

279
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,410
All of a sudden, at some
particular point, you see that lot

280
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,100
of resources get provisioned
by this auto scaling mode

281
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,980
and it is due to some sort of a pattern

282
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,700
that is being misread by
AI to be considering it

283
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,443
to be an auto scaling scenario.

284
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:42,030
And this particular spike,
if you consider this pattern,

285
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,580
sometimes there could be periodic spikes

286
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,730
that happens within a
particular hour itself.

287
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,060
So that is a concept
in the cloud ecosystem

288
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,060
where if you rotate the
resources on a continuous basis

289
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,570
within a particular hour,

290
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,270
you get charged for the entire hour.

291
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,260
So what happens here

292
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,280
is like say there are 10 auto
scaling incidents happening

293
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,310
within an hour and it continues
to happen for 48 hours,

294
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,870
you're going to end up with
500 auto-scaling events

295
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,200
within the time your
operation team gets back

296
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,370
on a Monday morning.

297
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:22,230
So they'll be staring at a huge
cloud bill and I pity them.

298
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,590
So what we could have done
differently with observability

299
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,360
for AI over here.

300
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,860
So we could have identified
this anomaly detection pattern

301
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,310
by the AI-based auto
scaling system earlier

302
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,590
and we could have merged this context

303
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,650
with traditional monitoring data

304
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,790
to actually consider this

305
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,000
to be a sustained peak
in most of the scenarios.

306
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,710
And we could have provisioned systems

307
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,840
that could run on a permanent basis

308
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,270
and at the end of the day, we
could have saved a lot more

309
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,220
on your cloud bill.

310
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,600
So this takes us to the
heart of the subject.

311
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,490
So measuring what really matters
is going to be the agenda

312
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,760
that you gotta have when
you're taking both sides

313
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,240
on AI-powered observability
and observability for AI.

314
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,750
The first side is more
of the classic ones,

315
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,090
which is going to be more
of observability metrics,

316
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,760
CPU memory, already have
repeated all those things,

317
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,770
you already know about all those things.

318
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,070
And this helps us to make sure
that the system is healthy

319
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,750
and available all the time.

320
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,660
The second part is something
that is going to be new

321
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,730
that you got to be a lot
more interested about.

322
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,420
It's going to be the
drift prediction rate,

323
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,680
confidence levels and last
but not the least, cost.

324
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,860
So these metrics will help us to make sure

325
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,580
that we can continue trusting
AI for making the decisions

326
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,870
for us and we should also
consider another fact

327
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,610
where at scale whether
AI will run at a rate

328
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,680
which we consider to be a sustainable one.

329
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,920
So sustainability is one more
thing that we need to consider

330
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,110
as a factor in case of AI world.

331
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,690
This is one of the
reasons why we always feel

332
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,890
that FinOps is one of the
major players in the AI world

333
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,200
as we all know that we are never blessed

334
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,883
with infinite budgets.

335
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,620
Now, only when you bring these two sides,

336
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,650
I spoke about two different parts together

337
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,510
as part of a single coin

338
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,180
or maybe consider these
two different aspects

339
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,620
as a single entity,

340
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,020
you'll begin to see the
real value out of it.

341
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,780
So if you check out
AI-powered observability,

342
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,930
it gives us speed, scale, and foresight

343
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,550
in most of the situations.

344
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,790
And observability for AI gives us trust,

345
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,100
reliability and accountability.

346
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,900
And together you actually kind

347
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,390
of get the full picture of observability

348
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,990
and it gets completed when
you consider both the sites

349
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,240
because going forward,
it's never going to be

350
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,870
about infrastructure and
applications alone anymore.

351
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,690
It's going to be infra, applications

352
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,773
and AI that unifies them into
a single intelligent system.

353
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,560
This is the reason, like
we have followed this

354
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,630
as an expectation at ManageEngine

355
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,850
and we have built our item suite

356
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,343
with this exact thought process.

357
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,930
We use AI to seamlessly integrate

358
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:23,340
and correlate all the signals
across applications, users

359
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,250
and infrastructure in order to reduce

360
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,830
or cut the noise for the enterprises

361
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,250
and help them focus on
exactly what's needed

362
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,300
with a comprehensive suite of solutions

363
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,380
that is going to be more
than like 60 plus products

364
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,600
with complete focus on solving

365
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,990
or covering all the aspects
of enterprise IT management.

366
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,960
With an integrated suite, we
follow a holistic approach

367
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,220
to AI adoption where we kind
of mix all the distress signals

368
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,960
from across the ecosystem

369
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,993
and we create a value in a unified manner.

370
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,790
So let me leave you with this
thought process for the day:

371
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,150
future of observability is not going

372
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,490
to be about humans versus AI,

373
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,270
it's going to be more about
humans working with AI

374
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,890
as active enablers.

375
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,190
At the end of the day, we
all know that we cannot fix

376
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,960
what we don't measure,

377
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,470
and AI is going to need the help of humans

378
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,530
to measure what's really needed.

379
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:29,310
So hope you got some valuable
sort of information today.

380
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,600
Thanks for coming over.

381
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,160
I'd be more than happy to meet you guys

382
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,070
in our ManageEngine
booth, which is at 147.

383
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,270
Have a great week ahead.
