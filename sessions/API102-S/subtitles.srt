1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,390
- Alright, so we're gonna dig into lessons

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,670
from the leaders in Agentic AI.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,670
And so my name's Roger Primo,
I lead corporate strategy

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,220
for IBM and a lot of our strategy,

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,310
we've been on this journey
for the last several years.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,390
Going back to 2020,

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,460
we declared this hybrid
cloud and AI strategy.

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,710
And obviously with cloud we also know

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,570
so much being here at re:Invent.

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,590
In 2020 we got this question
of why AI, why not blockchain,

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,670
why not VR, all these things.

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,990
I think today everybody
understands the necessity of AI

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,970
and I'm just gonna try and
get these slides to start.

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,020
Let's see if it goes.

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,460
And what we're seeing in, I
lead our corporate strategy team

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,250
and what we've looked
at is this technology

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,080
and understanding

18
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,470
how does it compare versus
prior generations technology.

19
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,480
And I think there's a
lot of buzz in the market

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,920
around agentic AI.

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,420
People have heard so much.

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,720
I think the message, if I could
leave anyone with today is

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,760
if you're starting, keep going

24
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,383
and we're gonna hear real
examples from companies

25
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:00,480
that have applied this technology

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,580
to change their business for the better.

27
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,720
But if you're one of the many

28
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,780
that MIT put out the
famous study that only 5%

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,150
of companies are getting value from AI,

30
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,440
if you're one of that 95%,
that's not getting value,

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,020
the time is now to start changing that

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,730
because the companies that are starting

33
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,030
to use this technology, the
advantages are compounding.

34
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,740
And we're seeing real examples

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,920
inside IBM's business, in
our client's businesses,

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,480
in the market where agentic AI is far more

37
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,940
disruptive than any technology

38
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,470
generation that's coming before.

39
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,960
It will come faster, it'll
touch more businesses,

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,990
more categories, more
industries than any technology

41
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,270
disruption we've seen before.

42
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,730
And so if you are among that 95%

43
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,767
that haven't truly turned GenAI

44
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:49,710
and now agentic into value,
to me the real question from

45
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,710
that MIT study is not, why
are 95% not getting value?

46
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,370
It's what are the 5% that are doing

47
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,860
and how can we learn from them

48
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,953
before they put the laggards
of adoption outta business?

49
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,990
If I had one framework to
think about this, we've used

50
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,380
this idea of raising the
floor and breaking the ceiling

51
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,750
and we'll have Mark come up
in a second talking about

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,820
both of those working together.

53
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,520
But this technology changes.

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,810
Your best process today is
your worst process tomorrow.

55
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,240
And I'd say that when my
corporate strategy teams

56
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,950
looked around the world at success cases

57
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,170
and adopting this technology,

58
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,920
what's fascinating is there's
almost no industry sector

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,500
that's not among the ones that
have gotten value from it.

60
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,480
Because in those raise
the floor use cases,

61
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,910
there's real value and
we'll talk about it.

62
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,280
The main patterns are in
things like customer service,

63
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,620
back office, and code development.

64
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,350
Every company in the world has customers.

65
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,960
Every company in the
world has a back office.

66
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,630
Today, most companies
in the world write code.

67
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,210
The patterns are there to create value.

68
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,610
I think what I've seen as a
failure mode is companies take

69
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,280
on an exotic break the ceiling use case,

70
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,190
but they haven't solved
things like data access

71
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,050
and security skills in their business

72
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,820
to implement this technology.

73
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,400
Trying to burden the creative
use case that should come

74
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,340
for your business with
these technical challenges

75
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,570
sometimes becomes too heavy.

76
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,270
So start with a lot of
those proven patterns.

77
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,160
Or if you're an innovator
like Mark, you can start

78
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,110
by breaking the ceiling if
you really have the vision

79
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,910
and persistence to drive through it.

80
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,060
To me, this metaphor at
the bottom of the page,

81
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,400
I think we all know about Moore's law.

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,310
I think agents reduce
this translation barrier.

83
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,550
So many times where we've been
anchored in human processes

84
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,550
and it's what slows down
business innovation.

85
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,210
The agents don't care
about your prior processes.

86
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,700
They'll learn how to deliver
for the best outcomes

87
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,920
if you can create the evaluation

88
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,900
frameworks that tell them where to go.

89
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,150
And to me, the translation barriers

90
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,070
between Moore's Law
and the actual outcomes

91
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,780
for business shrink.

92
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,150
And so I think it means that this cliche

93
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,730
of every company being
a technology company

94
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,493
has never been more true
than this agentic era.

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,140
If I just broke down, how
does this come to life?

96
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,570
Let's take a look at
the classics of people,

97
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,893
process and systems.

98
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,130
And while there's a lot that
we can say on all these topics,

99
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,230
I just say two things.

100
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,700
On process, it is this notion
of optimizing to outcomes,

101
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,533
not processes.

102
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:24,780
If I look at prior generations
of digital transformation

103
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,340
or cloud transformation, one of the things

104
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,760
that held companies back is
they're anchored in today's

105
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,100
workflow and they're
incremental on improving

106
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,110
on what they do today.

107
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,740
The agents don't have that anchoring.

108
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,950
If we tell them the right
outcomes to optimize for,

109
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,410
they will shatter today's
processes that hold us back.

110
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,463
They'll find new creative
ways to implement,

111
00:04:45,463 --> 00:04:49,230
they'll deliver value in
ways that a traditional kind

112
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,413
of human driven engineering
process may have never found.

113
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,560
On the right side of the page,

114
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,630
this is how we've implemented a lot

115
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,690
of it in IBM's business and
I'll spend a minute on that.

116
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,110
But this technology touches
every layer of the business.

117
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,360
At the base, individual
productivity workers,

118
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,980
this is part of the toolkit
of the modern worker.

119
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,390
I grew up early in my career,
I sat next to the former CEO

120
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,540
of my employer and he'd kind
of come up in the 70s and 80s,

121
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,600
and every day he had
his assistant print out

122
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,330
all of his emails and then he'd read them

123
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,320
and he'd scroll notes on him

124
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,900
and his assistant would
type those back in.

125
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,020
If we're not the adopt,
if he didn't adopt email

126
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,570
and it held back how he'd
communicate in a modern era.

127
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,230
If we're not all the users
of this technology every day,

128
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,080
we talk a lot internally at
IBM of if the first attempt

129
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,750
of using the tool, when you prompt it,

130
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,490
it doesn't give you the right answer.

131
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,370
Learn how to prompt it to
get better on the next wave.

132
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,350
And if it still gives
you the wrong answer,

133
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,760
after a couple of attempts,

134
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,910
pass that feedback to the development team

135
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,650
so they can meet, create a better

136
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,090
experience in the next wave of it.

137
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,700
But every knowledge worker has to know how

138
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,590
to use this technology.

139
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,120
At the center layer on
the right side of it.

140
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,970
If we think about end-to-end
business processes,

141
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,210
there's so much optimization
there that can happen.

142
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,809
And it creates ways for
if it's your CFO, CHRO,

143
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:15,630
et cetera, ways for them to optimize

144
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,770
and create new ways

145
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,460
of serving the business
in their various domains.

146
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,580
And inside our business
we see general managers

147
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,790
and CEOs that are using that
insights and decisions layer,

148
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,430
being able to look at
the cumulative effect

149
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,050
of that generative AI deployed

150
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,960
to the individual worker,
to enterprise processes.

151
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,660
And then being able to look
at it in an integrated fashion

152
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,520
across the entire business.

153
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,230
So CEO can ask the question of

154
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,390
how do I make my business better?

155
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,460
And the agents get up to work on asking

156
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,820
that question in a way that
touches the entire business

157
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,000
and comes back with an
answer sometimes in minutes.

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,110
Versus if we were to ask
individual leaders come back

159
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,088
with 10 ideas on how we become better,

160
00:06:57,088 --> 00:07:00,150
that's often a multi-month
process in so many businesses.

161
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,420
So the rate and pace of that
top of the pyramid of insights

162
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,160
and decisions works so much faster

163
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,110
and so much broader than it did before.

164
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,390
Since we're at re:Invent,
I want to talk a little bit

165
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,100
about the technical foundation of this,

166
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,790
because there's so much
innovation occurring

167
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,390
across AWS, across the
edge, at data centers,

168
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,740
across other cloud providers,

169
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,050
across SaaS applications.

170
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,730
One simple thing I'd leave you

171
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,860
with from a technical perspective is one

172
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,500
of the things we know about agents is

173
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,320
that if I give agents more information

174
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,230
to make decisions on and
I give them more tools

175
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,710
and places they can take
action across my business,

176
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,753
they'll be more impactful
if I give them that breadth

177
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,670
of access.

178
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,260
And for most organizations in the world,

179
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,930
that means giving them
access to learn from data

180
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,370
that lives in those SaaS applications,

181
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,460
lives in AWS, lives in other clouds

182
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,840
and the ability to call tools

183
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,950
across all of those environments.

184
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,930
So we have to think differently about

185
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,990
how we platform engineer
our technical architecture

186
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,320
to provide that type of
access to the agents.

187
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,720
I'd also think if we think
about the IT environments

188
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,320
and the application environments
that our employees work in,

189
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,330
I'll talk about the IBM example,

190
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,230
but we swapped out our
core HR system at IBM.

191
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,510
All of our work was done
through an agentic interface.

192
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,390
Most employees in the company didn't know

193
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,030
that we changed our HR
provider behind the scenes

194
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,476
'cause they'd become so
accustomed to interacting

195
00:08:26,476 --> 00:08:29,340
with a conversational interface.

196
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,240
That interface of work is
changing from the application

197
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,430
to the conversation that
touches any application

198
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,370
or data in your business
regardless of where it lives.

199
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,746
So thinking about that way of working

200
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:41,220
and the technical layer

201
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,010
and how you think about your application

202
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,523
and technology environment
is critically important.

203
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,100
And then the last thing
I'll say is the data journey

204
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,120
is incredibly important.

205
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,050
So accessing both data quality,
data access, data permission

206
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,434
and security, how we think about
things like identity across

207
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:00,960
this environment so that
when an agent in one part

208
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,180
of your environment can have
a conversation with the other

209
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,309
and they can know that
that agent has permission

210
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:07,470
to have that conversation.

211
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,930
There's a lot of important
technical architecture work

212
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,110
that has to be done on this
foundation as a prerequisite

213
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,900
for success at scale with agentic.

214
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,320
That doesn't mean you can't
do pilots in specific areas,

215
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,020
but I think re-looking at

216
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,550
platform engineering in the agentic

217
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,203
context is critically important.

218
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,766
As an IBM example, we
wanna be the exemplars

219
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:33,480
of using this technology in our business.

220
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,000
We wanna be a best practice
example so we can feed it back

221
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,710
to our product teams
and our consulting teams

222
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,640
to help our clients, but then
also to improve our business.

223
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,560
And so all of this data
is publicly reported

224
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,090
in our audited financials.

225
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,580
So this is kind of the
real data behind it.

226
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,780
But we have raised our floor

227
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,360
and we're in the process
of breaking our ceiling.

228
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,830
In IBM by the end of this year,

229
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,540
the run rate of our business will be

230
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,030
four and a half billion dollars better

231
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,820
than it was just three or four years ago

232
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,380
based on a GenAI based

233
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,213
transformation of how we operate.

234
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,080
We've added enormous productivity into our

235
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,130
back office functions.

236
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,790
So today I do my HR work
in a tool called ASK HR,

237
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,500
which is basically an agentic interface

238
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,320
to those HR technologies
I discussed before.

239
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,350
The same is true in
finance, IT, procurement,

240
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,870
so many of the back office
functions that there's

241
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,450
so much data in so many businesses

242
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,050
that you can learn how to do it.

243
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,310
If it's customer service
and in code we're seeing

244
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,420
just new ways to innovate.

245
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,160
And I think those are well known in

246
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,230
many areas of the industry.

247
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,159
If I think about breaking
the ceiling, we're innovating

248
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,980
how we do consulting with something called

249
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,590
IBM Consulting Advantage built upon

250
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,790
our orchestrate platform,

251
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,240
which is our agentic orchestration layer.

252
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,280
We've changed how we do customer service.

253
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,820
We've built our own GenAI native IDE

254
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,100
that's driving both
productivity internally

255
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,750
and with a set of customers that are part

256
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,580
of the private preview of it.

257
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,396
So we're seeing both the
ability to fundamentally change

258
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:01,606
how we operate and how productive we are

259
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:06,090
and changing what we bring
to market with our clients.

260
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,730
The last thing I'd say
is these feed each other.

261
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,620
We're not taking all
the productivity money

262
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,540
and just distributing
it out to shareholders.

263
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,000
We're reinvesting that in innovation so

264
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,040
that break the ceiling can go faster.

265
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,653
And I do think for most
organizations in that room,

266
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,110
some version of that pattern,

267
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,910
it probably applies for you as well.

268
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,630
But there's hope. So
this has been so hard.

269
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,520
95% are failing.

270
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,578
There are some of these exemplars

271
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:32,880
and obviously this conference
is filled with a number

272
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,160
of people that'll talk about that success.

273
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,040
But if I had to synthesize
across the companies

274
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,930
that we've looked at
that have beaten the odds

275
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,860
and gotten value from this,

276
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,730
and I source it a lot from
our internal examples as well.

277
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,640
I think it comes from a set
of vision and leadership,

278
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,350
alignment from the top all the way down

279
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,403
to the individual employee
that's to use this technology.

280
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:55,740
It comes this notion of
purposeful processes.

281
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,440
I'll just say the kind
of anti-pattern there is.

282
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,750
So many companies I've spoken with,

283
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,440
they have a hundred, a
thousand GenAI pilots going

284
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,900
that live in disparate places.

285
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,130
But if they're in disparate places,

286
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,290
that means that the data quality work for

287
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,240
that one use case doesn't help the data

288
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,980
quality work for the next.

289
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,050
Thinking about these as
end-to-end processes so

290
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,310
that the work compounds, the
technology platform integrates

291
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,130
and the benefit accrues in
a much more systematic way,

292
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,863
we see as a pattern that
continues to be true.

293
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,420
Investing deeply in data
readiness and data quality.

294
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,286
We've spent a lot of time
working on our view of a customer

295
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,870
of an employee, of a product

296
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,170
to better represent it both
for traditional data analytics

297
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,420
and for generative AI.

298
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,500
Data quality is always a good
idea in so many businesses.

299
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,260
I think now there's so much
more of an agentic prize

300
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,306
to be gotten that if particular
data quality initiatives

301
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:54,030
couldn't make it over the line in your

302
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,840
organization a year or two ago,

303
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,360
today, the ROI is probably there

304
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,800
because there's so much more value

305
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,310
to be created with agentic.

306
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,290
The fourth is spending time
on that technical foundation.

307
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,110
And I talked about it, but
those little use cases that

308
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,900
so many companies went
down in their hundreds

309
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,860
or thousands of pilots, if
that one small use case has

310
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,350
to figure out the data security

311
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,410
and access challenge all unto itself,

312
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,940
it kind of crushes under its weight.

313
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,370
So there has to be this
technical maturity that is paired

314
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,000
with the use cases that you
pursue to be able to make sure

315
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,670
that we don't burden one use case

316
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,450
with the technical work that'll
benefit the entire business.

317
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,150
And the last thing I'd say
is there is a new development

318
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,340
model that's emerged and
we've worked to codify

319
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,900
what we've done internally.

320
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,950
I'll talk about a little bit.

321
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,170
We've worked with Anthropic to publish

322
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,690
what we call the age agentic
development lifecycle.

323
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,150
But the traditional software
development lifecycle,

324
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,370
which is very kind of linear,

325
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,140
doesn't lend itself as well here.

326
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,630
So it's much more of an
optimization learning cycle,

327
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,074
both in development and in production

328
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:02,910
that we think when you get to
that point of understanding

329
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,700
that begin with evaluations.

330
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,080
And those evaluations
mean the business outcome,

331
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,126
they mean the model cost
you're willing to spend,

332
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,800
the governance and security
boundaries that you wanna put

333
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,570
around this technology.

334
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,250
If you begin with the right eval framework

335
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,210
and the right experimentation
to get there, results follow.

336
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,390
So definitely recommend
kind of taking a fresh look

337
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,523
at the development methodology as well.

338
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,000
And I'll just say very quickly
I've hinted at some of this,

339
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,850
but we're living those best
practices in our business.

340
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,890
Everything from the CEO mandate through

341
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,836
to every employee in the company.

342
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:40,110
Leveraging generative AI,

343
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,933
starting with those processes
I talked about before.

344
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,110
Our technical foundation where we've used,

345
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,990
we are a hybrid cloud company
that runs across (indistinct)

346
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,300
our own data centers,
other cloud providers,

347
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,477
building that technical foundation

348
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:54,810
so we can bring innovation

349
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,120
everywhere that our business needs it.

350
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,620
And then helping to codify

351
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,390
and really understand that ADLC,

352
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,900
which is now the methodology
we use inside of our business,

353
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,850
you know, has been part of our journey.

354
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,040
So real quickly, if you
wanna learn more on ADLC,

355
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,740
I skipped one other project,
Bob, which is our GenAI IDE.

356
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,770
But that's one part of how
we're seeing profound results

357
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,110
in both how we develop code

358
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,770
and how we are getting much
more productive in our business.

359
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,071
And then WatsonX Orchestrate,

360
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:26,340
which is our agentic
orchestration platform

361
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,400
that runs across environments,
AWS in the data center

362
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,930
and other cloud providers to
bring agentic orchestration

363
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,780
and agent ops to basically any environment

364
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,520
where your business happens.

365
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,740
So with that, I said we'd
have lessons from the leaders

366
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,210
and hopefully that synthesis

367
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,370
that we've done in the
research was helpful.

368
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,630
But I wanna bring over
Mark Murphy, who's the CEO

369
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,950
of Claims Connection Group

370
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,870
to talk about a real world example of

371
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,940
how he's used this technology

372
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,130
to create real advantage in his business.

373
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:56,963
Mark.

374
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:00,787
(crowd clapping)

375
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,150
- So MIT meets boots on
the ground, my friend.

376
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,550
- MIT meets boots on the ground.

377
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,900
Sure, I'll take that.

378
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,340
Well, those are great boots.

379
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,440
Those are great boots.

380
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,370
Well Mark, maybe we just start off,

381
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,380
we just talk a little bit about,

382
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,213
we'll get to it in a second.

383
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,010
Talk about your company,
talk about (indistinct)

384
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,833
and how did you get
started on this journey?

385
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,013
- It's a really good story actually.

386
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,340
So I had a construction company.

387
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,730
I've been the insurance
restoration business for years

388
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,400
and decided to move to Texas.

389
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,850
I'm from Minnesota, so just
a redneck moving down south.

390
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,630
And my goal is to help people

391
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,840
and I helped a lot of people
in my construction company,

392
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,520
but 500 to a thousand a
year is not all of them.

393
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,210
So my goal was moving to
Texas is start a new company

394
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,200
and the catalyst was, is I worked

395
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,100
with existing CRM managers
in our industry trying

396
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,890
to recreate the wheel for
our business processes.

397
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,720
So I had eight businesses
trying to get it down to one

398
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,820
and it wasn't working with them.

399
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,410
And one of my young
bucks, he came up to me

400
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,383
and he goes, "Mark,
you ever heard of IBM?"

401
00:17:25,383 --> 00:17:27,000
And he is 26, right?

402
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,820
And I'm like, yeah, I mean,
I know who Watson is, right?

403
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,250
Playing chess back in the 90s.

404
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,103
And I'm like, yeah,
I'll send him an email.

405
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,413
So I sent him an email, I'm not
a tech guy, never have been.

406
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,030
But what happened was, it was process,

407
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,220
which is what we're all about, right?

408
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,960
We're all about process.

409
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,720
So it's like, okay, how could
I help all the people instead

410
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,390
of one or 500 or a thousand?

411
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,590
And so long story short
here, I sent the use cases

412
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,123
and IBM got back to me
and I started with it.

413
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,120
I had a lot of use cases, right?

414
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,120
I'm trying to do a 48 state
level deal immediately.

415
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,513
And I told him three to five
years and an IBM came along.

416
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,060
One of my first experiences as A CEO was,

417
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,353
where's my money stuck?

418
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,110
Where I spend the most money
and where's my throttle?

419
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,650
And for mine it was estimating.

420
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,520
So we automated estimating
immediately within three weeks.

421
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,730
And so my average estimator
could do eight a day

422
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,710
and we can now do 244
per user license per day,

423
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,410
which saved me 14,000 bucks a day.

424
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,600
That's gets me excited.

425
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,400
Not only am I saving money,

426
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,390
but I'm helping more people
and that's the biggest part.

427
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,590
And so the next question is,

428
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,933
who has an insurance policy here?

429
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,580
You didn't raise your hand.

430
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,310
No.

431
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,930
So (indistinct) is a...

432
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,820
So what happened was as we started

433
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,450
to build out an internal
BAW for our processes

434
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,610
and it spun off into
three different companies,

435
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,670
built strictly off IBM technology.

436
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,180
And so (indistinct)
was the insurance deal.

437
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,710
So what happens, what's the next throttle?

438
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,490
The next throttle is in my
company is I am the one that has

439
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,600
to, if you have a claim, I give
you not advice, but I mean,

440
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,860
'cause I can get an E&O claim,

441
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,450
which is errors and omissions.

442
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,320
Okay? And so that
throttles up to me, right?

443
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,320
Well now on a thousand
person level, still busy,

444
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,090
but now do nationwide.

445
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,800
I can't do that.

446
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,160
So like, okay, let's use agentic AI.

447
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,010
And so we built a private AI using

448
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,130
Orchestrate and WatsonX AI.

449
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,123
And what it can do is, is where I spend,

450
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,920
I have to have the call,
"Hey, here's the claim,"

451
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,270
I'm talking to you, right?

452
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,350
You're calling me. That's a
half an hour of just this.

453
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,860
And it's like, here's the advice
Roger, let's do something.

454
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,693
- Yep.

455
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:14,910
- Okay, so that's an hour
a day, right? Eight a day.

456
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,210
Now we can do it in two minutes
without any interaction.

457
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,960
And they're getting the
same advice as I would give.

458
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,060
So now we're able to help a lot of people.

459
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,460
- That's fantastic.

460
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,700
So I think this notion of the merger

461
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,680
of process and technology,
that's kind of the core,

462
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,023
the boots in the ground and IBM,

463
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,470
if you just think of so many people,

464
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,450
every business has a process about,

465
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,970
how urgent do you feel like this topic is?

466
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,740
If you said to other leaders in the room,

467
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,173
how urgent is it to
really tackle this now?

468
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,453
- You are two years late
if you haven't started yet.

469
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,660
- I think that says it pretty
well. And I agree with that.

470
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,560
I agree with that.

471
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,120
Talk about the implementation itself.

472
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,420
What are some of the
challenges along the way?

473
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,189
How did IBM help you through that?

474
00:21:05,189 --> 00:21:08,310
How much did you have to
help yourself through that?

475
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,720
Talk about that journey.

476
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,680
- It was me, I'm organic,
no software, you know,

477
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,700
I utilize software to make
money and help people of course.

478
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,135
But with the IBM journey and trying to,

479
00:21:20,135 --> 00:21:22,470
I mean anything when
you're talking one state

480
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,283
to 48 to global, you're there.

481
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:32,700
The part where we often,

482
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,260
as me it is like, it was tough.

483
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,260
I took 18 months off and did
not make income to do this.

484
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,140
And I sat with engineers,
expert labs, client engineering,

485
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,300
and I had a lot of use cases

486
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,710
and we had to put 'em all together.

487
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,997
I learned a lot of
things about my business

488
00:21:47,997 --> 00:21:51,060
and my processes during that

489
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,770
and a lot of times I've been like, man,

490
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,030
I shouldn't even be up here right now

491
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,230
'cause I'd have an island

492
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,280
if I would've done it correctly to start.

493
00:21:58,376 --> 00:22:03,090
And that's on this level to your point is

494
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:08,090
we gotta, it's always this,
it only has to be this

495
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,850
to start.

496
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,430
Where's your money suck,
eliminate that thing,

497
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,630
then you get pumped up

498
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,160
and then you keep doing it, right?

499
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,710
And you can go down to
organic level sending emails

500
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,570
and all the other things, right?

501
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,180
But how do you help more people?

502
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,273
How do you make it easier
and more effective?

503
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,420
- We were prepping for this.

504
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,690
I love the phrase, where's
the suck as a mental model

505
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,700
for figuring out where to
focus in your business.

506
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,860
'Cause you gotta back to
what I was talking about.

507
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,290
It's putting the effort into the things

508
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,630
that are gonna have the real economics

509
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,390
and then that means that
each use case gets easier

510
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,500
and easier along the journey.

511
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,900
But you start with one
where you know it's gonna be

512
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,790
a moneymaker or at least there's a strong

513
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,050
belief will be a moneymaker.

514
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,480
- Saving money's just as good
as making money, my friend.

515
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,128
- It's true.

516
00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:59,073
And by the way, now
you're doing both right?

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,280
You're able to then serve more customers

518
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,660
so you're making more
money and you're doing it

519
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,740
far more productively.

520
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,573
So you're doing both.

521
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:07,290
- Money's a byproduct
of doing things right.

522
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,190
- Yeah.
- You know, that's all it is.

523
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,860
- And then just as a side,

524
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,900
just if you think about Mark's
journey kind of prepping

525
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,090
for this, this is like a use case

526
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,010
that this technology is fantastic for.

527
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,539
If you think about understanding
process in one state

528
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:26,130
and then all the variants
across 48 different states,

529
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,230
that's the type of pattern that I think

530
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,200
for a human being is
really almost impossible

531
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,003
to understand all that complexity,

532
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,700
but it's far easier for this technology.

533
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,680
So it's almost a perfect case study for

534
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,490
how this technology can help with barriers

535
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,740
that just couldn't have
been broken without it.

536
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,573
- Correct.

537
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:47,550
You know, I mean again,
you're helping more people,

538
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,173
and the same as you help
one you can help a million.

539
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:51,006
- Yeah.
- Right?

540
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:53,440
- It's just how do we do that without

541
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,360
hiring more people and
doing all the things

542
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,080
and like again, these new
companies I started with,

543
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,080
IBM is literally built
off this foundation of

544
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,200
where Roger started
this in 2020, you know,

545
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,653
and I'm a perfect byproduct of his vision.

546
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,530
- There were a few other
participants in setting

547
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,330
that vision, but I'll
take a little credit.

548
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,230
I appreciate that.

549
00:24:20,076 --> 00:24:21,810
Mark, if you have to net out though,

550
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,970
I mean, we talked about at the beginning,

551
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,780
like the MIT study went
viral earlier this year.

552
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:32,340
So many companies haven't gotten
ROI, not just from agentic,

553
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,320
which is obviously even more complex

554
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,120
to implement than traditional GenAI.

555
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,540
How do you look at, just talk about

556
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,830
how do you net out the ROI

557
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,943
and how did you know, you were,

558
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:43,140
like how did you track

559
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,030
that you were on path to really get value

560
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,470
from this technology along the journey?

561
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,720
Like what are the measures you-

562
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,090
- Very simple, entrepreneur style, right?

563
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,780
90% of businesses fail. That's a fact.

564
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,240
Now you got 95, I watched the MIT study

565
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,823
and I'm like, well I
got 5% less competition.

566
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,880
Very simple.

567
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,060
You know, (laughs) it's what it is.

568
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,100
- So you're much more as an entrepreneur,

569
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,260
you're comfortable with that risk

570
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,300
and potential to fail-

571
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,490
- Don't fail, but fail to try.

572
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,630
- Yeah.

573
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,040
Now we got a lot of people
from larger companies here.

574
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,660
Any advice from...

575
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,730
You work with a lot of
large companies as well.

576
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,750
How do you translate that kind

577
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,810
of entrepreneur mindset into...

578
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,900
- That's our inherent
problem with all of this

579
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,403
is the enterprise level
companies, they move slow,

580
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,590
and you're talking legs

581
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,510
and it's meetings on
meetings and you know,

582
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:44,510
and it's just like, again, take
a bite of the apple, right?

583
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,560
You're not gonna be able
to embrace the agentic AI

584
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,470
on security level and
everything else immediately,

585
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:57,470
but find the one piece, do
that and then it compounds.

586
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,320
But it cannot be, hey, we're gonna take a,

587
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,360
I don't want to use big company's name,

588
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,193
large insurance company, okay?

589
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,820
You're not gonna rinse and repeat

590
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,500
and get rid of everything you built.

591
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,170
So what I originally started
with, IBM was BAW workflow

592
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,880
for my own processes.

593
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,940
Then we compound agentic AI on top of that

594
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,690
and we were already moving
good with the BAW, right?

595
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,490
Now we're just getting better.

596
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,660
And I think that's what a lot

597
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,730
of existing enterprise companies have,

598
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,680
is that existing infrastructure
that you're not, I mean,

599
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,653
I would not do it as a
CEO, I wouldn't rinse that.

600
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,240
But if we can amplify
it, which is agentic AI,

601
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,073
then we do that.

602
00:26:38,692 --> 00:26:40,980
- Mark, one big question,

603
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,240
you touched on this a little bit before,

604
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,990
but like, people talk about governance

605
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,850
and security for this technology.

606
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,620
And for you personally, those E&O claims,

607
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,060
like for people that aren't, like

608
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,110
if the AI accidentally gives
your customers bad advice,

609
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,700
you are financially-

610
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,350
- Me personally, (indistinct).

611
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,350
- Yeah, your wellbeing is at risk.

612
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:07,080
How did you get comfortable
with this technology?

613
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,180
Say I can believe in it
such that you can take

614
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,570
that personal risk or you
avoid that personal risk?

615
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,250
- I don't avoid any personal risk.

616
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,050
It always lands on me and my friend.

617
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,740
So what I did during this process

618
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,920
of building out (indistinct)
which is our policy reader,

619
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,570
you know, again, this is not,

620
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,230
so I drop into all the large
language models, everything,

621
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,780
all the deals, including building our own.

622
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,520
But what I trust, I don't,
large language model,

623
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,410
I'm not gonna drop company names,

624
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:42,410
but it has to be the right
prompt to give the right advice.

625
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,490
And that's the biggest issue
on compliance and HEPA.

626
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,490
So and for our story, my story is to build

627
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
that product to where I felt comfortable

628
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,980
where I'm not gonna lose my home is

629
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,733
building the agentic AI with IBM.

630
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,720
- Mark, maybe one last
question for this audience.

631
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,640
You've went through this journey.

632
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,450
If you had one thing that
knowing what you know now,

633
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,560
is there anything you'd change

634
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,230
or what was one piece of advice
you'd give for the people

635
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,180
that might be earlier in their journey?

636
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,883
- I feel like I'm a wild
veteran at this thing,

637
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,950
which I'm not.

638
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,710
You don't have to be the
smartest kid in the room.

639
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,430
I'm 2.3 GPA from a trade school, okay?

640
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,680
And we figured it out, right?

641
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,390
It's you find the right
people to work with,

642
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,550
you find the right business
partner, which is IBM.

643
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,600
They don't pay me to be here, by the way.

644
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,480
But like my business
model is to help people

645
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,460
and the reason I'm sitting here is

646
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,760
because I want other
people to help people.

647
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,860
So if you have a question
on where to start

648
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,240
or how to pitch your boss,

649
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,290
what I find is the biggest,
I've been to all the events

650
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,350
and a lot of people come up after I talk

651
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:05,857
and they got sent here for their boss.

652
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:06,690
"What do I do?"

653
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,320
"Well, I got all this data,
Mark, I come back to the CEO

654
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,550
and he says I'm crazy."

655
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:15,120
Well, you are crazy. You
understand where you're at.

656
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,143
But again, to the point
where does the money suck?

657
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,170
CEO's gonna love that.

658
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,760
You know, you gotta hit
from that perspective,

659
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,990
which is hard to do as an employee

660
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,290
sitting here in the crowd.

661
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,840
- But yeah, I mean I think
it's phenomenal advice

662
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,040
and goes right to the
back to the beginning.

663
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,580
I mean, this technology
exists to create value.

664
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,496
We have so many other
categories of technology

665
00:29:37,496 --> 00:29:39,150
that have been much more mature

666
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,120
before you had to wake up and adopt them.

667
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,220
And so we knew the
proven patterns of value,

668
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,170
but this technology is moving so fast

669
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,760
and so important that you have

670
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,350
to find the suck in your business.

671
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:52,150
- You gotta put the tile
to the pavement now.

672
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,520
- Okay, to get going.

673
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,170
Alright, well listen,

674
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,270
Mark, I wanna thank you for
joining us on stage here.

675
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,940
It's a pleasure to have you as a partner.

676
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,547
(crowd clapping)

677
00:30:01,547 --> 00:30:04,760
And I'm gonna pass it off to Vishal

678
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,503
to introduce our next
client from Apollo Tires.

679
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,370
Thanks Vishal.

680
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,270
- Thank you Roger.

681
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,400
Okay, yeah.

682
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,830
So I was saying (indistinct)
from Apollo Tires

683
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,160
is gonna go fairly

684
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,130
technical about how they're using Agentic

685
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,960
at their organization.

686
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,180
But before we do that,
I'm gonna spend a minute

687
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,323
or two on AWS and IBM.

688
00:30:27,323 --> 00:30:29,760
AWS and IBM.

689
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,773
It's really a story about momentum.

690
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,030
Together we've built one
of the strongest alliances

691
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,933
in the industry.

692
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,130
We've got 12 partner of the year awards

693
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,000
for innovation, design
and client collaboration.

694
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,613
At the center of this is
IBM's AWS's premier client

695
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:51,685
consulting partner,

696
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:56,640
powered by 25,000 trained AWS consultants

697
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,607
over 200 locations and
34 delivery competencies,

698
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,113
including agentic and manufacturing.

699
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:11,790
And we made strategic
acquisitions over the years.

700
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:16,710
Redhat for example, it
brings open source innovation

701
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,200
that integrates very well with AWS.

702
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,140
We just acquired Texture so
that we can help our clients

703
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,910
with target operating models.

704
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,677
Similarly, new (indistinct)
they bring cloud native

705
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:30,150
and managed services for our clients.

706
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,430
But the real impact is in client,

707
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,220
how we deliver to our clients.

708
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,660
We use our garage method

709
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,500
to deliver 75% better
outcomes for our clients.

710
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,120
I'll give you an example.

711
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,370
Delta Airlines, they came to us.

712
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,210
They wanted us to transform
their passenger experience

713
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,680
and flight ops.

714
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,829
Together we modernized, containerized,

715
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:57,240
and we go to cloud native about 600 apps.

716
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,670
Not only did the clients save money,

717
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:03,090
but they became a lot more
agile and a lot more productive.

718
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,810
So the story is really about
acceleration, innovation,

719
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,853
proven by client outcomes.

720
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,420
So when I talk to my clients,
it's becoming very clear

721
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,003
that we are going past the AI hype cycle.

722
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,510
Clients are making strategic decisions,

723
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,960
decisions that will
determine whether AI remains

724
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,650
a set of experiments or it
becomes something more productive

725
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,293
that gives real value to the clients.

726
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,610
IBM's Institute of Business
Value, we did a study

727
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,503
and the results were very striking.

728
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,170
Only 15% of our clients
right now qualify as leaders.

729
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,590
When I say leaders, I mean that they have

730
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,720
gone past the pilot mode.

731
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,260
They're actually embedding
workflows into their applications

732
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,440
and processes and they're able to

733
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,020
get the ROI that they need.

734
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,960
So basically AI is not a gadget for them,

735
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,693
it's something that is
producing ROI for them.

736
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:09,239
So the foundation of this
success is really data.

737
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:13,080
A lot of our clients are
starting to invest in data

738
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,110
because they know that
without clean connected data,

739
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,243
the promise of AI will never be possible.

740
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,300
The third thing I'm seeing is agentic,

741
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,036
80% of execs are making a
huge investment in agentic

742
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:28,072
because they expect the
workflows to get re-engineered

743
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:31,800
and for the agents to produce
a lot of productivity.

744
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,170
And finally, of course you need security.

745
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,375
And that's why our
clients are spending a lot

746
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,460
of money on security.

747
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,230
But how do you do it right?

748
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:43,440
The instinct is go to
go from right to left.

749
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,190
I would say let's not do that.
Let's go from left to right.

750
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,230
Set your strategy first.

751
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,260
Align it with your goals,
then come up with initiatives

752
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,673
that align to your strategy.

753
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:59,069
Then you start to embed
AI into your workflows

754
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:01,680
and then you have to of course
take care of your talent,

755
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,480
upskilling culture.

756
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,690
And then you bind all of
this together with security

757
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:10,500
and compliance because you
have to make sure that the AI

758
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,593
that you are putting in
your systems can be trusted.

759
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,490
So in terms of value, it
doesn't come all at once.

760
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,813
It comes in layers.

761
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:27,420
The first layer, of course
is productivity based agents.

762
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,450
We've all seen summarization tools,

763
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,520
chatbots, all those things.

764
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,680
The productivity of
that comes only when the

765
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,883
employees adopt them.

766
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,690
The second is re-engineered workflows.

767
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:43,800
That's where when you
start to combine AI, GenAI

768
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,820
and automation to really
change the workflows

769
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,800
and get value out of them.

770
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,240
The third of course is Nirvana.

771
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,560
It's ambient AI where
AI is almost everywhere

772
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,340
and then you are able
to use real time data

773
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,813
to accomplish big things.

774
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:07,340
So one of the clients who's
really doing this really well

775
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,030
is Apollo Tires.

776
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,100
And I'm gonna invite (indistinct) to share

777
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,414
how he's using agentic
AI in his organization.

778
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:16,920
(indistinct)

779
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,270
- Thanks Vishal.

780
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,500
I hope I'm (indistinct) everybody.

781
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,600
How's everybody doing?

782
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,293
So exciting time, exciting
keynote if you attended today,

783
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:31,740
and before I talk about the
tech part of it, let's try

784
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,930
to understand why is it even important.

785
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,660
What is a problem that
we are trying to solve?

786
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:41,430
Apollo Tires are well-known
brand within the Asia Pacific.

787
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,293
We are heavily invested in US market.

788
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:47,820
$3.5 billion company, 20,000 employees,

789
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,880
complex product group.

790
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,080
We are across all the segments,
passenger, farm, trucks,

791
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,630
off-roading, two-wheelers.

792
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,207
We have two brands, Apollo and Vredestein.

793
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:01,920
Vredestein is a premium brand,

794
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,780
which you can find here in US.

795
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,780
In the farm segment, we
have Apollo Tires in US

796
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,313
all across the Europe.

797
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,553
So very large organization,
complex processes.

798
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,960
To solve these things
what you need are again,

799
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,690
some exciting technologies.

800
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,820
In fact, the word
exciting excites me a lot.

801
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,563
Matt spoke a lot about it today.

802
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,170
So what we did, we started our
tech journey four years back

803
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,030
when we started moving all our workloads,

804
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,370
manufacturing everything onto the cloud,

805
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:39,900
our manufacturing execution
system, SCADA systems,

806
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,660
VMIs, most of those
things, production systems

807
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,123
of entire ERP, SAPs on the cloud.

808
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,023
The best thing what we did is

809
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:50,973
that we removed the data silos.

810
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,910
After we removed the data
silos, the first thing

811
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,160
that we did is we
created a giant data lake

812
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,573
onto the cloud itself.

813
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,920
The objective was that anybody

814
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,710
who is using the data
should have a trusted data,

815
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,170
single source of truth, no more silos.

816
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,390
We have seven manufacturing facilities.

817
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,180
Earlier the data was within
the manufacturing facilities.

818
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,760
If you're familiar with the
manufacturing processes,

819
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,560
the SCADA as I'm talking about,

820
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,930
they store the data into the historians.

821
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,490
Terabytes of data.

822
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,820
We do a lot of quality checks
using the X-ray images,

823
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,590
again, terabytes of data.

824
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,790
Today we have more than
400 terabytes on my S3

825
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,540
and nearly eight terabytes
in my data warehouses,

826
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,553
which are built on Redshift and Aurora.

827
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:40,200
What do I do with all this
data? Terabytes of data.

828
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,640
What insights can I get?

829
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,470
There is no point in
having all this data if you

830
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,030
can't make a meaning out of it.

831
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,460
If you can't answer a single question.

832
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,670
The result was we were
using traditional BI,

833
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,140
more than 500 reports.

834
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,750
Everybody who wants
something, they'll come to us.

835
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,450
We are the bottleneck. Can
you create this report to me?

836
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,670
I'll take 15 days, understand
the business process,

837
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,960
deliver one report.

838
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,640
Then they'll say, "Oh, I also wanted

839
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,930
another question to be answered.

840
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,370
Here's another report for you.

841
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,270
Here's another version of the report."

842
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,170
So these things pile
up and this is going on

843
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,210
with everybody in the traditional

844
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,610
business intelligence reporting.

845
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,630
So what we did is that

846
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,650
the good part with LLM is
that now you can use the LLM

847
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:26,040
to convert whatever the
human is saying into

848
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,643
the natural language part
of that, into a SQL query.

849
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,520
I can very easily execute that
SQL query into my database

850
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,860
and then get the answer instantly.

851
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:42,240
There is no need of any
BI, my business users,

852
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,240
my CIOs, CXOs, everybody can
just use this to find out

853
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,103
what was the sale as of
today morning in real time.

854
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,260
What was the total dispatch done today?

855
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,350
Has it reached to the customer
on time? What is the OTIF?

856
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:01,680
How is my productivity happening
in the manufacturing plant?

857
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,220
My IoT devices which are
directly talking to my data lake,

858
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,330
instantly give me the
insights of the plant.

859
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,950
What have I manufactured today?

860
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:13,143
Which machine was down for how much time?

861
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,920
I know the latency
between my manufacturing

862
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,400
to the warehouse, to the
dispatch to the customer.

863
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,780
Has it reached on time or not?

864
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,280
How many orders have I missed?

865
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,980
Till now everything was
within the batch process.

866
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,150
A delay of four hours,

867
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,913
sometimes 24 hours when
it comes to the BI tool.

868
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:38,070
So what we did, a very simple thing.

869
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,450
We put the LLM on the top

870
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,090
of my entire data lake,
this is just a POC.

871
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:45,480
What we have done and the
results are phenomenal, amazing.

872
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,283
Everybody who saw from the business,

873
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,883
they were absolutely blown out.

874
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:53,940
A very simple thing.

875
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,880
What they can do is fire a
command and then get the results.

876
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,957
Not just that they can store
the sessions, they can go back

877
00:39:59,957 --> 00:40:03,390
to the session, have
the context as a memory.

878
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,000
They can also generate
the charts out of it.

879
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,862
And if the default charge generated

880
00:40:07,862 --> 00:40:10,830
by my system is not good
enough, they can say, oh,

881
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,170
I want the same data in the pie chart.

882
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,820
No, no, I want in the line chart.

883
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,210
From the previous query I want to further

884
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,660
and refine and drill it down.

885
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,110
So what we did, which is this,

886
00:40:28,163 --> 00:40:31,050
so what we did, laser pointer.

887
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,130
Okay, hey.

888
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,200
So I have two data warehouses I mentioned.

889
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,960
One is Amazon Aurora and
the other one is Redshift.

890
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,170
Dependent on what kind
of data I want to store

891
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,260
and what kind of analytics I want to do.

892
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,970
While Redshift is very good in terms

893
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,960
of the columnal storage,
large data storage, indexing

894
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,600
and creating the UDF

895
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,180
or the procedures are
a little complicated.

896
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,800
So that's where we use Aurora
for some of my use cases.

897
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,490
The data inside the Aurora
we took as the first trial

898
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,950
or the POC, on the top of Aurora,

899
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,070
we simply use the Amazon Bedrock.

900
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:12,090
And then using the Bedrock,
we created a context model

901
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,640
for at least one of the databases.

902
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,010
There are hundreds of them
and hundreds of tables.

903
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,320
We picked up one of the simplest cases

904
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,760
for the warranty issues of the customers.

905
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,230
Very simple thing we did.

906
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:29,792
And my users can now query this database.

907
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:32,190
They can find out what
was the warranty claim,

908
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,630
what was the total percentage,

909
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,250
how many dealers are claiming what?

910
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,840
What are the product failures?

911
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,100
They can very easily find it out

912
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,500
rather than using a BI tool.

913
00:41:43,352 --> 00:41:44,185
Go back.

914
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,270
I'm storing all these sessions

915
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,340
into my Amazon OpenSearch.

916
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:54,090
With all the context, user can
store X number of sessions.

917
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,160
They can come back, retrieve a session,

918
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,020
see what they did last time.

919
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,770
On the top of that, they can
again run a context query.

920
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,350
The second thing is I want

921
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,290
to use the data which is stored in S3

922
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,170
other than the Amazon
Aurora, as I mentioned,

923
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,477
400 terabytes of data.

924
00:42:11,477 --> 00:42:14,490
I want to expand it not
just to my structured data,

925
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,140
but even to my unstructured data.

926
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,040
My marketing says I have thousands

927
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,320
and thousands of marketing materials.

928
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,670
There are insights from
the marketing agencies,

929
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,750
there are PDF files.

930
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,190
What do I do with that?

931
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,530
It's hard to make a meaning out of it.

932
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,120
The simplest thing, what I can do is

933
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,070
that I can run an LLM on the top of that

934
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,672
using the same tech stack

935
00:42:36,672 --> 00:42:41,160
and then my marketing team
can get the entire summary of

936
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,170
what is happening with the competitors,

937
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,293
with the other agencies within the market.

938
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,715
My R&D says, I want

939
00:42:48,715 --> 00:42:51,303
to understand my
engineering drawings better.

940
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,702
My shop floor says that I want

941
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:56,250
to solve a problem when
the machine is broken.

942
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,480
I have to read through the manual

943
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,090
and see what exactly has to be done.

944
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:04,260
So this whole thing now
just a POC has opened

945
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,370
so many avenues for me
to deliver on the top

946
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:11,427
of my entire 400 terabytes of data lake.

947
00:43:11,427 --> 00:43:13,650
The xray images that I have,

948
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:16,380
when a warranty issue comes,
I go and analyze that.

949
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,360
What happened wrong with
that particular case?

950
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,190
Was it manufacturing?

951
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,050
Was the manufacturing at fault?

952
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,090
Was it like the post manufacturing,

953
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,380
the curing process was there,

954
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,300
was there a foreign
particle within the tire

955
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,310
or what exactly happened?

956
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,358
I want to analyze the whole genealogy in

957
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,667
that particular thing and find out

958
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:37,470
who manufactured, which shift
it was manufactured into,

959
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,410
which assembly line it
was manufactured into.

960
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,060
These questions are extremely complex

961
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,480
and then they take a lot
of time to get answered.

962
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,830
Earlier my R&D team, my
manufacturing team was spending days

963
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,480
to get those answers.

964
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,420
On the similar lines, we
have developed another

965
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,150
prototype using the graph databases

966
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:59,068
where they can find out the
whole genealogy, the parent

967
00:43:59,068 --> 00:44:01,893
and child of the manufacturing process.

968
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,900
So essentially the results
are extremely exciting,

969
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,340
very positive, very promising.

970
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,010
And the single POC we plan to expand.

971
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,860
We want to take it to the next level,

972
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,290
put it on the entire data lake

973
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,390
and give it to my all the users.

974
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:25,020
This we call it as the
self-service data lake,

975
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,460
just like the self-service
BI tools people use today.

976
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,520
So there is no need of going to train

977
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,780
to business how to use it.

978
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,833
This is so easy.

979
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,610
The simple user interface
integrated with active directory.

980
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,110
They can go and log in.

981
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,820
I can control who access
what part of the data

982
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,700
and then they can just use
it across all the segments

983
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,030
till the executive level
till the CXO levels.

984
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:54,153
Zero training ROI from day one.

985
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,740
In terms of if I want to measure some

986
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,143
of the quantitative parts of that,

987
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,500
a simple report if I want to create,

988
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,820
it takes probably 15 days

989
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,173
for me to create a report.

990
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,320
Business will come tell
their problem statement.

991
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,660
I will hire a BA, business analyst

992
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,340
who will understand the problem statement.

993
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,830
The knowledge transfer will happen.

994
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,780
They'll say X will understand Y

995
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,300
and then number of iterations
will create a report,

996
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,140
deliver the report.

997
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,920
And again, they'll do a dry run on that.

998
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,630
Gimme a feedback. I'll define the report.

999
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,210
The whole process can take 15
days to a month depending on

1000
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,670
how complex or easy the report is.

1001
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:38,133
Gone is that particular
time. I don't need that.

1002
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,850
Business doesn't have to
tell me what they want.

1003
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:42,930
In some parts yes,

1004
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,150
because yes, I have to
create a context of the data,

1005
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,760
especially when there are multiple tables.

1006
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,940
The good part is that when
you create a BI report,

1007
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,440
your knowledge is drained.

1008
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,900
That BI report is containing your business

1009
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,550
logic and the knowledge.

1010
00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:00,300
But here now I can store my entire context

1011
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,450
and the knowledge within
my data lake itself,

1012
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,943
which is my goal as a
single source of truth.

1013
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,040
Once I have done that,

1014
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,743
my KPIs are uniform across the company.

1015
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,710
If my sales says my sales
value is X, my commercial

1016
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:19,740
and my finance cannot say
yes, this is different

1017
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,390
because everybody's looking at the same

1018
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:22,653
number across the board.

1019
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,100
The reporting time reduces

1020
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,470
where my book closing
happened within 10 days.

1021
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:31,230
Now using this thing, I
can have my book closing

1022
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:34,410
and get the answers to what
was my total quarterly sale

1023
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,230
or monthly sale within probably
four days to five days.

1024
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,730
This is what we are targeting.

1025
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,060
So if I want to quantify the benefits,

1026
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,380
this slide probably won't be enough

1027
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,853
to quantify those benefits.

1028
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:51,483
So that's all I wanted to
share from my insights.

1029
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,350
I'll hand it over to Vishal.

1030
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:58,620
- Before I go further, I
have a question two for you.

1031
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,453
- Sure.

1032
00:46:59,453 --> 00:47:03,360
- So what I see is a lot of
our clients have tech data

1033
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,080
or tech debt, process debt, data debt

1034
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,720
that really inhibits their AI journey.

1035
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,017
I'm guessing (indistinct),
you face some of

1036
00:47:12,017 --> 00:47:14,370
that in your organization as well.

1037
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:17,220
So talk to me about how
you overcome those debts

1038
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,950
that you have and still
make this possible.

1039
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:20,783
- So interesting.

1040
00:47:20,783 --> 00:47:23,790
Again, if you attended the keynote today,

1041
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:26,310
Matt also spoke about exactly same thing.

1042
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,600
He spoke about the tech debt

1043
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,410
and a lot of agents that he
has introduced AWS introduced

1044
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:33,303
to solve some of these things.

1045
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,830
We have very, very simple
rules when it comes

1046
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:40,143
to removing these debts.

1047
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,390
So we have a very simple rule.

1048
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,553
We want to remove these debts.

1049
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,760
When you talk about the
data that I spoke about,

1050
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,600
the data silos, that was the
first tech debt we removed.

1051
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,320
No more data to be stored
within my on-prem systems,

1052
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,890
whether it is x-ray images,
whether it is my historians,

1053
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:04,440
whether it is my transactional
data, my SAP data,

1054
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,573
everything must land within my data lake.

1055
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:10,260
One single data lake, which must be used

1056
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,040
for all my reporting, all
my analytics, all my AI,

1057
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,463
my entire AI layer runs on that.

1058
00:48:15,463 --> 00:48:17,580
So that is the first thing we have done

1059
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,050
as a future proof thing that we want

1060
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,510
to remove the data debt.

1061
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:22,710
When it comes to the tech debt,

1062
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:26,250
we have chosen two tech stacks.

1063
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,190
Either we will work on
Python, which works very well

1064
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:31,320
for everything you want
to do web development,

1065
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,187
you want to do API,
you want to do fast API

1066
00:48:34,187 --> 00:48:36,150
or API in the flask,

1067
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:41,150
or you want to run your
AI on the top of that,

1068
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:44,370
it seamlessly integrates
with all the AI systems.

1069
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:45,570
I want to analyze the data.

1070
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:48,410
I can run it within the
Jupiter, whether I do it in AWS

1071
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:51,660
or if you guys are using Microsoft Fabric,

1072
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,013
it runs everywhere.

1073
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,460
So that is my second text
stack that I want to use

1074
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,400
and remove the tech debt that
no more any other technology.

1075
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,890
Probably in some cases,
yes, we use node js

1076
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,960
or there are some legacy
applications still running

1077
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,523
on .net.

1078
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,720
Then my golden rule is
if I can run it on Linux,

1079
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,800
that is my first preference.

1080
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,883
I'll run it on Linux.

1081
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,570
My first preference is
I run it on Graviton.

1082
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:18,570
That reduces my cost by 40 to 50%.

1083
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:21,120
I run Amazon Linux on
Graviton cheapest solution

1084
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,950
that you can get in the market.

1085
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:25,170
My second thing is if you
cannot run it on Graviton,

1086
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,218
if you need the Intel architecture,

1087
00:49:27,218 --> 00:49:28,530
(indistinct) architecture, fine,

1088
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:31,110
I'll give you AMD if not,
then I'll give you Intel.

1089
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,643
That's how I manage my cost.

1090
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,430
If Linux doesn't work for you, then yes,

1091
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,280
I will go for Window that
is the only solution.

1092
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,310
So those are some of my
standard rules I have created

1093
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,320
that I remove my tech debt.

1094
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,000
When it comes to the databases

1095
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,540
I'm very clear I will not
run any database on-prem

1096
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,950
until it's absolutely needed

1097
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:52,800
for the manufacturing within
the edge, within the plant.

1098
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,630
I'll run it on RDS.

1099
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,970
If I'm running on RDS,
I'll give you a database,

1100
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:59,610
not the whole server.

1101
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:01,350
Traditionally people had this habit

1102
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,120
of buying a separate instance

1103
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,366
for everything that they want to do,

1104
00:50:05,366 --> 00:50:09,609
where you see multiple licenses coming up.

1105
00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:13,350
Again in RDS, if you can
run on PostgreSQL, fine.

1106
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,630
If not, then probably if you want MySQL

1107
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:18,240
or something, if not,
it is something that has

1108
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,970
to run on Oracle and SQL,
fine, I'll give it to you.

1109
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:22,407
So these are the standard rules that I use

1110
00:50:22,407 --> 00:50:24,333
to remove my tech debt.

1111
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,450
I hope I've answered those questions.

1112
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:28,283
- Fascinating. Yeah.

1113
00:50:28,283 --> 00:50:31,650
So I know we need to get
to our lessons learned.

1114
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:34,020
So I'm gonna take maybe a
couple minutes just to share

1115
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,630
with you a couple of the things.

1116
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:40,080
So IBM enterprise advantage,

1117
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,630
think of it as a complete toolkit

1118
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:45,990
for you to take your
AI ambitions to reality

1119
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,150
and think of it as a three layer cake.

1120
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,510
Roger talked about of course,
IBM consulting advantage.

1121
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:55,380
So that brings together
all the tools, assets,

1122
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:00,380
and services for you to take
the entire AI lifecycle.

1123
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,769
On top of that, we have
a advantage marketplace,

1124
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,210
which is by the way, vendor neutral.

1125
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:09,140
So you can use the tools from IBM, AWS

1126
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,490
or other partners so that the solution

1127
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:14,430
that you're building
fits your environment,

1128
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:15,680
not the other way around.

1129
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,375
We also include the agentic studio.

1130
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,890
It's a development platform

1131
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:23,100
and a hub that has all the
tools assets for you to scale

1132
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,250
and optimize AI faster and smarter.

1133
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,730
On top of that, of course,
is AI implementation services

1134
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:31,650
so that you can scale your AI

1135
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:34,590
and you can optimize your
AI as you go forward.

1136
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,180
So the story really is simple, right?

1137
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,840
So it is not about just the technology.

1138
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,500
This framework is about
tools, people, processes

1139
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,080
that we bring to you so that you are able

1140
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,360
to scale your AI journey.

1141
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,570
I'll spend only a minute
on the marketplace.

1142
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:56,310
So this marketplace has what
you need in terms of agents.

1143
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,800
These agents can be
business agents, they can be

1144
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,150
by industry, they are by
SDLC, they are domain.

1145
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:05,220
You can license these from IBM.

1146
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,320
And when you do that,
basically you're able

1147
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,870
to not start from the scratch.

1148
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:12,390
So it's already half done
though the cooking is half done,

1149
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,390
and then you can bake your own
cake from that point onwards.

1150
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,130
So at the core,

1151
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:21,450
this really embodies IBM's
asset based consulting approach.

1152
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:25,473
We bring to you packaged
reusable assets that you can use

1153
00:52:25,473 --> 00:52:27,723
to bake your own cake.

1154
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,063
One last thing.

1155
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:34,980
A lot of people ask me, so how
do I think about AI agents?

1156
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,030
Should I think about them
as robots? I would say no.

1157
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,760
I would say think of them
as your trusted employees.

1158
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,460
Think of your most
trusted employee, right?

1159
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,000
So what do you think about them?

1160
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,050
They're skilled, they're
dependable, they're coachable.

1161
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:51,030
They have all the access

1162
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:54,090
and they're supervised
when it needs to be.

1163
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,250
So your AI agent needs

1164
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,880
to be like a trusted
employee, not like a robot.

1165
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,940
So what do I mean? So skillset.

1166
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,250
So when I'm training my agents,

1167
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,710
I'm not training them on a big LLM,

1168
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:11,040
I'm gonna take away domain specific LLM

1169
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,070
and I'm gonna use your data
so that I can train them

1170
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:16,410
in the right format, right?

1171
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:19,080
I will use your processes, your methods so

1172
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,733
that the agent understands that.

1173
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:26,070
Now when I onboard a agent,
I'm gonna give it access,

1174
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,980
privileges, everything like
I would do to an employee.

1175
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,570
Nothing more, nothing less.

1176
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:33,270
So it has to be
constrained in that format.

1177
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:35,430
It has to follow your rules.

1178
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:37,800
So whatever the constraints
you have in the organizations,

1179
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,340
the rules you have, your
agents have to follow that.

1180
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,390
And then it has to be coachable.

1181
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,690
So it's not gonna be
perfect on day one, right?

1182
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:50,220
So I should be able to
coach it, give it feedback,

1183
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,930
and then of course you have

1184
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:55,470
to work within the parameters
of your risk management

1185
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,820
that you have in your company.

1186
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:01,820
And finally, human in the
loop is very, very important.

1187
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,060
It doesn't go away.

1188
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,230
So I'm gonna go to the lessons

1189
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,180
that I think we are gonna share.

1190
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,190
The first one, at least for me is

1191
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:11,131
that human in the loop is not optional.

1192
00:54:11,131 --> 00:54:13,470
Not yet at least right?

1193
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,670
For the sake of enforcement,
for the sake of compliance,

1194
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:22,670
for sake of security, for sake
of your reputational risk,

1195
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,923
you need human to be
in the loop right now.

1196
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:29,970
Your agent cannot be fully
autonomous on day one.

1197
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,290
You can give it some autonomy

1198
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:34,680
and as the agent proves to
you that it is consistent

1199
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,540
and getting more and more consistent,

1200
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,640
that's when you give it more autonomy.

1201
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,710
But human stays in the loop.

1202
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,110
So that's one thing that
I think about it a lot.

1203
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,950
What are some of your learnings?

1204
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,440
- So the best learning
that came through this is

1205
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,500
always start small.

1206
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,333
Do A POC.

1207
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:57,030
Of course you can't ignore
the quality of your data.

1208
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,940
That has to be a good quality data

1209
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,950
that you want to work on.

1210
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,254
The POC that we did, I'm happy to share.

1211
00:55:05,254 --> 00:55:08,280
And you won't believe within
five days we were able

1212
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,050
to get the initial results.

1213
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,450
Things are so easy, plug and play

1214
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,760
when you use the Bedrock,
the knowledge base

1215
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,563
and the search engine
that we are building.

1216
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,160
OpenSearch that we are using.

1217
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,110
Within 15 days the prototype was ready

1218
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:28,710
and I was able to take it to
my CTO to seek an approval

1219
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:30,330
that this is what we are building.

1220
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:33,930
And after we had the approval that yes,

1221
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,450
they're gonna sponsor it,
we can take it forward

1222
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:38,700
as a full scale project
on the entire data lake,

1223
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:42,300
which is a massive project
that is gonna be there.

1224
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,310
Sometimes what happens,
business will come,

1225
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,620
or probably you will think,

1226
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,660
I want to solve the most complex problem

1227
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,343
because that is the pain area.

1228
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,220
Early wins are very important.

1229
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,930
You show the early wins and then

1230
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:57,180
after that you move to the
complex one rather than,

1231
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,860
you know, picking the most complex project

1232
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:02,490
and either delaying it,
going for the cost over.

1233
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,880
So that is one of the
most important lesson

1234
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,300
that I would say you
should follow as a rule.

1235
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,020
- I mean, I was very, very
impressed on how you took

1236
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,780
a pain point that is so common, right?

1237
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,570
And you created a pilot
and you started small

1238
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:21,300
but high impact, you went for early wins.

1239
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,490
And that's why I think
you're getting the momentum

1240
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:24,990
that you are.

1241
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:25,920
Well done.

1242
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,230
Another thing that I think
about is when you think about

1243
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:30,690
agents, think about the
business outcomes, right?

1244
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,850
Don't think about the technical outcomes.

1245
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:36,070
Start with a business world,
right? So is it validate it?

1246
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:38,520
Is it detect, is it a
claims processing agent?

1247
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,590
So you have to think about agents

1248
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:42,810
not as something technical.

1249
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:45,060
What is the outcome that
you're trying to achieve

1250
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,790
and design the agent around that.

1251
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:50,550
That gets your business along with you

1252
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,050
and you get momentum that way.

1253
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,823
- Yeah, absolutely right.

1254
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,000
Again, I would go back to the keynote.

1255
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,390
You can't avoid the agentic framework now.

1256
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:06,750
More and more agents, you
know, are being launched.

1257
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,760
The new one that was announced today,

1258
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,090
the front end agent rather
than the backend agents.

1259
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:14,768
In one of the use cases, what we did

1260
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:17,970
in a multi agentic framework,
we created two agents.

1261
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:21,420
While one agent is trying to
interpret the natural language

1262
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,740
and generate the query,
we created a agent we call

1263
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,030
as judge, who is going

1264
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:29,780
to judge whether the query
generated is right or wrong.

1265
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:35,630
For example, when I'm saying
give me the top five products,

1266
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,300
has your agent generated
a query which really

1267
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,500
gives you top five

1268
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,270
or is it giving you top 10 or top four?

1269
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:44,910
How do you know the SQL
generated is right or wrong?

1270
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,710
So we pass that to the second agent

1271
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:50,670
to interpret those keywords
and the judge qualifies

1272
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,680
and then corrects the first agent.

1273
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,653
So these kind of frameworks, if you want,

1274
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,040
ideally they should be implemented

1275
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,130
and there are very good
articles, whole books on that

1276
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:05,280
in case you are looking
for multi-agent frameworks

1277
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,503
on the web, you should go through that.

1278
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,930
- Yeah, I'll amplify what
you're saying. Right?

1279
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:13,080
So don't try to make a super agent, right?

1280
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,147
Make smaller, specialized
agents who talk to each other

1281
00:58:16,147 --> 00:58:19,350
because over time, like I said,
agents have to be coachable.

1282
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:22,770
So if you make smaller agents,
then they get specialized

1283
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:25,230
and they are coachable
and then you can get them

1284
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:27,630
to behave the way you want them to.

1285
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:30,859
So in my mind having
multi-agent, so you think

1286
00:58:30,859 --> 00:58:34,680
of it like a planner, a
researcher, an auditor, you know,

1287
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,452
different agents who are
working with each other to get

1288
00:58:36,452 --> 00:58:38,490
to the outcome that you want.

1289
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:39,323
- True.

1290
00:58:39,323 --> 00:58:40,156
- We have less than a minute left,

1291
00:58:40,156 --> 00:58:41,913
so I'll let you have the last word.

1292
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,003
- Yeah.

1293
00:58:44,003 --> 00:58:48,030
See, my suggestion would be

1294
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,830
in case you are planning
to build any such thing,

1295
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:54,830
your baseline framework
should be strong enough.

1296
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,320
What we did right in this case
was our focus was that fine,

1297
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,610
we can catch up with the AI,

1298
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:03,210
but our data layer should be
extremely, extremely strong.

1299
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,920
That's where we focused.

1300
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,890
Otherwise, what happens when
you develop these things,

1301
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:10,440
the data silos become the pain point.

1302
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,600
You do not know which data to trust upon.

1303
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,780
You'll run the AI on one
particular data silo will give you

1304
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,910
X results, and then you
bring it to the second one

1305
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:19,358
it'll give you y results.

1306
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:23,160
Training becomes a pain point,
retraining has to be done.

1307
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,500
So the baseline data layer must be there,

1308
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,440
which should be company wide, globally,

1309
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,170
dependent on of course
how you're organized.

1310
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:34,500
But then this is the first
thing that we did right.

1311
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,440
The second thing was that we focus on more

1312
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,580
of real time data.

1313
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,920
We heavily invested in the IoT

1314
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,290
considering we are a
manufacturing company.

1315
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:46,830
So directly getting data from
the PLCs, from the plants

1316
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:50,000
was our priority and this
has worked very well in terms

1317
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,573
of the real time insights.

1318
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,860
Then we have a cloud first strategy,

1319
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,180
if I can run it on the cloud

1320
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,820
I will first prefer to run
my project on the cloud,

1321
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:03,330
which gives me absolute
scalability control over the cost.

1322
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:05,400
And we have converted
the entire CapEx model

1323
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,530
into the OPEX model.

1324
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:10,333
So no more heavy investment for on-prem.

1325
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:11,673
So these are some of the golden rules

1326
01:00:11,673 --> 01:00:15,630
that I have followed and they
have worked very well for us.

1327
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:16,590
- Awesome. Thank you (indistinct).

1328
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:19,500
So we are out of time,
but Mark, (indistinct)

1329
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,389
and I are gonna be on sidelines.

1330
01:00:20,389 --> 01:00:22,311
If you have any questions,
we are available.

1331
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:24,120
Please come talk to us. Thank you again.

1332
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,213
- Thank you everyone.
