1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,619
Hi everyone, um, thanks for coming.

2
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:05,078
Uh, my name is Rick Oaks, and

3
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:07,198
I have, uh, a, a few other people here with

4
00:00:07,198 --> 00:00:09,478
me to help present this session, COP 202,

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,978
what's new in AWBS optimization.

6
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:13,720
Uh, I lead the product management team for

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,300
AWBS optimization tools

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,940
including compute optimizer,

9
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:20,399
uh, cost optimization hub, savings plan

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,190
analyzer,

11
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:23,559
savings plan recommendations, and I

12
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,559
know I'm probably missing some.

13
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:27,100
Um, and I also sit on the Finops Foundation Technical

14
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,370
Advisory Council helping AWS represent

15
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,870
how customers optimize and operate with,

16
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:33,728
uh, financial management.

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,630
Bonnie, Bonnie Fernstall, I lead

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,590
Delta Airlines, uh, central Finops team.

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,759
Mary Naimov, I lead the savings plan

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,539
purchase experience.

21
00:00:43,598 --> 00:00:44,990
Thank you. All right, so, um,

22
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:47,609
we, we have a lot of stuff to get through today and we're really

23
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:48,618
excited to have you all here.

24
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:51,310
Just before we dive into any sort of specific

25
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,368
content, I'm curious how many of you folks are

26
00:00:53,368 --> 00:00:55,569
here from FinOps

27
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:57,189
organizations? Show of hands.

28
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,118
Awesome, that's great.

29
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,579
How many are maybe more FinOs adjacent,

30
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,260
maybe engineering leaders or engineering folks?

31
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:07,849
OK, so it's about actually fairly split.

32
00:01:07,888 --> 00:01:08,609
That's awesome.

33
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,388
Um, OK, so

34
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,049
how many of you have,

35
00:01:13,528 --> 00:01:16,278
before I dive into specific features and announcements,

36
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,959
how many of you have used some of our AWS

37
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,209
optimization tooling such as compute

38
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:22,028
optimizer?

39
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:26,000
Awesome, that's great to see. OK, we've

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,120
got some new things in compute optimizer to show you.

41
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,668
How many of you have made savings plan

42
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:33,159
purchases with our recommendations or analyzer

43
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,388
tooling? Wow, we've

44
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:37,540
got a lot of optimization aficionados

45
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,290
in the crowd. Cool. OK, so

46
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:42,028
first on the agenda we've got, we've got

47
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:43,808
some new features that we'll talk about,

48
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:46,269
um. We're gonna talk first

49
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:48,469
about EBS optimization. How

50
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:50,510
many of you heard of this new launch? We just launched it about a

51
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,168
week ago,

52
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:52,730
right before Thanksgiving.

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,439
No, OK, you're gonna love it. So in

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,040
compute optimizer we offer recommendations

55
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,668
for those of you that haven't used it yet,

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,159
recommendations for right sizing, modernization,

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,519
idle detection, and clean up

58
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,118
for things like EC2, EBS, RDS,

59
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,899
and quite a few other services.

60
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,639
Inside Compute optimizer, we kept hearing from

61
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,719
customers, I like these recommendations,

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,939
but there's so many of them. You keep giving me

63
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:19,118
more, it's really hard to

64
00:02:19,118 --> 00:02:21,229
get after the ones I already have, and you keep

65
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:22,838
launching more, so help us take them.

66
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:25,629
Uh, and it's great feedback. We love building and launching

67
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,088
new capability here, so

68
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,550
optimization has been pretty high on our priority

69
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,689
list for a while now.

70
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,169
We decided to focus on

71
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:36,229
the low hanging fruit, easy to do optimizations

72
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:39,169
to get started here. In this case, EBS

73
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,330
idle cleanup, which is

74
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,629
EBS volumes that are unattached

75
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,028
to any instance

76
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:47,308
and are really not adding any value to

77
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:48,149
your environment.

78
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:50,990
Uh, so we have optimization that will automatically

79
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,210
snapshot those unattached volumes

80
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:55,129
and delete them for you

81
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:57,849
and maybe even add tags if you wish as well.

82
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,758
We also will automate the

83
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:02,909
upgrade of volumes, and that means moving

84
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:05,669
from GP2 to GP 3 for a 20%

85
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:07,028
cost improvement

86
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:09,379
or moving from IO1 to IO2

87
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:10,849
for resiliency improvements.

88
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:13,990
And so this optimization capability

89
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,110
allows you to apply these recommendations

90
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,669
in your environment automatically.

91
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:20,080
You can apply them immediately

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,179
by selecting them and hitting execute or

93
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:22,979
implement,

94
00:03:23,278 --> 00:03:25,740
or you can create a policy

95
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:28,240
which will allow you to schedule the cleanups

96
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,399
and do it repeatedly over time to keep

97
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,520
your environment clean.

98
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,278
We're really excited about this because

99
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,699
as we were talking to customers there's

100
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,758
a lot of these volumes to go clean up

101
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:41,460
and we understand that the scale problem

102
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,580
took a lot of time from FinOps teams

103
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,740
and engineering teams and so this will allow

104
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,368
you to set up these automation rules and

105
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,659
move on to other more interesting or

106
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:52,939
impactful things where cleaning up storage

107
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,979
volumes isn't always the most fun and engaging.

108
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:58,199
So A little bit more details.

109
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:00,558
Here's a screenshot of our console. I'll

110
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:02,379
also go through a demo here in a minute.

111
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,909
Uh, you'll be able to see the recommendations that

112
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:07,080
are applicable for automation. You

113
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,099
can multi-select and click

114
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,538
the little review and apply button right there in the top

115
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:13,599
and save money immediately. And I

116
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,419
hope before

117
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,389
the end of the week maybe open up your laptop, take a

118
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,720
look at this, maybe try a few and

119
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,119
start saving money right away. My hope is that

120
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:24,439
at the end of reinvent you've all saved a little bit of money

121
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,059
with these optimization tools.

122
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,048
You can also create

123
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:30,230
these automation rules.

124
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:32,470
Now automation rules

125
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:34,910
are very flexible. You can

126
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,910
create an automation rule for your entire

127
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,428
payer account and organization.

128
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:41,170
You can create an automation rule for a

129
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,910
subset of accounts, say non-production

130
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:46,389
with different rules or configurations

131
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,988
or maybe an individual linked account as well,

132
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:51,528
so you can kind of scope out and figure

133
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:53,988
out. What specific

134
00:04:53,988 --> 00:04:56,290
scope or organization or team

135
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:58,670
is is OK with execution

136
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,988
of automation

137
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:02,269
of recommendations and create rules

138
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:02,778
just for them.

139
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,699
You can also add criteria

140
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,720
to the automation.

141
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,980
If you, how many of you have

142
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,170
tags

143
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,678
for environment like production and

144
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:16,699
non-production and.

145
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:20,170
These very envi environment variables

146
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:22,588
awesome. So if you want,

147
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,790
you can create an automation rule that

148
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,269
applies only to certain tag combinations,

149
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:29,709
and you can even select multiple different

150
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,088
tag combinations

151
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:33,709
or set rule criteria based on region,

152
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:34,850
capacity,

153
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,250
or quite a few other options as well.

154
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,879
Lastly, you can set a schedule

155
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,600
if your organization likes to

156
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:45,959
make changes in your environment in downtime

157
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,100
windows or maintenance windows, you can

158
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,379
select a window for these recommendations

159
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:51,338
to implement

160
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,850
which allows you to target those maintenance

161
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,559
windows,

162
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:56,858
uh, even though the recommendations that we

163
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:57,678
have for you

164
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:00,298
with automation have no downtime

165
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:02,028
or no necessary impact,

166
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,500
we understand a lot of organizations still do

167
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
have change control windows that they would like to

168
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,928
respect. Lastly,

169
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:12,829
Once you take the recommendations, do

170
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,480
you have a question? Sure, I'd take a question.

171
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:16,399
Can you do that

172
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:21,600
You can do it either across accounts

173
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,889
or in an individual account, and I'll

174
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:24,980
show that in the demo as well.

175
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:28,119
Tracking results. Once you have implemented

176
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:30,170
recommendations, you can look at how many were

177
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,689
implemented and how much savings

178
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:35,108
that you've accomplished or achieved

179
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,730
from taking these recommendations.

180
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:39,149
Now this graph is basically

181
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,410
a sum of the monthly

182
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,449
potential savings. We're not tracking it month

183
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,528
over month and accruing it over time. This is

184
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:47,730
just a very simple sum of that

185
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,850
potential savings metric.

186
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:53,709
One of the most important

187
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,709
parts of how we automate

188
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:56,750
optimization

189
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:58,608
is safety nets.

190
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:01,769
Engineering teams do not want to get

191
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,809
called at 2 in the morning because of incidents

192
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:05,278
or outages or issues,

193
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:07,869
so we've built a lot of these safety nets into

194
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:10,449
the automation pipeline to help

195
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,100
protect from any sort of impact.

196
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,738
You can roll back any

197
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,988
recommendation that you've implemented

198
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,850
for up to 1 year after

199
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,028
the automation has been implemented.

200
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,720
So because we automatically take

201
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,769
a snapshot of a volume before we make

202
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:27,629
a change on it.

203
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,759
We have that snapshot available to use

204
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:32,769
in a rollback event for one year.

205
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:35,759
We also have other safety nets.

206
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,259
We automatically check if

207
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,838
the reason why the volume was marked

208
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:43,238
as unattached is still true

209
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:45,338
before we implement the recommendation.

210
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:48,040
So there's another safety net, and if it fails

211
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,959
that check

212
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:50,819
of still being unattached,

213
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,199
then the automation will

214
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,379
be marked as failed,

215
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,278
and

216
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
anytime you have a failed automation,

217
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,119
it will make sure to not implement the

218
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,519
recommendation, thereby leaving you in a healthy

219
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,778
state. So

220
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:07,980
before we get to the next one, I'm going to switch over here

221
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,338
to my laptop and we're going to demo this automation

222
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:15,269
feature. So

223
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:17,730
those of you familiar with compute optimizer,

224
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:18,889
should be

225
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,579
a screen that you're used to and

226
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,439
The new thing here is on the left side of the

227
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,759
screen you'll see an automation section.

228
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:29,639
Um, I'm going to go ahead and click on recommended

229
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,769
actions. These are the recommendations that are

230
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:33,389
eligible for automation.

231
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:36,029
In this case, we have two recommendation types

232
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:38,750
snapshot and delete unattached EBS volumes

233
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:40,609
and upgrade EBS volumes.

234
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,918
In this case, I have some GP2 to GP

235
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:44,548
3 volumes that need to be upgraded,

236
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:46,940
and I can see the estimated savings for each

237
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,599
one of these,

238
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:50,369
and I can see exactly what recommendation type.

239
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:52,320
I have,

240
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,399
I can multi-select some of these recommendations,

241
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:57,979
and at the top of the screen it'll tell me how much money

242
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:00,700
I'll save per month by taking these recommendations

243
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:02,879
and I can click review and apply

244
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:05,340
so you can save money that quickly. How,

245
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,210
how many clicks was that? Like 45?

246
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:10,899
So the idea here is to make optimization

247
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:12,899
very easy for everybody to implement.

248
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,548
And if you have some

249
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:18,210
environments that just have a lot of

250
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,408
aged EBS volumes and you want to just

251
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:22,408
clean them up right now, this is a great option.

252
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,719
If you have a lot of accounts where

253
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:27,500
you want automated or recurring

254
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:30,599
uh implementation of automation,

255
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,359
you can create an automation rule.

256
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:35,779
Now you can create an automation rule at

257
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:38,359
the organization level or at a linked

258
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:39,019
account level

259
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,558
and you get to choose which ones

260
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:43,219
get implemented first

261
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,658
so you can kind of set priorities here

262
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,798
on if you want an individual team to

263
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:49,989
run their own automation or if you,

264
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:52,340
if maybe you have a central fin ops team

265
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,460
that manages optimization for everybody.

266
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,019
You'll have the ability to

267
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:59,668
have sort of organizational level

268
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:00,570
automation rules.

269
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,798
Uh, let's save questions to the end. Thank you.

270
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:06,519
Um, so

271
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,168
once I look at these automation rule options,

272
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:11,399
I can create this automation rule,

273
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,879
and I'm just going to create an organizational rule

274
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:16,308
and select my linked account in my org.

275
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:19,869
And I can choose which recommendation

276
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,889
types I would like to apply

277
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,129
in this policy.

278
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,590
Then I'm going to add some rule criteria.

279
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,580
In this case, we talked about tags.

280
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:31,469
Let's say I have an environment tag.

281
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:35,658
And say, I want the value to be

282
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,269
development.

283
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:38,729
How many of you have.

284
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,239
Had tags where some of them are capitalized

285
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,639
and some of them are lowercase.

286
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:47,308
OK, a lot of nods. OK, so I'm gonna type in

287
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:47,940
capital D

288
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,298
development and so you can have multiple

289
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:52,639
tag values here in your criteria

290
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,580
to catch it all.

291
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:56,558
And then you can also add additional criteria.

292
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,538
So say if I have

293
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:58,619
maybe.

294
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,019
Estimated savings or volume type criteria,

295
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,609
you can add that here as well

296
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:06,629
and really customize your automation

297
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:07,389
rules.

298
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,590
Uh, there you can do ors by

299
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,869
creating additional criteria and picking tag

300
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:16,690
again, so you can do and or ors.

301
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:19,750
Now once you've selected your criteria,

302
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:22,330
you'll get a refreshable list

303
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,538
of the volumes that match your criteria.

304
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,548
In this case, I actually don't have environment tags, but

305
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:29,320
you'll see the list of all of the volumes

306
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,928
that apply to the criteria that you've selected

307
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,190
and the estimated savings for

308
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,330
those recommendations,

309
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,529
and then you can set your schedule.

310
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,798
In this case you can set midnight on Saturday

311
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:42,798
or something like that and you can set it to

312
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:44,798
run for however many hours you have your

313
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:47,308
window. Note 100

314
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,658
recommendations will be implemented at a time,

315
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,859
and they can take

316
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
a variable amount of time depending on the size of the

317
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,639
volume. So just note if you have a lot of very

318
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,668
large volumes, they'll be a little bit slower to

319
00:11:57,668 --> 00:11:58,200
implement.

320
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,808
And implementation will stop

321
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:03,570
beginning as soon as the window completes.

322
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,538
You can also

323
00:12:05,798 --> 00:12:07,460
add new tags

324
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,029
to the newly changed resources,

325
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,788
so this is great because you can tag something as

326
00:12:12,788 --> 00:12:14,960
optimized. I've already optimized it,

327
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,279
and this allows you to understand how many

328
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,619
resources you've optimized later on or

329
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,859
use those tags for other FinOs purposes.

330
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,168
You name your rule

331
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,869
and then you can set the rule as active or inactive

332
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:28,288
if you'd like to save it for later

333
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:29,558
and once you

334
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,408
implement this group.

335
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:34,529
You'll be able to go into computer optimizer

336
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:35,710
automation events

337
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,168
and look at the historical number

338
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:40,210
of recommendations implemented and the

339
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,019
amount of savings.

340
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:43,469
You'll see any recommendations that completed

341
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,330
or if they failed and then rolled back,

342
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,229
and you can see those by month

343
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:49,769
and then you can see the savings by month as well.

344
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:51,859
So that's automation.

345
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:54,538
If you have any questions on this feature, we will definitely

346
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:56,580
be available after the session to answer questions.

347
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,820
We also have a blog post and a lot

348
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,058
of great content online to help.

349
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:05,570
Next up,

350
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:08,509
we have a new recommendation for you in compute optimizer.

351
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,178
How many of you have not gain

352
00:13:12,178 --> 00:13:13,469
weight usage in your environment?

353
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,450
OK,

354
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:18,629
Understanding if a NAT gateway is

355
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:20,750
being well utilized or not is a

356
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,038
complex task.

357
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:24,989
One of the things that we understand is a lot of customers

358
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:27,428
run NAT gateways, but they're designed to be

359
00:13:27,428 --> 00:13:29,769
failover or backup NA gateways

360
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:31,330
in case something happens.

361
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,090
So we designed a new

362
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:35,940
recommendation to detect idle nat gateways,

363
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:38,710
and we look at 30 days of historical utilization.

364
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,090
And we also look at if

365
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,899
the net gateway is referenced

366
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,469
in a route table

367
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,460
or associated with the route table.

368
00:13:47,808 --> 00:13:49,808
What that means is we check to see if

369
00:13:49,808 --> 00:13:51,330
it's a failover or backup,

370
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:54,109
not just if it has zero utilization.

371
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:56,609
This means we know that there's no route

372
00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:58,759
table association and there's no usage, so

373
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,808
this is a great opportunity for you to talk to the

374
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:03,009
network team and go figure out if this net gateway

375
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:03,750
is left behind

376
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,250
and really need it or not.

377
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:09,719
Once you view

378
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,320
uh Nat gateway recommendation and compute optimizer,

379
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:14,940
you'll see them populate in the idle recommendation

380
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,940
list, and then you will be

381
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,940
able to click into it and see the utilization

382
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,129
details that validates that this Nat gateway

383
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,239
is not being consumed

384
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,320
and may be an option for you to clean up.

385
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:26,700
Next up,

386
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,700
cloud optimization efficiency.

387
00:14:29,158 --> 00:14:31,178
We in the cost optimization hub

388
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:33,399
launched a brand new metric that we're really excited

389
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,798
about. We

390
00:14:36,798 --> 00:14:38,918
heard from a lot of customers that there's

391
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:41,500
not very many metrics or KPIs

392
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,759
for optimization success

393
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,428
in the FinO space. We have a lot of cost visibility

394
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,440
KPIs, but the optimization

395
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,519
space is kind of lagged behind on a maturity curve

396
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,139
a little bit.

397
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:54,000
There are some metrics that we've heard from customers

398
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,418
like effective savings rate,

399
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,080
average CPU utilization. But they only

400
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,418
show part of the puzzle.

401
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,090
Effective savings rate, if you optimize it very

402
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,619
well,

403
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:05,200
will push commitments really high, but

404
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,308
then maybe block you from right sizing or cleaning up

405
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:07,820
idle.

406
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,099
The same with resource optimization.

407
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,359
If you only optimize resources, you may be leaving

408
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,489
commitments on the table.

409
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:15,879
So we wanted to come up with a new metric that

410
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:18,119
equally measures and balances the value

411
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:20,719
of right sizing and resource optimization

412
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:22,080
with commitment optimization.

413
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,379
We heard from a lot of customers that they've tried

414
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:26,639
to make metrics on their own,

415
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:29,399
convincing leadership of the value of the metrics

416
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,769
and coming to a common agreement on the

417
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:33,239
definition is very challenging.

418
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:34,719
So we wanted to

419
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:36,619
make an attempt at this, so

420
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,979
we created the cost efficiency metric in

421
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,918
the cost optimization hub product.

422
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,769
This is available today for you. We launched it about a

423
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:44,668
week and a half ago.

424
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:47,440
And this metric is automatically generated and

425
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,149
populated

426
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,570
with 90 days of daily historical

427
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,869
granularity in cost optimization hub.

428
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,330
This will allow you to set targets and

429
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,548
benchmark your cost efficiency over time

430
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:00,219
and ideally save more,

431
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,529
more money by helping convince leadership that

432
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,649
efficiency is a very important investment

433
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:05,489
for your organization.

434
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,529
Here's what it looks like.

435
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:10,649
In the cost optimization hub you'll see a brand

436
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:12,690
new graph on the right side. It is your

437
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,519
cost efficiency.

438
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:16,298
In this case, my environment is very inefficient

439
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:17,308
because it's a demo account.

440
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:20,129
You'll see it trended over 90 days, so

441
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:20,918
you can see.

442
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,808
As you're building new resources, are they efficient

443
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:24,710
and effective,

444
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:25,788
or

445
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:28,250
maybe new resources are not

446
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,269
so efficient and you're seeing the number drop?

447
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,719
This is a great way to talk to individual

448
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,428
resource owners or account owners.

449
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:36,889
Maybe some resource and account owners have

450
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:39,048
really great efficiency and maybe have some

451
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:41,269
stories to tell about how they were able to do that

452
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,609
and you can do a little bit of culture work and knowledge

453
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:46,269
sharing with teams that are really good at optimization

454
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,229
with teams that maybe need more help.

455
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:52,009
So let's talk a little bit about how efficiency metric

456
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:52,928
works.

457
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:55,820
We take the total potential savings

458
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,190
of all of our recommendations in cost optimization

459
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,700
hub, compute optimizer recommendations,

460
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:02,158
right size, idol,

461
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:04,670
RI savings plan recommendations.

462
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:05,930
We combine them all together.

463
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,358
We deduplicate the savings

464
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:10,938
so we don't overstate savings, meaning

465
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:13,159
if there's a bunch of idle resources we won't

466
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:15,417
tell you to buy a savings plan for them, for example,

467
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:16,659
we take that number

468
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:19,458
and we divide it by the total potential

469
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:21,638
optimizable spend. What that means

470
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:23,989
is. We take some things out of this number like

471
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:24,588
credits,

472
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:25,699
fees,

473
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:28,410
support costs, things that we can't optimize,

474
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,949
so we have a more stable baseline amount

475
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,029
of spend that is optimizable that we

476
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:34,189
provide recommendations for.

477
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:36,469
Then we divide one by 2 and

478
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:37,578
we have a percentage.

479
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:39,989
In this case, if you have

480
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:42,269
maybe $10,000 of potential savings

481
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,368
on an account with $100,000 of

482
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:47,029
optimizable spend, your efficiency is 90%.

483
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,568
The idea is to make this very easy

484
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,890
to explain to leadership,

485
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,608
and every single individual percentage

486
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:55,969
point of efficiency relates

487
00:17:55,969 --> 00:17:57,969
to a real dollar value that

488
00:17:57,969 --> 00:17:58,969
is on your invoice,

489
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,489
so driving this metric up will be an

490
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:03,348
actual real business impact

491
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:04,529
to your cost.

492
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:09,289
You will be able to look at the metric by

493
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:09,828
account,

494
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:11,088
by region.

495
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:13,750
And you can look at top 5 highest

496
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,559
efficiency,

497
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:16,618
lowest 5 efficiency,

498
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,078
and again you could look at specific date

499
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:20,739
ranges as well if you had

500
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,318
very specific moments in time

501
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:25,358
where a savings plan expired or you

502
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:26,578
bought a new savings plan

503
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
and your efficiency took a drastic change, you'll

504
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,880
be able to zoom in on that and understand

505
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,479
how are the activities you're doing today

506
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,519
in your FinOs practice will

507
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,019
influence your overall efficiency.

508
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:42,939
Thank you all so much. I'm going to invite,

509
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:45,039
uh, Bonnie up from Delta to

510
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,239
tell her story about how they use compute

511
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:49,140
optimizer to optimize their estate,

512
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,559
and, uh, I really appreciate

513
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,640
all you attending. If you have questions on

514
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,750
these new features, we'll be available afterwards.

515
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:56,838
Thanks, Bonnie.

516
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,789
Thanks so muchtric.

517
00:18:58,598 --> 00:19:00,719
You know, personally, I'm most excited about

518
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:02,799
the efficiency metric. It had been part of

519
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,420
my 2026 roadmap,

520
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,358
so I've got one done now, right?

521
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:10,269
So when I stepped into my role, Delta

522
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:12,910
was about 3 years into a massive cloud migration

523
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,140
program. An early FinOs practice

524
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,380
had been established, mostly focused on

525
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,650
show back with a little bit of purchase commitment

526
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,199
as well.

527
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:23,900
Fin-Os became a hot topic for us for

528
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,180
the same reason I imagine it has for most of you.

529
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,318
Our cloud bill is growing rapidly,

530
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:30,578
and we need levers to pull to rein it in.

531
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:34,000
Now at this point, all of my FinOps

532
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,098
knowledge came from a web search I did prior

533
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:37,588
to accepting my position.

534
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,989
So I had no idea what those levers would be.

535
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:42,828
Luckily for me, compute optimizer had a

536
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:43,729
set ready to go.

537
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:47,750
Getting people to adopt those optimizations

538
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,509
in an organization our size

539
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,250
has definitely been a journey.

540
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:54,509
We learned a lot about the gap between intent

541
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:55,289
and reality.

542
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:58,219
Turned to automation to help along the way,

543
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,920
and ultimately ended up achieving measurable

544
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,539
change.

545
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:04,019
So today I'll share a little bit of that journey with you.

546
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:09,269
I'm a product person by trade,

547
00:20:09,568 --> 00:20:11,108
so when I first saw the recommendations,

548
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:14,209
to me it looked like a large number of stories

549
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:15,588
that needed to be written,

550
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:16,650
refined,

551
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:17,799
assigned,

552
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,029
and worked by a large number of teams.

553
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,489
Those stories and the desire to reduce our cloud

554
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,670
costs predated me,

555
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,098
so it was pretty obvious that my job was to

556
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:29,199
figure out how to turn those opportunities

557
00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:30,500
into reality.

558
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,989
So I started, as I think a lot of people with my

559
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:34,660
background would,

560
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:36,299
with the five W's.

561
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:39,439
Where were people supposed to be picking up the work

562
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,500
from? Developers log

563
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,848
into their accounts daily,

564
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,219
but the people managing the backlogs don't,

565
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:47,118
and they need a central place to go

566
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,539
to see all the recommendations across

567
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,699
the 1200 account ecosystem we have.

568
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:55,549
Who is supposed to be performing the work?

569
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:58,209
If we're gonna ask these busy teams to

570
00:20:58,209 --> 00:21:00,239
put even more work into their backlogs,

571
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:02,588
we couldn't be asking them to also figure out which

572
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:03,670
work was theirs,

573
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,250
nor could we establish any sort of accountability

574
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,170
mechanisms without that information.

575
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,299
What was the work?

576
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,098
I went in with the assumption that even though I

577
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:16,380
may not personally understand the optimization

578
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,019
opportunity,

579
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,000
the teams performing the work would.

580
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:22,368
But as I mentioned, we're in the middle of a migration journey,

581
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,828
and for many of our developers, the clock was

582
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:26,588
just as new to them as it was to me.

583
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,318
When was the work going to get done?

584
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,848
As an organization, we had quite a few priorities,

585
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:36,809
and we're going to have to figure out how to get the visibility

586
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,150
to move up the ladder if we wanted the work to get

587
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,219
done. And

588
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:42,338
then finally, why?

589
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:44,568
The work was there,

590
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,410
the desire was there.

591
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:48,348
So why wasn't it getting done?

592
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,779
This probably sounds pretty familiar as I

593
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:53,858
found it echoes some of the key findings in

594
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:56,000
the 2025 State of FinOs report

595
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,318
by the FinOsS Foundation.

596
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,858
Competing priorities,

597
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,318
lack of accountability, and lack of

598
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:02,989
understanding

599
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:05,219
are challenges that a lot of us are facing.

600
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:11,588
We decided to start by tackling where

601
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:14,289
and who through the creation of the opportunity dashboard.

602
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,430
The recommendations are centralized in a single

603
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,239
database

604
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,239
and then enriched with organizational context

605
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,318
like leader or application name

606
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,689
to provide clear lines of ownership.

607
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:29,670
Then the report's broken down into two levels.

608
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,229
The summary report lets you view

609
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,670
across both teams and opportunities

610
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:36,750
where the greatest savings lie.

611
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:39,410
So whether you own a single application or

612
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,390
an entire development organization,

613
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:44,170
you can quickly filter and see where your team's

614
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,368
efforts can best be spent.

615
00:22:46,838 --> 00:22:49,239
Then each opportunity has a detailed

616
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:49,779
report.

617
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
And that's really more relevant to the people

618
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,380
performing the work.

619
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,699
You can see at a resource level things like

620
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:58,348
what account the resources in,

621
00:22:58,818 --> 00:23:01,338
what the actual savings estimate for that particular

622
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,098
resource is,

623
00:23:02,699 --> 00:23:04,979
and usage metrics that can be helpful in

624
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:07,299
understanding why the recommendation was made.

625
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,430
Than to help with the understanding of what.

626
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,519
Each opportunity has its own opportunity

627
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,170
run book.

628
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:18,189
This Rum book takes in a 5 minute or

629
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,000
less read,

630
00:23:19,318 --> 00:23:21,920
all of the essential points that you need to

631
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,160
understand, validate, and

632
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,618
implement an opportunity.

633
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,410
This is to help with capacity constraints.

634
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:32,430
The FinOps team has the time and frankly

635
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,289
the mandate to go deep dive into these opportunities

636
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,848
and understand what they are and their implications.

637
00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:40,699
So by consolidating that information into

638
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:42,009
a Cliff Notes version,

639
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,588
you can enable your developers to spend less time

640
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:45,130
reading

641
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:46,789
and more time optimizing.

642
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,799
I'm gonna pause here and touch on our tagging

643
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,618
strategy.

644
00:23:54,118 --> 00:23:55,818
While I can't take any credit for it,

645
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,519
I think it's really lightweight from a maintenance

646
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,380
perspective

647
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,880
and results in a high quality of data, so it's

648
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,640
worth a mention.

649
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:06,489
Instead of requiring teams to maintain a bunch

650
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:08,088
of tags on each resource,

651
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:10,608
we use a 10 character code and a primary

652
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:12,890
key that represents the business

653
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,029
capability the technology supports.

654
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:18,108
The reason this works so well is that while the

655
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:19,729
exact functionality

656
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,328
or the ownership is likely to change over time,

657
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:24,729
that core business capability

658
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,189
generally does not.

659
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,209
Each code gets registered in a central architecture

660
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:31,269
repository,

661
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,789
so teams have a single place to go

662
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:36,130
to keep the contextual information that we're

663
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,309
so reliant on

664
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,439
up to date.

665
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:48,098
So I

666
00:24:48,098 --> 00:24:50,400
don't know if any of you have experienced what I did.

667
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:53,059
We have foundational reporting now where you can

668
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,699
go into a room of leaders

669
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:57,479
and talk about the savings opportunities you've found

670
00:24:57,939 --> 00:24:59,979
and watch the dollars roll off the cloud

671
00:24:59,979 --> 00:25:00,959
bill in their eyes.

672
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,259
It's fantastic

673
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,279
until you realize that not all opportunities

674
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,739
can be turned into savings.

675
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:10,880
Early on, I had to roll back some pretty

676
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,459
big numbers I'd reported on

677
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,029
after the teams told me that the opportunities

678
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:16,660
wouldn't stay valid for long

679
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,219
due to upcoming changes in usage patterns.

680
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:22,630
Now there was nothing wrong with the recommendation, it

681
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,608
was accurate.

682
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:25,979
So the key learning here

683
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:28,838
is that teams have critical information

684
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:31,818
about plane changes, about their roadmaps,

685
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,279
and if you want to present an accurate picture of

686
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:34,989
savings,

687
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,939
you have to incorporate that.

688
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:41,000
So with that, our dashboard changed

689
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:43,118
from purely a reporting mechanism.

690
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,769
To also incorporate a decision from the teams.

691
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:48,920
Were they going to implement

692
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,598
or reject an opportunity?

693
00:25:51,328 --> 00:25:53,568
Or did they need to test in a lower environment

694
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:54,608
prior to deciding?

695
00:25:55,838 --> 00:25:57,930
If they chose to reject it, they also had

696
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,789
to provide a justification,

697
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:02,799
and that was to allow us a starting point for

698
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,588
conversations later

699
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:05,969
if teams were rejecting opportunities that

700
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:06,989
stayed valid,

701
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,709
maybe just based on a lack of understanding.

702
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,979
So with this information

703
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:15,719
you can now go in and talk about the savings

704
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:17,939
that your teams have said they will implement.

705
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:19,539
I did that.

706
00:26:20,568 --> 00:26:22,068
And then I went in the next month,

707
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:23,549
and the next month,

708
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:26,259
and talked about many of the same opportunities

709
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:27,709
and many of the same numbers.

710
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:30,618
And our leaders started asking one of the same questions

711
00:26:30,618 --> 00:26:31,640
I started with,

712
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,759
when is this going to happen?

713
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,189
That led us to add our final 2 decision

714
00:26:37,189 --> 00:26:37,809
points.

715
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:41,059
A timeline for implementation.

716
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,299
And then a reason for delay

717
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:47,180
if the recommendation was expected to stay idle

718
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,459
for more than 30 days.

719
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,289
Now you have a system that provides clear

720
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:58,549
line of sight into those five W's.

721
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,170
Each week the recommendations get refreshed,

722
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,750
and depending on their change in state, if

723
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,769
they still exist,

724
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:08,189
they roll up into one of 3 reports.

725
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,989
Unaction opportunities are rolled up by justification

726
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:12,910
and timeline.

727
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:16,539
This is to provide insight into the cost

728
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:17,199
opportunity

729
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,039
of prioritizing other work.

730
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:23,318
Rejected opportunities going into a validation

731
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:25,318
report. If teams are

732
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:27,549
rejecting opportunities that continue

733
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:29,299
to show up week after week.

734
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:32,189
There should be a sign off that those are costs that

735
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:34,160
our organization is willing to carry.

736
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:38,949
The fun one is implemented opportunities

737
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,670
going to the track savings report.

738
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:44,269
For this one, we baseline the cost of the

739
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:46,439
resource the month before the optimization is

740
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:48,549
performed. And we compare that

741
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:50,199
to subsequent month costs,

742
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:52,368
which allows us to

743
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,789
track savings

744
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:56,630
even if a team's account or environment

745
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,160
or system is still growing.

746
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,739
So what this transparency and the

747
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:05,150
conversations that we had after it showed to us

748
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:08,189
was that we had a fundamental misalignment

749
00:28:08,568 --> 00:28:10,729
between team and leader timelines

750
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:12,469
for implementing these changes.

751
00:28:13,469 --> 00:28:15,289
Leaders want the savings now.

752
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:18,088
Teams agreed to implement the savings.

753
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,969
But we still had teams migrating workloads.

754
00:28:22,838 --> 00:28:24,140
We still had uh

755
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,759
traffic coming in. The business certainly

756
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:29,059
hadn't stopped asking for new capabilities,

757
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,779
and teams knew that this was important,

758
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,328
but it just wasn't translating to

759
00:28:34,328 --> 00:28:35,759
those stories getting committed.

760
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,459
So my team turned to automation.

761
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,000
If we knew they're OK with it and they just

762
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,019
couldn't get to it,

763
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:45,479
we could automate some of that implementation

764
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:47,858
work and let them focus on those other efforts.

765
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:55,519
We started at one of the same places the compute optimizer

766
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:56,180
team did,

767
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,660
cleaning up unattached DBS volumes.

768
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:01,709
We chose this for a number of reasons.

769
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,670
First, there were 0 autonomy concerns.

770
00:29:06,098 --> 00:29:08,180
We weren't making changes to systems and

771
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,180
there was a broad agreement that no one was

772
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,150
abandoning these volumes on purpose.

773
00:29:13,328 --> 00:29:15,608
2nd was the number of volumes. We

774
00:29:15,608 --> 00:29:16,549
knew this was a place

775
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,519
that we could demonstrate measurable savings,

776
00:29:19,848 --> 00:29:22,068
both in terms of dollar and time.

777
00:29:23,098 --> 00:29:25,118
And then 3rd, we had an on-premise policy

778
00:29:25,118 --> 00:29:25,979
to replicate,

779
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:28,019
so the behavior wasn't new.

780
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,848
Our flow is pretty much the same as what you saw

781
00:29:31,848 --> 00:29:34,049
and honestly if the automation had existed

782
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:34,650
back then,

783
00:29:34,969 --> 00:29:36,709
we would have used it rather than build it.

784
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,239
But if you're looking for a place to start,

785
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,118
uh, automating cost optimization,

786
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,959
I highly recommend you check this one out.

787
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:48,930
Especially with the ability to create snapshots,

788
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,769
though I've yet to hear of a single one being restored,

789
00:29:52,078 --> 00:29:54,469
it's a good way to build trust in automation

790
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,250
and save some money along the way.

791
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,598
We must have been cosmically aligned or something,

792
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,549
because we also looked to volume conversions next.

793
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:08,568
For us it was mainly IO1 to GP 3.

794
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,180
There was definitely a little bit more concern

795
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,459
here because we're gonna make changes

796
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:15,279
to the system.

797
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,180
So this required us to do some more

798
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,368
education. We used metrics

799
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:22,529
to show teams that GP 3 would more than

800
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,750
meet their system requirements in most cases.

801
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:28,009
And we also had to let people know that not using

802
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:30,309
GP 3 hadn't been a design decision.

803
00:30:30,568 --> 00:30:32,598
It was new technology. It simply hadn't

804
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:34,630
existed when they were deploying their systems.

805
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:39,130
The automation approach is more aligned with that rules-based

806
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:39,750
approach

807
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,410
in that this automation only runs in

808
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,250
accounts where teams have agreed to opt in.

809
00:30:44,858 --> 00:30:46,900
And it only runs against resources

810
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,680
that teams have agreed to optimize.

811
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,259
This lets teams that are doing all of their updates

812
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:54,160
through pipeline keep their environments clean.

813
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:57,108
And ensures that we're aligning with testing timelines

814
00:30:57,108 --> 00:30:58,199
and things like that.

815
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,029
Now the immediate concern here

816
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:04,769
was that we're going to limit our savings

817
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:06,529
by allowing teams this latitude.

818
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:10,039
But that's mostly mitigated by the fact

819
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:12,618
that the reporting is agnostic of how you

820
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:13,539
choose to implement.

821
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,699
Whether you solely use automation or

822
00:31:16,699 --> 00:31:18,479
perform every single update yourself,

823
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,939
what's important is that you align with your leader's

824
00:31:20,939 --> 00:31:22,479
timeline for getting the work done.

825
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:26,608
With this automation for the resources

826
00:31:26,608 --> 00:31:28,348
that it does run against,

827
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:30,949
after updating the volume directly,

828
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:33,328
it also loops back and updates

829
00:31:33,328 --> 00:31:34,670
on drifted stacks.

830
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:37,969
This further helps build buy-in because you're not

831
00:31:37,969 --> 00:31:40,309
creating tech debt for teams to clean up later

832
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:42,809
and you're also ensuring that it doesn't just pop up on

833
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:45,309
the report again the next time the system is redeployed.

834
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:49,348
Finally, we follow everything up with an

835
00:31:49,348 --> 00:31:51,670
email letting teams know what work was

836
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,289
completed

837
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,269
and what work, if any,

838
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,229
remains.

839
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,439
All right, so this set us up to

840
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:02,588
go after the big one,

841
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,348
Easy to right sizing.

842
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,219
Now, we knew we had to tread carefully

843
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:09,680
and we had to get this right,

844
00:32:10,118 --> 00:32:12,279
because another team had made an attempt at

845
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,818
right sizing with a different tool's recommendations,

846
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,739
and it was pretty disruptive.

847
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,000
We are confident that we could do this with a compute

848
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,189
optimizer for a couple of reasons.

849
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:25,160
One was simply the trust that we had built

850
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,059
in this uh both the automation.

851
00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:30,098
And the recommendations in our previous efforts.

852
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,920
And 2 is the ability to customize

853
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,299
those recommendations.

854
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,838
For our first pass, we set the highest threshold

855
00:32:37,838 --> 00:32:38,890
for both CPU

856
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,338
and memory utilization headroom,

857
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:43,959
letting teams feel comfortable that they had room to

858
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:46,380
grow. We also excluded

859
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,759
some instance types that weren't compatible

860
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,259
with agents on our base build.

861
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:54,150
The first run at this was pretty simple. We

862
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,299
looped through the recommendations,

863
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,799
further refine them to low-risk options

864
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,420
with no architectural changes.

865
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:03,500
Generated an email with an approval link

866
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,539
for the managers.

867
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:07,568
And then executed approved changes during

868
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,809
our standard change window.

869
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:12,219
And I think I had about 3 approvals

870
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:13,118
through the system.

871
00:33:13,699 --> 00:33:15,959
So once again we had to take to the teams

872
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,939
and try to figure out what we were missing.

873
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:21,549
Getting buy-in for this

874
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,809
required us to adapt to design and resiliency

875
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:25,890
standards in our org.

876
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:29,559
This is, uh, this was things like identifying

877
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:31,660
boxes that needed to be sized identically

878
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,739
for low balancing purposes.

879
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:37,420
Creating different patterns for different environments

880
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,598
or different resiliency tiers.

881
00:33:40,858 --> 00:33:42,910
And allowing an opt-out option

882
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,328
for teams that maybe have vendor

883
00:33:45,328 --> 00:33:47,500
software that has specific requirements

884
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,059
behind it.

885
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:52,670
This was definitely a heavier lift,

886
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,130
but what it allowed us to do ultimately

887
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,858
was shift from an opt-in

888
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,729
to an opt-out approach,

889
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,709
providing greater savings.

890
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,500
Now what I haven't stated explicitly, but

891
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,239
I hope you've heard through all this,

892
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,559
is how key communication is.

893
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,300
And I want to stress how critical it is in

894
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,958
this space to establish

895
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,378
and to adhere to a communication pattern.

896
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:20,559
For us it looks something like this,

897
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:21,688
in form,

898
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:23,469
often more than once.

899
00:34:24,268 --> 00:34:26,028
Then open the door for feedback.

900
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:28,829
Don't go in assuming that you know why an

901
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:31,608
unoptimized decision was made.

902
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,530
When you do take action,

903
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,369
make sure you're transparent

904
00:34:36,628 --> 00:34:38,389
about what's being done with that feedback.

905
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,619
Teams need to have confidence that you've heard them

906
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,159
and that you understand the potential implications

907
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,059
of whatever decision is finally made.

908
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:50,619
For our organization, this has also been aided

909
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:52,648
by the implementation of a cost champion

910
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:54,679
program. I have a really small team.

911
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:55,860
There's 4 of us.

912
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,619
And so getting the scale

913
00:34:58,619 --> 00:34:59,648
of work done,

914
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,949
we had each cost center owner

915
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:03,590
appoint a champion or two.

916
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:06,429
And we meet with these these people on a

917
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:07,809
biweekly basis.

918
00:35:08,469 --> 00:35:10,809
We educate them about new opportunities.

919
00:35:11,668 --> 00:35:13,809
We tell them about new processes, change to

920
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:14,409
reporting,

921
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:17,148
and more recently, and my favorite is they've

922
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,489
started coming to us

923
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:21,590
and educating us in the community about optimizations

924
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,869
that they've actually found.

925
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:25,829
They trust us,

926
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:28,909
their teams trust their knowledge of their domains,

927
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:31,619
and those two things combined let us get far

928
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,489
greater reach than we could have on our own.

929
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:39,599
And

930
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:41,929
along that journey we've managed to see a

931
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:44,228
27% monthly cost savings.

932
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,250
Just as important to me, if

933
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,438
maybe not to my boss,

934
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:50,969
is the cultural transformation that we've achieved

935
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:51,708
along the way.

936
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,119
Teams as they become more educated about these

937
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,199
optimizations are starting

938
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,438
to shift left and incorporate them in their

939
00:35:59,438 --> 00:36:00,500
design phases.

940
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,840
Which is allowing FinOs to become a part of

941
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,739
how we work,

942
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
rather than the extra work it seemed to be

943
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,079
initially.

944
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,389
That partnership is so key

945
00:36:12,389 --> 00:36:13,628
in building trust,

946
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,489
to making that happen, and it ultimately

947
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:17,789
leads to the teams

948
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,668
being more likely to accept new optimizations

949
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:22,188
and new automations.

950
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,418
And all of this combined

951
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,320
provides the foundation for our leaders to make

952
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,429
data-driven decisions that thread

953
00:36:30,429 --> 00:36:32,648
the line between cost optimization

954
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:35,079
and the 100 other priorities that cross their

955
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:35,958
desks every day.

956
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,378
Now I mentioned at the beginning that we

957
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:42,110
have some purchase commitments,

958
00:36:42,438 --> 00:36:44,780
but we've kept a modest baseline to this point,

959
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:47,000
and that's been an intentional strategy.

960
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:50,059
We didn't want to commit ourselves to resources

961
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:51,559
that were maybe oversized

962
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,418
or entirely unnecessary.

963
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:57,148
But now that we're reaching a much better state,

964
00:36:57,659 --> 00:36:59,699
we intend to look to this in 26 as a

965
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:01,530
big lever to control our costs.

966
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,039
So I wanna invite Mary up onto the stage

967
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:06,728
to tell us more about the some developments in that

968
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:08,728
space. Perfect. Thank you,

969
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,099
Bonnie. Thank you so much for the insights and the

970
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:11,639
stories.

971
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:12,699
Um,

972
00:37:13,168 --> 00:37:13,679
hi everybody.

973
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,188
Uh, have a key question for you.

974
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,958
What do you do when you have

975
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:21,458
different types of databases running

976
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:22,530
across your environment?

977
00:37:22,938 --> 00:37:24,719
You want to optimize your cost

978
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:26,679
and you want to do it fast.

979
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,119
From this week, you can purchase

980
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,978
a database savings plan.

981
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:34,860
Uh, thank you.

982
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:37,878
This is um

983
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,478
one of the most exciting uh launches

984
00:37:40,478 --> 00:37:42,750
we have uh at this reinvent. Uh,

985
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,800
we saw a lot of excitements already in the

986
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,918
news. Um, my name is

987
00:37:46,918 --> 00:37:49,159
Mary Naimov. I lead the savings

988
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:51,280
plan purchase experience at AWS

989
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,438
and overall, I'm just obsessed

990
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,590
about creating simple experiences

991
00:37:56,869 --> 00:37:58,590
for technical complex products.

992
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:00,199
Today,

993
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:01,918
I'm going to show you,

994
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:02,750
uh,

995
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,619
basically we'll go through an introduction of

996
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:07,208
what are database savings plans.

997
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:09,590
Then we'll see how the savings plans will

998
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,699
apply to your database services

999
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:13,809
usage. And lastly, I'll show

1000
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:15,860
you how to purchase a database savings plan

1001
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:17,000
with our own

1002
00:38:17,418 --> 00:38:19,780
native AWS tooling like savings

1003
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,030
plan purchase analyzer

1004
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,780
and savings plan recommendations.

1005
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,398
Uh, can you raise your hand again who used

1006
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:26,599
these tools before?

1007
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,760
OK, perfect.

1008
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,208
Great. Uh, so you can utilize

1009
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,030
your knowledge

1010
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,289
to purchase the new database savings plan.

1011
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,610
And if you never purchased a database savings

1012
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,409
plan, don't worry, after this talk,

1013
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:41,039
you're going to be an expert and you will be able to

1014
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,320
teach other people how to purchase a database

1015
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,889
savings plan.

1016
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:47,820
OK, so let's start with the basics.

1017
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,579
A savings plan is basically a

1018
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:51,699
um a

1019
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,079
$1 per hour commitment for a

1020
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,110
long-term period.

1021
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:58,099
You can purchase, for example, $1

1022
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:00,599
for 1 year and in exchange for

1023
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,039
this long-term commitment,

1024
00:39:02,438 --> 00:39:04,340
you will get a discount pricing.

1025
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,750
It's the easiest way to start saving

1026
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,119
in your AWS environment because it doesn't

1027
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,300
require any

1028
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:12,938
Architectural changes and the best part

1029
00:39:12,938 --> 00:39:15,530
is after you purchase it, it automatically

1030
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,188
applies

1031
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:18,599
to all the eligible usage you have in your

1032
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,780
environment. So you don't really have to do

1033
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,860
anything after you purchase. You just monitor the success

1034
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,360
of that, then you can repurchase more

1035
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,539
and more as you have a consistent usage in your

1036
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:30,648
environment. A

1037
00:39:30,648 --> 00:39:32,648
little small history

1038
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:34,090
lesson about savings plan.

1039
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,688
Today we have all these types in our environment.

1040
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:39,110
We launched Compute and EC2 savings plan

1041
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,329
in 2019.

1042
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:43,110
Sagemaker came out in 2021,

1043
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:44,179
and this week,

1044
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:46,849
as I said, we are really proud to

1045
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:49,889
introduce database savings plan of 2025.

1046
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,228
The database savings plan gives

1047
00:39:53,228 --> 00:39:55,280
you up to 35%

1048
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,369
discount. It's

1049
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:59,369
a one year commitment and

1050
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:00,769
it's no upfront cost,

1051
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,329
no upfront payment, which means that you're going to

1052
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:04,188
pay for this.

1053
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,309
On a monthly basis.

1054
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:09,429
Uh, it's very easy. All this

1055
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:10,599
information is also in the UI,

1056
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:13,119
so you really don't have to memorize it. The

1057
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,340
UI will guide you through the purchase experience.

1058
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:19,059
OK, this is one of the key slides that

1059
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:20,869
a lot of our customers are curious about.

1060
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,889
What actually the database savings

1061
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:24,579
plan will cover.

1062
00:40:24,898 --> 00:40:27,099
So we have 9 types of

1063
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:28,639
database savings plans

1064
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:31,579
services that it will cover like RDS,

1065
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:34,114
Aurora. Dynamo DB elastic cash,

1066
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:35,925
you're welcome to take a picture,

1067
00:40:36,543 --> 00:40:38,905
as you can see, the serverless has a

1068
00:40:38,905 --> 00:40:40,244
higher type of discount,

1069
00:40:40,594 --> 00:40:42,954
so this savings plan is actually encouraging

1070
00:40:42,954 --> 00:40:43,773
you to modernize

1071
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:46,164
and move from instances to server-less.

1072
00:40:46,474 --> 00:40:47,494
Once you do that.

1073
00:40:48,148 --> 00:40:50,269
The savings that you will get from the

1074
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:52,429
same purchase will be actually higher because

1075
00:40:52,429 --> 00:40:54,539
it will cover the ser serverless

1076
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:59,708
types. After

1077
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,728
you purchase the savings plan, it will

1078
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:03,148
start to apply to your usage.

1079
00:41:03,648 --> 00:41:05,809
So in this example, uh, we show

1080
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:08,559
that there is Aurora serverless with 35%

1081
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:10,610
discount, Elastic Cash, and Dynamo

1082
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,070
DB. Once you purchase the database

1083
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,128
savings plan, it will start to apply

1084
00:41:15,128 --> 00:41:15,648
to the

1085
00:41:16,478 --> 00:41:18,478
Service with the highest

1086
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:21,059
discount. So in this case, 35%

1087
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,389
on serverless Aurora.

1088
00:41:23,918 --> 00:41:25,958
Once it applies to that,

1089
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:28,320
it will trickle to Elastic Cash and finally

1090
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,119
to Dynamo DB.

1091
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:31,780
In this way, it maximizes

1092
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,188
the savings plan you get from the purchase because it

1093
00:41:34,188 --> 00:41:36,260
applies to the highest discount first.

1094
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,530
When you, OK, so you say I, I

1095
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,360
have all these

1096
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:43,139
different services running, how much should I buy?

1097
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:44,800
How should I decide what to buy?

1098
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:48,449
You can start with a conservative purchase of

1099
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:49,559
50% coverage.

1100
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:51,119
It's a great start.

1101
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,610
So if you have no savings plan currently

1102
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,769
in your environment, you just start with something

1103
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:57,228
and you start covering 50%.

1104
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,030
In this case, we're covering

1105
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:01,369
uh most all of the aurora and

1106
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:02,590
most of the elastic cash.

1107
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,409
Uh, you can then move on and maximize

1108
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:07,648
your savings. So this is a watermark

1109
00:42:07,648 --> 00:42:09,688
line of this is the max

1110
00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:12,429
savings you can get from savings from purchases

1111
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,269
because if you go above this line.

1112
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:17,168
You actually don't have enough of

1113
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:18,228
on-demand

1114
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:21,239
to justify a savings fun purchase.

1115
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,269
That max savings, we actually in our tooling

1116
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:26,530
will help you to find that watermark line

1117
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:29,188
and you can build up to it with small purchases

1118
00:42:29,188 --> 00:42:31,199
over time. Or if you have an

1119
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:33,389
environment that is always growing, you can

1120
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:35,510
start from max savings and just keep purchasing

1121
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,820
more and more as your usage becomes

1122
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,469
consistent.

1123
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,800
OK, so lastly, before

1124
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,820
we jump to the demo, I want to show you the

1125
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,559
um workflow that our customers

1126
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,800
do for all their savings plans.

1127
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:51,978
First, you analyze your environment and

1128
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:54,989
you use your recommendation or purchase analyzer

1129
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:55,619
to decide

1130
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,059
on which one to purchase.

1131
00:42:57,478 --> 00:42:59,539
You add it to the cart with a few clicks

1132
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:01,840
you purchase and then you start monitoring

1133
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,398
it with coverage and utilization

1134
00:43:04,398 --> 00:43:04,978
reports.

1135
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,809
Coverage utilization reports will show

1136
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:09,869
you how much of your on-demand is covered

1137
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,289
and how much your savings plan is being utilized

1138
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:13,148
in the environment.

1139
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:15,688
Lastly, after you review your

1140
00:43:15,688 --> 00:43:17,849
purchase in the reports, you can

1141
00:43:17,849 --> 00:43:20,208
again do the same thing. Use the

1142
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:22,360
tools to analyze a new purchase, repurchase

1143
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,030
and just see your coverage grow over time.

1144
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,300
With that, I'm really excited to show you a

1145
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,449
demo on this topic, so let's

1146
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:31,780
do that. Uh, once

1147
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,179
I'm in the billing cost management, I'll scroll

1148
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:36,418
down over here and there's a savings

1149
00:43:36,418 --> 00:43:38,579
plan area and we have all

1150
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:41,019
these, uh, pages, overview, inventory

1151
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:41,760
recommendations.

1152
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:44,219
Um, they supported all the savings

1153
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:46,378
plans we had until now and now they support also

1154
00:43:46,378 --> 00:43:48,688
database savings plans. So if you use you used

1155
00:43:48,688 --> 00:43:49,619
anything like this before,

1156
00:43:49,938 --> 00:43:51,438
you can just, uh, um,

1157
00:43:51,938 --> 00:43:54,099
continue building upon your knowledge and use the same

1158
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:56,340
tools. I'll start with clicking on

1159
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,320
recommendations.

1160
00:43:59,659 --> 00:44:01,938
Here I see all the 4 types of savings

1161
00:44:01,938 --> 00:44:03,119
plans we have compute,

1162
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:04,340
database,

1163
00:44:04,668 --> 00:44:06,478
EC2, and Sage maker.

1164
00:44:06,969 --> 00:44:08,530
I'm gonna click on database

1165
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:11,250
and I'm gonna see that it's already selected for me

1166
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,728
one year and upfront,

1167
00:44:13,168 --> 00:44:15,208
um, so that's the offering as

1168
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:16,148
you can see here,

1169
00:44:16,449 --> 00:44:18,688
and I have a selection on based on the past.

1170
00:44:19,168 --> 00:44:21,539
So here I need to select the lookback

1171
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:23,610
period that most likely are going

1172
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,789
to be reflecting my future

1173
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:28,369
because we're gonna find that max savings

1174
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:30,889
waterline based on the historical

1175
00:44:30,889 --> 00:44:31,769
usage patterns.

1176
00:44:32,688 --> 00:44:34,949
Let's take a look at what I have for the last

1177
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,030
30 days.

1178
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:38,590
So I'm gonna click here on view details

1179
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,329
and I'm gonna see a visual chart that

1180
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:43,409
will, we'll go over

1181
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:45,789
and it uh to explain how we found this

1182
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,300
max savings number.

1183
00:44:47,809 --> 00:44:50,070
So in this case, I see that my recommendation

1184
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,110
is $2 per hour

1185
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,329
and it will save me around $300.

1186
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:55,469
It's very low.

1187
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,610
Um, on in red, it's the on-demand

1188
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,610
usage. So you can see that we were

1189
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,840
testing this feature before we invent

1190
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:05,329
and we spin up a lot of database services

1191
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:07,369
up and down to see uh that

1192
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:09,449
we, uh, everything is working correctly, so you

1193
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:10,409
can see that usage.

1194
00:45:10,728 --> 00:45:12,728
But since I don't have a lot of

1195
00:45:12,728 --> 00:45:14,119
things in the last 30 days,

1196
00:45:14,469 --> 00:45:16,809
the recommendation is really low because it's targeting

1197
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:17,889
the consistent usage.

1198
00:45:19,909 --> 00:45:22,019
So in this case I want to modify it and

1199
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,019
that's why uh we have Purchase analyzer.

1200
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:26,639
If I click here, I'm going to Purchase analyzer.

1201
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,688
You can also start from Purchase Analyzer

1202
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:31,000
if you scroll down here

1203
00:45:31,418 --> 00:45:33,570
and click straight to Purchase Analyzer.

1204
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:36,369
Here you see the same kind of selection.

1205
00:45:36,418 --> 00:45:38,090
I have the 4 types of savings plan.

1206
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:40,398
I'm gonna click on database

1207
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:42,820
and I I need to select all

1208
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,039
these things here. So

1209
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,079
The

1210
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:46,639
analysis level

1211
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:49,019
payer will take all the usage

1212
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:50,800
across all the linked accounts

1213
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:53,099
and we will build a recommendation on top

1214
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:55,219
of that. If you want to focus on one of

1215
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,159
the linked accounts, you can also click here

1216
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,519
and you will have a linked account selection.

1217
00:46:01,188 --> 00:46:03,389
Once you select that, one year, no upfront,

1218
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,648
no selection over here.

1219
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:07,510
And here I'm gonna focus on an area

1220
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:08,909
where I had a lot of usage.

1221
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:11,228
It's actually started on the 28th,

1222
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:12,168
where we had

1223
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:14,708
uh more consistent usage, which is also

1224
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:15,260
my birthday.

1225
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,530
So I really like to select this date

1226
00:46:18,228 --> 00:46:20,449
and up until the 4th.

1227
00:46:21,918 --> 00:46:24,000
Here you have the flexibility so to

1228
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,039
select any lookback period in

1229
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:28,340
the last 60 days, so it's

1230
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,070
more flexible than the recommendation.

1231
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:32,559
This is actually a simple way to think about it.

1232
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,840
This is a super set of anything

1233
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,918
we generate for you in the recommendation.

1234
00:46:36,989 --> 00:46:38,840
So, recommendation is a good

1235
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,820
starting point for you to see like what is available,

1236
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:44,199
but then you can go to the analyzer and really modify

1237
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:45,000
many things and

1238
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,398
have a lot of simulations. So in this case I'm

1239
00:46:47,398 --> 00:46:49,438
gonna select 28 until the 4th.

1240
00:46:50,063 --> 00:46:52,103
Um, um, the next selection here is

1241
00:46:52,103 --> 00:46:53,063
the recommendation

1242
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:55,503
where it finds the max savings

1243
00:46:55,503 --> 00:46:57,704
water line or I can also do custom.

1244
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,125
Custom, I can enter any number, so

1245
00:47:00,304 --> 00:47:02,304
maybe the water line mark is $10

1246
00:47:02,385 --> 00:47:04,804
I can uh enter $5.

1247
00:47:05,184 --> 00:47:07,155
So let's start with uh

1248
00:47:07,465 --> 00:47:08,625
the recommended amount.

1249
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:11,619
Now, since I clicked on this, what it does

1250
00:47:11,619 --> 00:47:13,739
in the background, it takes every

1251
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:15,458
hour in my lookback period,

1252
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:18,239
it collects all the services that are eligible

1253
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:20,978
for database savings plan coverage and

1254
00:47:20,978 --> 00:47:22,159
it starts to look for, OK,

1255
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:25,659
what which dollar amount will give the maximum savings

1256
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:26,918
for this type of usage.

1257
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:28,320
In this case,

1258
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,969
You can see that we went from

1259
00:47:30,969 --> 00:47:33,239
$2 to $28 per hour

1260
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,590
because now I selected a short period of

1261
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,349
time with a lot of consistent usage,

1262
00:47:37,728 --> 00:47:39,829
uh, and that's my estimation right now of what

1263
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:41,208
I'm going to use in the future.

1264
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:43,708
This will give me 14% of

1265
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:45,750
savings and I can also take

1266
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,489
a look at my coverage and utilization.

1267
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,050
So coverage, right now,

1268
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,688
I don't have a savings fund purchase,

1269
00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:56,090
so I'm actually starting from very low, from zero.

1270
00:47:56,489 --> 00:47:57,789
And then I'm going to

1271
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,708
reach 100% coverage for

1272
00:48:00,809 --> 00:48:01,570
this purchase.

1273
00:48:02,168 --> 00:48:04,360
Um, you can actually go over

1274
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,329
and see hour by hour.

1275
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,809
There is a I I I

1276
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,329
I can see that there's a small

1277
00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:11,590
amount of coverage because we did

1278
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:13,929
purchase a tiny savings fund just to test that

1279
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:15,559
it works. So you can see that here.

1280
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:18,168
Uh, so you can see hour by hour what's the

1281
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:20,648
coverage and same for utilization.

1282
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,139
So here I see there is some

1283
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:24,728
peaks and troughs in my environment

1284
00:48:25,148 --> 00:48:27,148
and at some point my savings plan is not gonna be

1285
00:48:27,148 --> 00:48:27,829
utilized,

1286
00:48:28,148 --> 00:48:30,750
uh, which is OK. Still have 76%

1287
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:31,329
utilization.

1288
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:34,090
So I can narrow it down or,

1289
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,469
uh, or I can be I can just take

1290
00:48:36,469 --> 00:48:38,780
this into account. OK, this is my weekend drops.

1291
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:41,219
I wanna see what I'm going to optimize with my

1292
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:43,349
weekend drops since it's a yearly commitment.

1293
00:48:44,909 --> 00:48:46,898
In this case, I can go here,

1294
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,500
click on custom,

1295
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:49,648
and

1296
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,269
Let's, let's do $15 and

1297
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:55,269
see what, maybe I'm not ready for the max

1298
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:56,148
savings commitment.

1299
00:48:56,429 --> 00:48:57,889
So I'm gonna click on $15

1300
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:00,010
run analysis,

1301
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,550
and now it's going to do the same thing. It's

1302
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:04,628
aggregating all the hourly usage and

1303
00:49:04,628 --> 00:49:07,000
it's starting to apply the $15 per hour

1304
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,889
each hour

1305
00:49:08,228 --> 00:49:10,389
and then then we'll see the results for that.

1306
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:14,000
OK, I decreased it by 50%.

1307
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,570
So now I see that

1308
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:17,389
I have more

1309
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,369
on-demand uncovered, so the red part

1310
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:22,648
is on-demand and I have some coverage

1311
00:49:22,648 --> 00:49:24,070
which is the blue area.

1312
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:26,769
If I click on coverage,

1313
00:49:27,228 --> 00:49:29,469
I'll see that now I'm not at 100%

1314
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:31,469
coverage anymore. I actually reduced

1315
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:32,168
it to

1316
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,628
an average of 65%

1317
00:49:34,628 --> 00:49:35,250
coverage

1318
00:49:35,789 --> 00:49:37,789
and maybe that's a good start for me. I, I just

1319
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:39,789
wanna purchase one and then I'm gonna go with

1320
00:49:39,789 --> 00:49:41,989
my coverage over time as

1321
00:49:41,989 --> 00:49:44,148
I see my usage grow and I'm getting more

1322
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,929
comfortable with savings plan purchases.

1323
00:49:46,699 --> 00:49:47,719
Lastly, the utilization

1324
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:50,978
is going to be 7 79%. Again,

1325
00:49:51,168 --> 00:49:53,519
because we did testing, we have a lot of ups and downs.

1326
00:49:53,938 --> 00:49:56,340
Usually when uh for customer

1327
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:56,969
environments,

1328
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,340
you will see more steady usage for

1329
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,329
database services.

1330
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:04,079
So that's how you're going after you

1331
00:50:04,219 --> 00:50:06,659
run a few simulations with all these options, you

1332
00:50:06,659 --> 00:50:08,679
can add it to the cart and

1333
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:10,378
continue to purchase the savings plan.

1334
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,360
After you purchase the savings plan, you can

1335
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,898
also go over here.

1336
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:17,438
You have utilization report and coverage

1337
00:50:17,438 --> 00:50:19,849
report. In utilization report,

1338
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,478
I want to show you exactly how to find the database

1339
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:23,280
utilization.

1340
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:25,659
So once you go over here, you will click

1341
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:28,000
on savings plan type and

1342
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,860
you will select database.

1343
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:31,639
Apply.

1344
00:50:32,668 --> 00:50:34,708
In this case, we have a very tiny purchase and

1345
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:36,208
it's 100% utilized

1346
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:38,909
and I have more details down below

1347
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:41,250
on how exactly each of

1348
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,168
the database savings plan is utilized.

1349
00:50:43,628 --> 00:50:45,728
So that after you purchase, you can track

1350
00:50:45,728 --> 00:50:46,889
your utilization.

1351
00:50:47,188 --> 00:50:49,219
Um, when we look at the customer

1352
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:51,510
environments, many times it's 100% or 99%

1353
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:53,728
if you have a little bit of uh um

1354
00:50:54,148 --> 00:50:55,510
going down over the weekend.

1355
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,539
And you can also click on coverage report.

1356
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:03,280
Over here, when you click on service,

1357
00:51:03,398 --> 00:51:05,530
you need to uh select all the database

1358
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:06,260
services

1359
00:51:06,878 --> 00:51:07,898
and then you can

1360
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,360
see exactly what coverage you have.

1361
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:13,000
In this case, because we have a very tiny

1362
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,099
amount of savings when purchased,

1363
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,559
uh we have uh.

1364
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,168
Going to look at the last 7 days.

1365
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:22,579
So

1366
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,360
It's, it's not a lot of coverage, but the cool

1367
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,739
thing here that I can see

1368
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:28,239
the coverage per,

1369
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:29,989
uh, different services,

1370
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,360
so it gives you a lot of insights of

1371
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,679
where the savings plan is going to

1372
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:36,760
cover and which services is going to cover

1373
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,840
for you. So you track it over time and

1374
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,378
then you go back and you start purchasing

1375
00:51:41,478 --> 00:51:42,398
the savings plan again.

1376
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,179
So we just wanna, um,

1377
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,708
We just wanna thank you all for coming today

1378
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,869
and one last thing we wanted to talk about

1379
00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:06,030
before we end the session is just to

1380
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,110
thank you all for the feedback you give us as we

1381
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:10,469
build new fin ops tools and cost optimization

1382
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:11,128
features.

1383
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,289
We use that feedback

1384
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:15,750
that you send your TAMMs and log as

1385
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,869
product feature requests in our roadmap

1386
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:19,949
planning and as we plan out the next

1387
00:52:19,949 --> 00:52:21,789
set of launches and features we do.

1388
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,639
That feedback is really crucial for us to make

1389
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:26,708
sure we can help you optimize your AWS spend

1390
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:28,099
as effectively as possible

1391
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:30,550
and honestly it's a really fun job because

1392
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,639
we get to come to reinvent and

1393
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,719
other conferences like FinOps X

1394
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:36,719
and places and bring a lot of new free

1395
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:37,699
savings tools.

1396
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:40,039
Um, I, I think we have maybe one some

1397
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:42,159
of the best jobs in the world that we get to build tools

1398
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,280
to help you save money, so it's a lot of fun.

1399
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:46,864
But it really depends on quality feedback

1400
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:49,105
from all of you as you look at your cost

1401
00:52:49,105 --> 00:52:51,625
and as you implement your own cost optimization

1402
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,746
programs to let us know how we can serve you better.

1403
00:52:53,864 --> 00:52:56,034
So please provide feedback.

1404
00:52:56,105 --> 00:52:58,226
We put an email alias up here on the

1405
00:52:58,226 --> 00:53:00,385
screen for you if you would like to give us feedback

1406
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,824
on any of our products, tools,

1407
00:53:02,835 --> 00:53:04,985
or experiences you have, feel free to just

1408
00:53:04,985 --> 00:53:06,045
reach out and let us know.

1409
00:53:06,331 --> 00:53:08,322
We love talking to customers. It's

1410
00:53:08,612 --> 00:53:10,731
the highlight of our day as as we go

1411
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:12,471
through product management activities

1412
00:53:12,911 --> 00:53:13,431
and

1413
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,771
thank you also on behalf of all of

1414
00:53:15,771 --> 00:53:17,931
the developers and engineers back home

1415
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:20,331
that work tirelessly on all of these features.

1416
00:53:20,771 --> 00:53:23,010
The road and lead up to reinvent is

1417
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:25,652
very difficult sometimes as we have to scramble

1418
00:53:25,652 --> 00:53:27,731
to get savings plans working and

1419
00:53:27,731 --> 00:53:29,929
everything and. There's a lot of people behind the

1420
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:31,969
scenes that come together to pull

1421
00:53:31,969 --> 00:53:33,168
this together,

1422
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:35,789
especially across so many different service teams. So

1423
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:38,329
on behalf of all of those engineers, thank you

1424
00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:39,010
so much.

1425
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:41,449
Um, your usage of these tools validates

1426
00:53:41,449 --> 00:53:43,489
and is rewarding for us as we

1427
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:45,530
see savings roll in and usage for

1428
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:46,909
these products and tools, so.

1429
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:49,655
Thank you so much and again we'll be available

1430
00:53:49,655 --> 00:53:51,735
afterwards for questions uh

1431
00:53:51,735 --> 00:53:53,813
if you'd like to stay after and learn

1432
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:56,215
more about any of these services or Bonnie's

1433
00:53:56,215 --> 00:53:57,114
story about

1434
00:53:57,454 --> 00:53:59,523
how they implemented and uh

1435
00:53:59,853 --> 00:54:02,735
really move the needle on saving 27%

1436
00:54:02,735 --> 00:54:04,753
off of their cloud bill, really exciting story.

1437
00:54:05,014 --> 00:54:05,914
So thank you all.
