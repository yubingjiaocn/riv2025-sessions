1
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,959
Good morning everyone. Thanks for making time on a Thursday,

2
00:00:08,118 --> 00:00:10,159
especially during lunchtime after a long week at

3
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:10,720
Reinvent.

4
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:13,079
We're, we're really glad you're here. Uh, just a

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,118
quick show of hands, uh, also proof of life.

6
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:16,899
Has anyone heard about Gen AI this week

7
00:00:17,158 --> 00:00:17,899
here at Reinvent?

8
00:00:18,548 --> 00:00:20,559
Yeah, so you're definitely not alone. There's been over

9
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,638
$200 billion invested in Gen

10
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:23,589
AI startups.

11
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,978
But the sad truth is that a lot of those

12
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,199
investments aren't actually making all their way

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:28,920
into production.

14
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:31,760
So, I'm Eric Anderson, I'm a principal

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,840
solutions architect here at AWS and I

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,109
help some of our most strategic customers with their AI

17
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:38,689
strategy, and I'm joined here by my colleagues.

18
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,469
Hey everyone, I'm Nicola.

19
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:42,868
I'm a start-up solution architect.

20
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:45,060
I work with healthcare and life science startups

21
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,209
out of Australia and New Zealand.

22
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:49,380
And I'm Jeffrey Hammond. Uh, I am an ISV

23
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,389
product strategist. I work with our

24
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:53,590
software company customers to help identify

25
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,829
how AWS can help you be more profitable

26
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,109
and drive profitable growth.

27
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,069
So over the next 60 minutes, the three of us will go

28
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:02,189
through 6 proven design strategies that will

29
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:04,349
help make sure that you're not the right, on the wrong

30
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,129
side of that

31
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:06,168
statistic.

32
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,909
But first, in order to help us along, we've got a fictional

33
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,250
software company that's in the healthcare space

34
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:13,189
that we'll be referring to throughout the presentation.

35
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:16,709
So picture this, a successful B2B customer

36
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,629
that was designed to handle everything for

37
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:19,838
healthcare companies,

38
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,209
from scheduling

39
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:23,549
to doctor's notes, all the

40
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,638
things like that, and their CEO woke up

41
00:01:25,638 --> 00:01:27,010
one morning and he said,

42
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:29,459
hey, our competitors have AI in our products,

43
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:30,790
we should do that too.

44
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:33,049
So we went to his technical team and said,

45
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:35,790
I'll give you 3 months to build something with AI.

46
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:38,448
So what did our well-meaning but ill

47
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:39,769
ill-advised team do?

48
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:42,349
They build a chatbot, of course, because, you know,

49
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,469
who doesn't need something to go out and answer questions.

50
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,418
The only problem was the chatbot

51
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:49,540
started getting creative with appointment scheduling,

52
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:51,629
and so it created appointments that didn't even

53
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:53,709
exist. And I don't know about you, I'd

54
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:56,290
be a little upset if I appeared at a doctor's appointment

55
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,579
on a Saturday and the office was closed,

56
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:01,308
so it wasn't really the ideal

57
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:03,308
situation, but it actually gets better or

58
00:02:03,308 --> 00:02:04,760
worse depending on your perspective.

59
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:07,150
So they kind of forgot to monitor any of the

60
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,229
costs, and it actually was costing them

61
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,240
$50 to provide this capability,

62
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:13,588
and they weren't charging their customers at all in

63
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:14,449
order to do so.

64
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:17,550
Fortunately, this is just a hypothetical

65
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,618
situation and no one actually showed up to

66
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:21,219
the doctor's office on a Saturday,

67
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:23,778
but some of the lessons that this company can learn,

68
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:26,099
I think you can take back to yours as well as you

69
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,179
go back to your companies after reinvent.

70
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,250
But whether you're a data scientist, a developer,

71
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,338
you focus on product strategy, or the

72
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:35,419
technical details, we really want you

73
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:37,460
all to come out of here with something that you can take back,

74
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:39,580
and it really does take all those roles

75
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,288
in order to make sure that you're successful.

76
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,610
You need the right use cases, the right technical

77
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,699
details, the right pricing strategy, which we'll get

78
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,819
into in a lot more detail.

79
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,219
And with that, I'll hand it over to Jeffrey to go into

80
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,118
a bit more detail.

81
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,949
Yeah, so, as, as you mentioned, uh,

82
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:54,969
Eric, uh, the spend

83
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:57,169
is, is, is pretty significant, uh, in this

84
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:59,449
space. $192

85
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:01,788
billion has been poured into AI startups by investors,

86
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:04,830
uh, so far in, uh, in, in 2025,

87
00:03:05,278 --> 00:03:07,649
and, uh, we anticipate that

88
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:08,990
by 2029,

89
00:03:09,278 --> 00:03:11,449
uh, the, uh, uh, software spend is gonna

90
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:13,939
grow to over $114

91
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:14,588
billion.

92
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,830
We did a survey earlier this year with

93
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,830
Forrester Research and we went out and asked over

94
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,149
640 software

95
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:25,308
companies about their spend plans with

96
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:26,528
respect to generative AI,

97
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:28,778
and what we found was that

98
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:29,808
over

99
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,088
60%

100
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:33,538
have significantly increased their

101
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:35,669
R&D budget. So the money is

102
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,868
there, it's being spent. I think we all know that.

103
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,580
But here's where it starts to worry

104
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,819
us a little bit. In that same survey, one

105
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,058
of the things that uh that Forrester asked

106
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:45,758
was, well,

107
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:48,179
what are your priorities? Why are you spending this

108
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:50,250
money? What do you, what do you hope to accomplish?

109
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,740
Top answers were things like, well, we want

110
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,860
to increase our brand awareness. CEO wants

111
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,929
to be thought of as an AI native company,

112
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:59,338
uh, growing revenue, which is good on its on

113
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:01,491
it's. Its face reducing

114
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,112
costs

115
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:05,032
at the bottom of the list, and there are about 1010

116
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:07,173
or 11 answers were things like

117
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:09,173
we want to improve our customer support or

118
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:11,173
we want to enhance our user experience.

119
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:13,393
That's a little bit of an alarm bell for me

120
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:15,733
because if you think of what we should be

121
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,762
doing with these technologies, if we're not

122
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:20,012
improving the way that our customers use our

123
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:22,324
product. The

124
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:24,565
way that that we're reducing their

125
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:25,865
toil, then

126
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:28,324
in some ways I think we're we're we're putting

127
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:30,406
the cart before the horse. And so when we

128
00:04:30,406 --> 00:04:32,406
think about how to be successful when you're going

129
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,495
from prompt to product,

130
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:36,045
putting that customer experience front and

131
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:38,225
center, working backward from the customer

132
00:04:38,324 --> 00:04:40,605
is actually the thing that should be the highest priority

133
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:42,545
as you start to think about your opportunities.

134
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:45,410
I think we see the results in some of the

135
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,730
latest surveys and

136
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,629
information that have come out.

137
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,269
According to 451

138
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:54,548
Research, they did a survey of about 1000

139
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:56,639
IT in line of business professionals, and

140
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,769
one of the things that they found was 42% of those

141
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:00,949
companies had abandoned the majority

142
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:03,129
of their AI initiatives before they reached

143
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:03,689
production.

144
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,048
At the same time, 46% of

145
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:08,369
those projects have been scrapped between

146
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:09,709
the proof of concept phase

147
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,269
and, uh, scaling broad adoption

148
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:14,709
now. If I were to take

149
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,869
that stat and be the glass half

150
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:18,949
full person, that's actually a good thing

151
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:20,528
because you don't want to go all the way

152
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:22,949
to scaling and roll out in full

153
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:25,428
production to discover that you can't drive profitable

154
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:27,519
growth. So it's good that we're weeding out

155
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,869
things before we go the whole way

156
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:32,350
through the effort. To me, the glass half empty

157
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,209
here though is that we're not,

158
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:38,153
we're putting things into. POC, which

159
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:38,684
should never

160
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:41,423
get out of POC, and we should be finding more

161
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:43,725
effective ways to separate the

162
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,863
high value business cases use cases

163
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:46,845
that we're going to work on

164
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:49,303
from the marginal value use

165
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:51,384
cases so that we can put all

166
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,463
of our focus and all of our spend behind the things

167
00:05:53,463 --> 00:05:55,803
that have the highest degree of success

168
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:58,463
and the highest ability to drive profitable

169
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:00,528
growth. So how

170
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,809
do we do that? How does generative AI

171
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,028
create business value?

172
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,028
Nicola, I'm going to turn that over to you.

173
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:09,428
Thanks Jeffrey, so

174
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:12,329
what are some of those really core strengths

175
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,528
of generative AI that you can really

176
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:16,629
use to generate business value?

177
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,410
Generating content, of course it's in the name,

178
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:22,889
probably the most obvious,

179
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:25,449
you know, think of images for retail

180
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:27,928
websites, hyper personalized marketing,

181
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,689
I know myself, I've used some to craft

182
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,928
some of those trickier customer responses,

183
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:35,639
ah so you're probably already using it yourselves

184
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,100
either in a personal or professional setting

185
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,819
in this way. Code

186
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,209
generation and execution is another really

187
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:45,220
core strength.

188
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,059
There are many applications for, for

189
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:49,298
actually for this,

190
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,480
so I think to our first example of

191
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:54,088
creating appointments and booking these to

192
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:56,759
generating sequel for business intelligence

193
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,838
use cases,

194
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,399
um, code generation and

195
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,959
execution with secure guard rails

196
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,959
is a really, really important

197
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,829
strength. Lighting

198
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:10,209
up dark data within your

199
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:12,420
organization similarly is something we're seeing

200
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,829
lots of customers doing.

201
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,269
Whether you've got information in

202
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,028
emails, in sales calls,

203
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,750
across some legacy systems within your

204
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,329
organization, being able to extract

205
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:25,350
information from those data sources

206
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,290
that was previously inaccessible

207
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:28,750
or invisible.

208
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:33,298
Workflow workflow augmentation

209
00:07:33,298 --> 00:07:35,298
to actually reduce some

210
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:37,298
of that uh heavy lift is

211
00:07:37,298 --> 00:07:39,519
another critical area where we're seeing

212
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,079
Gen AI really shine.

213
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,358
You can create,

214
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:45,338
you know, a collaborative loop where AI

215
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:47,858
executes on a tasks and humans

216
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:50,100
provide oversight, validation,

217
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,178
and actually input suggestions back

218
00:07:52,178 --> 00:07:54,178
into your task in order to

219
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:55,540
improve that over time.

220
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,160
And finally, Gen AI can be used

221
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,178
to reduce the cost to serve

222
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:03,350
through strategic automation

223
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,670
where you have really well defined and understood

224
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,660
workflows.

225
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,480
So based on our work with customers

226
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,629
and we're these core strengths

227
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,759
that we're seeing, we've actually devised

228
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,879
6 product design strategies that we're

229
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,298
gonna detail today,

230
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,759
um, to you.

231
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:21,298
So with that I'll pass back to Eric.

232
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:22,358
Thanks Nicola.

233
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,569
So as Nicola mentioned, we're going to transition

234
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:29,750
into these 6 strategies in much more detail,

235
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,210
and I'd like to point out that profitable growth

236
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,210
was so important to what we're talking about today

237
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,769
that it actually made the session title.

238
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,519
This isn't just about building cool AI

239
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,048
features, it's about building things that will actually

240
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:42,609
help you make money as customers.

241
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,019
And before we dive into any technology

242
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:47,178
decisions, before we talk about tokens or vector

243
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:48,460
database optimizations,

244
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,940
we need to think about this fundamental question.

245
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,700
Will and how will

246
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:54,979
this AI capability actually

247
00:08:54,979 --> 00:08:56,979
drive profitable growth for you

248
00:08:56,979 --> 00:08:57,639
as an organization?

249
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:00,460
Because here's the thing, and we saw this with our fictional

250
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,109
healthcare company,

251
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:04,210
they learned it the hard way. They built something, but it

252
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,649
wasn't the right thing. You might have an impressive

253
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:08,739
AI feature, you might have a not impressive AI

254
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:10,500
feature if you're having people show up on a weekend.

255
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:13,158
But if users don't care about what you're building,

256
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:15,369
you're probably not building a sustainable business

257
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:17,690
model. I know that sounds obvious, but

258
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,690
many teams just kind of forget about that and get caught

259
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,798
up in all the hype of building something cool,

260
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,250
but ultimately you need to make sure that you're building

261
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,250
something that allows you to stay in business over

262
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:26,908
the long haul.

263
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,668
And a lot of times this is what we call the

264
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:31,769
technology driven approach that we'll talk about more on the next

265
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,820
slide. But the solution really

266
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,658
starts right here.

267
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:37,379
How can you build something that starts from customer

268
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,599
value, and then build that back into

269
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,080
every AI product decision?

270
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:44,899
So what does a technology driven approach look like?

271
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,899
It typically starts with this.

272
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,479
People follow a relatively typical

273
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,960
software design process, typically with a POC.

274
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:54,158
Maybe they come up with the use case first, maybe they bring it

275
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,109
up after the fact,

276
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,479
then they go through the subsequent design phases

277
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,869
to design, build, test, and deploy the

278
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,889
application. And at the very end you see over there

279
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:02,759
on the right side,

280
00:10:03,048 --> 00:10:04,989
that's when they start thinking about price.

281
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,408
And what ends up happening, you start

282
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:09,529
hearing these from your customers. The ROI

283
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:11,570
isn't there, or it was a great demo,

284
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,639
but I'm just not willing to pay for it.

285
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:14,629
Or maybe

286
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,158
I like it, but I just can't justify the cost.

287
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,570
So what do teams do?

288
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,168
Well, maybe they release it as a premium feature,

289
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,529
hoping that somehow giving it away will ultimately

290
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:25,229
create the sustainable business model.

291
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,570
And that's exactly what happened to our healthcare

292
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,668
company. They built something, they released it.

293
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,928
But ultimately

294
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:33,710
their CEO was happy because they had AI in their product,

295
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:35,889
but it was the wrong thing for their customers.

296
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:38,509
So this backwards approach where we're building

297
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,629
first and figuring out how to price and how

298
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:42,989
to design value at the very end of the

299
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:44,349
process is kind of backwards.

300
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,649
So let's talk about a little bit of a better way.

301
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:50,649
While many of the core components of a value-driven

302
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,830
approach are the same, this is fundamentally

303
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,928
different. Instead of building and

304
00:10:54,928 --> 00:10:56,969
then figuring out the pricing later, we're going

305
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:58,969
to start here by identifying high value

306
00:10:58,969 --> 00:10:59,840
use cases.

307
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,808
Even as a techie myself, I know that oftentimes

308
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:04,808
it's, it's really important to focus not

309
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:05,960
just on the technology,

310
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:08,489
but really what is going to give my customer

311
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:11,029
value. This is going to deliver a meaningful

312
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:13,369
outcome for my customer and

313
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:15,428
make sure that there's something they're actually going to pay for.

314
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,928
This working backwards from customer requirements

315
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,340
is something that's near and dear to our hearts here at Amazon.

316
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:22,889
And what you'll notice is that early on in

317
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,960
the process here, we're going to develop a pricing

318
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,979
hypothesis.

319
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,450
And you can ask yourself at this point, are

320
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,489
customers willing to pay for this feature? And

321
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,529
that's not to say that you need to charge

322
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:34,609
for every single AI feature, and we'll talk more about

323
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:35,769
that in the next slide.

324
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:38,529
But you do really want to start with this early in the

325
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:40,899
process. We're shifting left this value proposition.

326
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,359
And then you can go ahead and still design, build,

327
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,710
and test and deploy your application.

328
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:47,580
But you're going to be making sure at this

329
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,320
point that you're doing this on the right thing.

330
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:51,940
I'd also like to call out the feedback loop at the

331
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,379
end, and it's important that this is not only a

332
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,298
technology feedback loop,

333
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,859
but it's also related to the value that we're

334
00:11:57,859 --> 00:11:59,168
delivering for our customers.

335
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,658
We're making sure that as we're going through, we're

336
00:12:01,658 --> 00:12:03,658
getting information from these customers

337
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:05,739
to see that we're we're getting the value that they

338
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:07,779
expect, and then we can adjust along

339
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:09,779
the way. If our healthcare

340
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,889
company had followed the same example, maybe

341
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:13,529
they would have picked something else to develop.

342
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:16,038
Maybe they'd have done something like automated insurance

343
00:12:16,038 --> 00:12:18,639
claim processing or clinical note summarization.

344
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,090
But having this value-driven mindset is

345
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,369
really critical throughout the entire

346
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:25,369
process, and it's going to affect more than

347
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,450
just the technology decision, it's also going

348
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,918
to affect your product and go to market strategies,

349
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,869
which is what I'll talk about here on the next slide.

350
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,428
So when it comes to your go to market strategy, you

351
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:37,629
have 4 main paths forward that we've identified

352
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,639
here. Embed is the

353
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,840
first one. So if you think about this, it's

354
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,000
a defensive play. You're adding existing

355
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,168
AI features for your current customers,

356
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,399
and typically you're doing so without additional

357
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:48,950
charges.

358
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,500
This is often about protecting market share

359
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:53,840
and staying competitive in the marketplace,

360
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,038
and realistically this is what we see a lot of our customers

361
00:12:56,038 --> 00:12:56,580
do today.

362
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,210
The one competitive differentiator you

363
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,529
have here though is your data.

364
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:02,979
And if you imagine, if you're an ISV that's

365
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:03,489
had

366
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,928
been operating over several years, you have all

367
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:07,928
this additional customer data that you can now

368
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:09,969
go and mine to make your

369
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:11,369
product even more competitive.

370
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,849
Think about a CRM provider that previously had

371
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:15,918
been working with financial analysts,

372
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:18,210
but now you can reach out to business analysts and

373
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,168
maybe interact with natural language processing.

374
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:22,719
Or maybe you're an HCM provider

375
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,158
and rather than having people create job descriptions

376
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:25,908
from scratch,

377
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,639
you now can give them some Gen AI capabilities, not

378
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,719
charge for it, but help with automated creation

379
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:31,859
of those opportunities.

380
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,048
The challenge here though is that you're giving them away, and that's

381
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,418
where we get into our next strategy around extend.

382
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,889
So extend is where the new money starts.

383
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:42,408
Effectively, you're adding some additional premium

384
00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:44,619
features, but now you're doing so with an ability

385
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:45,259
to charge.

386
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:47,940
So if you think about maybe a collaboration

387
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,099
suite, rather than just sending messages,

388
00:13:50,178 --> 00:13:52,178
maybe now you have a new AI capability where

389
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:54,580
you can go and summarize details or get

390
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,658
updates when you come back from vacation

391
00:13:56,658 --> 00:13:58,619
and and be able to catch up a little bit more quickly.

392
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,750
But in this case, we're now

393
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,168
adding a new revenue stream and that's why we're calling

394
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:03,950
it extend.

395
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,570
But all these focus on

396
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,149
essentially

397
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,969
new features within kind of our

398
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:10,928
existing product.

399
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:13,090
When we start on the new product side.

400
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:17,178
Gonna Do that we're going to

401
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:18,450
refer to that as expand.

402
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:20,769
So this is a, a new market segment,

403
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:22,960
a new product for existing customers.

404
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:26,090
So if you think about my example of creating

405
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,649
new

406
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,570
job opportunities for a hiring manager,

407
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,918
that was really part of the core product. But what

408
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,928
if instead I could create a

409
00:14:33,928 --> 00:14:36,109
new set of capabilities or a new product

410
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,369
to go out and actually screen candidates. So

411
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:40,399
I use AI to go out and do

412
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,710
some of the initial processing.

413
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:44,320
I've got a new value proposition. I'm

414
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,599
able to now have a new charging model

415
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:49,000
for that without affecting the base model.

416
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,308
And because of that,

417
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:52,678
again, I'm able to unlock additional revenue

418
00:14:52,678 --> 00:14:54,759
for for myself as a company and then

419
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,359
give my customers additional value.

420
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:00,298
Then the last one we have is build. So this is

421
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:02,099
new products for new customers,

422
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
and, and this could be entering a totally

423
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,219
new space.

424
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,899
A lot of times this has the biggest risk

425
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:10,038
because you as an ISV might be creating

426
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:10,940
something brand new,

427
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:13,379
but it also can have the best reward

428
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,379
because now you're able to take some of the learnings that you

429
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:16,058
had in the past,

430
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,500
create a brand new offering, and then take that

431
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,798
to market with your customers.

432
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:22,739
But the interesting thing that stands out

433
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:24,950
to me as we look through all of these strategies is

434
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,389
that regardless of what you're choosing,

435
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,849
there's going to be that interaction between go to market

436
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:32,399
pricing and your product strategy.

437
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,950
And so because of that, we're also seeing

438
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,629
several several new pricing mechanisms

439
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:38,928
that have come out in the process.

440
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,629
So there are a lot more beyond just

441
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,629
these three strategies, and if you haven't seen it

442
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:45,788
out there, I'll give a shameless plug for our, our white

443
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:47,899
paper where we, where we're able to go into these in a lot more

444
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:48,450
detail.

445
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,908
Uh, but these are some of the 3 most common ones that we're

446
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,210
seeing out here in the industry.

447
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,989
Seat-based is likely what you're most familiar

448
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:57,070
with. It's what a lot of ISV customers use

449
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,070
today. And, and here we have a fixed cost per

450
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,139
user. There's some real positives to

451
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:03,500
that because we have

452
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,690
a consistent value that we're, I'm

453
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,090
sorry, a consistent price that we're charging our customers.

454
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:10,538
Our customers can plan for it, so there's

455
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:11,658
a lot of consistency,

456
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:14,298
but the problem that we have here is it doesn't

457
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:16,418
reflect the varying value that we're able to give

458
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:17,340
to our customers.

459
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,820
So if you imagine a power user is getting

460
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
a whole lot of value out of your AI

461
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,960
features and someone who is maybe

462
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,500
against AI or just doesn't know how to use it, they

463
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,399
might not be getting

464
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:29,340
any value or as much value.

465
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:31,710
And we're charging people the same amount. And

466
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,668
so not only does

467
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:35,408
that mean we're not getting the full value

468
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:35,989
from that,

469
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,408
it costs us a whole lot more to handle that

470
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:40,418
product uh power user than it

471
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:42,489
does someone that's a very light user. And so

472
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:44,849
there's a little bit of a difference from an economics perspective

473
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:46,969
as well. And that's where something like

474
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:48,969
usage or token-based pricing comes in.

475
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,859
This helps you as a customer align

476
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:52,479
your

477
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,918
consumption from your users to your actual

478
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:57,269
costs. And so from a unit economics perspective,

479
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,558
you're now much more in line with how

480
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:00,099
you're actually

481
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,869
accruing costs and giving value to users.

482
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,910
The downside there obviously is that there's a lot more variability,

483
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,989
and if your customers aren't used to buying this way,

484
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,459
that can lead to a little bit of

485
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,380
a transition as you make that change.

486
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,479
The last one I'd like to touch on is outcome or value

487
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:18,880
based pricing, and a lot of times we'll talk about these

488
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,239
differently, but for the sake of conversation today, I'll

489
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,019
include them together.

490
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:24,559
But here we're starting to see a lot more adoption

491
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,838
in the space, especially from a Gen AI

492
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,059
capabilities perspective.

493
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,259
Here you get paid based on the business value

494
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,709
that you're actually able to provide to your customers.

495
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:36,140
So imagine that I'm a

496
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:39,059
customer service, uh

497
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,140
uh software company and I'm able to.

498
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:43,630
Solve tasks for you. So a customer

499
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,160
puts in a support case. If I'm able to

500
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,209
solve it, you pay for it. It's typically a

501
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:50,209
fixed price for that action, so maybe

502
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:51,848
$1 per case that I'm solving.

503
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,209
If I solve it, you pay. If I don't solve

504
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:56,469
it, you're not going to be charged. And so there's

505
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:58,229
a really nice alignment to

506
00:17:58,489 --> 00:17:59,630
customer value

507
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,750
and the actual pricing model.

508
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,568
Uh, Val base is a little different in that the

509
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:07,009
change there is that it's typically more variable.

510
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,338
So rather than just saying $1 per

511
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:10,588
action.

512
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:13,420
I'm going to take a portion of savings

513
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,459
or portion of revenue.

514
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:17,239
The example I like to think about is

515
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,769
I live in Texas. We have property tax valuation

516
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:21,759
every year, and based on

517
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:22,759
how much my

518
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,259
property taxes go up and down, that changes the amount I

519
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:27,160
pay. And so there's a company that works with me

520
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,420
to try and make sure that that value isn't too

521
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,660
high. If they save me money, they take a portion

522
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,689
of it, but our interests are really well aligned,

523
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,219
and I think that's a really nice example of value-based

524
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:38,439
pricing. But we talked

525
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,479
about working backwards, uh, and so

526
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:42,559
I don't just want to talk about what we see from

527
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,959
customers, but what are customers themselves actually

528
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,068
saying. So there was a, a

529
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:49,250
new study from IDC that went out there and asked

530
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,400
customers, what do you actually prefer when you're buying

531
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,459
AI capabilities?

532
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:55,059
And the way this study worked, as you can see, they asked

533
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:57,078
for their top 3 preferences, and it

534
00:18:57,608 --> 00:18:59,380
resulted in a whole lot of interesting data.

535
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,539
We're not going to get into all those nuances,

536
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:04,239
but what I do want to show is some of the 3

537
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:06,568
more, or the 4 more prevalent ones.

538
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:08,789
So the top 2 pricing models were

539
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:11,199
were bundled premium tier subscriptions

540
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,959
and consumption-based pricing.

541
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,539
The next 2 favorite hybrid hybrid

542
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,858
subscription and usage models are flex credits.

543
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:20,348
But you see across that whole stack, there's

544
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:21,959
not really one that stands out.

545
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,969
And so despite

546
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:25,949
there being lots of different options,

547
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:28,348
depending on how you're providing those capabilities for

548
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:30,459
customers, depending on the value you're providing,

549
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:33,000
there's not going to be a one size fits all approach.

550
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,729
And so you're probably going to need to have some different monetization

551
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:38,140
techniques as you go along and customers

552
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,650
kind of make this transition with you.

553
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:42,130
But regardless of pricing,

554
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:44,769
you also need to keep in mind some of the cost

555
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:47,009
optimization capabilities, because obviously

556
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:49,049
if it costs you too much to provide this to

557
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:51,170
a customer, that's also not going to be sustainable and

558
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,489
profitable over the long term.

559
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,670
So what can we do from a cost optimization perspective?

560
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,969
Again, this is a small subset

561
00:19:57,969 --> 00:19:59,390
of the many things that you can do,

562
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,400
uh, but a few things that I did want to call out, the

563
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,449
biggest option you have likely with Gen AI is your

564
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:05,739
model selection and customization.

565
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:06,920
So,

566
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:09,338
it maybe goes without saying, but don't just default

567
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:11,410
to the latest and greatest model because it

568
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,500
is the latest and greatest, it may also be the most

569
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,019
expensive.

570
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,459
Instead, you should pick the optimal model

571
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:17,858
for your specific use case.

572
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,219
Do validation with high quality data,

573
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:22,608
and then customize it to your business

574
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:23,880
specific requirements.

575
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:26,459
Oftentimes we find that a fine-tuned smaller

576
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,088
model or a distilled model can

577
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:31,180
perform just as well at a fraction of the cost,

578
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:33,279
and that's probably gonna be your biggest cost lover.

579
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:36,049
Also keep in mind token usage

580
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:38,170
optimization, and as you scale, these

581
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,489
can create big savings.

582
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:41,848
So analyze your token patterns,

583
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,390
implement token caching,

584
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:45,949
and ultimately that can help you not only improve

585
00:20:45,949 --> 00:20:47,539
performance, but keep your costs in check.

586
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,539
I'll talk a little bit more about the appropriate pricing

587
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,410
plan when we get to the 3rd design strategy,

588
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,979
but I do want to mention vector database optimization

589
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:56,838
as the last piece that we'll talk about here.

590
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,299
As your data grows, this can be incredibly

591
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,660
critical to make sure that you're not overspending

592
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,618
from this perspective,

593
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:05,279
and you want to implement efficient chunking

594
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,799
strategies as you go along,

595
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:09,439
and especially as your vector database usage

596
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:11,509
improves. And remember, every dollar that

597
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:13,949
you save is either something that you can keep in your pocket

598
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:16,059
or pass back to your customers, so don't overlook

599
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:17,608
this as something to keep in mind.

600
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:19,828
But with that, I'll hand it over to Jeffrey.

601
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,519
Thanks, Eric.

602
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:25,479
So design strategy

603
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:26,838
zero critically important,

604
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:30,068
a business focused approach and one that that

605
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:32,180
understands how you're gonna drive profitable growth,

606
00:21:32,318 --> 00:21:33,439
uh, right from the start

607
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:36,068
as we get into design, then,

608
00:21:36,318 --> 00:21:38,598
uh, the, the, uh, the, the, the next strategy

609
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,680
that, uh, that, that, that we, uh, find that,

610
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:42,920
uh, successful companies use is

611
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,529
focusing on tasks over

612
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:47,680
conversations in a sense, not just going and building

613
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,719
that chatbot because it it seems like

614
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:50,838
the, uh, the right thing to do.

615
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:53,519
While conversational interfaces have

616
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,239
their place in certain scenarios,

617
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:57,759
task-oriented designs generally create

618
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:00,009
more valuable, trustworthy, and

619
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:02,150
successful generative AI features.

620
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,799
That's because they help customers, users

621
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,019
of your product, focus on specific goals,

622
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:09,799
and they also have clear inputs and outputs

623
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,959
which increases your chance of designing

624
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,199
a successful use case.

625
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,880
Um, they also define clear boundaries

626
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,000
for your interactions with AI, and

627
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,199
they, as part of that create natural

628
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:22,479
guardrails around the experience

629
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:23,719
that you're looking to create.

630
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:26,598
These guardrails help your product teams

631
00:22:26,598 --> 00:22:28,920
address inconsistent or potentially harmful

632
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,680
outputs in the process.

633
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:33,338
A task oriented approach can

634
00:22:33,338 --> 00:22:35,459
often turn out to be the most cost effective

635
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:38,088
because of the constraints

636
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:39,689
that are involved with the task-based design.

637
00:22:40,078 --> 00:22:42,479
It's also easier to measure success

638
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:44,519
and iterate on your features when

639
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,400
you take that task-based approach,

640
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,759
and it makes it easier to implement

641
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,539
outcome-based billing if you want to implicate

642
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:52,539
implement some of those

643
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:55,279
newer pricing models. If you have

644
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,578
a clear definition of what the success

645
00:22:57,578 --> 00:22:59,920
of the task is, then it's very natural

646
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,420
to be able to charge for it. For example,

647
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,160
processing a payment. The payment either goes through or the payment

648
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,519
doesn't go through, and you can charge on this

649
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,680
agreed success of that.

650
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,910
Also, a task-focused approach,

651
00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:14,009
it makes it easier to extend existing

652
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:15,509
customer experiences

653
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:18,368
because they are often task-based interfaces.

654
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:20,479
So if you're using that first strategy

655
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,568
where you have an existing product and you're looking

656
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,279
to build new features for current customers,

657
00:23:25,328 --> 00:23:27,368
extending the user interface with those

658
00:23:27,368 --> 00:23:29,509
tasks can often be

659
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:30,390
very effective.

660
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,469
So if you are adopting a

661
00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:35,549
task-based approach to the use case that you

662
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:37,920
want to implement, some things that you want to focus on,

663
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,750
facilitating the customer, the user's

664
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,009
agency and control,

665
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,750
you don't want to give them the blank screen. What should I

666
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,868
write? How should I talk to this

667
00:23:46,868 --> 00:23:49,068
thing? You want examples

668
00:23:49,068 --> 00:23:51,088
of things that the user can do,

669
00:23:51,469 --> 00:23:53,588
highlight the insight

670
00:23:53,588 --> 00:23:55,630
into the dark data that you're that you're

671
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,568
about to light up.

672
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:59,789
If you can personalize or contextualize

673
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:00,640
the task, uh,

674
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:03,368
if your use case can begin to predict

675
00:24:03,368 --> 00:24:06,088
what the customer might want to do, the intents

676
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:07,410
that they want to fulfill,

677
00:24:07,689 --> 00:24:09,670
like for example, if I'm booking a flight,

678
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:12,130
then can the system remember that I happen to be

679
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,380
a frequent flyer on American and

680
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,689
that I always fly out of Charlotte and

681
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,769
bring that context to the beginning

682
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:20,848
of the tax, the task processing

683
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:22,799
event. Um, finally,

684
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:25,338
uh, how are you gonna instrument the task

685
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,979
to make sure it's observable, to be able to

686
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:30,699
understand the level of successful completion,

687
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:31,910
uh, rates?

688
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,380
So just as an example of some of

689
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,699
these things, I worked with, uh, uh, an ISV

690
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:38,759
customer in the healthcare space,

691
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:40,979
uh, that makes information processing systems,

692
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:43,358
laboratory information management uh systems.

693
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,699
One of the things that they did was

694
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:47,779
to take an existing task that a customer

695
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,368
has reading lab reports.

696
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,459
Everybody knows, you know.

697
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:53,094
Figures come up. You look at it and you understand it

698
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:54,243
and you interpret the results.

699
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:57,074
They didn't want to change that fundamental task,

700
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,375
but what they did want to do is they wanted to

701
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,404
provide guidance by

702
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:04,134
an LLM to indicate the things that

703
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:06,255
the that the test reader should potentially

704
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,193
pay pay additional

705
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:09,894
attention to.

706
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:12,489
So by providing that additional

707
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:14,608
capability by being subtle

708
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:17,039
in the way that they presented the

709
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,170
information, they didn't overwhelm the existing

710
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,608
user agency agency, the existing

711
00:25:21,608 --> 00:25:23,650
process that the lab tech would go through, but

712
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,689
they did allow them to sharpen their focus on the

713
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:27,368
things that might matter the most to them.

714
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:28,269
The result,

715
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,660
they saved an average of 2 to 3 minutes per

716
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,368
test read,

717
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:33,439
over hundreds of test reads a day,

718
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:35,868
significant productivity improvement

719
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,199
because they focused on the

720
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:39,729
task to start.

721
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,029
So some more examples of this,

722
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:45,130
uh, great example from a company called

723
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,170
Dovetail. We've got a few Dovetail folks in the audience

724
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,868
today. You guys put your hands up, yeah,

725
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,309
excellent. Um, Dovetail is a customer

726
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:53,598
intelligence platform. It aggregates, uh,

727
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:55,910
analyzes and shares qualitative data,

728
00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:56,989
uh, from diverse

729
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,729
sources, uh, including customer interviews

730
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:01,750
and, uh, feedback, support tickets

731
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,068
and sales calls.

732
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,108
This example focuses on a specific

733
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:08,189
task that the Dovetail team,

734
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:10,489
uh, helps their customers with, which is theme

735
00:26:10,489 --> 00:26:12,630
categorization across a broad,

736
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:14,848
uh, variety of, uh,

737
00:26:14,858 --> 00:26:15,630
of, of, of data.

738
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,660
Now, uh, they do this via

739
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,969
a feature called channels

740
00:26:20,969 --> 00:26:23,660
which automatically identifies and clusters

741
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,660
uh the themes across massive amounts

742
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,979
of data. So a good example of what Nicola said, lighting

743
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:29,479
up uh dark data.

744
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:31,818
It allows their customers to make

745
00:26:31,818 --> 00:26:34,059
more informed decision making and allows

746
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,500
those companies to be more responsive to customer

747
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,578
needs and emerging trends, and this is the

748
00:26:38,578 --> 00:26:40,880
important part. It saves hours

749
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,098
of manual analysis. So you've got toil

750
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:45,219
reduction there, and the net

751
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:47,299
is that it reduces the cost to

752
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:49,818
serve insights up from unstructured

753
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,858
data. So by organizing

754
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:53,979
around the tasks to be done by your

755
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,049
users as opposed to what kind of chatbot are

756
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:58,259
we going to build, you build a much more effective

757
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:00,259
interface for your existing

758
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:02,509
products. OK,

759
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:05,358
design strategy number 2 then, which builds

760
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:07,358
on that idea of a task-based

761
00:27:07,358 --> 00:27:09,719
approach, focusing on narrowly

762
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:11,799
scoped tasks overbroad.

763
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,309
If you've spent any time uh

764
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:16,630
looking at the data that's come out recently, you've probably

765
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,029
run across the MIT NANDA report and

766
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:21,068
one of the things that they also picked up is one of

767
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:23,309
the reasons for so many failures

768
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,430
in the investments that organizations were

769
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,088
making was that when

770
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,750
organizations tried to implement

771
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,229
complex tasks that might span multiple

772
00:27:32,229 --> 00:27:34,368
organizations or complex workflows,

773
00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:36,709
uh, that uh usually those things were

774
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:38,689
harder to implement successfully,

775
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:40,269
so um.

776
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,880
In the case of the healthcare management

777
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,779
software company

778
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
that we talked about, if they had focused on

779
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,199
narrowly scoped tasks, they might have

780
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,500
had a higher rate of success. So examples like

781
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,759
verifying patient insurance eligibility

782
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:54,920
before scheduling an appointment, that's a narrowly

783
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,890
scoped task,

784
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:59,104
checking for drugs. Interactions when prescribing

785
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,354
new medications, that's a narrowly scoped

786
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:01,884
task,

787
00:28:02,144 --> 00:28:04,265
generating patient friendly summaries of lab

788
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,473
results like the limbs example I just talked about,

789
00:28:06,743 --> 00:28:08,785
that's a narrowly scoped task. It's going

790
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:11,064
to be much easier to successfully

791
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,164
implement those specific

792
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:14,384
use cases.

793
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:17,868
So the advantages of narrowly scoped tasks

794
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:20,029
include clear expectations of what

795
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:22,189
the AI should uh accomplish, which

796
00:28:22,189 --> 00:28:24,729
makes it easier to set accuracy goals.

797
00:28:25,189 --> 00:28:27,309
Uh, narrowly scoped tasks help

798
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:29,309
improve the response quality and the

799
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:30,348
reliability.

800
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,108
It also lowers the implementation risk

801
00:28:33,108 --> 00:28:35,309
because it allows it, uh, it makes it easier

802
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:37,469
for you to do targeted evaluation

803
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,809
of, uh, how the LLM is responding.

804
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:42,239
It allows you to do precise testing

805
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,519
and more effective prompt engineering

806
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:46,118
around the task itself

807
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:48,939
and so it also makes it easier to

808
00:28:48,939 --> 00:28:51,000
take each individually scoped feature

809
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,219
uh and evaluate it and refine it based

810
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:55,380
on your user feedback so it's not an all or

811
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,630
nothing when you go out to the customer and then

812
00:28:57,818 --> 00:28:59,858
uh go into that that iterative

813
00:28:59,858 --> 00:29:00,880
process of improvement

814
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,559
uh with your use case.

815
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,150
Let's look at a couple of really good examples.

816
00:29:05,608 --> 00:29:08,009
I like to talk about Canva a lot

817
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:08,750
because they've

818
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:11,209
implemented AI capabilities

819
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:13,250
broadly across their product, but if you're a

820
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,068
creative user,

821
00:29:14,328 --> 00:29:16,400
you might not even realize it because of the way

822
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,699
that they have integrated the task capability

823
00:29:18,699 --> 00:29:20,430
into the overall flow

824
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:23,338
of the product. As an example,

825
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:24,469
Magicrite

826
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,328
generates specific text content like

827
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:28,088
headlines or captions.

828
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,098
The image generation tool that they have creates

829
00:29:31,098 --> 00:29:33,199
virtual uh visual assets, uh,

830
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:34,900
that support particular design needs.

831
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,180
The chat assistants, uh, guides

832
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,259
users through specific creative

833
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:41,529
decisions. Each of those individual

834
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,900
features tackles one task,

835
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,618
and it does it really, really well.

836
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,019
Magic Rite doesn't try to be a good general

837
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,219
writing assistant. Its features are

838
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:52,338
specifically tuned for design-related

839
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:54,430
copy. So this

840
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,549
approach delivers two key benefits

841
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:57,479
for the Canva team.

842
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:59,838
First of all, the individual creatives

843
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:01,930
can easily understand what each feature does

844
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,229
and what outputs to expect, makes

845
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:05,410
it much more predictable.

846
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,509
Secondly,

847
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:08,828
uh, Canva can optimize

848
00:30:08,828 --> 00:30:10,689
each individual feature

849
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:13,108
based on the use case, and the end result

850
00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:15,229
is a higher quality experience for

851
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:17,588
their existing users, which incidentally

852
00:30:17,588 --> 00:30:19,088
creates a higher price

853
00:30:20,828 --> 00:30:21,969
performance opportunity

854
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:22,910
in the market.

855
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,039
Let me give you a second example. It's actually one that

856
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,500
we talked about earlier this week in one of the keynotes,

857
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:31,160
um. If you've

858
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,160
ever authored content that you want

859
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,719
to share with the world, you know that professional

860
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:38,019
book cover design can be a real barrier.

861
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:40,479
Kindle Direct Publishing sees this problem with

862
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:42,000
its customers.

863
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:44,539
It allows authors to self-publish

864
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:46,559
print and digital books that reach millions

865
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,439
of users on Amazon.

866
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,000
Now I wrote professionally for 16 years and I

867
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,318
can tell you that the creative process was

868
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,328
something that I practiced every day and I

869
00:30:55,328 --> 00:30:56,328
got pretty good at writing,

870
00:30:56,608 --> 00:30:58,868
but that didn't make me very good at uh

871
00:30:58,868 --> 00:31:00,098
at graphic design,

872
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:03,189
uh, and, and, and I'm still not, uh,

873
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:05,289
indie authors face this problem all the time.

874
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,420
So what did the KDP team do?

875
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,358
Uh, it. Turned to the AWSACE

876
00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:12,299
program, which is a program that we use to work

877
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,630
with customers around use cases,

878
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,818
specifically generative AI use cases,

879
00:31:17,118 --> 00:31:19,160
and they came together to solve this problem in just

880
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,029
4 weeks.

881
00:31:20,318 --> 00:31:22,939
They went from initial concept to a working prototype

882
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:25,189
and uh integrated with AWS Bedrock

883
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:27,380
as part of that and Adobe Firefly.

884
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,838
And so the specific task in this

885
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:32,160
case was the task of cover design.

886
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,959
By solving that distinct problem

887
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,338
with a very narrow scoped, manuscript

888
00:31:37,338 --> 00:31:39,640
aware cover generation with commercial

889
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,719
IP protection,

890
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,358
the KDP team has transformed a long

891
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:45,259
standing pain point for folks like me

892
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:48,078
into competitive advantage as part of

893
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:49,279
the publishing process.

894
00:31:50,489 --> 00:31:52,519
So that's design strategy too. Eric. I'm

895
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,088
gonna pass it back to you Jeffrey.

896
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:59,009
So now let's talk about the 3rd design strategy,

897
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:01,269
and in this case we're matching task modality

898
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:02,180
to requirements.

899
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,750
This is something that's gonna be that's gonna be

900
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,150
important no matter which of the product design strategies

901
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:07,739
you choose.

902
00:32:08,108 --> 00:32:10,259
We find all too often that we just

903
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:11,118
default with our GI.

904
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:13,989
Gen AI experiences to be synchronous.

905
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:16,289
So users click a button, they start to see the

906
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:18,410
little spinner go, and then they wait for something

907
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,049
to happen.

908
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:21,489
It feels familiar because that's how we've often

909
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:22,969
designed our products in the past,

910
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:25,368
but it's not necessarily always the best fit when

911
00:32:25,368 --> 00:32:26,608
it comes to generative AI.

912
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:29,250
And here's the problem, it often requires

913
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,289
higher performance characteristics than we

914
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:33,328
would need any otherwise, and it also then

915
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,680
results in higher inference costs.

916
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:37,108
So now you're forcing your users to wait,

917
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,809
and it's actually costing you more money.

918
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,709
Asynchronous design patterns are going to be

919
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,989
a slightly different way to do this. It's a fundamentally

920
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:44,769
different approach.

921
00:32:45,108 --> 00:32:47,269
So instead of making users wait for that, you

922
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:49,890
can actually prioritize the next step in the workflow

923
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,189
and eliminate those forced wait times in the

924
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:54,390
process. So think about it this way, when

925
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,709
a user is waiting for some AI generated

926
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,130
content, whether it's a book cover,

927
00:32:58,588 --> 00:32:59,529
ingesting

928
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:02,029
something else for your

929
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:04,199
operation. Do they really need to wait for that,

930
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:06,209
or could they move on and do

931
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:08,318
something else in the background while you're

932
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:09,789
waiting for the AI to complete this?

933
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,328
This not only improves the user experience, but

934
00:33:12,328 --> 00:33:14,489
it actually addresses several several technical

935
00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:16,289
challenges that I'll talk about in a slide or two.

936
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,279
So these are things like unpredictable

937
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,000
processing times,

938
00:33:20,318 --> 00:33:22,358
resource management, and cost optimization.

939
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:24,420
So let's look into this in a bit more detail.

940
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:27,358
So when should you choose synchronous versus

941
00:33:27,358 --> 00:33:28,578
asynchronous processing?

942
00:33:28,979 --> 00:33:31,059
Synchronous processing, as you might imagine, are

943
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:33,410
things that require real-time interactions

944
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,199
or validation.

945
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:37,019
So if you're guiding a patient through onboarding

946
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,150
before they can see the doctor, that has to happen

947
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,199
before they can see the doctor.

948
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:43,259
Uh, it's great for simple queries where you have a predictable

949
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:45,568
response time, say less than 3 to 5 seconds,

950
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:48,009
or an interactive conversation, if you were actually

951
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:50,219
creating a chatbot, it would be a really bad experience

952
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:52,219
if you needed to go off in the background, let's just

953
00:33:52,219 --> 00:33:54,640
say. For asynchronous processing,

954
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:57,068
these are going to have the opposite sorts of use cases.

955
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,368
So if you think about complex document

956
00:33:59,368 --> 00:34:01,568
processing, if we were thinking about

957
00:34:01,568 --> 00:34:03,618
processing insurance claims for our healthcare example,

958
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:05,209
this would not be a good fit

959
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:07,650
for synchronous, and so async is going to be our friend

960
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,769
here. And another case where we

961
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:11,918
might want to use asynchronous is if we have multi-step

962
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,969
workflows. So again, this is going to take a little bit

963
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,550
longer, it's a little bit more complex.

964
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,010
We don't need to sit there and have our user wait for this

965
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,688
to come back.

966
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:21,668
Another example where asynchronous is going to be a

967
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:23,869
good fit is where we need significant compute

968
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:26,148
power. So if it's going to take a lot of resources

969
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,949
to be able to complete this task,

970
00:34:28,228 --> 00:34:30,269
it's something that we probably want to do in the background and then

971
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,228
let the user come back to it at a later point in time.

972
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:35,300
The key question you need to ask yourself is,

973
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,688
does the user absolutely have to wait for this

974
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:39,708
to to continue the next step in

975
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:40,418
their workflow?

976
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:41,619
If they do,

977
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,590
you're probably gonna need to go synchronous.

978
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:44,789
If they don't,

979
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,668
you definitely want to look at something like asynchronous

980
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,309
request for this.

981
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,239
One of the other benefits of using asynchronous

982
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,280
requests is that you can often get access to

983
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,918
lower priced inference.

984
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,639
So if you think about as of reinvent 2025

985
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,438
today on a Thursday,

986
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:00,800
a lot of our models have half

987
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,039
the cost if you're using batch inference as opposed

988
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:03,719
to on-demand.

989
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:05,978
And very,

990
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,500
very few other places allow you to save 50%

991
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,139
just by making a different design choice.

992
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,239
And we have other

993
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:13,840
AWS services that can help with that. If you think about

994
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,898
using SQS or EventBridge to allow

995
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:18,090
you to know what to do when someone triggers something

996
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,090
and then come back to it,

997
00:35:19,378 --> 00:35:21,809
those are really good options to help you build these asynchronous

998
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:23,929
flows. So let's look at a real

999
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:25,090
world example from Tapi.

1000
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:28,349
So, Tappy's a New England property management

1001
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:30,530
start-up that's using asynchronous approaches to

1002
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,769
help with automated invoice processing.

1003
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,708
Here's how their solution works.

1004
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:37,250
So a business will send an invoice to a

1005
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,250
specific email address that Tay provides to

1006
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,648
them. Then they use Gen AI in the

1007
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:44,039
background to asynchronously process and extract

1008
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:46,429
all the information that's contained within this invoice.

1009
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:48,849
And this approach has 3 distinct

1010
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:51,208
advantages that help address some of the challenges

1011
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:52,250
that we see with Gen AI.

1012
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:54,849
The first one is it tackles the latency

1013
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:56,539
and performance unpredictability.

1014
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:59,030
So model performance can vary

1015
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,349
depending on the length. If you imagine I've got a short invoice

1016
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:02,590
versus a long invoice,

1017
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:05,070
the system loads, so how many invoices are coming in

1018
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,010
at the same time.

1019
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:08,349
And some of these things are going to be outside your control.

1020
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,208
So by processing these invoices asynchronously,

1021
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,708
Tapi's able to take that unpredictability

1022
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,938
and kind of obscure it from their users, and

1023
00:36:15,938 --> 00:36:17,750
then turn it into a background process.

1024
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,349
Their users aren't sitting there and waiting, and then they can

1025
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:21,889
continue with the next step in the workflow.

1026
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,869
Second, it provides security advantages.

1027
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,300
So if you think about

1028
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:29,000
asynchronous processing, you now have time

1029
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,309
to be able to provide things like content filtering,

1030
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,719
toxicity checks, and security chains

1031
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,260
if you do want to have a human in the loop,

1032
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,949
before you send it back to your users. So this

1033
00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:40,039
review before release model is a lot

1034
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:42,099
harder to implement if you were using synchronous

1035
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,909
processing. And third,

1036
00:36:44,228 --> 00:36:46,228
it enables resource management, and by that

1037
00:36:46,228 --> 00:36:48,349
I mean how can we best use the

1038
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:50,510
resources available to us from our

1039
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,260
G AI capabilities.

1040
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,898
So we can do prioritization, we can implement

1041
00:36:54,898 --> 00:36:57,188
queuing systems. If we have a burst of load,

1042
00:36:57,309 --> 00:36:59,429
we can maybe spread those out over time if they all don't

1043
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:00,688
need to happen at the same time.

1044
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:03,110
And those are all things that would be really difficult

1045
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,929
to do if we were using synchronous processing.

1046
00:37:05,378 --> 00:37:07,139
But probably most importantly,

1047
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:09,550
this allows Tappy to give their users a better

1048
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,269
experience and be respectful of their time.

1049
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,668
So rather than sitting there and just again watching

1050
00:37:13,668 --> 00:37:14,409
that spinner go,

1051
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:17,070
their users can move on to the next step. Maybe it's

1052
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,188
sending in another invoice, maybe it's doing something

1053
00:37:19,188 --> 00:37:20,110
completely otherwise,

1054
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:21,369
but they're not now

1055
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:22,889
waiting for something

1056
00:37:23,228 --> 00:37:25,228
that needs to happen that isn't really required

1057
00:37:25,228 --> 00:37:27,260
from them. Uh, but with that, I'll

1058
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,750
turn it over to Nicola for our last two strategies.

1059
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:31,228
Thanks Eric.

1060
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,309
All right,

1061
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,188
so.

1062
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:38,019
When integrating AI into your products,

1063
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:40,409
how many of you got really excited and think

1064
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:41,889
I'm gonna automate

1065
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,668
everything? What happens

1066
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:47,648
when with that automation, you're replacing,

1067
00:37:48,148 --> 00:37:50,628
you know, human intelligence and human nuance

1068
00:37:50,628 --> 00:37:52,699
and deep contextual understanding?

1069
00:37:53,228 --> 00:37:55,510
What happens when that fails?

1070
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,610
We did see that in our hypothetical, thankfully

1071
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,929
no customers turned up for their Phantom

1072
00:38:00,929 --> 00:38:01,949
appointments,

1073
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:04,489
but you can see how you might end up

1074
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:06,570
with really frustrated users who are

1075
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,128
going to lose trust in your products.

1076
00:38:09,949 --> 00:38:11,929
So how can you avoid this?

1077
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:15,829
Let's look at a real world example.

1078
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,668
Vital is another New Zealand based start-up,

1079
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,148
and they are revolutionizing patient

1080
00:38:21,148 --> 00:38:23,409
communication in inpatient

1081
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:25,570
and hospital settings in the US.

1082
00:38:26,128 --> 00:38:27,829
So imagine this, you're a patient,

1083
00:38:28,168 --> 00:38:30,668
you've turned up to the ER and you're tracking

1084
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:32,269
your your your visit

1085
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,610
on your mobile phone.

1086
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:36,708
A common problem is that you're gonna have a lot of tests

1087
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:37,429
that get run.

1088
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:40,360
And you know, the critical issue that

1089
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
you're in there for is gonna be followed up, but what

1090
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,478
happens if there's other incidental

1091
00:38:44,478 --> 00:38:46,719
findings that you might not

1092
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:49,208
you might leave the hospital not knowing about?

1093
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,679
Vital solution is to actually run

1094
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,679
the patient notes and tests through

1095
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:57,239
an LLM to extract those incidental

1096
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,280
findings out of that information.

1097
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,148
So, to be specific,

1098
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,878
incidental findings are those

1099
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:06,429
outside of what was primarily being looked for

1100
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:07,958
within medical image reporting.

1101
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,550
This again is a really classic example

1102
00:39:11,688 --> 00:39:13,409
of lighting up dark data.

1103
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:17,340
You've got physicians that are able to validate

1104
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,409
those findings,

1105
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,918
they can streamline contacting the patient

1106
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:24,000
and then update electronic health records

1107
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:25,199
automatically.

1108
00:39:25,898 --> 00:39:26,918
With this workflow,

1109
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:29,599
doctors provide that human touch

1110
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:32,309
when they're delivering sensitive medical

1111
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,389
information. And their expert feedback

1112
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:36,829
can be used to further improve incidental

1113
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:37,688
findings.

1114
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:40,148
Currently, this product services over

1115
00:39:40,148 --> 00:39:42,050
3 million patients within the US

1116
00:39:42,668 --> 00:39:45,208
and they actually surface 94%

1117
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,349
of incidental findings that would have

1118
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:49,389
otherwise been unreported

1119
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:50,530
and unnoticed.

1120
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,110
Critically,

1121
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,119
Vital estimates that this

1122
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:56,688
feature would also take around 5

1123
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:57,579
physicians

1124
00:39:57,949 --> 00:40:00,139
per hospital to actually implement.

1125
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,099
So with AI they're actually unlocking

1126
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,688
whole new capabilities.

1127
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,519
Saying that,

1128
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,000
Gen AI doesn't just augment

1129
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,840
workflows,

1130
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:12,099
it also gives you the ability

1131
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,840
to create whole new workflows

1132
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,030
that just weren't economically viable

1133
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:17,760
previously.

1134
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,969
Fundamentally, Vital have implemented

1135
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:25,239
an augmentation loop, which is a pattern we're

1136
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,829
seeing a lot of customers adopting.

1137
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,760
Instead of fully automating the workflow,

1138
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:32,239
they have AI generate the incidental

1139
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:32,978
findings.

1140
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:35,628
The clinician then verifies those findings

1141
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:37,780
and is able to communicate to the patient

1142
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,208
and provide feedback,

1143
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:41,668
um, which then helps to

1144
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:42,728
improve the accuracy

1145
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,269
of those findings over time and build

1146
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:45,889
trust.

1147
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:48,628
So whilst full automation might seem

1148
00:40:48,628 --> 00:40:49,969
like the ultimate goal,

1149
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:52,369
augmentation can actually

1150
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,409
provide much more immediate value

1151
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,449
and a better long-term result.

1152
00:40:57,309 --> 00:40:58,840
From a product perspective,

1153
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:01,159
augmentation is also going to create

1154
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:03,599
a much stickier experience,

1155
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:06,418
because uh the clinicians in this example

1156
00:41:06,418 --> 00:41:08,360
or or your customers will build up

1157
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:11,099
sort of muscle memory with your feature

1158
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:11,929
over time.

1159
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,570
This leads to higher engagement

1160
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:16,340
as customers feel a lot more

1161
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,378
competent and and able with your

1162
00:41:18,378 --> 00:41:20,510
product. Augmentation

1163
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,668
can also create a much more forgiving

1164
00:41:22,668 --> 00:41:23,320
environment,

1165
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:24,688
as you're able to

1166
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:27,340
improve it iteratively over

1167
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,728
time. You can launch the AR feature

1168
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:31,389
without having full, you know,

1169
00:41:31,668 --> 00:41:33,789
expectation expectation of perfect

1170
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:34,510
accuracy,

1171
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:37,309
and users then provide the necessary feedback

1172
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:39,409
to improve that over time.

1173
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,280
This creates a really,

1174
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,000
um, you know, important cycle of improvement

1175
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,360
that pure automation is going to lack.

1176
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,378
So let's breakdown that example

1177
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:53,438
even further so you can see how

1178
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:55,659
automation and augmentation can be

1179
00:41:55,659 --> 00:41:58,219
combined into one well-defined workflow.

1180
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,050
Medical notes reveal

1181
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,059
Gen AI. The incidental

1182
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:05,360
finding is extracted also with Gen AI

1183
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,958
before the patient is contacted for an examination.

1184
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:10,050
Reminders can be sent.

1185
00:42:10,378 --> 00:42:11,648
There's a patient visit.

1186
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:14,260
Notes are generated, uh, and

1187
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,360
automatically updated in that patient record.

1188
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,019
You can see here Gen AI is used

1189
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:22,378
in uh to augment critical steps around

1190
00:42:22,378 --> 00:42:24,438
reviewing notes and extracting incidental

1191
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:26,898
findings, and we've also got that clinical

1192
00:42:26,898 --> 00:42:28,369
expert at critical points,

1193
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:30,898
you know speaking to patients about sensitive

1194
00:42:30,898 --> 00:42:31,628
findings.

1195
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:34,309
We do also have automation. Involved,

1196
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:36,769
so, you know, updating that patient record,

1197
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,769
sending those reminders to the patient,

1198
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,438
so you can see within this workflow we've

1199
00:42:41,438 --> 00:42:43,688
thoughtfully combined automation,

1200
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:45,199
augmentation with AI

1201
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:48,438
and including those those clinical experts

1202
00:42:48,438 --> 00:42:49,128
in the loop.

1203
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,340
This thoughtful implementation also

1204
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,478
addresses some of AI's biggest

1205
00:42:54,478 --> 00:42:56,789
weaknesses around accuracy and

1206
00:42:56,789 --> 00:42:59,309
consistency because you're catching any errors

1207
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:00,809
you know before they really matter.

1208
00:43:01,688 --> 00:43:03,929
Let's drill down even further to see

1209
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:06,050
how safety is further involved

1210
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:06,849
within this loop.

1211
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:13,510
So, this problem is broken

1212
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,708
down into 3 overarching tasks,

1213
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:18,550
let's think back to those, you know, previous strategies.

1214
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,909
They've got clear inputs and they've got

1215
00:43:20,909 --> 00:43:21,978
clear outputs.

1216
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:24,510
So, and multiple validation gates

1217
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,199
within each.

1218
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:28,590
The workflow is also an asynchronous

1219
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,099
process.

1220
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:31,708
So this provides time for guard rails

1221
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:33,909
and checks to occur throughout that

1222
00:43:33,909 --> 00:43:36,110
process. Pre-processing

1223
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,389
of clinical notes uses the Amazon Nova

1224
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:40,849
Micro model for generating taxonomies

1225
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:42,820
and pulling out relevant details.

1226
00:43:43,188 --> 00:43:45,750
Medical imaging has very specific taxonomies

1227
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,369
that they're able to rely on here.

1228
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:50,619
Myel actually migrated to Amazon

1229
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:52,739
Nova Micro from a more expensive third

1230
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:53,530
party model

1231
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,978
when monitoring and testing showed that

1232
00:43:55,978 --> 00:43:58,320
they were able to perform the same

1233
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:01,050
uh task with the same level of accuracy

1234
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,320
at the fraction of the cost.

1235
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:05,898
Every section is then validated against a

1236
00:44:05,898 --> 00:44:08,000
gold standard of taxonomies produced

1237
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,079
by clinicians, so if something doesn't

1238
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,760
match, it's gonna be discarded.

1239
00:44:12,688 --> 00:44:14,688
Rejectex is used to validate, you

1240
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:16,228
know, do I actually have a response,

1241
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:18,610
um, make sure that there's something there.

1242
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:22,250
And then a lightweight AR model also validates

1243
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,590
do I have something that's medically meaningful.

1244
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:28,329
The core prompt generation is a bit more sophisticated,

1245
00:44:28,668 --> 00:44:29,530
so you've got

1246
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:31,869
a a dynamically constructed

1247
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,110
prompt, it's gonna include more patient

1248
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,978
details around conditions,

1249
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,909
medications, and also the reading level, so

1250
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,849
who's actually gonna be reading this result?

1251
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,780
This is before we also use an

1252
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:47,860
uh LLM to actually judge the outputs.

1253
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,869
So this is multiple prompts

1254
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:53,478
included within this, it's gonna be looking at accuracy,

1255
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:55,360
it's gonna be looking at safety.

1256
00:44:55,878 --> 00:44:58,019
Um, and the findings are actually

1257
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:00,119
graded against a set of criteria that have

1258
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:02,320
been validated by clinicians, so

1259
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,958
if I'm getting a 5, it means it's highly accurate,

1260
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:07,039
it contains the information that I expect it

1261
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:08,478
to, down to a 1,

1262
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,619
not so good, not so accurate,

1263
00:45:10,898 --> 00:45:12,938
we really need to review this for safety.

1264
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:15,800
Studies by Vital have shown

1265
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,039
that their in-house AI safety

1266
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:20,360
uh evaluation framework has

1267
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,519
achieved 99% accuracy.

1268
00:45:24,228 --> 00:45:26,360
So the clinician then reviews, oh

1269
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,750
sorry, these uh findings

1270
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,070
are then validated against a a

1271
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,309
set of criteria,

1272
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:35,050
so does it meet the safety threshold,

1273
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:37,550
are there any sensitivity flags for the

1274
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:40,079
types of results that are going to be uh

1275
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,239
provided back to the patient.

1276
00:45:41,929 --> 00:45:44,418
And then anything that's particularly sensitive

1277
00:45:44,418 --> 00:45:46,539
will be sent to the physician to

1278
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:48,378
review and then report back to the patient.

1279
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:52,019
Citations and referencing to the original

1280
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:54,019
reporting can also be included here

1281
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:56,139
to help improve the accuracy of those

1282
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:57,139
human reviews.

1283
00:45:58,139 --> 00:45:58,760
So these

1284
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:01,500
checks and feedback can really be incorporated

1285
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,969
again into any automatic evaluations,

1286
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,219
which are gonna be critical for improving

1287
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:06,769
your product over time.

1288
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:13,369
But how do you know that this augmentation

1289
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:15,599
loop is actually improving things

1290
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:16,329
over time?

1291
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:19,570
Monitoring is going to be your best

1292
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:20,148
friend.

1293
00:46:20,648 --> 00:46:23,128
You need to track those business metrics

1294
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:25,369
at a task level in order

1295
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:27,369
to see that your feature is

1296
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,449
actually incorporating all of that feedback

1297
00:46:29,449 --> 00:46:31,929
that you're being provided uh and and

1298
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:34,199
collecting. Monitoring

1299
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:36,300
becomes even more critical when you think

1300
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:38,800
you know that the production environment is

1301
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,418
not a static environment.

1302
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:43,000
Models are gonna be deprecated. The

1303
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,039
GPU allocations for the model

1304
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:45,878
that you're using

1305
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:48,280
might change, and maybe there's an

1306
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,898
auto-upgrade of a model that affects accuracy

1307
00:46:51,148 --> 00:46:52,478
of the results that you're getting.

1308
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,878
So here we have a very, very simple example,

1309
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,199
it's not a real example from a customer.

1310
00:46:58,438 --> 00:47:00,719
I did make this using Quiro, but it is

1311
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:03,050
representative of what I'm seeing with customers.

1312
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,878
So you can track cost, which is, you know, a function

1313
00:47:05,878 --> 00:47:08,079
of the number of tokens and the cost per token,

1314
00:47:08,398 --> 00:47:09,579
as well as accuracy.

1315
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,958
You may also be, you know, wanting to

1316
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:14,199
track the execution metrics as well, they're

1317
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:15,820
not, they're also very critical.

1318
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:19,168
So if we go back to our extracting taxonomy

1319
00:47:19,168 --> 00:47:19,780
task,

1320
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,269
what happens, you know,

1321
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,978
when I introduce a change to that task.

1322
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:26,409
So for example, what happens if I introduce

1323
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:27,228
a new model?

1324
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,119
Well you can see at this task level,

1325
00:47:30,378 --> 00:47:32,500
the cost is shifting down and the accuracy

1326
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,619
is about the same.

1327
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:35,898
So clearly it's a good um

1328
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:38,280
a good change, a positive change,

1329
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:40,780
uh, and I'm able to actually track this

1330
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,300
easily because of the way I've set up my monitoring

1331
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,340
and my metrics.

1332
00:47:45,648 --> 00:47:48,010
So remember our first uh strategy

1333
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,418
about profitable growth.

1334
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,409
Monitoring tells you if this feature is actually

1335
00:47:52,409 --> 00:47:54,869
becoming more profitable over time.

1336
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:57,648
So when you can easily breakdown your cost

1337
00:47:57,648 --> 00:47:59,969
to serve at the task and at the feature level,

1338
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:02,599
you can more easily set targets

1339
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,010
around cost optimization,

1340
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:06,369
uh, and actually implement some of

1341
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:08,889
those strategies that Eric highlighted

1342
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,030
uh earlier in the talk.

1343
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,168
For those of you who are really really

1344
00:48:13,168 --> 00:48:15,280
interested in monitoring

1345
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,688
and um automated evaluations,

1346
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,208
I'd recommend checking out the Gen AI

1347
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:22,889
Life Cycle Operational Excellence Framework.

1348
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:25,000
Had to practice that one a few times.

1349
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:27,688
Also GLOW, GLOE,

1350
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:30,289
um there is prescriptive guidance around that that

1351
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:31,628
goes into great detail.

1352
00:48:34,228 --> 00:48:36,349
So our final strategy

1353
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:38,429
represents a real shift in

1354
00:48:38,429 --> 00:48:40,610
how we design for user experience.

1355
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:43,708
Traditionally you'd optimize your interfaces

1356
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:45,119
for human interaction.

1357
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:47,550
So you want, you know, really clear visual

1358
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,378
hierarchies, you want intuitive navigation.

1359
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:53,110
But when designing your experiences

1360
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:54,869
for LLMs you're now saying,

1361
00:48:55,148 --> 00:48:57,389
oh the AI is the intermediary

1362
00:48:57,389 --> 00:48:59,510
between my customer and the

1363
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:01,590
product. When an LLM

1364
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,668
is consuming and processing

1365
00:49:03,668 --> 00:49:05,800
information uh from your product, it's

1366
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,878
not gonna care about where is

1367
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:10,110
that button on the page, what color is it,

1368
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:12,590
uh, instead it needs structured,

1369
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:15,000
predictable and semantically

1370
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,860
rich data formats.

1371
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:19,398
This means designing your API's

1372
00:49:19,398 --> 00:49:22,079
and your data schemas and your system outputs

1373
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,159
with machine interpretation in

1374
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:26,349
mind. So remember our

1375
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:28,510
healthcare company, you know, way back at the

1376
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:29,708
start of the presentation.

1377
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,208
Instead of that

1378
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:33,550
Interesting chatbot,

1379
00:49:33,969 --> 00:49:36,079
imagine if they designed for their appointment

1380
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,159
system with both humans and AI

1381
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:38,668
in mind,

1382
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,570
with structured data to prevent phantom

1383
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,699
appointments from appearing and clear

1384
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:44,829
schemas to help

1385
00:49:45,128 --> 00:49:47,168
AI understand availability

1386
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:49,489
constraints, so we're not getting our Saturday

1387
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:50,489
appointments booked in.

1388
00:49:53,648 --> 00:49:56,090
Amazon maintains a relentless focus

1389
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,219
on the architectural principles that

1390
00:49:58,219 --> 00:50:00,619
enable rapid scaling and innovation.

1391
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:03,610
One of the most transformative decisions

1392
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,590
that was made

1393
00:50:04,929 --> 00:50:07,050
was to have all teams expose their

1394
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,949
data and their functionality through APIs.

1395
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,849
This was about creating a company where any

1396
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:15,099
team could build on top of the work of

1397
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:15,829
another team.

1398
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:18,708
The API first approach

1399
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:20,789
enabled Amazon to launch

1400
00:50:20,969 --> 00:50:23,010
AWS so we can thank that

1401
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,469
for our conference today,

1402
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:27,289
um, and Amazon had solved the

1403
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:29,889
problem of making internal systems

1404
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:30,550
accessible.

1405
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,329
Every service was able to

1406
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:34,728
become a product.

1407
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,280
So just as Amazon's API mandate

1408
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,519
broke down internal silos,

1409
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,559
MCP servers breakdown the silos

1410
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:45,599
between AI models and the tools that

1411
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,739
they need to actually be useful.

1412
00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:51,019
Model context Protocol or MCP

1413
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:53,510
makes it easy for products to expose their

1414
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,668
functionality directly to AI,

1415
00:50:56,378 --> 00:50:58,590
um, directly to AI agents

1416
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,949
through a standard interface.

1417
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:03,000
So a lot of definitions have been thrown

1418
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,398
around about agents, I'm sure you've heard many

1419
00:51:05,398 --> 00:51:06,090
this week,

1420
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:08,599
um, but the one I like best is that

1421
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:09,418
agents

1422
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:11,829
are models using tools

1423
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:12,500
in a loop.

1424
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:15,159
Can't take credit for that one, I did hear it on

1425
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:17,159
Simon Willison's blog, I believe it's via

1426
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:17,898
anthropic.

1427
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:19,949
So,

1428
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:21,739
how can you actually

1429
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:24,409
set up your applications to

1430
00:51:24,409 --> 00:51:26,829
allow these agents easy access?

1431
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,510
One way companies are doing this is through

1432
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:30,829
MCP.

1433
00:51:31,409 --> 00:51:33,849
Companies are also doubling down on

1434
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:36,708
really rich APIs with good documentation.

1435
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:39,579
API's using open API format,

1436
00:51:39,849 --> 00:51:41,708
uh, open API schemas

1437
00:51:42,128 --> 00:51:44,188
already have a really familiar,

1438
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:46,309
uh, syntax for tool calling.

1439
00:51:46,699 --> 00:51:48,938
Uh, and they can easily be modified

1440
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:50,500
to be used by LLMs.

1441
00:51:53,219 --> 00:51:55,860
So we're witnessing a shift from optimizing

1442
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,938
solely for that user experience to

1443
00:51:57,938 --> 00:52:00,099
including the LLM experience

1444
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:01,280
or LLMX.

1445
00:52:02,449 --> 00:52:04,539
This transition is apparent in how you

1446
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,579
approach your documentation, so you

1447
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:08,659
know, think of the days of having,

1448
00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:10,300
you know, scattered PDFs,

1449
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,489
video tutorials, help docs, FAQs,

1450
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:15,559
you know, across your whole organization

1451
00:52:15,938 --> 00:52:18,780
really are ending as LLMs need comprehensive

1452
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,820
and structured documentation

1453
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,398
that they can rapidly pass.

1454
00:52:24,188 --> 00:52:27,219
So moving to markdown based documentation

1455
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,719
is isn't just about convenience,

1456
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:32,469
it's also about having machine readable

1457
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:34,550
content that seman that has, you

1458
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,869
know, the clear semantic structures and

1459
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:38,989
human but still remains

1460
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:39,969
human friendly.

1461
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,628
Well structured markdown allows for

1462
00:52:42,628 --> 00:52:45,110
LLM's to understand relationships

1463
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,148
between concepts and the logical

1464
00:52:47,148 --> 00:52:49,128
flow of how your product is meant to work.

1465
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,878
So think of your documentation as training

1466
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,000
material for any uh AI

1467
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,280
agents that are going to be using your

1468
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,179
product. You've created

1469
00:52:59,438 --> 00:53:01,478
comprehensive knowledge bases that

1470
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,519
AI can instantly access and then

1471
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:05,519
synthesize in order to

1472
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:06,978
provide relevant guidance.

1473
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:08,780
The product,

1474
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:11,599
the products that are able to master this

1475
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,110
LLM experience will have AI

1476
00:53:14,398 --> 00:53:16,878
AI agents that can expertly navigate

1477
00:53:16,878 --> 00:53:18,438
their products from day one.

1478
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:24,050
But how do you reimagine how

1479
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,590
users are going to interact with your software

1480
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:28,668
in this transition from UI,

1481
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,349
sorry, from UX to LLMX?

1482
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:34,070
This shift requires thinking beyond

1483
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:36,128
traditional app boundaries that we're all

1484
00:53:36,128 --> 00:53:36,668
used to.

1485
00:53:37,478 --> 00:53:38,978
So let's use an example.

1486
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,719
Let's consider how I might interact with a

1487
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,949
location service. I'm gonna open up a

1488
00:53:43,949 --> 00:53:46,079
location, you know, I'm very new to Vegas,

1489
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:48,619
so I, I, I'm looking for everything at the moment.

1490
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:51,260
I might search for a place that I wanna find,

1491
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:53,840
I might switch to another panel, try and

1492
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,719
find other places that are nearby,

1493
00:53:56,119 --> 00:53:58,199
uh, and then click through to find a bit more

1494
00:53:58,199 --> 00:53:59,760
detail about those options.

1495
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:02,659
You can see I've probably navigated through multiple

1496
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:05,300
different UIs and different interfaces

1497
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,378
in order to get the information that I need and

1498
00:54:07,378 --> 00:54:08,958
there's friction at every point.

1499
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:12,639
AI AI agents using

1500
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:14,820
tools and MCP servers can

1501
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,719
coordinate these tasks for me simultaneously.

1502
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:20,340
There's no need to click through different user

1503
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,590
interfaces as an agent is able

1504
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,809
to see which MCP servers and tools

1505
00:54:24,809 --> 00:54:26,898
are available in order to complete that

1506
00:54:26,898 --> 00:54:28,599
task for me and present it back.

1507
00:54:29,429 --> 00:54:31,550
So as a user, I can specify

1508
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:32,570
where I wanna go,

1509
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:35,228
and that agent might use say Amazon

1510
00:54:35,228 --> 00:54:36,429
location MCP to

1511
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:38,449
find uh nearby

1512
00:54:38,869 --> 00:54:39,869
options for me

1513
00:54:40,269 --> 00:54:42,739
uh without me needing to go through that

1514
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:44,878
visit. It can then be

1515
00:54:44,878 --> 00:54:47,079
presented back to me in a readable

1516
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:49,559
format, um, so that human

1517
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:51,898
experience is still very much a part of it here,

1518
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,398
um, without me having to traverse

1519
00:54:54,398 --> 00:54:56,840
through multiple UI's and have multiple

1520
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,699
points of contact.

1521
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:01,269
So the challenge becomes to think about creating

1522
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:03,688
capabilities that AI can invoke

1523
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:06,349
um rather than products

1524
00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:06,889
where

1525
00:55:07,228 --> 00:55:09,050
that are destinations for users.

1526
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:13,139
This requires thinking beyond the traditional

1527
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:14,000
UIUX

1528
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,639
and focusing on making your product's core

1529
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:19,119
value and core features

1530
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,079
accessible through intelligent orchestration.

1531
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:24,188
So with that, I will pass back to Geoffrey

1532
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:25,389
to round out our presentation.

1533
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:27,929
Thanks, Nicola.

1534
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:29,820
So

1535
00:55:30,378 --> 00:55:32,619
that is a pretty broad tour

1536
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:34,739
through a lot of things that when you

1537
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:36,860
apply each of these collectively

1538
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:39,099
and you stack them as you can see in the

1539
00:55:39,099 --> 00:55:41,340
examples how one over after another

1540
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,639
uh uh another after another stack

1541
00:55:43,978 --> 00:55:44,820
can yield

1542
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,719
meaningful differences

1543
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:49,340
in the use cases that you're looking to automate.

1544
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:52,219
Drive down the cost and enable

1545
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:54,780
you to, in a very stepwise fashion

1546
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,099
reach profitable growth and

1547
00:55:57,099 --> 00:55:58,239
increase your odds of success,

1548
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,978
beat the odds uh from what the surveys

1549
00:56:00,978 --> 00:56:01,820
are telling you.

1550
00:56:02,769 --> 00:56:04,809
Drive profitable growth with a value driven

1551
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:07,219
approach. It starts with the business case.

1552
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:09,909
Focus on tasks over conversations,

1553
00:56:10,208 --> 00:56:12,360
narrowly scope those tasks. Make

1554
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,369
sure you pick the right modalities which are gonna

1555
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:16,409
help you optimize the right cost and

1556
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:18,668
optimize the way your customers interact

1557
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:19,989
with what you're building.

1558
00:56:20,648 --> 00:56:23,050
Favor augmentation over automation.

1559
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:25,398
And design your experiences for both

1560
00:56:25,398 --> 00:56:26,019
humans

1561
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,179
and uh for LLMs

1562
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:31,119
do those and you're gonna find that that

1563
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,360
your your uh chances of

1564
00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:35,458
of of delivering meaningful

1565
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,878
uh interactions with your

1566
00:56:37,878 --> 00:56:40,360
customers, driving meaningful extensions

1567
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,519
to your product and driving profitable growth

1568
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:44,059
are gonna become a lot easier.

1569
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:46,978
So with that we want to thank you for joining us. We'll

1570
00:56:46,978 --> 00:56:48,989
hang around afterwards if there are any

1571
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,989
questions, uh, if you're interested in

1572
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:52,050
diving deeper,

1573
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:54,389
uh, you can start with the QR code there

1574
00:56:54,389 --> 00:56:56,458
which is gonna take you, uh, to, uh,

1575
00:56:56,469 --> 00:56:58,599
the follow up material that we have that, uh,

1576
00:56:58,789 --> 00:57:00,829
that will help you, uh, expand on the design

1577
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:02,530
practices that we've presented here.

1578
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:04,909
Also, um, we have

1579
00:57:04,909 --> 00:57:07,414
programs within the. ISV segment

1580
00:57:07,614 --> 00:57:09,914
uh that are designed to help organizations

1581
00:57:09,914 --> 00:57:12,273
walk through those use cases to score

1582
00:57:12,273 --> 00:57:13,914
them, to understand

1583
00:57:14,195 --> 00:57:16,195
where you might want to focus your effort and your

1584
00:57:16,195 --> 00:57:18,313
AM can help you uh understand

1585
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:20,385
things like the generative AI innovation Center,

1586
00:57:20,594 --> 00:57:22,773
uh, the agentic Catalyst program,

1587
00:57:22,985 --> 00:57:24,994
uh, ways that we can help accelerate

1588
00:57:24,994 --> 00:57:27,333
working through these design best practices,

1589
00:57:27,675 --> 00:57:29,704
uh, and, uh, and, and, and we're

1590
00:57:29,704 --> 00:57:31,715
looking forward to, uh, to helping you get on

1591
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:33,675
that path, uh, to profitable growth.

1592
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:35,458
Uh, last thing,

1593
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,878
uh, if you, uh, have the opportunity,

1594
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:39,969
make sure that you continue your learning journey

1595
00:57:39,969 --> 00:57:42,360
on, uh, uh, AWS SkillBuilder,

1596
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:44,760
uh, especially around these topics with

1597
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,760
respect to generative AI.

1598
00:57:46,849 --> 00:57:48,989
So with that, thank you, have a great day,

1599
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:51,610
hope you have a great rest of the conference and

1600
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:53,070
thanks guys, we'll stay around.
