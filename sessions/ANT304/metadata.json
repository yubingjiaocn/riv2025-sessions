  "abstract": "An unparalleled level of interest in generative AI and agentic AI is driving organizations to rethink their data strategy. While there is a need for data foundation constructs such as data pipelines, data architectures, data stores and data governance to evolve, there are business elements that need to stay constant like cost-efficiency and  effectively collaborating across data estates. In this session we will cover how building your data foundation on AWS provides the tools and the building blocks to balance both needs, and empower organizations to grow their data strategy for building AI-ready applications.",
  "abstract_cn": "对生成式AI和智能体AI前所未有的关注正在推动组织重新思考其数据策略。虽然数据管道、数据架构、数据存储和数据治理等数据基础构建需要演进，但成本效益和跨数据资产有效协作等业务要素需要保持不变。在本次会议中，我们将介绍如何在AWS上构建数据基础为平衡这两种需求提供工具和构建模块，并赋能组织发展其数据策略以构建AI就绪的应用程序。",
