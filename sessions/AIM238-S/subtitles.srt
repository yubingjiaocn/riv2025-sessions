1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,830
- Hello, I am Tylor Kim.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,630
I'm from Samsung Electronics.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,070
Yeah, today people started our subject,

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,900
let me introduce myself.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,180
Yeah, I am Kyotack Tylor Kim.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,783
I'm a lead engineer of Core SRE Part.

7
00:00:21,903 --> 00:00:26,903
I'm operating some project
from Samsung Electronics,

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,360
just like Bixby and Galaxy AI,

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,360
which are the some main AI
services in Samsung Electronics.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,020
And also, I am engaged with
some vision critical projects,

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,020
just like Samsung Wallet and
Samsung accounts like that.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,940
I will touch about the example

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,450
of this project more
during these sessions.

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,450
Yeah, today's agenda is
how Samsung use AI agent

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,490
to optimize infrastructures
that scale with the Cast AI.

16
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,040
Yeah, I'm coming from Samsung Electronics.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
I'm not an employee of Cast AI,

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,280
so I'm just explain my experience,

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,593
during using Cast AI only, yeah.

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,670
Yeah, people touch the main item.

21
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,900
I explained the Samsung
Electronics in glimpse.

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,370
Yeah, this company is established in 1969,

23
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,780
and this company grown

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,780
into more than 260,000 peoples worldwide.

25
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,720
And my company produce some mobile phone,

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,300
based on the Galaxy brand,

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,283
and also making some visual displays

28
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,290
and home appliance as well.

29
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,440
Also, put the P2B businesses,

30
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,170
and we are making semiconductors,

31
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,350
and it is also indispensable part

32
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,963
of the Samsung Electronics operations.

33
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,290
In bottom of that slide,

34
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,080
and also tell is some R&D centers,

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,890
and the each R&D center
is established globally.

36
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,890
And so this R&D center
focus on some localizations,

37
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,900
and also, they have some
specialized features just like AI

38
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,533
or SRE like that.

39
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,910
Yeah, here is the challenge of my company,

40
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,910
and we need to operate
massive-scale Kubernetes operations,

41
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,030
and so scale and complexity
is very challenging for us

42
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,420
because we are running our applications

43
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,550
on top of multi-cloud.

44
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,270
It's AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure,

45
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,820
and Samsung Cloud as well.

46
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,840
This makes operating more complex.

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,840
We should do considering
more infrastructures code,

48
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,220
based on the multi-cloud.

49
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,220
We also thinking about some
well-grained security policy

50
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,160
for operators and developers.

51
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,030
And another one is over
than 50 applications running

52
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,067
on top of AWS.

53
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,330
Some applications is
running on top of AWS only,

54
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,830
and some applications
running on top of AWS

55
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,760
and other cloud providers.

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,760
And over than 1,000 EK
clusters in our system,

57
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,230
and tens of thousand of
virtual machines nodes,

58
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,890
is learning for our applications.

59
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,570
And the second one is
CPU and GPU workload,

60
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,430
and critical mix of CPU and
GPU workload is very important

61
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,030
to us because we have separated team

62
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,150
for training and inference.

63
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,820
From the training team, they wanted

64
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,820
to have some simply paid
operational requirement.

65
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,220
They want to running their
training infrastructures,

66
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,030
running on top a single
(indistinct) clusters.

67
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,880
In case of inference team,

68
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,940
they want to have some more GPUs

69
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,640
with cost-effective prices

70
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,240
And also, we have a traditional backend

71
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,160
and proton-developing
company and developing teams,

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,160
and they also want to have
some unified requirement tools.

73
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,523
Yeah, in second side,

74
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,590
standard cost-saving
limit is also important.

75
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,590
Till last year, we only focus
on the ROI and savings plans

76
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,910
for the cost-saving policy,

77
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,130
and it's not very attractive

78
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,300
because we only have
some commitment to AWS,

79
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,930
we can get on more
cost-effective infrastructures.

80
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,970
But from this year,

81
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,813
we are also considering
spot instance pretty much.

82
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,703
After using the Cast AI solution,

83
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:32,867
(indistinct) instance is very attractive.

84
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,050
Without any commitment to AWS,

85
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,050
we can get a more cheap
infrastructures by using Cast AI.

86
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,190
Yeah, this is the solution that

87
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,190
and Samsung have some ongoing
project called Agentic AI.

88
00:05:54,193 --> 00:05:57,600
Agentic AI has some separated categories,

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,520
just like infrastructures
management and security,

90
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,020
and change management or (indistinct)

91
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,410
and monitoring committee.

92
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,410
And also, Cast AI integration
manages GPU and CPU workload.

93
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,320
I will touch more about this,

94
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,150
and banking optimization for
intelligent workload placement,

95
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,920
is also important.

96
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,920
In right side, center of our Agentic AI,

97
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,060
there is a Cast AI.

98
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,060
Cast AI control the AIOps
and workload simultaneously,

99
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,903
and it supports the AWS, EKS pretty much.

100
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,023
Yeah, here is some key challenges.

101
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,530
Scalability issues, how to
efficiently manage thousands

102
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,060
of diverse workload across the
massive Kubernetes clusters.

103
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,670
And it's a very important thing,

104
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,840
because my operators need

105
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,170
to support Kubernetes portion upgrade.

106
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,150
Everybody knows it's very difficult

107
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,610
because of we spent much time,

108
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,060
and also, there is some
performance bottleneck.

109
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,013
In case of Samsung Wallet,

110
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,100
for the Korean customer tend
to not bring their plastic card

111
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,140
to the market in these days.

112
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,260
So when the Samsung Wallet is impaired,

113
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,310
they can't buy anything from the market.

114
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,770
So kudos the Samsung Wallet project,

115
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,138
performance bottleneck or impairment

116
00:07:41,138 --> 00:07:45,120
or latency is very critical.

117
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,480
And integration complexity.

118
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,310
As like mentioned earlier,

119
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:55,310
my company making us some over
the 50 applications on cloud.

120
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:01,670
So in this case, simple
architecture is a very important,

121
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,580
so I'm thinking about the Cast AI.

122
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,380
We put only one component
in our infrastructures.

123
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,380
We can easily achieve our AI
Agentic architecture in place.

124
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,360
Yeah, here is some technical solutions,

125
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,850
automation driven by AI,

126
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,340
and using Samsung's AI agent

127
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,030
to continuously optimize
cloud in real-time.

128
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,460
Yeah, as like mentioned earlier,

129
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,120
some change management and
security and (indistinct)

130
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,570
and other AI agent is running,

131
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:47,070
and they cooperate, and
on top of this AI agent,

132
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,900
there is also supervisor agent is running.

133
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,340
So when the implementation is done,

134
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,340
and I believe this operation
system will be very smart.

135
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,313
Next one is a Cast AI integration,

136
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,790
leveling intelligent
to automation pictures

137
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,490
to scale fast and automatically

138
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,030
and right size workload in real-time.

139
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,453
Yeah, so when the implement Cast AI,

140
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:25,731
operational engineers don't
need to operate anymore,

141
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,333
and the automatically Cast AI,

142
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,930
controlled our infrastructures.

143
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,320
And the next one is the
impacting optimizations.

144
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,730
I believe that when someone
considering Cast AI first,

145
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,850
in this case, they easily tend to do focus

146
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,010
on those instance only.

147
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,033
But I had some purity in my team,

148
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,453
and the result was pretty good.

149
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,610
When we are only focused on
the bin packing automation

150
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,610
by using Cast AI, the cost
to saving is more than 30%.

151
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,770
It's very crazy, so I
think we are using Cast AI,

152
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,080
and (indistinct) simultaneously,

153
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,993
the cost-saving output
will be more good, I think.

154
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,550
Yeah, I am gonna touch about the result

155
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,463
and picture outlooks of
Samsung Electronics as well.

156
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,860
Yeah, quantifiable impact.

157
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,210
Yeah, reduce the operational overhead.

158
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,290
AI-driven automation, streamless
infrastructure management,

159
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,880
is very important,

160
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,800
because when I installed
the Cast AI solutions,

161
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,800
after that, we can easily figure
out our status and progress

162
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,573
by using monitoring of Cast AI.

163
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,950
I believe that monitoring dashboard

164
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,250
of Cast AI is pretty beautiful,

165
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,830
and I'm also talking about this aspect

166
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,110
to Cast AI people as well.

167
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,320
And cost manual workup scaling,

168
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,503
provisioning and optimization
is also important.

169
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,883
This tool is very important
to for the operational team.

170
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,860
I have over than 50 silos,

171
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,180
and I implemented Cast AI.

172
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,130
After that, they do not need

173
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,253
to monitoring every morning.

174
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,440
So it's also very important.

175
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,980
And next one is improve
the application efficiency

176
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,550
and real-time optimization,

177
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,210
right sizes, resources continuously.

178
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,503
And this means cast AI is AI agent,

179
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,600
always checking our workload,

180
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,140
and sometimes, sharing
the some number of node,

181
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,090
or sometimes scaled out
the number of node sizes.

182
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,233
And the next one is elevate
over and under-provisioning.

183
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,780
We can use all of the
resource in our physical load.

184
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,290
And this is a very important aspect,

185
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,350
and significant cost reductions,

186
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,510
combines the AI automations

187
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,123
and the smart bin packing and spot usage.

188
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,900
And the combination of these three aspect,

189
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:44,900
make a much cost-saving
outcomes in our company,

190
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,400
and also, enables substantial savings,

191
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,640
across Kubernetes environment.

192
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Yeah, and automation
means that we can focus

193
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,890
on other things in our company,

194
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,890
and usually, we can focus on
the creating other agent job.

195
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,950
We can make some additional
environment for AI operating.

196
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,073
And so this is also significant
cost-reduction as well.

197
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,433
Yeah, here is the future
outlook of my company.

198
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,870
AI-driven autonomy

199
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,159
and moving toward pretty
autonomous cloud operation.

200
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,159
This is the final goal from
the logs, from the Cast AI,

201
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,240
we are getting some more
information of our infrastructures,

202
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,810
and by using the kinds of log systems,

203
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,683
and we can create a more
advanced AI autonomy.

204
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,463
Also, minimal human
interventions required.

205
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,710
In case of mission-critical project,

206
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,710
we needed to monitoring our
system 24 hours, seven days.

207
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,980
That it does a very critical
aspect for the operation,

208
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,200
because of human beings can't focus

209
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,240
on the monitoring every time.

210
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,990
So when we introduced the Cast AI,

211
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,890
after that, we can minimal
human intervention required

212
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,793
in our team.

213
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,430
Second one is industry standard.

214
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,840
Defining new benchmark for
efficiency and scalability,

215
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,100
will be held last few years.

216
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,490
For example, pay the attention

217
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,960
or mixed (indistinct)
could be a benchmark,

218
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,530
and they're dominant in this area.

219
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,710
And that these kinds of
changes very big impact

220
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,840
to our infrastructures.

221
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,870
And so Samsung Electronics is more focused

222
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,000
on these kinds of change,

223
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,660
and we are going to adopt new technology

224
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,680
in our GPU processing as well.

225
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,730
Next one is driving cost-effective,

226
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,313
AI-powered cloud operations.

227
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,700
Cost-effective means

228
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,700
we can use the clearly
optimized infrastructures,

229
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,690
and that is based on the Cast AI product.

230
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,360
And also, we are also more focused

231
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,353
on the AI-powered automation
operations as well.

232
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,640
Lastly, unified optimization
is very interested

233
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,003
in my team,

234
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,930
expanding AI automation across
the CPU and GPU workload.

235
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,230
You can see the GB200 and
GB300 during this re:Invent,

236
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,250
and it's excellent combination
of the CPU and GPU.

237
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Also, already we have some GPU
and CPU combination workload

238
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,690
in our systems.

239
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,680
So well organized, this
operation is very important,

240
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,763
I think, as well.

241
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,380
Lastly, delivering
consistent optimization,

242
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,663
across diverse environment.

243
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,493
Multi-cloud is always very challenging.

244
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,480
Sometimes one public
cloud could be impaired.

245
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,060
In this case, we need to
favorable our workload

246
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,340
to other companies,

247
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,600
in this kinds of orchestration
is very challenging

248
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,910
for the operational team.

249
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,140
So we needed to make our
architecture more simple.

250
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,790
So in the middle of our architecture,

251
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,313
and there is Cast AI solutions.

252
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,150
Yeah, this is all of my deck.

253
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,380
If you have any kinds of
questions, just let me know, yeah.

254
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:19,876
(audience applauding)
