1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:01,650
- All right, hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,640
My name's Ian McKiernan.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,823
I'm the lead product manager
for the NBA Stats Platform,

4
00:00:04,823 --> 00:00:06,300
and we're here to talk to you today

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,400
about the NBA's new
Inside the Game platform

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,800
with AWS along with...

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,150
- Dashiell Flynn or "Dash."

8
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,450
I'm a principal consultant in
our sports practice at AWS.

9
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,420
I lead a lot of our AI/ML
data and analytics projects

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,360
across our league team
and sports customers.

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,680
- Right, and I'm Charlie Rohlf.

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,380
I get the honor of leading
the NBA Stats team,

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,410
and I'll kick it off here
with the slide presentation.

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,290
This is our 300 level talk
about Inside the Game.

15
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,000
We're excited to talk about the NBA,

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,763
what we're doing with AWS.

17
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:37,272
I am a retired 500 level engineer

18
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:39,120
who can no longer cut it at that level,

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,540
so I'm appropriate at
the 300 level for today.

20
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,730
So, can everyone hear me okay?

21
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,563
Yes, excellent.

22
00:00:45,563 --> 00:00:48,420
My first presentation to
green earmuffs all around.

23
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,070
So, thank you.

24
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,310
But let's start with our
customary hype video as the NBA.

25
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,470
We put a lot of effort into our marketing,

26
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,000
but this is great to get us excited,

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,833
and then we'll get into

28
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,730
what the Inside the Game platform does,

29
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,092
what our team does, and go from there.

30
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:03,000
We're excited for the presentation.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,003
So with that, enjoy.

32
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:04,911
- [Commentator] James fly.

33
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:05,869

45
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:26,470
Tosses it up.

46
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,553
Oh!

47
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:29,017
(upbeat music continues)

48
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:31,443

51
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,730
Great, so with that, we wanted to unveil

52
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,290
the Inside the Game platform,

53
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,088
which from the NBA, empowered by AWS.

54
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:46,050
And we're excited to talk
to you about that today.

55
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,883
But first, we have to start

56
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:48,830
with a little bit of
background and context.

57
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,370
So you'll see on the loop there

58
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,020
this expected field goal percentage,

59
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,700
and we'll talk more about that later.

60
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,840
But what I really wanna highlight

61
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,250
before we move into our team

62
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,190
are those little green dots
all over Luca's body, right?

63
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,990
That represents our player tracking data

64
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,420
and it underpins a lot of what we do here.

65
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,300
So we are generating 29 data points.

66
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,990
Wrists, shoulder, elbows,
shoulders, knees, hips, et cetera.

67
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,150
29 body parts of every player,

68
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,340
60 times a second throughout
the course of the game

69
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,450
in three dimensions.

70
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,710
And you can see those little green dots.

71
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,320
They represent an X, Y, Z
coordinate of every player

72
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,250
60 times a second.

73
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,080
It's an incredible amount of data.

74
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,940
The scope of that data really speaks

75
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,050
to the scope of our team.

76
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,180
And to understand what
Inside the Game does

77
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,210
and how we did it, we have to
start with what our team does.

78
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,150
So our stats team handles
everything on the screen here.

79
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,410
It's everything in the backend

80
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,030
related to the basketball data,

81
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,520
the data that describes
the game on the court.

82
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,290
So we do the ingestion and storage,

83
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,490
wherever that data comes from,

84
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,170
whether it's a partner,
whether it's internal.

85
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,140
Whatever data describes
the game on the court,

86
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,960
we're taking it in, we're
ingesting it, we're storing it,

87
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,569
we're processing it, we're ETL-ing,

88
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:53,340
we're keeping it for the
historical record books

89
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,020
and doing that generation in the middle

90
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,000
where we add intelligence to it.

91
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,220
And that's really where
Inside the Game shines,

92
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,486
where we try to add
intelligence to the content,

93
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:02,400
to the data.

94
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
We wanna tell stories with the data.

95
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,030
And then ultimately, we
have to deliver that data.

96
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,640
We want to take that data and
deliver it to our products,

97
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,109
deliver it to our teams,
to our broadcasters,

98
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:12,930
and ultimately our fans, right?

99
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,270
Because if we have one mission,

100
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,060
our mission is to educate and engage fans.

101
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,820
So we have built this
Inside the Game platform

102
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,680
to educate and engage our fans

103
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,440
and take that data,
tell compelling stories,

104
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,600
and help our fans
understand the game better,

105
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,360
understand why great players are so great,

106
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,940
what makes them the best
athletes in the world, right?

107
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,650
Why are the teams succeeding?

108
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,910
Why is another team struggling?

109
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,550
We wanna be able to use
data to tell those stories.

110
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,400
Because the more we can
educate, the more we can engage,

111
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,230
it will lead to better broadcasts,

112
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,940
better engage with our digital products,

113
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,520
and generally, better business outcomes.

114
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,820
But, you know, since we're
operating at the 300 level here,

115
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,950
you can see the scope
of our team is broad.

116
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,080
Like, we're only gonna
cover a slice of this

117
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,820
with the Inside the Game platform.

118
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,107
But I'm lucky to lead a team
of extremely talented engineers

119
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,600
and product managers that
handle all of the steps on here

120
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,050
and happy to answer
questions about it as we go.

121
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,170
So, the first thing to
drill in a little bit more,

122
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,191
and again, we're gonna go
into that content generation.

123
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:14,747
That's where the Inside
the Game really shines.

124
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:17,354
And while AWS has stepped in

125
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:20,400
to be an incredible partner
across the whole stack,

126
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,870
our entire tech stack,

127
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,161
and amplified our mission
to educate and engage fans,

128
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:25,920
really, from day one,

129
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,630
we're gonna focus on how Inside the Game

130
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,520
renders for our fans.

131
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
And in order to do that, we
have to understand sort of,

132
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,850
what are we trying to do?

133
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,130
We're trying to quantify a play.

134
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,720
So, in case you're not
a basketball expert,

135
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,650
let's just show a play,

136
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,150
and we'll jump back to this later.

137
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,940
But with Giannis here,

138
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,480
he's gonna get a lot of attention
in defense, kick it out.

139
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,050
Nice little cue pass there
for a three in the corner.

140
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,400
So that's a play.

141
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,370
But the moment team got the
balls, end of the possession.

142
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,260
But not every play is the same.

143
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,360
Some plays are a distinct moment in time,

144
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,250
some plays span a lot of time.

145
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,690
But ultimately, what we're trying to do

146
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,233
is quantify the action
and quantify that play.

147
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,330
But there's a lot of history here

148
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,770
that we need to understand.

149
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,480
We've come a long way.

150
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,770
You remember that shot of Luca

151
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,070
with the 29 data points on his body?

152
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,170
It wasn't always that way.

153
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,500
We have on the screen here
a shot of the scorebook

154
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,570
from Wilt's 100-point game.

155
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,443
It used to be a play like that,

156
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:26,460
a play like Giannis with a
kickout and a give and go,

157
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,553
or all those plays were really,
at best, one data point.

158
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,860
Just one data point.

159
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,120
If they scored.

160
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,953
What was the score?

161
00:05:33,953 --> 00:05:35,403
That was the only data point we had.

162
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,640
And over time, we added data points.

163
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,590
So we got to the point where we had shots

164
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,610
and misses and makes,

165
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,200
and then we had rebounds
and we had assists.

166
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,480
And over the years, we
added more and more stats

167
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,940
and it became the box score that you knew.

168
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,800
But then the box score wasn't enough.

169
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,210
There's only so much you could do

170
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,670
'cause you'd have the
aggregate of all the stats,

171
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,690
but you needed the play by play.

172
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,860
You needed the temporal aspect.

173
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,693
When did they happen?

174
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:57,526
Who was on the court?

175
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,250
Then we had the play by play.

176
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,403
So from 1996 onward, we
had the play by play.

177
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,550
So we would know the time of each event,

178
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,140
and then we could tell
you who was on the court

179
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,820
and which lineups were efficient.

180
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,950
And we could really measure
the success of each player

181
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,440
in a different way from '96 onward.

182
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,610
But you're still talking about

183
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,260
relatively little data, right,

184
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,870
compared to the scale
we're dealing with now.

185
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,250
And it took a big leap forward

186
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,810
when we added player tracking data.

187
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,430
A little over 10 years ago,

188
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,650
we started with just a single
data point for every player,

189
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,140
an X, Y, Z coordinate of
the player on the court

190
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,290
as they moved around in your
high school geometry class.

191
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,810
That was a big leap, a stepwise leap.

192
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,760
And then we took another step forward

193
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,860
in the last three years where
we moved to that pose data,

194
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,060
as we call it, right?

195
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,710
That's the head,
shoulders, knees and toes,

196
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,230
the skeletal pose data of the players,

197
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,320
60 times a second, 29 body parts.

198
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,120
And then imagine what that unlocks

199
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,090
when you're trying to
quantify a play that we saw.

200
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,520
And you can see our
little dancing skeletons,

201
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,100
as we like to call them,
matched up to the video.

202
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,810
But that's what the data looks like

203
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,110
when you just play it out.

204
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,673
Right?

205
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:03,333
It's an incredible data set.

206
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,920
There's so much we can do.

207
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,320
And in many ways, we're
only scratching the surface

208
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,910
of what's possible.

209
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,330
But we now work with AWS
to take in all this data

210
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,820
and think of that pipeline
we showed in the early slide,

211
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,090
ingest it, store it, process
it, do live real-time

212
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,720
split second data science
through our Flink architecture,

213
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,390
running seamlessly on AWS and
deliver it to our products,

214
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,930
our broadcasters, our teams so
that they can make use of it.

215
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,293
And really, back to that
quantifying a play idea,

216
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,040
that amount of data is incredible, right?

217
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,290
Millions, literally,
millions of data points

218
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,250
for every single play.

219
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,370
We went from one to millions.

220
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,230
But we can't take millions of data points

221
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,920
and give millions of data
points to a broadcaster.

222
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,741
We can't give millions of data
points to a coach or a fan.

223
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:53,430
They're not gonna know
what to do with that.

224
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,963
So a lot of the work we
do when we quantify a play

225
00:07:55,963 --> 00:07:58,699
is how do we understand
the aspects of the game

226
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:02,790
and quantify the specific
basketball things

227
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,860
that a broadcaster can then act on

228
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,660
or an insight we can give the fan

229
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,130
to engage them and educate them

230
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,080
about what they're seeing on the court.

231
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,900
And all these aspects go into it.

232
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,082
And we'll talk more over the
course of this presentation

233
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:17,670
about how we prioritize all the things

234
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,230
we could do with the stats.

235
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,000
But again, it all boils down to this idea

236
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,433
of how do we quantify a play.

237
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,090
And not every play is the same.

238
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,230
As I mentioned,

239
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,110
we have our expected field
goal percentage, XFG.

240
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,240
That takes in all these features.

241
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,290
The pose of the shooter,

242
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,600
how closely defended were
they when they shot it?

243
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,433
Were they leaning?

244
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,550
Were they coming off a screen?

245
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,110
How fast were they running?

246
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,050
All those aspects of a
single moment in time,

247
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,980
that moment of a shot, that's
part of quantifying a play.

248
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,470
We can tell you how
effectively shooters shoot,

249
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,910
like, what's the expected
field goal percentage,

250
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,100
which shooters exceed the
expected field goal percentage,

251
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,400
which don't quite do that.

252
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,370
But that's just a moment in time.

253
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,780
That's a play.

254
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,475
But so is something like
a horns action, right?

255
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:02,040
Double high ball screen.

256
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,730
There's a hundred variations
of this that teams run,

257
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,563
but that spans a long time.

258
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,100
So there's not one size fits all, right?

259
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,750
There's a lot of different
plays to quantify.

260
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,720
But ultimately, if we quantify the play

261
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,770
and we can identify it

262
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,070
and use AI and ML to find that shot,

263
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,260
to find the features
that describe that shot,

264
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,410
to build the AI model, the ML model,

265
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,240
to pull out the expected
field goal percentage,

266
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,920
to detect that horn's action.

267
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,010
Once we find it, after we find it,

268
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,160
then we can quantify and
we can tell you tendencies,

269
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,130
frequencies, efficiencies, where
on the court do they do it?

270
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,390
How often does LeBron go

271
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,830
to his left or his right more often?

272
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,720
What happens when he goes
to his left and his right?

273
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,070
But the first step is always finding it.

274
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,170
You have to quantify the play.

275
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,940
From that, then you can
generate the insights

276
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,260
and you can go from there.

277
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,390
And we're so excited to go into how AWS

278
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,500
has helped us really amplify that goal

279
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,580
of educating and engaging fans

280
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,690
through quantifying these plays

281
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,190
and generating these cool new stats

282
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,620
that we're gonna show off today.

283
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,990
So with that, I will hand it over to Dash

284
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,090
to talk about the program overall.

285
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,013
- Thank you, Charlie, very much.

286
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:11,550
At AWS, we're very excited to
be partnering with the NBA.

287
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,800
I think as we've gotten
into our overall objective,

288
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,380
we really see this as an
innovation partnership

289
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,580
across the organization

290
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,680
and that the NBA is really
living up to its reputation

291
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,560
as the most innovative
professional league we have here.

292
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,050
And so what we started to build out

293
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,030
is that overall partnership framework

294
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,040
and how do we start to
develop these capabilities

295
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,230
over a five-year period of the partnership

296
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,870
and how are we leveraging
core AWS services

297
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,340
and combining that with the wealth of data

298
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,530
Charlie was talking to at the NBA.

299
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,910
So how do you take those three years,

300
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,350
this third season of post data

301
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,850
and start to develop insights?

302
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,220
How are you starting to
look at 14 plus years

303
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,720
of tracking data that center of mass

304
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,490
and start to develop
pull out insights there,

305
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,470
and how do you start to do that at scale?

306
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,420
So setting the foundation
of really being able

307
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,940
to apply different services
for different outcomes

308
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,140
and where are we leading to

309
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,430
with that foundation of integration

310
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,340
of NBA's data with AWS services.

311
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,080
On top of that core foundation,

312
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,880
we're really looking to build out scale.

313
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,920
So how do we start to scale
across the organization

314
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,019
and help the NBA move
faster at higher volume

315
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:09,900
with the same kind of resource inputs?

316
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,420
And so that's really where the
basketball insights platform

317
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,360
is designed to build out
those core foundations, right?

318
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,891
And so to be able to build things once,

319
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:18,960
and then scale it across the organization.

320
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,340
So if you have an integrated pipeline

321
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,860
for pose and video
connections, synchronization,

322
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,780
you use that for advanced stats as we are,

323
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,250
but also helpful for player health

324
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,290
and looking at biomechanics
and those sorts of data.

325
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,720
So you can use it once
across the organization.

326
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,280
Or you're building distribution pipelines.

327
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,690
You're building those
ones and scaling them.

328
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,000
So really, that core
engine and that platform

329
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,490
that enables the organization
to scale at speed

330
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,159
and help these guys
start to develop rapidly

331
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,090
at an innovation pace that
we had AWS build around.

332
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,170
And then from there,

333
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,060
then we start to get into
the individual products

334
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,710
and services that we're building.

335
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,580
So you see here,

336
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,100
what we've started with so far
is what we call Play Finder,

337
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,330
which is the ability to search

338
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,580
for any play or any similar play

339
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,470
in the history of that tracking data.

340
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,158
So you can start to either just say,

341
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:02,010
"I wanna see LeBron dunks."

342
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,230
Or a fan can design a play.

343
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,350
I wanna run a horns action into elevators

344
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,880
into an open, you know, corner three.

345
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,680
How do you find that play
and how do you put that in

346
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,690
to be able to search and
pull back the most similar,

347
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,550
how do you filter that
down to your favorite team,

348
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,130
your favorite player involved,
those kind of capabilities.

349
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,666
And so those products and services

350
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,527
are gonna be a suite of capabilities

351
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:22,350
that we build out together over time

352
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,861
that add to that top layer
for more and more inputs

353
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:26,850
and engagement with fans,

354
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,180
supporting teams, supporting
the organization, et cetera.

355
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,280
And then today where we're
really investing into

356
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,170
or showing is the advanced
Stats Platform, right?

357
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,450
And what are those
additional new advanced stats

358
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,154
that we're able to develop
and leverage our AI

359
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:40,920
and machine learning services

360
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,450
to start to draw out the insights

361
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,480
and start to understand
nuances of the game

362
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,550
in a measurable way that we
haven't been able to previously.

363
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,260
And that's where we sort of, you know,

364
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,397
how do we get there and how do we start,

365
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:53,250
you know, really being able to look

366
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,410
at how do the core Stats
Platform migrate over

367
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,000
and welcome Ian up to talk through

368
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,080
how that migration happened

369
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,640
and how it's led into where we are today

370
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,050
and what we're launching with Gravity.

371
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,490
- Thanks, Dash.

372
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,600
Yeah, so we're gonna start

373
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,370
with how we migrated the platform over.

374
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,510
There was a whole conversation

375
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,270
about moving the whole NBA over yesterday.

376
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,030
But small piece of that
was the Stats Platform.

377
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,863
We'll go through that.

378
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:13,696
Then we're gonna go a little bit

379
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:15,240
through the stats ideation process

380
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,400
and we'll finish up by
looking specifically

381
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,380
at the new stat that
was released last week

382
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,670
on private video broadcast.

383
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,610
So with migrating the
advanced Stats Platform,

384
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,238
Charlie talked about it.

385
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,240
We have many different
operations within the stats team.

386
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,760
So we had to migrate our
historical data warehouse,

387
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,860
we have our live stats processing

388
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,530
and delivering those VR APIs.

389
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,480
And then we have our real-time
player tracking data,

390
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,817
which included moving
terabytes of data over to AWS,

391
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:41,700
which there were many tools available

392
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,100
to help us do that
effectively and efficiently.

393
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,870
But that also includes the live processing

394
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,160
of that player tracking data

395
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,450
and getting that out to our fans.

396
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,487
And I'm gonna go into details
more about that architecture

397
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:53,580
and how we migrated that
over on the next slide.

398
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,380
But we also have our stats alert system,

399
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,390
which is a real-time
data science application,

400
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,212
which is looking for
insights using data science

401
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,430
to look for outliers, right?

402
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,648
Career highs.

403
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:06,766
This player has scored or counted 80%

404
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:08,550
of his team's points in a quarter.

405
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,140
Or this team is going on a run, right?

406
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,150
And we're able to alert our broadcasters

407
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,040
and tell stories to our fans through that.

408
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,237
And then we have our data science tools

409
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:18,510
and our development environment
we've migrated over as well.

410
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,300
So all of this had to go
over a lot of moving pieces,

411
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,280
but there are a lot of tools in AWS

412
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,430
and great products on there
for us to migrate over to.

413
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,860
So this is a look at our real-time

414
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,572
player tracking infrastructure.

415
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:33,270
This is one of our more complicated

416
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,560
pieces of infrastructure, right?

417
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,476
We have a lot of data
stored terabyte stored in S3

418
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,700
as the background of this.

419
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,088
And then we're running a
lot of Kubernetes operations

420
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,260
and EKS that need to talk to each other

421
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,790
with low latency, right?

422
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,590
This needs to move quick.

423
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,410
From the time the data
leaves the RabbitMQ topic

424
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,640
in the arena, right?

425
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,262
This whole operation is only
adding about 50 milliseconds

426
00:14:53,262 --> 00:14:54,750
to reaching the end user

427
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,610
at the other side of the API, right?

428
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,030
So we're moving about 10
streams a game, right?

429
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,250
And this needs to scale, obviously.

430
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,050
'Cause we can have 12 concurrent games.

431
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,570
That first set of games, two
games went into overtime.

432
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,403
They're sending data

433
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:09,480
from the G League game earlier that day.

434
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,270
This system needs to scale, right?

435
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,680
It needs to scale back
down and be cost-effective

436
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,427
and needs to be reliable and fast, right?

437
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:19,984
And we've been able to do
that with EKS on AWS, right?

438
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:22,290
So we have our optimal
feed service, right?

439
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,977
That tells the shepherd spawner,

440
00:15:23,977 --> 00:15:25,830
"Hey, there's a game coming up."

441
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,637
The Shepherd Spawner
sponsor Shepherd that says,

442
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:30,330
"Hey, make sure that everything's
running for this game."

443
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,000
That Shepherd will then
spin up a number of pods

444
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,170
that we call listeners here

445
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,210
that move data from the RabbitMQ topics

446
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,610
to an internal Kafka topic.

447
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,230
We have listeners that then move that data

448
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,120
to S3 for future use.

449
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,400
We have Flink applications
that are spun up.

450
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,830
We spin up close to a hundred
Flink applications a game

451
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,438
to calculate in real-time player
speed and movement, angles

452
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:52,141
and create these building
blocks that we use

453
00:15:52,141 --> 00:15:54,150
to then create the stats

454
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,710
that you see headlining inside the game.

455
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,620
There's a lot of little
pieces that go into that

456
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,060
in this infrastructure that add up

457
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,370
to Player Gravity, for example,

458
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,890
which we're gonna talk
about a little later, right?

459
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,750
And then we have listeners
that move that data

460
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,169
to an external facing kafka topic

461
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:12,030
that feeds our API for
users to consume that data.

462
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,140
So like I said, all of this...

463
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,070
And then it's scaled.

464
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,450
You know, this should be three dimension.

465
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,190
We see we have a live
version of this, right?

466
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,450
And we have a historical version.

467
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,730
So we prioritize that
live data for live games,

468
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,760
and then a historical games or process

469
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,060
on a different node pool.

470
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,582
But everything's able to happen
within the same environment,

471
00:16:27,582 --> 00:16:29,003
within the same node pool.

472
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:31,863
So minimize the networking
costs or overhead

473
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:34,530
and get that data through
as quickly as possible

474
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,550
to the end user.

475
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,620
And we're able to do that very effectively

476
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,663
using these AWS products.

477
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,900
So how do we come up with a stat though?

478
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,980
We have that infrastructure.

479
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,660
When you wanna build something on it,

480
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,340
how do we do that, right?

481
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,290
Well, we start with a
couple of questions, right?

482
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,420
Where are the gaps in
the stats discourses?

483
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,770
What are people talking about?

484
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,569
What do we all intuitively know

485
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:56,550
about the game when we watch it,

486
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,370
but there's no way to talk
about it with numbers, right?

487
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,380
And so one thing is defensive value.

488
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,970
And we've been able to target this

489
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,230
with our Defensive Box Score.

490
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,550
We have steels and blocks,

491
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,370
which we have had for a long time, right?

492
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,050
But our Defensive Box Score has allowed us

493
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,510
to go a step deeper to
see who is guarding who

494
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,710
for what period of time

495
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,180
and what stats do they accumulate

496
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,067
during that period of time, right?

497
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:19,073
And so this is one way
that we can look deeper

498
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:22,377
and add context to that
conversation about which players

499
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:24,990
are adding defensive value to their team.

500
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,040
Offensive process.

501
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,440
Which team gets the best shots, right?

502
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,730
Not who scores the most.

503
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,563
You know that.

504
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:31,710
Just look at the score, right?

505
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,420
But which team got the best shots?

506
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,827
A team can use that to look and say,

507
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:37,710
"Well, did we have the right process?

508
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,940
Maybe we don't need to change

509
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,230
our game plan for the next game.

510
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,063
Because you know what?

511
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:41,896
We got great shots.

512
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:43,500
We just didn't hit them," right?

513
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,970
And we're able to do that

514
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,920
with our expected field
goal percentage metric

515
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,230
and shots over expected there.

516
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,510
And then another thing,
impact without scoring.

517
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,460
We all know hustle players, you know,

518
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,230
steals, rebounds, blocks, assist,

519
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,670
the guy who's everywhere on the court,

520
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,010
but maybe doesn't fill
out the statute, right?

521
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,180
How can we quantify that?

522
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,520
These are just some areas
that we're looking to explore

523
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,590
when we come up with a new stat.

524
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,300
Then we're talking to our fans,

525
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,490
our broadcast partners and teams,

526
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,890
and what are they highlighting, right?

527
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,670
In the discourse, earlier this year,

528
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,620
we heard a lot of talk
about Player Gravity,

529
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,350
which players are drawing
the defense towards them,

530
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,430
morphing the defense

531
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,590
and creating open shots
for their teammates.

532
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,630
Well, everyone notices that on the court,

533
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,510
the Giannis clip that Charlie
showed earlier, right?

534
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,800
But how do we quantify that?

535
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,090
Well, with Player Gravity,

536
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,530
which we're gonna talk about next,

537
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,270
we're able to do just that.

538
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,370
Shot Makers, our expected
field goal percentage.

539
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,830
That's shot's made above expected, right?

540
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,390
This is a way for us to quantify

541
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,060
who the best shot makers are
and have a discussion about it.

542
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,737
Add that context for
fans and not just say,

543
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:42,960
"Well he's my favorite player,

544
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,170
that's your favorite player,
who's better, right?"

545
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,150
And then lastly, as Charlie talked about,

546
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,590
we're in a very data rich environment,

547
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,300
but what data do we have available, right?

548
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,250
We have the box score
and the play by play.

549
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,230
We may need to join back to that.

550
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,880
We have player tracking data.

551
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,930
And then I talked a little bit

552
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,370
about these NBA developed stats,

553
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,480
which are the building blocks

554
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,000
towards some of these
larger headline stats.

555
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,537
One of the things underlying
our Player Gravity metric

556
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:09,960
and our Defensive Box Score
is a defensive pressure score.

557
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,880
Something that's not really talked about.

558
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,920
Go into a little bit more
detail about that later.

559
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,500
But essentially, quantifying
defensive principles.

560
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,240
Everyone's heard ball you man, right?

561
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,750
Rec basketball, stay between
your man in the basket, right?

562
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,120
We've been able to create an algorithm

563
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,710
that measures the amount of pressure

564
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,600
that each defender is putting

565
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,580
on each offensive player, right?

566
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,413
And through that,

567
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:33,000
we're able to use an
optimization algorithm

568
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,480
that maximizes total
team defensive pressure

569
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,490
to figure out which player
should be matched up

570
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,040
with which player at any
given moment in time,

571
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,650
which helps us make our
Defensive Box Scores

572
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,859
and also helps us with Player Gravity.

573
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:47,598
And the next slide,

574
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:50,250
because everyone loves
a good flow chart here,

575
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,350
it's really, how we go
through this process?

576
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,420
What do we wanna measure.

577
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,120
Do we have the data to measure it?

578
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,310
If no, can we collect the data, right?

579
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,260
If yes, we go back to
the front and start again

580
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,630
and hopefully get to the left
side of the tree this time.

581
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,670
If no, we have to wait for technology

582
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,380
to catch up sometimes, right?

583
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,090
And that's where the player
tracking data comes in.

584
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,440
In this data rich environment,

585
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,150
we do have the opportunity
to look at things

586
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,620
we've never looked at before

587
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,784
and get more to the left
side of this tree, right?

588
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:20,550
If we do have the data,
will it require a model?

589
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,383
No?

590
00:20:21,383 --> 00:20:22,466
Great.

591
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:23,299
We can start building it.

592
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:25,680
If it does, does it require labels,

593
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,850
and you guys get the rest, right?

594
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,860
But this is basically the
workflow that we go through

595
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,690
when we're coming up with our new stats,

596
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,740
trying to figure out

597
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,230
how we can build something for the fans,

598
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,510
for the broadcasters, for
our teams that's meaningful

599
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,120
and provide more context and insights

600
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
as part of the Inside the Game platform.

601
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,030
So specifically, let's
talk about Player Gravity.

602
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,770
This is this play that we watched earlier.

603
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,360
We'll it again one more time

604
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,340
and go into a little bit more detail.

605
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,070
You'll see a moment here
where Giannis drives.

606
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,050
He's gonna draw all
three of these defenders,

607
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,480
and that starts this turn.

608
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,460
Miles Turner's open.

609
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,067
Behind the back pass to (indistinct).

610
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,530
Knocks down the three, right?

611
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,690
This moment in time right here,

612
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,010
or in the traditional box score,

613
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,678
Giannis gets no credit, right?

614
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:12,060
Maybe, maybe in the new age

615
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,010
where we have some
secondary assist metrics,

616
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,960
you can quantify some of that value.

617
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,940
But really, this is what starts the churn

618
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,680
and gets the play open

619
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,990
and creates that open shot at the end.

620
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,170
But we've had no way to
quantify that until now, right?

621
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,830
And so here is some of what
we're working on under the hood

622
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,297
where as these...

623
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:31,440
The plays flipped.

624
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,540
But as Giannis is dribbling here,

625
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,160
you'll see the defensive pressure scores

626
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,130
are being calculated in real-time, right?

627
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,673
And you'll see we have actual sum DPS,

628
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,030
sum defensive pressure scores.

629
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,410
Expected some DPS.

630
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,060
Expected pressure scores, right?

631
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,100
It's a key piece of the Gravity model

632
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,060
that we have developed with AWS, right?

633
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,257
But what this allows us to do is quantify

634
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:56,610
which players are getting more
attention from the defense

635
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,820
than we would expect from
the average player, right?

636
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,580
So a little bit more on
the gravity definition,

637
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,890
but we have that actual DPS, right?

638
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,170
So we're doing pair-wise,
defensive pressure,.

639
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,145
25 defensive pressure scores,

640
00:22:09,145 --> 00:22:12,030
calculated at 60 frames
a second in real-time

641
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,150
based on player speed and
movement angles, how far they are,

642
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,160
how far they are relative to the basket,

643
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,180
other things like that

644
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,100
go into the actual
defensive pressure score,

645
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,280
where the ball is where you
are, where the basket is, right?

646
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,630
We can calculate that.

647
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,600
Or we've been calculating
that for a few years now.

648
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,100
What AWS has helped us develop

649
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,140
is an expected defensive
pressure score model,

650
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,440
which is a machine learning
model, which takes the inputs

651
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,630
of the offensive positioning and the ball

652
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,250
and tells us where we expect,

653
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,960
essentially, where we expect the defense

654
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,430
to be standing based on
where the offensive players

655
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,330
in the ball are.

656
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,650
And what this allows us to do,

657
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,990
like I said, if we take
the actual minus expected,

658
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,960
we get attention from the
defense above expected,

659
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,300
which seems like a pretty
straightforward definition

660
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,440
for Player Gravity.

661
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,330
And so we're really excited
for what this can do.

662
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,260
But a little bit more

663
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,000
about that expected pressure score model.

664
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,370
As I said, we take the defense out

665
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,782
and basically the model learns.

666
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,900
This is a similar architecture
to the coverage model

667
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,850
that was being talked about at the NFL.

668
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,991
But using factorized attention

669
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:13,184
and a transformer architecture,

670
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,912
we're able to feed the player locations

671
00:23:15,912 --> 00:23:17,820
over a two-second period,

672
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,796
as well as trajectories,
time, and score into the model

673
00:23:21,796 --> 00:23:25,230
to understand where do we
expect the defense to be

674
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,250
in this situation.

675
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,780
So if your man is pulled in,

676
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,640
you know, if that's Joel
Embiid at the high post

677
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,793
and that guy in the corner
takes a step closer,

678
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:35,464
this model is gonna pick that
up as being more attention

679
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:39,060
than otherwise would be
had at that high post area,

680
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,640
giving more Gravity to a
player like Joel Embiid.

681
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,980
So we're really excited
about this application.

682
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,111
And as you can see from
the actual leaderboard,

683
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:52,170
current leaderboards for
the season as of last week,

684
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,810
anyone who's a fan probably
expected Steph Curry

685
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,643
to be at the top.

686
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:56,610
So we know the model's working.

687
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,510
We're done, right?

688
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,873
No.

689
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,170
But what this allows us to do

690
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,120
is have intelligent conversations, right?

691
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,040
Everyone expects Steph
Curry to be at the top,

692
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,060
but maybe you're asking

693
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,460
why is Michael Porter Jr. second, right?

694
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,570
He's on a struggling team.

695
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,640
He may be one of the better
players on a struggling team,

696
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,140
and therefore the defense is able to throw

697
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,310
more attention at him.

698
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,990
And so what this allows us to do

699
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,700
with teams and fans and broadcasters

700
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,570
is have those intelligent conversations

701
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,870
about what team strategies
are being applied.

702
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,531
Maybe one team produces
more gravity in general

703
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:27,840
because they're pressuring up
more than is expected, right?

704
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,097
And we're able to quantify that now

705
00:24:29,097 --> 00:24:32,280
and we're able to see those
differences and evaluate that

706
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,080
both in real-time for our broadcast

707
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,220
and show that to our fans,

708
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,556
but also over the course of
seasons and different games

709
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:39,750
and compare those numbers.

710
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,898
So you'll see the rest
of the list though looks,

711
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,580
you know, looks pretty
good from the eye test.

712
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,080
So, like I said, really excited.

713
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,950
This was launched last week
on the Prime Video broadcast,

714
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,970
and we're excited to bring it

715
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,120
to the Inside the Game platform
online in the coming weeks.

716
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,280
But I'm gonna pass it back to Charlie

717
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,140
to talk about what's coming in the future.

718
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,730
- Thank you, Ian.

719
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,630
Before we go about it,

720
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,392
I just wanted to bring this back

721
00:25:02,392 --> 00:25:03,690
to what we talked about at the beginning

722
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,810
and think through how that data
science achievement, right,

723
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,400
of analyzing the tracking data,

724
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,890
coming up with defensive pressure score,

725
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,973
developing the ML model for actual

726
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:15,420
and expected defensive pressure score,

727
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,640
and ultimately resulting in gravity.

728
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,080
That data science effort,

729
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,590
that achievement manifests
in a lot of different things.

730
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,730
You see the leaderboard here.

731
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,320
This is a great fan engagement tool.

732
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,400
It's a new leaderboard.

733
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,324
It speaks to aspect of
defense and offensive pull

734
00:25:30,324 --> 00:25:33,090
that we've never been
able to quantify before.

735
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,890
And that's a great fan engagement tool.

736
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,570
But it's also every moment of the game,

737
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,450
it can turn into something that
we generate for highlights,

738
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,817
helping broadcasters see
a specific Gravity play

739
00:25:41,817 --> 00:25:44,940
and the color commentator speak
to it as Stan Van Gundy did

740
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,340
on the first prime video broadcast, right?

741
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,520
And so it touches so many
aspects of our business

742
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,439
and it also touches all the aspects

743
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:54,630
of that stats infrastructure.

744
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,480
And that's really why AWS
has been a great partner

745
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,070
and able to amplify our mission

746
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,020
of educating and engaging fans.

747
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,330
They've come in and helped
us with the database layer,

748
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,270
the ingestion layer, the
data science aspects,

749
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:10,650
all the parts that go into
creating this leaderboard.

750
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,640
Comes out as a leaderboard,

751
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,130
but there's so much work
along the way, right?

752
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,530
And we're so appreciative
of AWS's contributions

753
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,660
to all the steps that go into this

754
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,730
and all the other ways
that Gravity will impact

755
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,650
our fans, our broadcasters,

756
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,083
help our teams analyze
the game in a new way.

757
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,590
So what's to come, right?

758
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,490
Looking ahead, some of
our tentpole events here.

759
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,100
Rivalries Week, All-Star.

760
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,830
You've seen Defensive Box
Score, Shot Difficulty,

761
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,940
we talked about the outset,

762
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,100
the expected field goal percentage.

763
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,000
We just released Gravity here
on the Black Friday broadcast.

764
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,707
Next up is our Leverage Score.

765
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:49,904
And that's a look at
how players contribute

766
00:26:49,904 --> 00:26:51,963
to the team's chances of winning.

767
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,740
And it's not just points, it's
their rebounds, the steals,

768
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,350
getting a defensive
rebound in a clutch moment.

769
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,520
We're building a new model

770
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,800
that will measure those players' impact

771
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,553
and how each player has helped
their team win the game.

772
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,270
For All-Star, we're
targeting handle score.

773
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,000
That'll be a fun model that really speaks

774
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,440
to how players handle the ball.

775
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,430
The great crossovers, the
spin moves, behind the back,

776
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,130
and a fun metric that'll
speak to the great athletes

777
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,620
in the incredible way, what
they can do with the ball

778
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,660
and how they can move around the game.

779
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,430
And that will come out around All-Star.

780
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,727
But then let's not forget
about the WNBA too, right?

781
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:30,630
AWS is coming in.

782
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,820
We're gonna work same
stats team on our end.

783
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,490
We work with the W basketball data,

784
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,040
and we're excited for what
we can do with the WNBA.

785
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,690
And we're looking at
things around chemistry.

786
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,760
And we're honestly still
kicking around ideas,

787
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,161
but how do we speak to
the player's chemistry

788
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:45,930
and who interacts with each other

789
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,570
and how do they pass to each
other, the types of passes.

790
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,980
We're looking at rebound prediction

791
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,530
or we're looking at triple threat.

792
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,790
And we love stats that are
easy for fans to understand,

793
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,830
or we want to make the
most impact we can make

794
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,150
with the stats that we do.

795
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,880
So how do we develop stats
that are both compelling

796
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,100
from a data science standpoint, right,

797
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,530
push the industry forward
from basketball analytics,

798
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,380
help our teams, but are
ultimately approachable.

799
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,904
So that fans, no matter your
interest level in the NBA,

800
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:16,860
whether you're a novice or
you're a hardcore stat fan

801
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,430
and basketball nerd like me,
is it's something engaging,

802
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,273
something that will help you

803
00:28:22,273 --> 00:28:23,250
and something that will
teach you about the game.

804
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,360
And we try to find things

805
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,460
that are approachable at all those levels.

806
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,890
So hopefully you'll have some questions.

807
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,293
Finally, we'll end with where to watch.

808
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,420
Right here.

809
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,506
Watch right here.

810
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:35,910
We're gonna have the
happy hour in the game

811
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,710
after the next session.

812
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,642
But appreciate all our
broadcast partners, ABC, NBC,

813
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:45,642
and Prime Video, Peacock right there.

814
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,470
And hopefully to see you all
at the upcoming happy hour

815
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,740
where we can turn on
the game and learn more.

816
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,130
But with that, we would
love for some questions

817
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:56,963
from the group.

818
00:28:58,753 --> 00:28:59,813
- [Ian] Should we stand up?

819
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:02,940
- We have the mics ready in the back.

820
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,260
All right.

821
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,560
Who's gonna break the ice?

822
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,573
All right.

823
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,520
- [Audience Member] Hey.

824
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,353
Sir.

825
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,933
Hi there.

826
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:19,500
Do you think this data
is gonna make its way

827
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,210
into the next generation of video games?

828
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,910
Like, if you introduce these
concepts, you'll see that.

829
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,070
And kind of the follow up to
that is, do you think you're...

830
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,757
Are you doing any predictive
for like full game outcomes?

831
00:29:28,757 --> 00:29:31,290
Do you see a future of that?

832
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,200
- All right, starting
with a tough two-parter.

833
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,800
Certainly, you know, as the
game evolves, the video game,

834
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,781
I don't wanna speak for the folks at 2K,

835
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:42,360
but we certainly are work with them

836
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,490
and provide data to them and
help them in any way they can.

837
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,200
But ultimately, like,
they're video game experts,

838
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,130
and I'm not that.

839
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,237
But it's a good question,

840
00:29:48,237 --> 00:29:50,310
and I'm sure they're looking at all ways

841
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,170
to make the game more realistic.

842
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,150
On the predictive side, yes, we do.

843
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,980
We are the league office.

844
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,380
We don't always want to predict

845
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,090
who's winning or losing the game

846
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,199
because we are the neutral
third-party arbiters of the game.

847
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:06,060
But we do use things like
win probability models

848
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,460
under the hood to help
inform what content to serve

849
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,870
and things like that.

850
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,635
So, yeah, we absolutely do
predictive things like that.

851
00:30:12,635 --> 00:30:13,468
- [Audience Member] and
that win probability model

852
00:30:13,468 --> 00:30:14,700
is underlying the Leverage Score.

853
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,930
- Yeah, absolutely.
- So how do we find

854
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,610
those moments that have high swings,

855
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,740
potential swings in win probability

856
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,850
to be a leverage moment, so...

857
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,683
- Exactly.

858
00:30:21,683 --> 00:30:22,950
So that Leverage Score that's coming,

859
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,040
although it's not directly,
but you can often think of it

860
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,860
as how did the players' contributions

861
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,080
move their teams win probability.

862
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,913
Right?

863
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,870
And obviously your contributions
in clutch close games

864
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,920
are gonna move the win probability

865
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,790
more than the beginning of the game,

866
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,900
but that's part of basketball.

867
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,060
And which players perform
in those situations

868
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,610
and a rebound and a steel moves
win probability a lot too.

869
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,060
So while we may not surface
exactly the win probability,

870
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,610
it's a very important factor
to that Leverage Score

871
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,510
that goes into it.

872
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:52,684
Over here.

873
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,700
- [Audience Member] Quick question.

874
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,010
Do you guys track foul calls?

875
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,210
- We track foul calls, certainly.

876
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,130
I mean, we need to know when
a player gets the six fouls,

877
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,450
so they can't play anymore.

878
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,950
- [Audience Member] No, I'm saying like,

879
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,811
every time a coach or a team

880
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:10,410
or owner sends that type of
information to the league

881
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,300
and say, "Hey, this is clear cut footage

882
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,826
that this is a foul call."

883
00:31:14,826 --> 00:31:16,854
- So that's the basketball
operations department,

884
00:31:16,854 --> 00:31:18,630
not our team in terms of,

885
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,480
that's internal process between
the teams and the league.

886
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:23,308
(indistinct)

887
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:24,361
- [Audience Member] So do you ever...

888
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:27,107
Do you think you'll ever track like...

889
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:30,120
'Cause if you have sensors on the players,

890
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,120
you could technically, if
there's like pressure points,

891
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,600
you could see when they got fouled,

892
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,300
if they got fouled, right?

893
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,133
- So we don't...

894
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:43,050
29 body points per player is a lot,

895
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,180
but not necessarily enough
to know things like that

896
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,330
in terms of content and, you know?

897
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,040
But you never know what
technology is around the corner.

898
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,800
And certainly we're looking at
ways to use the data to help,

899
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,630
you know, automate officiating things

900
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,790
and improve the flow of the game

901
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,140
and things along those lines.

902
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,510
- And just to be clear,
the skeletal pose data,

903
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,490
there's no sensors on the players.

904
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,320
In the NFL, they have
sensors in the shoulder pads

905
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,636
for Next Gen Stats.

906
00:32:05,636 --> 00:32:07,410
In NBA, it's all optical tracking.

907
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,330
So it's all generated off of video

908
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,740
to build that full post data set.

909
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,987
So there's no like
actual sensors deployed.

910
00:32:12,987 --> 00:32:14,970
- [Audience Member] Okay,
and then last question,

911
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,850
do you ever think we'll
have like a robot ref.

912
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,222
- Listen, that's your limit
on controversial questions.

913
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,437
(crowd laughing)

914
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:22,270
You've already...

915
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,536
- No, Adam Silverman said hi.

916
00:32:23,536 --> 00:32:26,036
(Dash laughs)

917
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,253
- [Brian] Yeah.

918
00:32:28,253 --> 00:32:30,540
Hi, Brian Jackson with
Info-Tech Research Group.

919
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,660
I know that NBA teams have
their own analytics departments

920
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,490
that might be trying to suss out

921
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,170
some of these more advanced metrics

922
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,570
even before the NBA would, right?

923
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,249
So do you feel that, like, by releasing

924
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:43,725
these advanced metrics,

925
00:32:43,725 --> 00:32:45,420
that maybe you're sort of democratizing

926
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,850
that intelligence across the league?

927
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,940
- Certainly anything we
build, our team builds,

928
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,040
we are gonna share with all of our teams,

929
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,900
NBA, WNBA, et cetera.

930
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,190
We wanna make sure they have access

931
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,840
and that they can do what
they wanna do with it,

932
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,910
and then what teams do

933
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,210
and their competitive
advantage is up to them.

934
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,010
But we definitely talk to our teams

935
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,120
and what would be helpful to them

936
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,610
and what would be meaningful
and help their workflows

937
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,440
not just from a data science standpoint,

938
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,851
from a data delivery and
a logistics standpoint

939
00:33:12,851 --> 00:33:14,250
and cloud infrastructure

940
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,080
and how do we get the data to them easier

941
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,300
with less state engineering
and less ETL process.

942
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,340
So, we're in touch with teams all the time

943
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,151
and absolutely wanna help
them run more efficiently

944
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:26,193
and get the insights they
need to run their business.

945
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,180
- [Sam] Hi, I'm Sam Meyer from BMS.

946
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,470
Thank you for this.

947
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,490
I have two questions.

948
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,453
The first one is,

949
00:33:37,775 --> 00:33:41,610
how do you account for the
propensity of the defense

950
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,670
to help or not when it
comes to the gravity score?

951
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,503
I'm curious about that.

952
00:33:45,503 --> 00:33:47,730
And then also, are you
thinking about anything

953
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,520
that's sort of the inverse of
the gravity score for defense

954
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,800
or like a wimpy factor, if you will?

955
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,270
- You can take that.
- That's a funny one.

956
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,440
Someone did bring that up to me.

957
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,426
It's a little bit more
difficult to tease out on...

958
00:33:58,426 --> 00:34:00,450
I'm taking the second question first.

959
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,860
A little bit more difficult to tease out

960
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,683
because you'd have to figure out what,

961
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,990
you know, you have to give the information

962
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,580
about where the defense is, right?

963
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,550
And once you do that,
the game's kind of up.

964
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,630
You know where they are,

965
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,443
not where they would otherwise be, right?

966
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,570
It's a tricky question.

967
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,403
It's been brought up.

968
00:34:19,403 --> 00:34:21,637
We're thinking about it, for sure.

969
00:34:21,637 --> 00:34:25,560
Like, which players on defense
push the offensive way.

970
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,741
Like, they don't want to
come near Wembanyama, right?

971
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:29,691
It's definitely on our minds,

972
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:31,560
but how to solve that problem

973
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,864
is something we're still thinking
through and talking about.

974
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,119
And then your first question is,

975
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,396
by using a season's worth of data, right?

976
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:40,950
We downsample a little bit.

977
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,954
We're doing 10 frames a second here.

978
00:34:43,954 --> 00:34:46,380
We account for, hopefully,

979
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,970
all of those different moments in time.

980
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:52,080
The model takes in two
seconds worth of input data

981
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,880
and we're deploying it
with at least, you know,

982
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,830
we can have 25% of that massed out.

983
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,300
So within half a second

984
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,800
of the players coming over half court,

985
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,898
we're calculating that gravity metric

986
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:06,770
or running that expected
defensive pressure score model,

987
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,570
you know, at 10 frames a second.

988
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:12,060
And so we hope by training the
model over a season of data,

989
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,900
we find those situations
where help versus no help.

990
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,400
All teams do it differently, right?

991
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,490
Where's the average defender
on this play, right?

992
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,002
And that's how we can tell
that over help situation

993
00:35:23,002 --> 00:35:25,590
is when that player really steps over

994
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,600
and increases that defensive pressure

995
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,910
on that player above the expectation.

996
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,680
So it's really just a
volume question, I think,

997
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,510
to kind of tease out that help situation.

998
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,550
If that's a strategy to take it away,

999
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,600
we wanna understand that.

1000
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,890
Because if you're deploying your help,

1001
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,420
you're leaving someone else open, right?

1002
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,060
And that's a high gravity
moment that we want to capture

1003
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,260
and may hopefully leads

1004
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,480
to a high expected field
goal percentage shot, right?

1005
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,010
And we can tie all these things together

1006
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,240
and tell really great stories

1007
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,810
about how teams are creating
value on the offensive end.

1008
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,465
- Yeah, if you look at the play we showed

1009
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:57,000
when Clarkson comes over as
a third defender on Giannis,

1010
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,160
you can see the gravity score
is going up significantly.

1011
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,970
So we're using all of those
25 pair ways DPS scores

1012
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,140
from all the defenders

1013
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,910
to each of their offensive
players throughout,

1014
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,440
and, yeah, the secondary defender,

1015
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,490
the third defender comes over,

1016
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,890
has a big impact on gravity.

1017
00:36:11,696 --> 00:36:12,900
- [Audience Member] Hi.

1018
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,220
Not to turn this into an engineering talk,

1019
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,630
but, like, can you give
us a quick overview

1020
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,240
of not just the model
you're using, but also-

1021
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,350
- That corner.

1022
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,390
- [Audience Member] Also,
how are you guys serving

1023
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,260
a model fast enough

1024
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,120
for like a real-time
prediction during a game?

1025
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,960
- Sorry, start again.

1026
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,793
I was lost.

1027
00:36:25,793 --> 00:36:26,880
I couldn't find you.

1028
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,380
- [Audience Member] Yeah, no worries.

1029
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,152
Without going into much (indistinct),

1030
00:36:30,152 --> 00:36:31,792
can you give us kind of a quick overview

1031
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,912
of how the machine learning
model actually works,

1032
00:36:33,912 --> 00:36:34,860
and then how are you
serving it fast enough

1033
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,680
to give real-time
predictions during a game?

1034
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,880
- Yep.

1035
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,170
Take it again.
(Ian laughs)

1036
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,880
- So like I said,

1037
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,860
we are using an inference server

1038
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,630
located in the same node pool, right,

1039
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,980
that we're sending these crews to

1040
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,060
or make sure we're scaled

1041
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,100
and that those are equipped
with the right machine sizes

1042
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,933
to handle the load

1043
00:36:50,933 --> 00:36:52,560
of the concurrent games that are going on.

1044
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,090
So we're sending those queries.

1045
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:57,840
We're also, you know,
using a dynamic batching

1046
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,010
on those inference servers

1047
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,230
to basically take any
queries that come in within,

1048
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,690
let's say, a few
milliseconds of each other

1049
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,970
to batch those together and run
inference on the same thing.

1050
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,541
So when we have 10
concurrent games going on,

1051
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:11,580
we can actually do
inference more efficiently

1052
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,200
with those servers, right?

1053
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,033
That's how we're doing it.

1054
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:15,360
As far as the details of the model,

1055
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,490
we've tried a couple of
different architectures,

1056
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,239
and I'm going to have to
defer to the data scientists.

1057
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,744
But based on, other than
what I talked about,

1058
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:28,744
we did try some simple
CatBoost XGBoost out options,

1059
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,824
but we found, over time, that
with factorized attention

1060
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:36,824
at the transformer architecture
where we're able to,

1061
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,780
the model is able to
learn the relationships

1062
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,820
between players in space and time

1063
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,180
over the course of that two-second
window that we're feeding

1064
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,680
was the most accurate overall.

1065
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,920
And so that's where we decided
to go with that architecture.

1066
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,140
- Next year, Dash, 500 level.

1067
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,973
- Absolutely.
- You gotta do it.

1068
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:55,795
- How we're getting to
subsecond latency bit by bit.

1069
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:56,970
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1070
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,128
- Absolutely.

1071
00:37:58,128 --> 00:37:59,580
- And maybe they could move
the tire changing closer.

1072
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,110
- Yes.
- Yeah, that'd be next year.

1073
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,550
- Yeah, the only other
thing I'd highlight too

1074
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,630
is we're really excited to see

1075
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,130
what each of the broadcast partners do

1076
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,630
with that live data, right?

1077
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,090
So, Gravity will be
available in sub-second,

1078
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,180
and you start to see some
of the stuff Ian showed

1079
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,080
in the graphics,

1080
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,210
but how do you overlay that
in real-time on the video

1081
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,210
and see how does that
third defender come over

1082
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,880
Spike Gianni's gravity, for example.

1083
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,240
Do they show that as a number?

1084
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,650
Do they show that as a size of a bar?

1085
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,570
I think, you know, working
with their graphics teams,

1086
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,100
we're really excited to see where they go

1087
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,710
and how they start to show
that to fans in live games.

1088
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,960
- Yeah, and that's an interesting
point on the, you know,

1089
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,930
sub-second latency, looking
to achieve that through moving

1090
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,729
that actual defensive pressure score

1091
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:38,850
from a calculation of different
sub-scores to a model.

1092
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,910
By including the defense
back into the model, right,

1093
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,500
and including that additional data point,

1094
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,020
we're actually able to
predict more accurately

1095
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,570
the actual defensive
pressure score in the moment.

1096
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:52,320
And then by using
inference on the raw data,

1097
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,240
as opposed to calculating features,

1098
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,580
we'll be able to serve up
gravity as subsecond latency.

1099
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,870
So it's been a really interesting

1100
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,880
to see how the model reacts differently

1101
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,968
when you include the
defense versus you don't

1102
00:39:01,968 --> 00:39:03,741
in similar architectures in it,

1103
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:07,398
how the different approaches are better

1104
00:39:07,398 --> 00:39:08,760
for the different models.

1105
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,380
But that's what we're moving towards

1106
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,243
for the subsecond latency gravity.

1107
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,067
- [Audience Member] Hello.

1108
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:18,480
Thank you, again, for having us.

1109
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,500
Nice shoes.

1110
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,110
I could listen to you talk
about NBA stats all day,

1111
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,420
and you have a great broadcasting voice.

1112
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,420
My question is, is this data
gonna be available for fans

1113
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,640
in order, like, through
an API or something

1114
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,260
in order to empower them

1115
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,617
to maybe create their own advanced metrics

1116
00:39:37,617 --> 00:39:41,340
or develop stats later on?

1117
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,670
- Thank you for the compliments.

1118
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,803
Appreciate it.

1119
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,360
Certainly, it'll be available
through our products, right?

1120
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,650
And putting the leaderboards on.

1121
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:53,580
But the raw data, we're
looking at potentially ways

1122
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,340
of doing that through,
you know, hackathons

1123
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,863
and things like that,
but nothing formal yet.

1124
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,470
But appreciate that there's interest

1125
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,510
- You can go today to nba.com

1126
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,890
and see all of the shots taken

1127
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,470
and get the expected field
goal shot for both teams.

1128
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,990
You can see how they shot
overexpected, underexpected,

1129
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,130
the actual field goal percentage

1130
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,990
versus their expected
field goal percentage.

1131
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,490
So all of that data is now available

1132
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,403
on the NBA's digital sites
to be able to look at.

1133
00:40:19,631 --> 00:40:21,027
- [Audience Member] I was
really trying to find out

1134
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:23,820
the 29 skeletal points 60 times a second.

1135
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,880
That would be amazing
if we could get that.

1136
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,355
- We appreciate the interest.

1137
00:40:28,355 --> 00:40:30,214
Again, back to the 500 talk.

1138
00:40:30,214 --> 00:40:31,587
Back for the (indistinct).

1139
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,260
- And spinning up your own cluster

1140
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,900
to manage all the storage and...

1141
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,270
- [Audience Member] Going
back to the data points

1142
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,350
that are in the model,

1143
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,680
like the defensive data
points, are those the,

1144
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,090
like depending on the actual player...

1145
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:45,923
Like, the defensive...

1146
00:40:45,923 --> 00:40:49,170
Like, who the player is or
just that they're a defender?

1147
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,033
- No, so the data points in the model,

1148
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:53,423
like, if you're talking about calculating

1149
00:40:53,423 --> 00:40:56,075
actual defensive pressure scores, right,

1150
00:40:56,075 --> 00:40:58,140
all of that is player agnostic.

1151
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,410
So it's more based on the
2D locations of the players.

1152
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,500
We have goals and aspirations
to actually improve that

1153
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,000
using player orientation

1154
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,470
and where they're looking over time.

1155
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:10,020
Right now that we have this
3D player tracking data,

1156
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,390
you don't necessarily
need to use all 29 points,

1157
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,070
but it's really cool to be able to see

1158
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,690
the hip orientation of the players,

1159
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,940
which way they're facing.

1160
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,663
So what's going into that actual
defensive pressure is all,

1161
00:41:20,663 --> 00:41:23,160
this is all player agnostic
on the model front,

1162
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,930
and that's what allows us to calculate

1163
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,831
that actual over expected

1164
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:29,850
'cause we just basically
assume every player is the same

1165
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,770
with the model, right,
and the calculation,

1166
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,960
and then we see specifically which players

1167
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,310
are drawing that attention.

1168
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,780
- [Audience Member] Did
you also make that decision

1169
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,840
because you didn't want to have
to, like, retrain the model

1170
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,610
each year as, like, new players came in?

1171
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,841
Or I guess, also, are you expecting

1172
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:45,600
to have to, like, retrain the model

1173
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,460
based on any changes to rules

1174
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,110
or anything, like, year over year?

1175
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:49,943
- Yeah.

1176
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:51,000
Something that we're discussing

1177
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,710
is how to best service year over year

1178
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,450
because there's changes in strategy.

1179
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,880
One thing we've noticed with
the defensive pressure score,

1180
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,150
or, sorry, with the expected
defensive pressure score models

1181
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,240
is that gravity is higher this
year compared to last year.

1182
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,010
And that's, if you've heard the discourse

1183
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,380
that teams are pressuring up more, right?

1184
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:11,430
So directionally, gravity is
still a very powerful metric.

1185
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,600
But compared to last year,

1186
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,550
you're gonna see different
magnitudes of gravity

1187
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,980
because defensive are
taking a different strategy.

1188
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,356
And funny enough, two years ago, you know,

1189
00:42:19,356 --> 00:42:21,750
we saw higher gravity's there as well.

1190
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,250
So for whatever reason last year,

1191
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,990
and, you know, this is the discourse

1192
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,413
we love to have and love to
understand the game better.

1193
00:42:27,413 --> 00:42:31,404
This year, that strategy pushed
everyone's pressuring more

1194
00:42:31,404 --> 00:42:32,850
leads to higher gravities.

1195
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,080
Now, like I said.

1196
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,210
Ordinarily, the
leaderboards and everything

1197
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,380
still makes sense,

1198
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,188
but we have had conversations
about when do we retrain,

1199
00:42:40,188 --> 00:42:43,500
when has strategy trained
enough that we need to retrain

1200
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,500
to better serve, you know, or
to understand the game, right?

1201
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,530
- Cool, thank you.
- Yeah.

1202
00:42:51,867 --> 00:42:52,825
- [Ben] Hello.

1203
00:42:52,825 --> 00:42:53,783
Hi, Ben Shalel.

1204
00:42:53,783 --> 00:42:54,616
Thank you.

1205
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:55,500
This is fantastic.

1206
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,520
I love this.

1207
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,190
I was wondering if you
do any audio tracking

1208
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,163
and if maybe there was an opportunity

1209
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:03,093
to do like a smack talk leaderboard.

1210
00:43:03,093 --> 00:43:04,920
I know that's big on the court.

1211
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,360
I think people would love that.

1212
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,753
So I was wondering if you
thought about that at all.

1213
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,580
- It would be interesting.

1214
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,050
I'll say, yes, we've thought about it,

1215
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,330
but I don't think that
would be forthcoming.

1216
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,467
But-

1217
00:43:19,467 --> 00:43:20,300
- Not the first person

1218
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,127
suggests tracking what is said

1219
00:43:22,127 --> 00:43:24,930
and trying to translate
it to data in some way.

1220
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:28,298
But, you know, a lot of
hurdles there and, you know?

1221
00:43:28,298 --> 00:43:30,270
- [Audience Member] From
a technical perspective,

1222
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,103
there's an ability to do it

1223
00:43:31,103 --> 00:43:33,840
and to be able to separate
out different sounds.

1224
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,890
Do you want background noise?

1225
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,030
Do you want background noise

1226
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,560
using some of the speech to speech models

1227
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,790
and those sorts of things.

1228
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,860
The ability to actually
hear what the players say,

1229
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,720
I think the players' association

1230
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,950
would have a lot to say about that

1231
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,870
before it ever comes
out publicly, for sure.

1232
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,910
- And they might change
what they're saying

1233
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,590
if they knew they were all being mic'd up.

1234
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,840
So then you're, you know?

1235
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,380
- [Audience Member] As I
work in high school sports,

1236
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,570
I'm curious how important
the video equipment itself is

1237
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:01,110
in kind of grabbing some of these 29 poses

1238
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,640
and everything like that of like,

1239
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,590
could I do this with a
single camera in a gym?

1240
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:05,550
How close could I get?

1241
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,730
Or is the video equipment
really helping out?

1242
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,830
- Really, it's a question for Hawkeye,

1243
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:13,320
our vendor who builds the
player tracking system.

1244
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,123
Our team takes that raw
29 points per player

1245
00:44:17,123 --> 00:44:18,780
and works with that data,

1246
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,430
but we don't necessarily
do the computer vision.

1247
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,110
That's our vendor.

1248
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,620
However, you know, from a
computer vision background,

1249
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,630
again, back when I used
to operate at 500 level,

1250
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,560
like, it would,

1251
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,390
the technology's improved a lot

1252
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:32,703
and there's a lot you
can do with one camera.

1253
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,249
But whether you would
get 50% or 70% or 80%

1254
00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:40,804
of what we have with 20
cameras and 60 frames a second,

1255
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:42,030
I'm not sure.

1256
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,710
But, you know, it is impressive

1257
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,307
what some companies are
doing with one camera

1258
00:44:46,307 --> 00:44:48,720
in a more amateur high school setting.

1259
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,280
Yeah, it's definitely coming.

1260
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,228
- And I think the problem
you run into with one camera

1261
00:44:52,228 --> 00:44:53,730
is just occlusion, right?

1262
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,040
It's one thing that we
deal with on the NBA side,

1263
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,765
is that where, you know...

1264
00:44:57,765 --> 00:45:00,405
Before this season, we were looking at,

1265
00:45:00,405 --> 00:45:04,917
you know, fixed length
joints for joint positions

1266
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:07,410
that were high occlusion zones, right?

1267
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,240
The hip joints and the finger joints,

1268
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,580
it's hard to determine where
they are in space sometimes.

1269
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,411
But our vendor was able to
improve that with the upgrades

1270
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,470
and the number of cameras they have

1271
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,090
to be able to go to variable lengths.

1272
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,190
But that's really the problem
you're probably gonna run into

1273
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,440
with a single camera, is
once that player runs...

1274
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,140
Once I stand behind Charlie,
you can't get any of mine.

1275
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,160
You're just guessing, right?

1276
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,240
So...

1277
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,100
- In a former life, I
did a master's thesis

1278
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,090
on tracking the basketball

1279
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,950
in the high school team I was coaching,

1280
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,720
and then I quickly realized
there was a vendor doing it

1281
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,627
way better than I would
ever do it by myself.

1282
00:45:35,627 --> 00:45:37,320
So while it got me the master's,

1283
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,003
that was the end of that project.

1284
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,190
- I would, I would say
that is the goal, though,

1285
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,023
over time, right?

1286
00:45:42,023 --> 00:45:43,380
As you see this technology...

1287
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,660
You know, years ago, you'd
have to have 100 cameras

1288
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,530
around a football field

1289
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,670
to start to get some of this data,

1290
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,400
then it goes down to 40, now in the teens.

1291
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,690
So I think there's certainly, you know,

1292
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,880
the pace of innovation is
such that getting to a point

1293
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,680
where you can do it with
three cameras, then two,

1294
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,327
and then hopefully ultimately
with one is certainly,

1295
00:45:58,327 --> 00:46:00,720
you know, I think a industry goal.

1296
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,960
Whether, you know, who gets
there, how quickly that happens,

1297
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,980
we'll be watching and seeing,

1298
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,630
but it's certainly where
that evolution is happening.

1299
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,820
- [Chandra] Hi, Chandra
from Nielsen Sports,

1300
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,560
partner with NBA.

1301
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,650
So the audio tracking, we
do track brands on audio.

1302
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:21,033
So probably you can partner
with us to catch that.

1303
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:24,240
I had a question on the APIs.

1304
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,772
We are partners, so do partners get access

1305
00:46:26,772 --> 00:46:28,980
to the data through APIs?

1306
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,813
Would you know?

1307
00:46:29,813 --> 00:46:31,950
- Did you say NESN, the broadcast?

1308
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,570
- Nielsen, Nielsen.
- Oh, Nielsen.

1309
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,289
I'm sorry, Nielsen.
- Yeah.

1310
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:37,140
- Happy to meet you after.

1311
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,820
We can talk about it, sure.

1312
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,070
I'm not the partnership person
to all the ins and outs,

1313
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,420
but happy to talk with you about it.

1314
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,823
- [Chandra] Perfect, thank you.

1315
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,890
- [Audience Member] So
we've been hearing a lot

1316
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:47,940
about agentic.

1317
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,880
I love my NBA podcasts,
but sometimes, you know,

1318
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,440
you don't know who's doing their research.

1319
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,200
And when I go to nbastats.com,

1320
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,690
it can be kind of overwhelming
to, like, see all the stats.

1321
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,659
So have you thought about,
like, a chatbot agent

1322
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:01,500
who really understands the stats,

1323
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,860
so I can ask it detailed questions like,

1324
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,110
why do the Clippers stink this year

1325
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,750
or why are the Celtics
turning around lately,

1326
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:10,800
those sort of things.

1327
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,520
- Gonna pass the mic to the
people in the back corner.

1328
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,390
Stay tuned.

1329
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:16,615
Good question.

1330
00:47:16,615 --> 00:47:19,408
I'm not allowed to tip
anything, but good question.

1331
00:47:19,408 --> 00:47:20,643
You're onto something.

1332
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,053
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

1333
00:47:25,474 --> 00:47:28,361
Can you apply this data
to historical footage?

1334
00:47:28,361 --> 00:47:31,770
Kind of going back to
the question from before,

1335
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:35,790
you know, who has a better
gravity score, Michael or LeBron?

1336
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,357
Like, you know, those sorts of comparisons

1337
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:40,276
would be interesting to see.

1338
00:47:40,276 --> 00:47:41,850
- It's something we'd love to do,

1339
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,170
and certainly something we looked at.

1340
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,540
It's not quite there yet
from a technology standpoint,

1341
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,990
but, you know, that'd be a
incredible world to live in.

1342
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,700
- Well, not that far historically, right?

1343
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,720
But one of the things is,

1344
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,370
and the reason we've decided to build

1345
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,720
these metrics the way that we have

1346
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,470
and focusing on some of
these metrics on the 2D,

1347
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:59,865
like Gravity is built

1348
00:47:59,865 --> 00:48:04,140
using the 2D tracking data mostly, right?

1349
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,160
Or completely.

1350
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,180
And that is to be able to
backfill it to the seasons,

1351
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,160
all of the seasons for
which we have tracking.

1352
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,590
But we do not have the
broadcast tracking back

1353
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,210
to the Jordan era, unfortunately.

1354
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,530
That's, you know...
- Yeah.

1355
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,460
That grainy footage.

1356
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,560
- Yeah, exactly.
- That be tough.

1357
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,000
Thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

1358
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,912
- It'd be great to see what Gravity was

1359
00:48:22,912 --> 00:48:23,745
in the hand checking era

1360
00:48:23,745 --> 00:48:24,870
and not need to send a double because-

1361
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:28,590
- Going back to how many models
(indistinct) for each era.

1362
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:29,430
Yeah.
- Yeah.

1363
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:31,170
No three point lines are incredible.

1364
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,460
- [Audience Member] Hey,
guys, I was just wondering,

1365
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,860
do you guys track any, like,
clutch metrics or like-

1366
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,360
- Sorry, can you put the
mic up a little higher?

1367
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,470
- Oh, sorry about that.
- There you go.

1368
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,438
- [Audience Member] I was
wondering, do you guys track

1369
00:48:39,438 --> 00:48:40,920
any, like, clutch metrics,

1370
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,840
you know, things that really
turn the tide of a game?

1371
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,260
For example, like, Ray Allen's
three or "blocked by James."

1372
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,817
Do you guys have any of those scores

1373
00:48:47,817 --> 00:48:49,830
assigned to each player?

1374
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:51,750
- So, we will with the Leverage Score.

1375
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,752
I think you're going to enjoy
what comes out here soon

1376
00:48:53,752 --> 00:48:55,440
with the Leverage Score.

1377
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,030
But you can go on nba.com right now

1378
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,530
and add our clutch filter,

1379
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,960
which looks at the last
five minutes of games

1380
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,120
when there's a five-point or
less deficit between teams.

1381
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,890
And we've had that
standard for a long time

1382
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:06,720
and look at how players have performed

1383
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,610
when those clutch
situations are happening.

1384
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:09,510
That's available right now,

1385
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:13,393
but the Leverage Score will
enhance that in an exciting way

1386
00:49:13,393 --> 00:49:15,900
that I think will be right
in line with your question.

1387
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,950
- Awesome, thank you.

1388
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,473
- Okay.

1389
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,460
- Good?
- Going once, going twice?

1390
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:27,673
- Oh, wait.

1391
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:28,506
One more.

1392
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:34,827
- [Audience Member] Sorry.

1393
00:49:34,827 --> 00:49:35,730
Just one more question
since nobody else had one.

1394
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:36,563
- Yeah.

1395
00:49:36,563 --> 00:49:38,847
- [Audience Member] I
didn't see on your roadmap

1396
00:49:38,847 --> 00:49:39,780
anything about the GOAT score.

1397
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,380
When is that coming out?
(group laughing)

1398
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,090
- We need the tracking
data back further, right?

1399
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:45,963
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1400
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:49,920
- Perfect.
- Oh.

1401
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,170
Is there one right there?

1402
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,927
- [Speaker] One more.

1403
00:49:54,927 --> 00:49:56,269
One more.

1404
00:49:56,269 --> 00:49:57,300
- [Audience Member] Hi.

1405
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,410
I was wondering for,

1406
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,960
when you release a new stat like gravity,

1407
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,583
how do you measure like
the success of a stat?

1408
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,543
Like, how much people
are engaging with it?

1409
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,370
Yeah.

1410
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:10,320
- It's a great question
that we struggle with

1411
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,070
as the product management hat
of our team in a lot of ways.

1412
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,270
The...

1413
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:16,890
We talked about the North Star, which is,

1414
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,540
How do we educate and engage fans.

1415
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,270
But if you actually go
kind of page by page

1416
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:23,280
to the app or the site,
stats are everywhere.

1417
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,190
Our team does the scores,
the standings, the schedule,

1418
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,340
and their components of lots
of different parts of the page.

1419
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,440
And it's hard to assign an ROI

1420
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,130
to any specific change we
make to the presentation

1421
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,440
or one new stat in a box score.

1422
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,240
It's hard to say how that stat impacted

1423
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,830
the overall experience
and drew a page views

1424
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,665
or any of the classic sort of
product management benchmarks

1425
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,510
that you might look at.

1426
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,347
And that's why we've adopted this idea of,

1427
00:50:47,347 --> 00:50:49,650
"All right, well, if we're
helping the discourse

1428
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:51,654
and moving the basketball
analytics industry forward,

1429
00:50:51,654 --> 00:50:54,060
and ultimately that phrase
that we keep saying,

1430
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,950
educating and engaging fans,

1431
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:59,520
that's leading to good ROI
and good business outcomes.

1432
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,520
And if broadcasters are wanting
it and teams are using it

1433
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,793
and, you know, it becomes
part of basketball,

1434
00:51:04,793 --> 00:51:07,830
and that's a home run success for us.

1435
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:08,663
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

1436
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:10,140
- To plug our friends at Prime Video,

1437
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,300
you can go across the
way to One Amazon Lane

1438
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,280
where Prime Video was...

1439
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,500
Right now they've got
NASCAR from this summer

1440
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,520
and Thursday Night Football,

1441
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,930
but they'll go very much into it with you

1442
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:21,510
about how they see these
new advanced stats programs

1443
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,340
driving viewership, engagement,

1444
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,650
how much the producing teams
are putting them on screen.

1445
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,210
So we're really excited to drive that

1446
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,230
with each of these partners here

1447
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:29,790
around how much these advance stats

1448
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:31,920
are actually going on screen being used

1449
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,240
or becoming a part of the dialogue.

1450
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,500
I think all of those metrics are things

1451
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,540
we'll start to look to
track both internally,

1452
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,390
and then with the broadcast partners.

1453
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,590
- All right.

1454
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:47,423
- All right.
- All right.

1455
00:51:47,423 --> 00:51:48,330
- Thank you.
- Thanks, everyone.

1456
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:51,627
- Thank you, this was great.
(crowd applauding)

1457
00:51:51,627 --> 00:51:56,627
Good work.
(Dash faintly speaking)
