1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,463
- [Girish] Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,463 --> 00:00:04,620
My name is Girish, I'm a
senior solutions architect.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,990
Along with me is my PSA Justin

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,620
and the two of us help AWS
customers move all the way

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,093
from ideation to production
with a special focus on AI ML.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,240
Over the next 60 minutes, we are going

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,480
to learn a few things.
We'll kick things off here

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,520
by understanding four key concepts

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,910
that we are going to leverage
to build this agent factory.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,490
From there, we'll move
to a coding terminal

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,220
and start creating some business agents

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,280
and then we'll interact with
the agent factory itself

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,740
to create some agents, multi-agent systems

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,130
on the fly for you. I want
you all to think about

15
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,500
one business agent that might be valuable

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,290
for your organizations. We are
going to take some requests

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,650
and try to create those
agents on demand here as well.

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,470
If you have any questions,
please raise your hand.

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,140
We'll try to take as many
questions as possible,

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,460
but given the time constraints,

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,320
if we aren't able to get to you,

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,360
we are absolutely going to stay back here

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,000
to address all your questions.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,580
We are also going to be
sharing the code base with you.

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,680
So to get the most out of the session,

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,340
I recommend just thinking
about the why behind things

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,660
and you can clone the code

28
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,260
and you can try things yourself
at a later time as well.

29
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,453
So with that, let's get going here.

30
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,480
So our agent factory is going to have

31
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,880
what we call a builder agent.

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,090
What the builder agent does,

33
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,630
it'll take a request from a user

34
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,060
and then create either a single agent

35
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,703
or a multi-agent system on demand.

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,930
But what really is an AI
agent, I spoke to a few

37
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,910
of them here and still
there's some confusion

38
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,030
about AI agents, right? Everyone
has their own definition.

39
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,130
I think the simplest one that I've heard

40
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,480
is an agent runs a loop with a model

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,110
and with a set of tools
to take certain actions

42
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,930
to achieve a particular goal.

43
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,500
And to build these agents
require a framework.

44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,700
In this case, we are going

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,760
to leverage the open source Strands SDK,

46
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,380
for three key reasons.

47
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,490
One, Strands makes it really
simple for us to create agents

48
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,350
with just a few lines of code

49
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,980
because it depends on the
intelligence of the frontier model

50
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,140
to create the code for us.

51
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,810
So instead of writing rigid logic trees,

52
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,550
it will do that work for us

53
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,533
and we tell it what agents to create.

54
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,570
Two, Strands comes with
its native set of tools.

55
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,510
So the most common tools
that an agent might require,

56
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,550
those are already built for you.

57
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,160
So we can directly start
tapping into those tools,

58
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,890
but it also makes it really simple for us

59
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,513
to create custom tools.

60
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,080
And three, Strands has
native support for some

61
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,802
of these immersion protocols.
So think of MCP and A2A

62
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:48,690
and our agent factor is going to use

63
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,893
those protocols as well.

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,250
But what really is MCP or
model context protocol?

65
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,030
So for our agent to
talk to different tools

66
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,740
and different data sources,

67
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,070
there needs to be a common
language between them

68
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,440
and that is exactly what MCP provides.

69
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,060
You can almost think of MCP
as a universal translator

70
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,390
where it provides a common
language for agents,

71
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,560
for tools and for data
sources to connect together

72
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,273
and work on things together.

73
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,050
But what if our agent factory
receives a request when it

74
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,840
needs to create a multi-agent system

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,480
where multiple agents
are talking to each other

76
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,650
and working together to
achieve a higher level goal?

77
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,230
And for that, we are going
to leverage what is known

78
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,280
as A2A or Agent2Agent
communication protocol.

79
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,680
A2A will provide us
three different things.

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,680
One, it allows an agent to
discover other agents around it.

81
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,970
Two, it allows an agent
to know the capabilities

82
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,960
of the agents around it so
it knows which agent to ask

83
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,650
for help whenever it's trying
to achieve a particular goal.

84
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,640
And three, it gives us a
common language for agents

85
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,210
to talk to other agents.
So despite of the models

86
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,880
or frameworks that different agents use,

87
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,760
there's a common language
in between that they can use

88
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,310
to communicate with each other.

89
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,700
Okay. So until now we
have learned three things.

90
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,390
One, our agent factory
will use the Strands SDK

91
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,960
to build agents. Two, it'll use MCP

92
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,750
for those agents to
connect to different tools

93
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,970
and to connect to different data sources.

94
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,440
And three, our agents will
use A2A to connect and talk

95
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,770
to other agents for more complex goals.

96
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,140
But how can we take our agent factory

97
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,400
from a prototyping environment
all the way to production?

98
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,700
And for that, we are going
to tap into AgentCore,

99
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,160
which is a purpose built service

100
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,720
for running agent systems
at scale, securely

101
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,900
and in an operationally efficient manner.

102
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,480
It provides us with a
set of modular services

103
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,320
that we can pick and choose
from based on the requirements

104
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,480
of a particular agent.

105
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,880
And this might really
look like a busy slide,

106
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,220
but let's think this
through together, right?

107
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,610
Whenever our agent factory
receives a request,

108
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,380
it needs to deploy those agents

109
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,480
and run those agents somewhere.

110
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,780
So what does the agent
factory need for that?

111
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,290
One, it needs a place
where it can run the agents

112
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,320
in a secure environment,
ideally serverless,

113
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,170
we don't want to manage the
infrastructure ourselves,

114
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,670
but there could be situations

115
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,620
where an agent needs like three minutes

116
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,330
to complete a particular task.

117
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,880
But there could be like long
running agents which require

118
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,100
like five hours to run, right?

119
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,170
And so this serverless
runtime should support

120
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,920
like small term tasks as
well as long term tasks.

121
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,290
And that is exactly what
the AgentCore Runtime

122
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,070
will provide us. But once we move things

123
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,550
from a prototyping
environment to production,

124
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,700
like security will become
even more important.

125
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,250
And for that we are going
to tap into what we call

126
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,870
as the identity feature,

127
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,430
which will do a couple of things for us.

128
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,940
One, it'll ensure that only
the users who are supposed

129
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,770
to have access to our agents,

130
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,350
only those users can access the agents.

131
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,650
And two, the agents
themselves can only access

132
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,480
the tools that they're supposed to,

133
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,693
can only access other agents
that they are supposed to.

134
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:28,560
All agents are only going to be as smart

135
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,600
as the things they can remember.

136
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
And for that we are going
to use the short-term memory

137
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,143
and long-term memory provided
by AgentCore memory feature.

138
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,670
For some agents which require
to write their own code

139
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,670
to execute that code as well,
we are going to leverage

140
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,010
the AgentCore code interpreter feature

141
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,480
and there might be some agents which

142
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,920
need to browse the internet,

143
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,440
go on the internet, fill web forms for us.

144
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,483
For that we could use the
browser tool which provides us

145
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:59,133
a really secure environment
to access internet at scale.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,470
One of the key features

147
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,340
or of our agent factory is
going to be what is known

148
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,380
as an AgentCore Gateway.

149
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,270
It does a couple of things for us.

150
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,010
AgentCore Gateway allows us

151
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,280
to have existing Lambda
functions or new Lambda functions

152
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,020
and expose them as if they
were MCP tools for our agents.

153
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,440
So say for example, our agents
now can connect to a gateway

154
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,390
and the gateway talks to Lambda functions

155
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,690
or APIs so that we don't
need to manage those APIs

156
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,850
or create MCP servers ourselves.

157
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,470
The gateway will expose them

158
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,740
as if they were NCP servers for us.

159
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,810
And finally, to make sense of everything,

160
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,990
to know why a particular
agent did a particular thing

161
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,270
or to know how to troubleshoot issues,

162
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,730
we are going to tap into
the observability feature

163
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,680
of AgentCore. Okay.

164
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,630
So now we know we are going
to have a builder agent.

165
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,410
Its role is just one thing,
takes users requests,

166
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,100
creates an agent or a
multi-agent system for us,

167
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,860
this builder agent is built using Strands,

168
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,563
is deployed on AgentCore
as the infrastructure.

169
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,060
The builder agent will have
access to three different tools,

170
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,060
one tool to create Lambda
functions. So these are the tools

171
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,870
that our agents will use to take action.

172
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,370
The second thing it does
is it has the ability

173
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,560
to create gateways on the fly

174
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,630
and to associate those lambda functions

175
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,240
with the gateway as MCP servers.

176
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,353
And thirdly, it can create and
deploy the agents themselves.

177
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,740
So once it deploys these agents,

178
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,120
these agents will work within
the AgentCore environment.

179
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,810
It'll access different tools
like Slack, Salesforce,

180
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,810
or any custom tools that you
might have across the gateway.

181
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,880
And that is how the
agent factory will work.

182
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,610
Okay. So now that we
know a little bit more

183
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,433
about the agent factory,
let's move to coding here.

184
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,860
If you can just turn it on.

185
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:07,548
(indistinct)

186
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,340
Can you all confirm
that it is large enough

187
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,680
for you all to see?
- [Audience] Yes. Yes.

188
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,110
- [Girish] Okay, cool.
So the very first thing

189
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,320
that I want to show you all
is a simple chat bot, right?

190
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,900
What I'm trying to show you
is how easy it is for us

191
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,740
to create these chat bots
or agents using Strands.

192
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,120
To create a chat bot with Strands,

193
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,880
we need just three lines of code.

194
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,230
One, I will import the
agent class from Strands.

195
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,230
Two, I'll then create an agent function

196
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,690
and three, I just trigger
that particular function,

197
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,640
ask it what re:Invent is.

198
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,850
And as you can see, it
came back with an answer.

199
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,290
So that is the power of Strands.

200
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,390
Like it just takes you a few lines of code

201
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,273
to create an agent and to
deploy that agent as well.

202
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,130
But there'll be times
when we need to select

203
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,470
a particular model,
right? In the first case,

204
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,670
what happened was we used
the base, the default model.

205
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,610
In that case it'll use Claude Sonnet 4.0.

206
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,890
But if I wanted to use a particle model,

207
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,490
all that I need to do is I
will import Bedrock model

208
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,460
from Strands. That is the difference.

209
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,070
Two, I'll mention what the model ID is.

210
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,760
So in this case you can see
the model ID is Nova Premier,

211
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,430
but tomorrow, say for
example if I wanted to use

212
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,100
Llama, right, from Meta, all that I do

213
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,900
is I change the model ID
here to Llama and run this.

214
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,870
It gives me the ability
to control randomness

215
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,630
or the behavior of the model
in terms of temperature

216
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,100
and top P as well

217
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,410
as if it's a chat based
application, right?

218
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,810
You can enable streaming for it.

219
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,410
But say for example, tomorrow,
OpenAI creates a new model,

220
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,970
an open source model, and we wanted

221
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,560
to leverage that model, right?

222
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,820
All that I do is I switch the model ID,

223
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,960
the rest of the agent code
stays exactly the same.

224
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,910
So this gives you a lot of flexibility.

225
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,970
Tomorrow, whenever new
models come into the picture,

226
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,010
you can keep the same agent code.

227
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,983
All that you do is switch the model ID.

228
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,030
We are also going to be providing
you three different files.

229
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,090
So if there are situations
where you want to consume

230
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,540
a model directly from
Anthropic as the provider,

231
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,390
so Anthropic provides
models on Bedrock of course,

232
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,670
but if you wanted to
consume it from Anthropic,

233
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,560
that's an option on Strands as well.

234
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,590
If you wanted to consume a
model directly from OpenAI,

235
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,330
it supports that as well.

236
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,260
And for some situations, if you
wanted to run a local model,

237
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,550
it supports Ollama.

238
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,040
So you can run a model
within your environment,

239
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,353
instead of running it on the cloud.

240
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,040
But like we discussed, a
true agent is what has access

241
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,560
to model as well as a set of tools

242
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,020
to take action on our behalf.

243
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,870
And now we'll start
interacting with agent tools.

244
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,730
The first thing, what
I'm going to do here is

245
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,910
I want to show you, say for
example our agent factory

246
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,590
got a request to create an agent

247
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,060
which can browse the internet,

248
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,940
find what AWS released last week,

249
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,800
create a news briefing of it,

250
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,920
and then upload it onto an S3 bucket.

251
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,685
So the difference in this
case is I'm going to import

252
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:23,430
some tools from Strands.
Strands provides a set

253
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,917
of various tools and we
will give you access to

254
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:28,290
our different tools it
supports out of the box.

255
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,031
But http_request will allow
it to access the internet,

256
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:35,250
use_aws will give it the ability to use

257
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,110
Boto3 libraries so that it can interact

258
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,630
with our AWS environment and current_time

259
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,750
gives it an understanding of
what date and time it is today.

260
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,903
So it goes back a week and
finds what AWS released.

261
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,120
From there, I am using
Anthropic as the model ID

262
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,280
in this case for creating the agent.

263
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,687
I'm giving it a system prompt where I say,

264
00:12:55,687 --> 00:13:00,687
"Hey, you are a news anchor
specializing in finding AWS news

265
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,470
and going to the internet
and then finding the news,

266
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,140
creating a news summary of it,

267
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,480
and then uploading it onto an S3 bucket."

268
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,370
So that is my system prompt.

269
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,890
The difference here is
the tools that I imported.

270
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,130
I'm telling it to use those
tools for doing those things

271
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,270
and then invoke it, right?

272
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,540
Like, "Hey, what's the latest AWS news?"

273
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,020
So now the agent is able
to understand the request,

274
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,720
take action on our behalf.
So what you can see is

275
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,720
it first use the current time tool,

276
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,080
then it use the http_request
to find the latest

277
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,090
AWS announcements.

278
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,810
And then it is using the
use_aws tool to upload that

279
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,350
to S3 on my behalf. And here
it is taking my permission,

280
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,930
there's ways for us to
automate that as well.

281
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,820
But I'm saying, "Hey, it's
okay for you to go ahead

282
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,040
and create this put_object request."

283
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,830
I say yes to it. And now
if I go to my S3 bucket

284
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,530
and refresh this, you will
see it has created a new file

285
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,510
and it created a news briefing for us.

286
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,220
So that is the power of agents

287
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,410
that can take action on our behalf.

288
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,930
This could have been something
which is more logical

289
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,810
to your business with a key
thing here is give it access

290
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,540
to a model, a set of tools
and let them do the work

291
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,733
on our behalf. Okay.

292
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,840
So the next thing I want to show here is

293
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,880
what if our agent factory
receives a request

294
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,480
wherein it not just needs
to create new agents,

295
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,060
but it also needs to create custom tools

296
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,830
outside of what Strands provides,

297
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,140
but build those tools on the fly based on

298
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,000
what the user request is.

299
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,670
So what I'm doing here is I've
created an agent which can

300
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,910
create different tools for
me. I just ran that agent.

301
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,010
I'm going to ask it to create a tool

302
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,340
that can calculate compound
interest as an example.

303
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,710
And let's go through the
code here for a minute.

304
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,830
The only difference here than
the previous thing is one,

305
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,140
I'm importing editor from Strands.

306
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,280
This will let it write code
and execute code on our behalf.

307
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,545
And then I'm telling it, "Hey, go ahead

308
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,330
and create new tools,

309
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,060
add those tools within
a particular directory,

310
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,630
the tools directory, but
also hot-load those tools

311
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,663
so that I can start using
those tools immediately.

312
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,050
So again, it went ahead, it is now asking

313
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,830
for my permission here to
make a right operation within

314
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,810
that particular tools directory.

315
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,933
So let me open that tool,
compound interest tool.

316
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,550
So this is very similar
tool or Python function.

317
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,045
Yeah, please go ahead.

318
00:15:49,045 --> 00:15:53,545
- [Attendee 1] So here, (indistinct).

319
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,540
- [Host] So the question
I can repeat it is,

320
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,100
we're running these tools locally,

321
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,330
generating these tools locally

322
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,608
and then if we were to
deploy this to AgentCore,

323
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:08,010
how might we create those tools Girish?

324
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,800
- [Girish] Great. So that is
going to be the next phase.

325
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,180
So what we are doing here is

326
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,400
running and creating these tools locally.

327
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,570
The next phase is going

328
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,660
to move it from our local
environments to AgentCore

329
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,250
and it'll use the same logic there.

330
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,380
So our agent factory takes a request,

331
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,300
it creates a particular tool

332
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,060
or a set of different tools,
then it creates a gateway,

333
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,130
associates those tools with the gateway

334
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,690
and then it creates an agent

335
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,400
to give it access to those tools.

336
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,823
So that will be the next
thing we'll do here today.

337
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,470
Does that help you?
(indistinct)

338
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,573
Okay, any other question?

339
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Okay. So as you can see,

340
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,550
it went ahead and
created this tool for us.

341
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,940
The only difference is
the @tool decorator.

342
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,570
Everything else is just a Python function.

343
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,190
So that is the power of Strands.

344
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,760
You can have your existing
or new Python functions

345
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,510
and expose them as tools
with the @tool decorator

346
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,963
that your agents can use to
take action on your behalf.

347
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,640
So if I now go ahead and ask it to

348
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,983
calculate the compound
interest as an example,

349
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,110
it knows it has a set of
three different tools.

350
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,790
It identifies the right tool

351
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,790
to calculate the compound
interest and then it goes ahead

352
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,280
and calculates that on our behalf as well.

353
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,630
This is not a meta-tooling.

354
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,940
We are going to use this
concept within the agent factory

355
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,940
where it can create other agents
and other tools on the fly.

356
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,260
Okay. So the next thing I
want to show you all here is

357
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:46,620
what if our agent was required
to access MCP servers?

358
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,287
So the example that I'm using here is

359
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:52,680
I'm creating almost a solutions architect.

360
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,420
What it'll do is it'll have access

361
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,520
to the latest AWS documentation.

362
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,860
So if something was launched yesterday,

363
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,500
it is within the documentation,
it needs to go ahead

364
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,680
and find what that thing
is in the documentation

365
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,360
and then I'm going to give it a request

366
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,390
to calculate the total cost
of ownership for hosting

367
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,930
that thing on AWS. To
keep things simple here

368
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,457
I'm creating a static
website and I'm telling it,

369
00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:18,990
"Hey host this on S3, have
a cloud front in front of it

370
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,713
and tell me how much it would
cost me to host this on AWS.

371
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,940
So the difference here is that
I'm going to make this agent

372
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,790
as an MCP client so that it can access

373
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,070
different MCP servers.

374
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,860
Two, I'm giving it access
to read and write files

375
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,260
because I'm asking it to
create the TCO calculations

376
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,363
and save that file on my local machine.

377
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,650
And three, I'm making
an STDIO client as well

378
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,900
so it can interact with those MCP servers

379
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,133
from my local machine.

380
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,900
I'm also giving it access
to certain access keys.

381
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,750
And that is only because
the pricing MCP calculator

382
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,640
requires access keys access.

383
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,240
But that is not always the case.

384
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,680
Everything else pretty much stay the same.

385
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,187
I'm giving it the role here in the prompt.

386
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:05,520
"Hey, you are an SA. You can write files,

387
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,510
you can read files,

388
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,300
you can find the documentation
of different things

389
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,453
and then you can go ahead
and serve the user's request.

390
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,283
So in this case, let us see
what it did behind the scenes.

391
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,220
So the first thing that it does is

392
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,370
it installs different MCP servers.

393
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,080
Then it finds the different tools

394
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,670
that those MCP servers provide.

395
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,310
So read documentation,
source documentation,

396
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,640
get pricing information, then it finds...

397
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,350
Then it actually takes the action, right?

398
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,080
So it is now finding the
pricing for different things.

399
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,370
It is finding the documentation

400
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,100
for different things if
it runs into an error.

401
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,100
So in this case it wasn't
able to find data transfer

402
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,820
as the pricing code,
it'll self-correct itself

403
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,550
and it found the right
code and it went ahead,

404
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,050
took my permission, "Hey, can I go ahead

405
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,300
and write this file?" I said yes.

406
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,280
And now I see a new file being created

407
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,180
which has the TCO calculation
of hosting a static website

408
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,000
along with links to those documentations.

409
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,220
So this is how you can create MCP clients

410
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,470
and have your agents work with MCP tools.

411
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,325
I see a question there.

412
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:19,680
- [Attendee 2] Yes. So
when the MCP interaction

413
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,525
with the cloud and server,

414
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:23,582
how does it manage the context window?

415
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:26,710
What if the tool in terms
of all (indistinct),

416
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,280
how does it manage the context window

417
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,986
so that it doesn't blow up the LLM?

418
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:32,819
- [Host] Did you get
that question, Girish?

419
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:34,470
So the question was how do you manage

420
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,320
the context window coming
back from the MCP tool?

421
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,510
- [Girish] Mm. So within Strands,

422
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,340
like we have provided functionality

423
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,060
where it knows how to manage
the context with MCP servers.

424
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,880
So you don't need to
create that logic yourself.

425
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,340
All that you do is you
create the MCP client,

426
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,880
give it access to different
MCP servers that you want

427
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,280
and then it will take
the right information.

428
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,080
Like we have added, say for example,

429
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,910
limits in terms of how much it can access,

430
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,830
what it can access, so it does not flood

431
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,800
your context window. So you
don't really need to spend a lot

432
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,830
of time on managing it.
That logic is built into it

433
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,530
and it can do that on your behalf.

434
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,793
Go ahead.
(indistinct)

435
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,202
Yes. Let me do that now.

436
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:18,616
- [Attendee 3] Because I
did see that you gave us

437
00:21:18,616 --> 00:21:20,755
an explanation of (indistinct).

438
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:25,755
- [Girish] Mm.
(indistinct)

439
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:27,464
- [Attendee 3] You give the
documentation (indistinct).

440
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:28,531
- [Girish] Mm.
- [Attendee 3] So why was this

441
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:30,080
web server (indistinct)?
- [Girish] Great.

442
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,700
So in this case, can
you repeat the question?

443
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,170
- [Host] Yeah, I think
the question is about

444
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,360
the tool documentation that
you provided in the code

445
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,370
versus that living in the MCP server.

446
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,010
- [Girish] Great. So
the difference is one,

447
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,890
like it needs access to the
latest documentation, right?

448
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,580
So instead of using... So think
of tools more to take action

449
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,160
versus MCP, in this case
we'll give it access

450
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,160
to the latest documentation.
If we tap into the MCP server

451
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,700
for documentation, there's
another MCP server for pricing.

452
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,520
So rather than creating
those tools yourselves,

453
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,100
we have built those MCP servers for you

454
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,900
so that you can start consuming them.

455
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,300
So there's an MCP server
for taking API action,

456
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,490
there's an MCP server for pricing.

457
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,680
Different services have
their own MCP server.

458
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,930
So based on the agent,
what it needs to do,

459
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,150
you can give it access
to the right MCP server

460
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,580
and it can interact with
it, find what's the latest.

461
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,730
You don't need to manage those.
You just create the agent

462
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,530
and have the agent interact with it.

463
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,110
- [Host] Okay, we'll take some more

464
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,180
questions after the session.
I think we need to make sure

465
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,010
we're continue moving forward.

466
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,384
- [Girish] Just hold
onto it. We'll get back.

467
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:31,920
- [Host] Yeah, we'll come back to you.

468
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,930
- [Girish] So the
difference in this case is

469
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,037
I created those MCP clients. I told it,

470
00:22:36,037 --> 00:22:37,560
"Hey, connect to the pricing server

471
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,000
as well as the MCP server."

472
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,430
And this agent is now able to do that.

473
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:46,140
But what if I wanted to
create a multi-agent system

474
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,440
which can have multiple
agents working together,

475
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,000
which could be a common requirement

476
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,740
for your agent factory, right?

477
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,600
So in this case, what I'm going to do

478
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,033
is let me show you the
architecture for it.

479
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,570
I'm creating an HR system.

480
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,670
It will take a user's request,

481
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,390
I'm asking it to host an HR
agent locally on port 8,000.

482
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:11,390
It talks using A2A to an
employee agent on port 8,001

483
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,210
and it uses an MCP server to get,

484
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,960
it's almost like a database,
to get employee data.

485
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,880
The request that I'm going to make it is

486
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,330
can you find me which employees
can help me on a particular

487
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,880
machine learning project?
I've given it a database

488
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,040
of different employee needs
with different skill sets

489
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,790
and it needs to identify who
those right employees are.

490
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,713
So I'll make a call request
here to trigger the HR agent.

491
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,513
Let me go ahead and do that.

492
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,920
And while it does that, let
me show you what the code is.

493
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,340
So for the HR agent, I'm
making it an A2A client.

494
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,530
So I import the A2A client provider.

495
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,910
I tell it this is the URL

496
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,920
that you are supposed to be hosted on.

497
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,890
For the employee agent,
this is an A2A server.

498
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,260
So I'm importing A2A server instead.

499
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,020
I give it the URL it's hosted on

500
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,210
as well as I tell like,
"Hey, this is the MCP server

501
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,890
URL that you have access to."

502
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,380
And this is just some Python
file that I've created

503
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,490
to replicate a database.

504
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,930
These are the first names of employees,

505
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,130
these are the last names

506
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,480
and these are the different skill sets

507
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,370
that those employees have, right?

508
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,400
So let us go ahead and see
what the call request did.

509
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,530
It sent a request to our server,

510
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,590
it found what different employees
have different skill sets

511
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,090
and then it recommends, "Hey, based on

512
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,260
what machine learning requires,

513
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,420
the frameworks and the technologies,

514
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,340
like these are the set of employees."

515
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,840
Which are the right employees
for us to work with.

516
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,610
Okay. So the final thing
now I'm going to show

517
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,800
is taking this to AgentCore now.

518
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,830
So I'm going to deploy this
particular server to AgentCore

519
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,430
and let me go ahead and do that.

520
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:52,490
So I've installed the
AgentCore CLI, I'll have it...

521
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:11,383
I'll have it deploy to agent call for us.

522
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,700
- [Host] Do you ever
get nervous with someone

523
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,852
looking over your shoulder as you type?

524
00:25:15,852 --> 00:25:18,390
(Girish laughs)
Girish is feeling that

525
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,223
right now
- [Girish] Yeah.

526
00:25:19,223 --> 00:25:20,056
- [Host] Times about 100.

527
00:25:26,914 --> 00:25:29,997
- [Girish] Okay. AgentCore configure,

528
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:36,450
this E... And I'm giving
it that agent's file.

529
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,050
I'll show you that file as well.

530
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Okay. So what this will do is it'll ask us

531
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,170
what we want to name the
agent. Let's call it HR agent.

532
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,790
It's asking what requirements

533
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,560
to put into that particular agent.

534
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,810
I have given it a requirements file.

535
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,300
I give it what Python version to utilize,

536
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,020
what is the execution role. I
just use the defaults for it.

537
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,140
And then it is asking me if
I want to give it a memory,

538
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,390
I give it memory as well

539
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,240
and I go ahead and launch this thing.

540
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,610
Okay. So what should happen now is

541
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,670
it will go to the AgentCore
file that we have created.

542
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,030
The only difference between
a local Strands Agent

543
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,520
and AgentCore is three different things.

544
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,943
One, I import the AgentCore app.

545
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:45,120
Two, I create the
AgentCore app, I define it.

546
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,380
And three, what I do is, I
put in the @app decorator.

547
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,930
So this is what my entry
point of the agent is.

548
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,940
So whenever someone triggers that agent,

549
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,220
this is the core that
it is supposed to run.

550
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,040
Everything else that we have
been creating with Strands

551
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,843
stays exactly the same.

552
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:06,310
Okay, so now let me move
back to the terminal

553
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,070
and show you what it is doing.

554
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,270
So what it does is it's
creating the AgentCore.

555
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,890
Runtime here, it created
different roles for us,

556
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,960
it created memory for us.

557
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,090
And this can take a couple of minutes.

558
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,210
It is creating, uploading things onto S3

559
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,650
after it's created the role

560
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,443
and now it is launching
things to AgentCore.

561
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,090
And this is exactly what
our agent factory is going

562
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,410
to utilize as well.

563
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,320
So to see all these
things being automated,

564
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,420
let's move on to the agent factory

565
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,130
and we can show these things in action,

566
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,420
how we can automatically create

567
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,000
and do all this work
without writing that code.

568
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,253
And for that, let me
pass on to Justin here.

569
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,540
- [Justin] Okay, great.
Well thank you Girish.

570
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,760
So just to recap what we just saw,

571
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,580
we saw a lot of stuff, right?
We saw things like Strands

572
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,520
and how you can use Strands
SDK to build agents.

573
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,000
We saw MCP servers and
how you can configure MCPs

574
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,667
on those Strands Agents. We saw A2A

575
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:14,760
and how you can configure
a multi-agent system using

576
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,220
A2A clients and A2A servers.

577
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,170
And then the very last thing we saw was

578
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,310
how can we actually take all this

579
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,193
and deploy it to
production using AgentCore?

580
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,240
Now we have to ask ourselves the question

581
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,570
and that question is, is there
an easier way to do all this?

582
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,460
Girish just wrote a ton of code,

583
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,750
he wrote it ahead of time obviously,

584
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,280
but ran through a bunch of code.

585
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,090
It's a ton of work to still
create all these Strands Agents,

586
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,800
create all of these different tools.

587
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,590
And is there an easier
way, is there a way for us

588
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,010
to maybe use an agent
factory or a builder agent

589
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,500
that we could speak to in natural language

590
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,890
and that agent could build
agents for us on the fly

591
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:56,430
from scratch according to our requirements

592
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,610
and then deploy them securely and scalably

593
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,590
into AgentCore Runtime?

594
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,593
And that's what we're
gonna take a look at now.

595
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,940
So Girish and I are gonna do
a little bit of role playing

596
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,600
and I'm gonna play the role
of the company AI guru.

597
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,110
So I'm the guy that everyone
comes to to build their agents

598
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,270
and I'm always up late, working at night,

599
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,250
getting these random requests from people

600
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,770
to build them some
random agent to help them

601
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,903
with their business task at work.

602
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,820
Alright, so it's a late Friday night,

603
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,790
I'm ready to get off of
work, I'm super tired

604
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,460
and suddenly I get a call from Girish.

605
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,640
- [Girish] Hi Justin, I know
this is late Friday night.

606
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,560
I have one last request for you.

607
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,870
We have a really board
meeting on Monday morning.

608
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,780
Can you please create an
agent which can help us make

609
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,960
investment decisions within
different industries?

610
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,510
I promise this is the
last thing I have for you.

611
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,980
- [Justin] Sounds good, Girish.

612
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,320
Alright, so it's 7:00 PM on a Friday.

613
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,060
I want to go hang out with my friends,

614
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,680
but now I need to make a decision.

615
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,950
Am I gonna build an agent
from scratch using Strands

616
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,040
and AgentCore and do all of
this coding and programming?

617
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,690
Or am I gonna use an agent
factory to help automate a lot of

618
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:12,300
that process and deploy that agent for me?

619
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,460
And so I'm gonna pick the second option

620
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,680
so I can go to sleep
at some point tonight.

621
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,580
So what I built here is just a
really simple CLI application

622
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,040
that we can use to interact
with our builder agent.

623
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,940
And that's what we're gonna call it.

624
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,910
Our builder agent is kind of
the key to our agent factory.

625
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,187
So I'm gonna go ahead
and just type in one here

626
00:30:29,187 --> 00:30:32,130
and I'm gonna kick off a agent creation.

627
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,780
I'm gonna just say, "Create
me an agent that can perform

628
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:41,730
risk analysis using a tool to determine

629
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:46,730
risk by industry vertical."
(keyboard clicking)

630
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,270
And we'll kick this off now
the builder agent's gonna be

631
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,090
thinking here, it's gonna be
doing things like crafting

632
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,250
this system prompt for this agent.

633
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,850
It's going to be building that
tool that it needs to do any

634
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,160
of the business logic
and then deploying all of

635
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,500
that to AgentCore. So while this runs,

636
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,390
rather than just stare at the screen,

637
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,560
let's go ahead and take a look at some

638
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,730
of the code under the hood

639
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,430
of what's actually happening here.

640
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,850
And we're gonna make all of
this code available to you

641
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,360
after the session. But just
to take a look together,

642
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,430
I'm gonna go into the builder agent folder

643
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,050
and this is sort of the
heart of the project,

644
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,930
which is this builder_agent.py file.

645
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,311
So let make this a little bit
bigger for everyone to see.

646
00:31:28,311 --> 00:31:30,690
And our builder agent is gonna use a lot

647
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,870
of those same core concepts
that Girish mentioned.

648
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:38,040
So things like Strands, we're
importing agents and tools.

649
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,170
And so if I scroll down here,

650
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,210
we're gonna see our app entry point.

651
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,400
So this builder agent
is already been deployed

652
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,960
to AgentCore Runtime.

653
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,030
And so we've got our app entry point here

654
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,040
so we know which function to invoke

655
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,693
when this agent is called.

656
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,230
Scrolling down here a little bit,

657
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,630
going through all of this
various payload handling,

658
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,330
we'll get to the real logic
and meat of this function.

659
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,160
We've got our model
initialized, we have our memory.

660
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,990
So our builder agent is gonna have

661
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,510
just a small snippet of code
here starting on line 78

662
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,740
for our memory hook.

663
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,470
And this is gonna give it
access to short-term memory

664
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,640
with a history of five.

665
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,100
So it's gonna have those
five previous messages

666
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,630
automatically loaded in when you

667
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,043
chat with the builder agent.

668
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:25,500
Additionally, here's our
Strands agent configuration

669
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,600
starting on line 87.

670
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,020
And you'll notice there's
about six tools here

671
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,700
and there's three of them
that are really important

672
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,590
that I wanna call your attention to.

673
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,670
And those three are
deploy_agents, create_gateway

674
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,023
and create_lambda_tools.

675
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,680
So our builder agent is
going to use all three

676
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,260
of these different tools to automate

677
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,390
that agent creation process.

678
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,870
The first thing that it will
do is call create_gateway.

679
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,510
And this is gonna create an
AgentCore Gateway for us,

680
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,790
which serves as sort
of like a facade layer.

681
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:00,540
Girish mentioned this during
some of those initial talks.

682
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,210
It's a facade layer that
allows your agent to connect

683
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,940
to things like Lambda
functions or other APIs

684
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,490
over MCP protocol. So the
first thing it will do

685
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,290
is create that gateway,

686
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,940
then it will create those lambda tools.

687
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,190
So in this case for our risk
agent that's running right now

688
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,590
and behind the scenes,
it's gonna create one tool

689
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:20,010
that's gonna deploy to Lambda
that will be exposed via

690
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,333
that AgentCore Gateway.

691
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,780
And then finally it's
going to deploy the agent

692
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,653
to AgentCore Runtime using
this deploy_agent tool.

693
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,420
Alright, we have our system prompt here,

694
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,520
we'll take a look at that here in a moment

695
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,960
and then we just pass back a response.

696
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,870
So pretty, pretty
straightforward code here.

697
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,180
So let's go back to our terminal

698
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,650
and we're gonna see, hey, great,

699
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,660
our risk agent's been
successfully created,

700
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:50,100
it's been deployed, it's
called risk analysis agent

701
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,260
and here's the associated gateway.

702
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,330
So why don't we give
this risk agent a try?

703
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,180
So I'm gonna go ahead and test it out.

704
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,130
So I'm gonna using my agent factory,

705
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:02,553
go to chat with deployed
agents, which is option two.

706
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,450
Give this a minute to
load. It's gonna pull back

707
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,670
all of the available agents
that are have been deployed

708
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,843
to the agent factory.

709
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,230
And here we can see Girish's
HR agent from earlier

710
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,570
and then my brand new risk analysis agent.

711
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,780
So we'll chat with that
risk analysis agent

712
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,450
and we'll say what is
the risk associated with

713
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:28,370
the technology industry?
(keyboard clicking)

714
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,270
And while this runs, why
don't we take a look at some

715
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,060
of the infrastructure that was
deployed by our builder agent

716
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,523
to make this risk analysis agent possible.

717
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,120
So I go to my console here

718
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,253
and I go to Bedrock AgentCore Runtime.

719
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,663
I'm gonna see this freshly
deployed risk analysis agent.

720
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,410
I'm also gonna go to gateways

721
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,360
and here I'm gonna see
a risk analysis gateway.

722
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,030
So this is that sort of
extra layer that we added in

723
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,950
to allow us to expose Lambda functions

724
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,633
to our agent as tools.

725
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,070
And then if I click in here under Targets,

726
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,960
I see we've got this risk analysis target

727
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,270
that's actually a brand
new lambda function

728
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,973
that our builder agent
deployed for us on the fly.

729
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,090
So this risk analysis function,

730
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,160
it's gonna be mostly
just generic logic here,

731
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,040
but you can easily think
of the possibilities

732
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,630
if you have, go into more detail

733
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,390
and you wanna connect to some
sort of third party system,

734
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,490
the builder agent could easily
write that kind of logic

735
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,110
and deploy it as a lambda function,

736
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,683
which you could then expose
to your agent as a tool.

737
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,980
Alright, perfect. So I'm gonna
go back to the console here

738
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,310
and here we can see our
technology industry risk analysis

739
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,470
of a score of 70/100.

740
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:40,113
So this is just some generic
response back from our agent.

741
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,350
Alright, Girish,
(Girish laughs)

742
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,880
we created our technology
risk assessment agent

743
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,070
and I'm ready to go to
bed now at this point.

744
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,900
- [Girish] No, I think
this looks amazing Justin,

745
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,480
thank you for it. And
thinking we could also connect

746
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,360
this risk agent to different
third party systems as well

747
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,550
as our own intelligence systems.

748
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,560
But I have one final thing for you,

749
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,240
I promise this is the final request.

750
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,073
- [Justin] All right,
hit me with it. (laughs)

751
00:36:04,073 --> 00:36:07,140
- [Girish] We have a set of
interns coming on Monday,

752
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,150
they are going to be
traveling to different places

753
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,230
to get training. Can we create
an agent which can help them

754
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,000
expense things when they travel?

755
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,710
I promise this is the last request.

756
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,240
- [Justin] Sure, yeah, I'll give it a try

757
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,310
with our agent factory.

758
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,740
So let's go back to our builder agent here

759
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:27,390
and let's ask for, you know,
"Create me an expense agent

760
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:32,390
that can fetch expenses by
user and add new expenses."

761
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:37,650
(keyboard clicking)
And we'll kick this off.

762
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,730
So this is gonna be great Girish

763
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,620
'cause right now I know we're tracking all

764
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,320
of our interns expenses
just on an Excel sheet

765
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,660
and it would be great if we
had an agent that we could use

766
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,350
to, you know, maybe update
some kind of backend data store

767
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:52,050
to allow our interns to
easily add new expenses

768
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,630
or view their existing expenses.

769
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,220
So we'll give our builder
agent here a minute

770
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,579
to create this expense.

771
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:00,450
And while this is running,
let's just go ahead

772
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,940
and take a look at the system
prompt of our builder agent.

773
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,640
So we talked about these
three important tools

774
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,960
and again, we'll publish this code

775
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,730
so you can take a look at
what's happening under the hood

776
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,650
for these different tools.

777
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,240
But we also have our system prompts.

778
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,393
Those are super important
to take a look at.

779
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,470
So for our builder agent system prompt,

780
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,530
we've got some rules like
only create one gateway,

781
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,700
only create one agent.

782
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,650
We don't wanna have any
kind of duplications,

783
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,150
which can certainly
happen when you're running

784
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,150
an agentic loop, it could
sometimes duplicate efforts.

785
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,950
So we just make sure we include
these as critical rules.

786
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,450
And then we've got a couple options here.

787
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,000
If it's a simple agent that
doesn't require a tool,

788
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,210
it's just gonna deploy
an agent with no gateway.

789
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,420
And then option two, which is
what we've been using so far,

790
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,250
is create an agent with custom tools.

791
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,260
So I mentioned this previously,

792
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,680
but the first step is to create
that gateway in AgentCore,

793
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,000
then we create our Lambda tools.

794
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,910
So it's basically writing
lambda functions from scratch

795
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,610
and deploying those and then it's going

796
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,563
to deploy the agent right here.

797
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,140
After step three you're done,

798
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,000
agents created successfully and then stop.

799
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,530
So we don't have any
kind of duplicates set

800
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,380
that might occur.

801
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,990
Alright, so going back to the terminal,

802
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,690
we can see our expense
agent is now deployed.

803
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,220
So let's give it a quick test

804
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,920
before going back to Girish
with our finished product.

805
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:27,318
Go to our expense agent and
say, "What is user001 expenses?"

806
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:30,450
(keyboard clicking)

807
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,530
- [Girish] So Justin, like when you are

808
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:34,650
asking this question,
where does it come back

809
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,670
with an answer from?

810
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,770
Is this data now stored somewhere?

811
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,603
- [Justin] That's right, Girish.

812
00:38:38,603 --> 00:38:41,990
So actually we exposed
our builder agent to a set

813
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,281
of DynamoDB tables that we have...

814
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:44,190
- [Girish] Mm-hm.

815
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,630
- [Justin] That are
storing these expenses.

816
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,730
So our builder agent's intelligent enough

817
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,830
to recognize those data sources

818
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,810
and then write the
corresponding business logic

819
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,660
in the lambda functions to
connect to those data sources.

820
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,493
- [Girish] Wow.

821
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,380
- [Justin] All right, so
here we've got our expenses

822
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,400
for user one and we can
see we've got some coffee

823
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,960
and Starbucks expenses, et cetera.

824
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,720
Probably hanging out at re:Invent
and getting some coffee,

825
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,810
these interns. Alright cool, Garish,

826
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:12,240
we've got the expense agent completed.

827
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,991
At this point I'm turning
my phone on silent.

828
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:14,880
(Girish laughs)

829
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,960
I don't wanna hear from you anymore.

830
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,030
I'm gonna go enjoy my Friday night.

831
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,550
But if anybody in the
crowd has a example agent

832
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,500
they'd like me to create, let's
go ahead and give it a shot.

833
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,550
Just raise your hand.

834
00:39:25,484 --> 00:39:27,901
(indistinct)

835
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,553
- [Girish] Okay.
(indistinct)

836
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,970
Right, data source. Hmm.

837
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,390
Yeah, so Justin, the question is we showed

838
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:48,240
how the agent can connect
to the right Dynamo table.

839
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,190
Like how does it understand the logic

840
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,280
to identify the right sources
when you create the new agent

841
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,260
and how is it able to
intelligently say connect

842
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,730
to this DynamoDB table?

843
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,680
- [Justin] Got it. Yeah,
so a lot of that's gonna be

844
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,270
provided as context to the agent.

845
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,130
So you can do that a couple of ways.

846
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,140
You can either include
that in your system prompt,

847
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,150
is like, "Hey, these are
your available data sources

848
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,710
and this is the schema that you can use

849
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,480
to connect to these data sources."

850
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,600
Or you can expose your agent
to some sort of MCP tool,

851
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,540
I know AWS does publish quite
a few different MCP tools

852
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,120
that you could use, which your
builder agent in this case

853
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,160
could use to search through
your AWS infrastructure,

854
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,473
identify those relevant data sources.

855
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,410
- [Girish] So they use
AWS tool that we had seen

856
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,320
before that will give it
access to all Boto3 libraries.

857
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,520
So it can go in their account,

858
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,110
find what data sources are there

859
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,560
and it can connect to
those data sources as well.

860
00:40:36,165 --> 00:40:39,573
(indistinct)
Hmm. Mm.

861
00:40:42,516 --> 00:40:46,088
(indistinct)
Hmm. Great.

862
00:40:46,088 --> 00:40:49,005
(indistinct)
Great.

863
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:54,060
(indistinct)
Hmm. Yeah.

864
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,340
So usually within
production you would want

865
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,370
to have it within your context
so that it limits itself

866
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,877
to just those tools and you define like,

867
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:02,903
"Hey this is a Dynamo table for expenses,

868
00:41:02,903 --> 00:41:05,520
this is a Dynamo table for
summoning PTO requests,

869
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,780
so on and so forth.

870
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,630
But like you could give it
the intelligence in like

871
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,240
a non-production environment
where you can let it

872
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,060
figure it out itself. But in
production what we have done

873
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,987
is we have created the
system prompt and told it,

874
00:41:16,987 --> 00:41:19,080
"Hey, this table is for
submitting expenses,

875
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,790
this table is for doing X, Y, Z."

876
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:24,323
So it knows what to use.
(indistinct)

877
00:41:30,724 --> 00:41:34,737
Mm.
(indistinct)

878
00:41:34,737 --> 00:41:39,404
Mm.
(indistinct)

879
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,850
Mm.
(indistinct)

880
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,213
Yeah.
(indistinct)

881
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:48,938
We'll take that one after a few examples

882
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:50,340
just for the sake of time.

883
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,250
But yeah, we will get
to it as well. Any...

884
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,690
- [Justin] So if anyone
has an example agent

885
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:55,710
they want us to create...

886
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,543
- [Girish] Do you want us
to create an agent, yeah.

887
00:41:56,543 --> 00:41:57,719
- [Justin] Raise hand do agent?

888
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:58,552
- [Girish] Go ahead.

889
00:41:58,552 --> 00:41:59,660
- [Attendee 5] The same example,
that was posted earlier,

890
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,830
multi-agent example.
- [Girish] Hmm.

891
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,030
- [Justin] Yes. Alright,
why don't we go ahead

892
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,310
and show that. So
Girish, I know we created

893
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,810
our expense agent.
- [Girish] Okay.

894
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,780
- [Justin] Right. Well, I know our interns

895
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,090
also need to take PTO.
- [Girish] Mm.

896
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,830
- [Justin] So what if
we create a PTO agent

897
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,660
that lets 'em do something very similar?

898
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,090
- [Girish] Okay.
- [Justin] And then after that

899
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:19,770
my thought is we can create some sort

900
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:23,070
of multi-agent system
using our agent factory

901
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,560
with an orchestrator that the
interns could interact with.

902
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,490
- [Girish] Mm-hm.
- [Justin] And then be able

903
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,430
to interact with the
expense agent, our PTO agent

904
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,130
and then any other new agents we decide

905
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,180
to build in the future.

906
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,013
How does that sound?
- [Girish] Sounds great.

907
00:42:34,013 --> 00:42:35,010
Yeah.
- [Justin] Alright,

908
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,180
let's go ahead and give that a shot.

909
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:40,560
So similarly to our expense
agent, let's go ahead

910
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,577
and prompt our builder
agent here to say, you know,

911
00:42:42,577 --> 00:42:47,577
"Create me a PTO agent
that can fetch PTO by user

912
00:42:47,995 --> 00:42:49,410
(keyboard clicking)

913
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:53,710
and you know, submit new PTO requests."

914
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,470
(keyboard clicking continues)

915
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,910
Alright, so this is gonna
create that PTO agent.

916
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,100
I'm just creating two
sample agents here just

917
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,880
to demonstrate A2A and then
we'll create an orchestrator

918
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,730
here in a moment.

919
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:08,073
Alright, so we'll give this
a moment to think, question.

920
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,437
- [Attendee 6] So in this case,

921
00:43:10,437 --> 00:43:12,933
is it like one of the tools essentially,

922
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:16,770
does it require like an API
integration with whatever,

923
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,590
you know, internal PeopleSoft
application is used

924
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:23,103
to manage PTO or are we assuming
that PTOs being managed by,

925
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,610
you know, Excel file for these interns

926
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,960
or some other data source?

927
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,120
- [Justin] Right. Yeah,
it could do either.

928
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,160
So if you have some sort
of external third party,

929
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,720
as long as you specify that or give

930
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,730
your builder agent context of that system,

931
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:38,610
it can write the lambda code on the fly

932
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,340
to connect to that system right as a tool

933
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,710
and expose that tool to your agent.

934
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,450
- [Girish] Yeah, so just
to repeat the question,

935
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:49,080
the question was in case
if we have our system,

936
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,790
like the PTO system being
managed by SoftChoice,

937
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,270
which is a third party tool,
can we give agents access

938
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,520
to those tools as well to
manage it there instead

939
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,560
of DynamoDB that we are
doing here, all right.

940
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,270
So absolutely, all that you would do

941
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,950
is the Lambda function
would have the logic

942
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,170
to connect to those tools as MCP servers

943
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,570
and then your agent connects
to the gateway which talks

944
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:08,668
to Lambda, which connects to people

945
00:44:08,668 --> 00:44:10,950
or SoftChoice for example,
to manage that as well.

946
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,170
So it can, like in the diagram
we showed like connecting

947
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,757
to Slack and Quip like it can connect

948
00:44:14,757 --> 00:44:16,710
to third parties as well,

949
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,543
- [Host] Right.

950
00:44:17,543 --> 00:44:19,440
- [Justin] Okay. Okay. So
right now our PTO agent's

951
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,000
being assembled under the hood

952
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,700
and then I also wanna just
show our generic agent code.

953
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,030
So we looked through the
builder agent, which is a lot

954
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,490
of the business logic of
what's actually being created,

955
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,017
but we also have to deploy an agent.

956
00:44:31,017 --> 00:44:34,320
And so that's where we, what
we call our generic_agent.py.

957
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,650
So really this is a
pretty basic Strands Agent

958
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,170
and then we're passing
a lot of these different

959
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,530
environment variables like the
model ID, the system prompt,

960
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:47,220
the gateway ID if it needs
to connect any kind of tools

961
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,800
in as an environment
variables to this code.

962
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,430
And then deploying this as those
separate different runtime,

963
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,343
those runtime agents that
get deployed to AgentCore.

964
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,650
So just to walk through
this code briefly here,

965
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,230
we've got one function
here to construct A2A URLs.

966
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,090
So for multi-agent systems, we need

967
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,500
to have this function onboard so

968
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,160
that way our agents can
discover each other using A2A,

969
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,320
and this is the URL that we're returning

970
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,700
on Bedrock AgentCore, we have
this create agent function

971
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,900
that I'm going to skip here,

972
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,690
but we'll take a look at it momentarily.

973
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,370
And then we have our main function.

974
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,160
So if you remember from
Girish's presentation,

975
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,980
he mentioned four A2A, there's such things

976
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,460
as A2A servers and A2A clients.

977
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,850
Now an A2A server, for the
most part all of our agents

978
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:38,130
so far that we've created
have been a to a servers

979
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:39,510
or the agent mode of server.

980
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,030
And so this block of code's going to run

981
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:47,030
or we create that agent,
we expose this runtime URL,

982
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:50,310
and then we run this
command here of A2A server,

983
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,587
which is gonna host this at port 9,000.

984
00:45:52,587 --> 00:45:56,280
And this makes this agent
viewable and exposed

985
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,403
to any sort of A2A clients
that might be on our network.

986
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,690
And I'm gonna scroll down here,
we're just doing some basic,

987
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,673
you know, mounting here of the server.

988
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:09,030
And then in our else
statement, this is client mode.

989
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:12,600
So if we deploy any orchestrators,
any orchestrator agents,

990
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,450
those are are deemed as clients

991
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,460
and here we're gonna do
some of that standard stuff

992
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,910
that Girish did earlier
with BedrockAgentCoreApp,

993
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:25,170
we run this app command and
then we specify our entry point

994
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:27,717
in the invoke agent command
and here we just run our

995
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:31,383
create_agent function
and create an A2A client.

996
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:37,380
Okay, perfect. And then
our create agent function,

997
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,510
this is where a lot of
that business logic is.

998
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,880
So we've got some if statements,

999
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,170
if we need code interpreter,

1000
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,050
let's add this code interpreter tool.

1001
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,843
If we need browser, let's
add our browser tool.

1002
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,330
If our agent mode is client,
here's our setup for A2A

1003
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,120
so it can discover those other A2A agents

1004
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,373
that are on the network as A2A servers.

1005
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,640
And so here's some
boilerplate code here around

1006
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,380
A2A client tool provider.

1007
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,900
So this gives it access to
those standard A2A tools

1008
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,110
that it would need to
discover agents over A2A

1009
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,483
and then also send those agents messages.

1010
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,100
And then we've got our gateway ID.

1011
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,890
So if we do have a gateway, we
need to also expose our agent

1012
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,530
to that gateway so we can
access those custom lambda tools

1013
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,780
that were created for it.

1014
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,080
Alright, perfect. So that's most

1015
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,480
of the business logic there.

1016
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:32,910
If I go back to our console,

1017
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:36,063
we can see our PTO agent has
been successfully created.

1018
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:40,020
And now I'm gonna do that last step,

1019
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,670
which is creating that orchestrator.

1020
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,900
- [Girish] Mm.
- [Justin] So let's go ahead

1021
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,550
and say, "Create an HR orchestrator

1022
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:51,520
that can delegate tasks
to the expense agent

1023
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:54,837
(keyboard clicking)
and the PTO agent."

1024
00:48:01,956 --> 00:48:04,373
(indistinct)

1025
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,950
Correct. Yeah, so you
could easily do that,

1026
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:15,990
if you update your system prompt,

1027
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:18,000
if you wanna do something
like an iteration of...

1028
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,320
And sorry I didn't repeat the question,

1029
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,230
but the question is could you
have a more interactive could

1030
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,020
process of assembling the agent?

1031
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,550
You could update your system prompt here

1032
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,680
of the builder agent. For
the sake of the demo today,

1033
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,000
we wanted to make it quick,

1034
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,370
but you could absolutely
architect it that way

1035
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,320
where you could have a
back and forth conversation

1036
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,410
with the user so they can
help to further refine

1037
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:40,410
those requirements of what
the deployed system prompt

1038
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:43,320
should be, what the deployed
tools should look like,

1039
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,660
those sorts of things.
- [Girish] Mm-hm.

1040
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,550
- [Justin] Alright, so now
we've got our HR orchestrator,

1041
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,170
it's configured as a client agent

1042
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:51,903
and it has access to the
expense and the PTO agent.

1043
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,283
So let's go ahead and
give that a quick test.

1044
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:01,027
We'll find our HR
orchestrator, and we'll ask it,

1045
00:49:01,027 --> 00:49:04,867
"What agents can you communicate with?"

1046
00:49:04,867 --> 00:49:08,700
(keyboard clicking continues)

1047
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,570
So what this is doing under the hood

1048
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:22,470
is it's using some of the
included A2A client tools

1049
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:25,920
to do a discovery and see
which agents it can connect to.

1050
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,860
And we're expecting here to be
able to see the expense agent

1051
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:32,610
and the PTO agent. So if I scroll up,

1052
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:35,160
we can see, we can
communicate with two agents

1053
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,130
and then I can ask that same
question from before of,

1054
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:41,550
you know, what is user001's expenses,

1055
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:42,750
or actually we'll ask
it something different.

1056
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:47,750
Let's say, you know, add
an expense for user001

1057
00:49:47,769 --> 00:49:48,690
(keyboard clicking)

1058
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:53,690
for coffee at Starbucks on
December 2nd, 2025, for breakfast

1059
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:00,933
for $15.65.

1060
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:07,400
All right, perfect.

1061
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,770
And we'll give this a
minute or two to run.

1062
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,560
This does take a bit longer
than interacting directly

1063
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,470
with the expense agent because
first the orchestrator,

1064
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:18,900
in this case, that we're
talking to, has to identify

1065
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,300
which agent should handle this request

1066
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,450
and then actually send a message
to that agent to allow it

1067
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:26,650
to make this post command
to our data store.

1068
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:32,400
So I'll just quickly show
what's going on in terms of

1069
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,603
what was created here. So
I go back to our console.

1070
00:50:40,754 --> 00:50:43,337
Lemme just refresh the page quickly.

1071
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,258
- [Attendee 6] How is the
orchestrator determining

1072
00:50:49,258 --> 00:50:50,933
the function supported by
each of the individual agents?

1073
00:50:54,139 --> 00:50:58,080
Is it inferring based on...
- [Justin] Yeah, so I did

1074
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,030
gloss over that detail. So the question is

1075
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:02,010
how can the orchestrator determine

1076
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:05,160
the functionality of the agents
that it can communicate to

1077
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,820
over A2A, so part of A2A, and
we didn't touch on this today

1078
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:11,760
specifically, is what's
called an agent card.

1079
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,770
And so those server
agents that are deployed

1080
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,410
are advertising what's
called like an agent card

1081
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:19,020
and that contains a
description of what they can do

1082
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,610
and some of their tools, right?

1083
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,070
So you could include those
details in the agent card.

1084
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,787
So when the client's
discovering it's like,

1085
00:51:24,787 --> 00:51:26,040
"Okay, this is my expense agent,

1086
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,130
this is what it can do, et cetera."

1087
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:30,630
- [Attendee 6] Are those
parts created as part

1088
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,370
of the agent factory or
is this something that...

1089
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:33,203
- [Girish] Mm-hm.
- [Justin] Yeah,

1090
00:51:33,203 --> 00:51:35,220
we are creating those as
part of the agent factory.

1091
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,780
I think I may have
scrolled over that code,

1092
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,180
but you'll have it in the
code repository. Yeah.

1093
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,680
Okay, cool. So now we've
got our expenses gateway

1094
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,327
with our get-expenses
and add-expenses tools.

1095
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,350
And then if I go back
here we can see, hey,

1096
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,150
we've recorded this expense

1097
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,800
and then if I were to say,
"Hey, what are user001's

1098
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,700
expenses, we would expect
to see this as well."

1099
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,620
- [Girish] So we have one
more question here, Justin,

1100
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,073
go ahead.
(indistinct)

1101
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,480
Yeah, so the question
is, in terms of managing

1102
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,330
what permissions the agent
has to read the Dynamo table,

1103
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,280
can it read, can it write,

1104
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,800
how can one manage those permissions?

1105
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,700
- [Justin] Yeah, that's a great question.

1106
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,250
So a lot of that's gonna be
done with agent identity,

1107
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,450
AgentCore Identity.

1108
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:26,910
We didn't plug that into
our agent factory for today.

1109
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,460
We're just using generic IM permissions.

1110
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:33,090
So you can kind of query user
one, user two, user three,

1111
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,950
and all those queries
are gonna go through.

1112
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:37,620
But absolutely if like
in a production system,

1113
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,510
if you were really deploy
this for your end users,

1114
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:41,670
you would wanna use things like J. tokens

1115
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:44,610
and things like that to identify
the claims of the token,

1116
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:46,800
who's interacting with the agent
and then pass that through.

1117
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,633
So they're only accessing the resources...

1118
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:49,050
- [Girish] Hmm.

1119
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,610
- [Justin] They should be able to.

1120
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:51,900
- [Girish] Yeah, we
have one more question.

1121
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,291
Sorry I couldn't get to you
earlier. Please go ahead.

1122
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:56,708
(indistinct)

1123
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:04,080
Okay.
(indistinct)

1124
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,510
Yeah, so the question is like,
are we using the same model

1125
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:09,090
for generating code as well
as talking to the agent?

1126
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:11,550
So in this case, what we
are doing is we have used

1127
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:15,060
Sonnet 4.5 for creating agents,

1128
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,890
and when we are talking to an agent

1129
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,620
that is Haiku 4.5, Sonnet Haiku 4.5.

1130
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,275
So we are using Claude models here.

1131
00:53:22,275 --> 00:53:24,692
(indistinct)

1132
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,880
Correct. So in...
(indistinct)

1133
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,760
Mm-hm, so when two agents
are talking to each other,

1134
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,980
like what is the security aspect of it?

1135
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,010
So we are relying on A2A
as the underlying protocol.

1136
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:44,465
So it is ensuring that the
agents can identify each other,

1137
00:53:44,465 --> 00:53:46,320
know what they're capable of,

1138
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,270
and they are using the A2A protocol

1139
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,830
to communicate with each other.

1140
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,110
So the communication would be encrypted.

1141
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,690
Like it'll basically use
that protocol as the channel

1142
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,900
to communicate with each other,
the communication channel.

1143
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,040
- [Justin] All right.
We'll take some questions

1144
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,100
here at the end. Just we're
almost done with time here.

1145
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,810
So just last thing I wanted to touch on is

1146
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:06,990
we've got some resources. The
code repo that Girish and I

1147
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:08,700
used today is that far left link.

1148
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,040
So if you wanna play around
with that, feel free.

1149
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,530
And then we also have like
a Strands Agent starter,

1150
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:16,410
and an AgentCore samples
GitHub repository as well

1151
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:17,913
that you can pull down.

1152
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,540
And then last thing we wanna
say is just thank you all

1153
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,280
for coming out and attending this session.

1154
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,815
We hope you found it
valuable. Thank you all.

1155
00:54:25,815 --> 00:54:26,880
(people applauding)

1156
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,130
- [Girish] Thank you all.
