  "abstract": "Almost everyone has experienced a bad IT day, where systems failed in unpredictable ways, but for organizations operating in humanitarian crisis contexts continuity is mission critical. Amazon’s CTO, Werner Vogels, has said: “Everything fails, all the time, so plan for failure and nothing fails”. Building resilient systems can be hard, and understanding the ways a system might fail can be challenging. However, generative AI can help in identifying gaps in your resilience posture. In this chalk talk, builders will see how they can leverage generative AI to better prepare for tomorrow’s disaster. You’ll leave with the tools, skills, and knowledge so your workloads are unaffected by future failures.",
  "abstract_cn": "几乎每个人都经历过糟糕的IT日子,系统以不可预测的方式发生故障,但对于在人道主义危机环境中运营的组织来说,业务连续性至关重要。亚马逊首席技术官Werner Vogels曾说过:\"一切都会失败,无时无刻,所以要为失败做好计划,这样就不会有任何失败\"。构建弹性系统可能很困难,理解系统可能失败的方式也具有挑战性。然而,生成式AI可以帮助识别您弹性态势中的差距。在本次技术讲座中,构建者将了解如何利用生成式AI更好地为明天的灾难做好准备。您将获得工具、技能和知识,使您的工作负载不受未来故障的影响。",
