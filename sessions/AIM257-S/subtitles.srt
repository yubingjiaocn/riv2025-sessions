1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,170
- Thank you, thank you.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,460
Hey, everybody.

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,920
I noticed that I am now
a Chief Product Office.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,660
The r is missing.

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,490
Good to have everybody here.

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,470
We're gonna, the game plan
for the next 20 minutes

7
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,920
is I'm gonna talk about
Reltio, the company,

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,900
we're gonna talk about our product,

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,020
we're gonna talk about
all the amazing movement

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,960
that we're seeing by building
agents on top of data

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,330
that is within Reltio.

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,170
So what is Reltio?

13
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,270
Let's start with that.

14
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:30,390
Reltio is a data unification platform.

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,400
The idea behind data unification

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,230
is that for any company
of a reasonable size,

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,130
they will have plenty of
data about their customers,

18
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,170
their suppliers,

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,110
different products that they sell,

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,500
and this data ends up
being in different parts

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,640
of their organization,

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,770
whether it's in different SaaS products,

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,022
whether it's a different databases,

24
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:57,990
you know, you have product
data in a warehousing system,

25
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,350
you'll have product data in an
e-commerce system and so on.

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,170
So, how do you bring all of this together,

27
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,080
unify this data to produce a single view

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,320
of authoritative view
of any of these nouns

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,090
that matter for your system?

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,750
So, what Reltio does is it brings together

31
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,400
this multi-source data

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,400
and gives you a trusted single view

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,800
on which you can build
your business operations

34
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,970
at the highest level.

35
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,540
Yeah, our approach has been to,

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,800
we started with a space

37
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,330
that is called Master Data Management.

38
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,490
Raise your hands if you know
what Master Data Management is.

39
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,840
Ah, okay, fantastic.

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,390
So, the idea of Master Data Management

41
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,490
was to bring together
multiple different records

42
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,150
and really manufacture a
golden record out of that.

43
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,800
And this definition of golden record

44
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,850
was fairly narrow, right?

45
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,850
You were talking about the
definition of an individual,

46
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,550
where they live, their
contact details, and so on.

47
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,350
And as this space has evolved,

48
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,010
this idea has become
less of a golden record

49
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,750
and much more of a trusted profile,

50
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,270
which are these sort of
very rich descriptions

51
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,720
of customers or suppliers and so on,

52
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,540
which have detailed amount of information

53
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,550
drawn from many, many different sources.

54
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,820
And this graph representation
of these entities

55
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,830
is maintained up to the second,

56
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,860
and it's available for
consumption via an API

57
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,940
or via the real-time
systems all the time, right?

58
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,360
And so, it's an evergreen data foundation

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,270
that a lot of other
processes can be built on.

60
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,350
Where Reltio sort of,

61
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,120
the way we approached it at Reltio

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,720
is to think of all of this
as a relationship graph

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,840
and different entity
types, their relationships,

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,522
and including a 360 view
of all the behaviors

65
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:45,360
that might be associated
with these entities.

66
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,590
So, in simple terms,

67
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,390
if you're talking about a customer,

68
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,030
a customer has an address, they have,

69
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,740
they also have a purchase
history with you,

70
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,800
they have clickstream,
which they've used to,

71
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,090
or they've browsed your website,

72
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,200
and therefore they have a clickstream

73
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,300
associated with that and so on.

74
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,170
So this complete 360 view
in a way that is connected,

75
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,540
every entity is connected
to everything else,

76
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,940
that really is the heart
of what Reltio represents.

77
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,250
Now, what the story,

78
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,740
you can also already
see it coming is a graph

79
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,850
is a very natural data structure

80
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,520
for large language models
to interact with, right?

81
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,830
So, on the left-hand side,

82
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,070
you see many, many different
data sources that can be used

83
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,020
to bring data into Reltio.

84
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,770
But the interesting bit is
on your right-hand side,

85
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,130
where you see the ability
to consume this graph,

86
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,416
either through applications

87
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,420
or by sending it into
different data warehouses.

88
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,010
But most interestingly,

89
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,190
our customers are building
agents on top of this data.

90
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,550
And that's really been an
amazing experience to watch.

91
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,900
I'll give you two examples.

92
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,380
CarMax, the biggest retailer

93
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,390
of used cars in the United States.

94
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,770
What they use Reltio for

95
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,310
is that they've organized
the data into 360s.

96
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,143
Why?

97
00:04:00,143 --> 00:04:01,560
Well, at the highest level,

98
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,170
the promise they have to their customers

99
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,870
is somebody can walk into a CarMax,

100
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,720
either buy or sell or buy and sell

101
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,670
and leave within 15 minutes,

102
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,670
so they have a transaction
business guarantee of 15 minutes.

103
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,020
How do they do that?

104
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,430
Well, to achieve that,

105
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,813
they have to organize,

106
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,560
by the way, they see a typical
vehicle in the United States

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,960
three times in the vehicle's lifetime.

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,130
Yeah, it's traded multiple times,

109
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,560
so it makes sense for
them to have a 360 view

110
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,390
of every vehicle they possibly can

111
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,550
so that they know as
much about that vehicle

112
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,320
as possible over time.

113
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,930
They also have a 360 view of prospects

114
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,180
or customers that they have
dealt with in the past,

115
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,390
and they have a 360 degree
view of their employees,

116
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,670
and for them, an transaction

117
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,900
is the combination of a vehicle,

118
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,580
a prospect or a customer,

119
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,400
and a salesperson who's made the sale

120
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,770
because their goal is not
just that the customer

121
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,990
can walk out within 15 minutes,

122
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,870
but also that they settle
with the salesperson

123
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,400
within that 15-minute window.

124
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,130
And the way to achieve
that business outcome

125
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,720
literally is to organize the data

126
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,730
that is friendly for that outcome, right?

127
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,410
And that's what's happening,

128
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,150
that's what they use Reltio for.

129
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,310
Now, a very, very different example,

130
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,670
completely different
industry, Warner Brothers.

131
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,100
Now, what is a product
for Warner Brothers?

132
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,750
It's their intellectual property,

133
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,850
are all the characters, right?

134
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,660
So if you're thinking
about "Looney Tunes,"

135
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,460
pick a character from "Looney Tunes,"

136
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,080
that particular character

137
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,380
has appeared in a certain
number of movies or cartoons,

138
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,989
they've appeared as merchandise
through different suppliers.

139
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:37,620
they have licensing agreements, right?

140
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,670
So, that is what constitutes
a 360 for Daffy Duck

141
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,780
or Roadrunner in this case, right?

142
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,330
And having that data be ready

143
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,170
to be then explored via
large language models,

144
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,540
that is what Warner Brothers uses us for.

145
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,890
So two very different examples,

146
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,520
but the point is the way
the data is organized

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,820
reduces the effort in
actually ingesting the data

148
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,200
and organizing the data,

149
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,080
and it makes the consumption of the data

150
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,390
is much more front and center, yeah?

151
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,560
So, if we think about this space,

152
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,380
bringing together data from
multiple different sources

153
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,150
and assembling it together,

154
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,190
this problem has been a problem

155
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,010
ever since we've had multiple SaaS systems

156
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,570
or multiple databases, right,

157
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,610
this data fragmentation problem.

158
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,620
And at the core of what
we're trying to solve for

159
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,210
is we were saying,

160
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,990
there's two or three or four
records that all indicate,

161
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,680
or they're all related to the
same individual, let's say.

162
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,090
How can we pick and choose

163
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,950
and connect these records

164
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,550
so that we have as much of a trusted view

165
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,530
of this customer as possible, right?

166
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,090
You're using first-party data,

167
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,850
you're also bringing in
third-party data to enrich

168
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,560
and get the output of this process

169
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,890
to be as high quality as possible, yeah?

170
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,850
But it's not all automated yet.

171
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,479
Even in 2020, let's say 2024, 2023,

172
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,720
there was still a lot of
manual effort being put in.

173
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,550
And if you think about
the larger the company,

174
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,410
the more the manual effort

175
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,340
in trying to make sure
that the data stewards,

176
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,420
that's the particular role,

177
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,700
data stewards are spending a lot of effort

178
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,700
making sure that the data is
as high quality as possible.

179
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,110
Now, of course, data quality itself

180
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,290
is a very interesting topic of discussion

181
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,520
because you can spend a lot of money

182
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,640
getting data quality the
highest level possible.

183
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,990
And the ROI on that,

184
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,540
it is really determined
by what is the application

185
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,920
of that particular data, right?

186
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,640
So data quality has to be
mapped to the business outcome

187
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,380
that that quality is looking for.

188
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,570
And so how much effort
you put into data quality

189
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,250
is sort of the second piece

190
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,860
that's been sometimes highly manual

191
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,840
and sometimes very expensive, yeah?

192
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,460
And the third thing is
complex data models,

193
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,510
as I described,

194
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,280
this space is about bringing together

195
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,800
different data models or data
from different data models

196
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,060
and combining it together

197
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,210
so that you have authoritative view

198
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,930
of that particular entity.

199
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,070
And there's complexity

200
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,570
in being able to map all these together,

201
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,950
and typically that's been done

202
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,720
from a manual point of view, right?

203
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,190
So these are the real problems.

204
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,360
If you think about,

205
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,857
you know, you say it's very easy to say,

206
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:15,960
"If you have your data organized well,

207
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,000
agents are going to behave well,"

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,490
or, "Trusted data leads to trusted AI."

209
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,230
But the how part is left
unsaid a lot of times, right?

210
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,350
And this approach that I'm
going to share with you

211
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,793
really goes to the heart of that how.

212
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:31,410
It's a very pragmatic approach

213
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,323
to how to get trusted agents.

214
00:08:33,323 --> 00:08:35,340
And so the goal that we set out on

215
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,980
is really to take this manual effort

216
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,450
in organizing this data

217
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,740
down by an order of magnitude

218
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,880
or two orders of magnitude,

219
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,073
automate as much of that as possible.

220
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,730
So here's what I'm gonna walk you through,

221
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,200
I'm gonna walk you
through a couple of demos

222
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,520
pretty quick here,

223
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,820
but just to orient you on our product set.

224
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,460
So at the base,

225
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,640
everything runs on a unified data cloud,

226
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,900
Reltio Data Cloud

227
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,580
that any of the products

228
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,330
that run on top of the data
cloud inherit the scalability

229
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,890
and the security aspects
that are built on top of AWS.

230
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,270
The two products that
we offered a year ago

231
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,960
are our multi-domain MDM and
our Intelligent 360 products.

232
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,070
And the way to think about it

233
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,420
is that multi-domain MDM

234
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,010
encapsulates everything that has to do

235
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,930
with entity information.

236
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,490
And then if you add behaviors,

237
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,510
if you wrap that around

238
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,430
to build a true 360 in real time,

239
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,620
that's the Intelligent 360 product.

240
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,000
And what we're gonna talk about today

241
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,580
is really the agents that the agent flow,

242
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,060
which is the layer on top
of these two capabilities

243
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,060
that delivers fully functional
agents in two regards.

244
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,937
The first agent,

245
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:46,650
and I'm gonna show you a demo of both,

246
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,850
the first type of agent,

247
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,240
class of agent is for
managing data itself.

248
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,590
So the data that's in the graph

249
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,710
that exists within MDM or
within Intelligent 360,

250
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,020
how can we manage that autonomously?

251
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,640
I'll show you an example of that.

252
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,603
And the second example is
once the data is managed

253
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,920
as pristine of a state as you can make it,

254
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,300
let's put it to use, right?

255
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,720
So how do you build an
application effectively

256
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,620
or an agent that's partially
doing what a CRM would do

257
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,890
or a a customer success system would do,

258
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,437
but do that as an application
that's built on top of data?

259
00:10:19,437 --> 00:10:22,770
And this is sort of the
data-first application movement

260
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,083
that's very much in play right now, yeah?

261
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,800
So let's look at the first scenario.

262
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,700
In this case, we are trying to solve

263
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,080
for data management,

264
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,420
we're trying to solve for duplicate data,

265
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,040
and here we go.

266
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,380
So, as you see, it's a
conversational interface.

267
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,360
There's really no mention of data,

268
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,800
yeah, anywhere in terms
of the interface itself,

269
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,630
and we're just asking a business question.

270
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,790
We're saying, "Hey, we're
seeing service delays

271
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,650
in our top 100 segment

272
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,940
and we suspect that there is some

273
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,710
data duplication going on."

274
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,960
So, the system at that point,

275
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,460
our agent is looking at
what does that top 100 mean?

276
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,500
And it's getting that definition

277
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,660
from the underlying data platform,

278
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,120
and it's able to then propose an approach

279
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,600
where it says, "I found what
that top 100 means for that,

280
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,150
each organization, I'm
gonna systematically look at

281
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,040
why that duplication is happening."

282
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Yeah, and it says

283
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,770
it gives you a simple option you can pick,

284
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,030
you know, as these,

285
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,410
I'm sure everybody's very familiar

286
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,480
with these sort of
interfaces at this point,

287
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,930
and it's identified that
there are two organizations

288
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,350
that actually have some
duplication in the data.

289
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,930
And then further it says,

290
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,090
it proposes a couple of actions

291
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,220
that are proposed for each one of those.

292
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,950
And it'll show us that

293
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,730
for this particular
organization, Solar Turbines,

294
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,010
there are, it goes attribute by attribute

295
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,520
and says, "Okay, well, I'm
looking at two versions

296
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,120
of information about this organization,

297
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,460
and I can see that there
are some mismatches

298
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,590
that are probably causing, you know,

299
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,600
for example, suboptimal shipping,

300
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,600
like you're shipping to the
wrong location and so on."

301
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,697
And so we say, "Okay."

302
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,110
By the way, it's also enriched this data

303
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,430
by looking up the internet, right?

304
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,560
That's one of the requests
we've always had from customers.

305
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,310
There's such a rich and
ever updated source of data,

306
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,150
the internet,

307
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,890
why can't that be brought in

308
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,530
to the data management platform?

309
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,240
And so it's sort of done all of that.

310
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,290
It's broadened this data

311
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,170
and it's created this level of automation

312
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,540
where if somebody had
to go and look this up,

313
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,090
they would very easily take 35-40 minutes

314
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,573
to go resolve this.

315
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:42,630
A data steward would very easily spend

316
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,710
30 minutes resolving this.

317
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,690
And so this took less
than a minute, right?

318
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,380
So just the savings in terms of doing

319
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,600
100 of these a day,
that's pretty enormous.

320
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,100
And of course, needless to say,

321
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,600
the whole thing can be automated, right?

322
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,010
It doesn't have to be conversational.

323
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,090
Everything is API driven,

324
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,130
so you can very easily wrap this up

325
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,353
in an even next level of automation.

326
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,370
The next demo I'm gonna show you

327
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,900
is around is more on that
next level of building,

328
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,310
being able to build applications

329
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,280
given that that data is already organized

330
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,660
in a proper manner.

331
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,190
And in this demo what we're showing

332
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,490
is there's customer data
and there's product data,

333
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,920
and a call is coming in from a customer

334
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,570
and our agent intends to show

335
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,730
the next-best product recommendation

336
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,073
or at least propose that to the agent

337
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:32,910
that so that they can
talk to the customer.

338
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,260
Of course, there's no assumption

339
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,754
whether it's a human agent
on this side of the phone

340
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:38,040
or an AI,

341
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,150
it doesn't really matter.

342
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,580
The point is, can we
produce a recommendation

343
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,330
down to the personalization of one, right?

344
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,600
If given as much data as
we have about the customer

345
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,010
and their past behavior,

346
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,480
can we actually build something

347
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,640
that is very, very customized for them?

348
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,790
So, very similar to the previous demo,

349
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,240
we'll drop into the
conversational interface.

350
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,333
And in this case, the
question we're asking is,

351
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:07,560
for a certain customer, we
provided a name Sarah Anne,

352
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,710
and please provide three
compelling product recommendations

353
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,870
and base that on her profile

354
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,500
and different relationships
that we see in the system

355
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,350
and different interactions
that they've had with us.

356
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,183
And so the system's looking for,

357
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,640
searching for that individual

358
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,650
and it finds a perfect match there.

359
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,150
And it's going through our MCP layer

360
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,570
and talking to our API, in this case.

361
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,640
And it says, "We found
a unique individual,

362
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,960
here's some information about them.

363
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,940
They're 46-year-old married female

364
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,587
from San Francisco, et cetera."

365
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,840
And we're seeing from them

366
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,450
that they have purchased from us recently,

367
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,860
there's a pattern there.

368
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,240
They're actually an enthusiast.

369
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,440
They interact with our blog

370
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,970
or some of our content.

371
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,150
And here is a set of recommendations

372
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,850
that she would most
likely be interested in.

373
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,090
And the thing on the left
is not interesting to me,

374
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,650
the thing on the right is more interesting

375
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,970
because that is the why.

376
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,430
Why is the agent
recommending certain things?

377
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,170
Yeah, because at the end of the day,

378
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,300
we have to be able to defend our decisions

379
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,733
to present something to a customer, right?

380
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,160
So, we go a step further,

381
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,170
we say, "This is great,

382
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,490
but if you look at the household,

383
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,200
perhaps she's interested
in buying something

384
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,000
for her household, somebody else,

385
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,500
a gift for somebody else,

386
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,850
not just something for herself,

387
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,920
so what would you recommend in that case?"

388
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,470
And so we look at

389
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,870
sort of the next surrounding circle

390
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,140
level in the tree,

391
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,090
and we find that the family

392
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,300
consists of Michael, Olympia and Sarah.

393
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,103
And Olympia, who's the daughter,

394
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,830
we have consent from her,

395
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:48,120
she's expressed consent
for new product launches.

396
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,730
So we could potentially position something

397
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,590
for Sarah in this case, right?

398
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,237
And the system goes through and says,

399
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:57,450
"For Olympia and Michael, in this case,

400
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,640
there is a specific kit
that we're recommending,"

401
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,560
and then the rationale
on the right-hand side

402
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,993
says why we're making
that recommendation, yeah?

403
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,270
It also, it'll scroll here in a second,

404
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,950
and to me what's interesting

405
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,740
is also the suggestion to the agent

406
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,000
who's having the conversation.

407
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,370
There's a communication strategy, right?

408
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,930
It is about how to present,

409
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,980
not just what to present,

410
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,780
but how to present this.

411
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,060
And that's based on a
certain amount of data

412
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,230
that's already in the system,

413
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,090
behavior that we've seen in the past.

414
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,650
And we'll actually ask the agent,

415
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,840
we'll say, "How much did you consider?

416
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,220
How much data did you consider?

417
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,050
How many data points did you consider

418
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,940
while making these recommendations?"

419
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,280
And it'll come up with an answer.

420
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,540
And in this case,

421
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,060
I think it's used 70 plus data points

422
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,640
from multiple different,

423
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,130
11 different sources and
multiple interactions

424
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,290
that it's had access to in the past.

425
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,150
And so what this shows you

426
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:55,050
is if you have data

427
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,850
organized a certain way,

428
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,850
then using agentic AI on top of that

429
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,603
almost seems simple and magical.

430
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,260
Conversely, think about
what you would have to do

431
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,700
if you're trying to create an agent

432
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,940
that is delivering you this outcome,

433
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,790
but your data is distributed
in five different databases,

434
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,500
multiple applications, right?

435
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,230
You'd be stitching together
all this information

436
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,253
when you need it,

437
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,610
and that becomes a very
expensive operation.

438
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,743
It becomes a very,

439
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,100
the outcomes become harder to predict

440
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,110
because on the other hand,

441
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,330
there's a customer, you're
trying to solve that problem

442
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,510
or present a proposal for the customer

443
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,640
and your system is busy sort of assembling

444
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,320
all this information together.

445
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,150
Yeah, so that, to me

446
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:46,590
is the real power of a
data unification system

447
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,910
where you have a graph ready
to consumed at all times

448
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,940
and you're not really spending
any engineering resources.

449
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,990
Once you've set up the graph,

450
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,903
it's ready to go at all times.

451
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,920
So a little bit about how we built this,

452
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,920
of course, we are powered
by AWS technology,

453
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,463
so we were one of the
earliest users of AgentCore

454
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,450
and the Strands,

455
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,810
Strands SDK.

456
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,350
So, the core of the agent
is built out using Strands

457
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,470
and for us, AgentCore,
as it has developed,

458
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,370
it's become really this sort
of super easy way to scale up

459
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,480
and not have to worry about

460
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,100
a lot of the non-functional aspects

461
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,720
or have to worry about

462
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,300
whether we'll have security taken care of

463
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,350
or access to memory so we
don't have to assemble memory

464
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,750
and web access, tooling and all that.

465
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,130
That kind of comes as a package,

466
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,930
and we can focus on really the value

467
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,973
that we are creating on top of that.

468
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,180
In a sense, the model
used doesn't really matter

469
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,820
because all these models are so capable.

470
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,850
I think as an ISV for us to create this,

471
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,480
it really is about getting
those non-functional aspects

472
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,313
to be testable.

473
00:19:01,313 --> 00:19:04,020
Because today if you're using Model X,

474
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,600
tomorrow it'll be Model X+1

475
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,340
and how to make sure that we're able

476
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,400
to actually give you the
same performance at scale.

477
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,780
Because remember, the customers,

478
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,340
our customers are some
of the largest companies

479
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,173
in the world.

480
00:19:15,173 --> 00:19:17,130
And so the ability to operate at scale

481
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,110
and yet go from one version of a model

482
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,460
to the next version of a model

483
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,140
and guarantee no regressions,

484
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,520
that's the sort of important thing

485
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,850
that a solution like
AgentCore provides us, right?

486
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,840
So we are very excited about

487
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,820
some of the policy-related announcements

488
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,070
that were made yesterday,

489
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,930
and really looking
forward to incorporating

490
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,643
some of that into the mix.

491
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,810
With that, I've shown
you a bunch of videos,

492
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,180
if you want to see the
real thing in action,

493
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,180
we are at both 1227.

494
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,380
I'll be there for a little bit,

495
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,213
happy to talk,

496
00:19:47,213 --> 00:19:48,900
but the Reltio team is there,

497
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,580
and we'd love to take questions there.

498
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,080
Really appreciate everybody's time.

499
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,423
Look forward to seeing you.
