1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,340
- [Morgan] Hey, everyone,
thanks for coming.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,140
Welcome to Best Practices for Performing

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,720
Custom Code Transformations
with Agentic AI.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,800
My name is Morgan Lunt.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,860
I'm a senior product manager
on the AWS Transform Team,

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,025
and I'm here with Venu.

7
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:13,437
- [Venu] Hey, I'm Venu Vasudevan.

8
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:15,990
I'm a senior specialist
solutions architect

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,943
with NextGen Developer Experience Team.

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,687
- [Morgan] This would be helpful.

11
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,470
(Venu chuckles)

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,000
So what we're gonna talk about today

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,560
is the challenge of technical debt,

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,910
which I'm sure you're
all very familiar with.

15
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,130
I'm not gonna spend too much time on that.

16
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,930
Some scaled remediation options,

17
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,040
things that you may be aware of

18
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,740
and some things that may be new to you.

19
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,500
Some best practices that we've
discovered internally in AWS

20
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,960
when managing tech debt
at significant scale.

21
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,400
And then the thing you're all here for

22
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,660
is the live code demo.

23
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,960
We'll actually show you
the tools that we use.

24
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,000
So the problem with tech debt,

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,640
it's big, it costs a lot of
money, it takes a lot of time,

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,290
it slows down your innovation

27
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,990
It prevents you from being able to deliver

28
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,820
new features to customers.

29
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,710
It prevents you from being
able to hire developers

30
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,940
that really understand your stack

31
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,920
and can contribute to it properly.

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,840
And it may bring security vulnerabilities

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,950
and all sorts of bad things.

34
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,293
So generally speaking, tech debt, bad.

35
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,990
Different kinds of technical debt.

36
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,760
You can have security
and compliance risks,

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,280
especially if you're in a
compliance-oriented industry

38
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,050
like healthcare or finance.

39
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,150
But even for any company,
a security vulnerability

40
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,150
can cause massive PR
issues, monetary loss,

41
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,790
all sorts of things that you
probably don't want to happen.

42
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,380
Maintenance burden.

43
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,450
Sometimes it can get to a
point where you're just doing,

44
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,620
feels like you're doing patching

45
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,020
and addressing vulnerabilities and CVEs,

46
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,580
and you're not actually spending time

47
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,010
developing things that
your customers want.

48
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,750
Performance limitations.

49
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,670
So your things can get slow.

50
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,750
They can get crufty.

51
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,820
You can have large applications built up

52
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,830
over 10, 20, 30, 40 years

53
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,140
that when they were initially
built were well designed,

54
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,140
but after caking mud on the
ball for many, many years,

55
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,560
it becomes unwieldy.

56
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,030
And this can also cost you money

57
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,780
in terms of being more
expensive to run on bigger VMs.

58
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,760
And finally, strategic misalignment.

59
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,040
So a lot of customers
that I've spoken with

60
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,830
work at companies that were
acquired by other companies,

61
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,080
and companies that are
acquired by other companies

62
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,850
may use a different tech stack

63
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,830
than the rest of the
companies in the portfolio.

64
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,020
So there's often a desire
within corporations

65
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,500
to have some sort of standardization
and internal alignment

66
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,090
for the tech stacks they use,

67
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,160
the libraries they use, the APIs they use,

68
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,540
the vendors they use, which are gonna have

69
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,093
their own different APIs,
and all that fun stuff.

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,260
So these are some customers
that I've worked with

71
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,480
pretty closely over this last year.

72
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,020
Air Canada has a big issue
with thousands and thousands,

73
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,720
I think tens of thousands
of Lambda functions

74
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,520
running on deprecated versions of Node

75
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,470
and deprecated versions of Python.

76
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,470
And due to compliance
and internal standards,

77
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,210
they desperately need to upgrade these,

78
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,880
and it takes a lot of
time and a lot of manpower

79
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,220
to go through every
single Lambda individually

80
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,060
and try to upgrade it

81
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,670
to the latest version of Node or Python.

82
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,520
Twitch, our friends inside of Amazon,

83
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,080
have a lot of Golang code.

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,550
They're kind of unique in Amazon.

85
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,580
Not a lot of people use
Go, but Twitch does.

86
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,760
And a lot of it's
written using AWS SDK v1.

87
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,100
They wanna migrate to AWS SDK v2.

88
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,600
They have over 900 applications.

89
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,040
I think they projected, originally,

90
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,370
11 developer years of
manual effort to do that.

91
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,500
QAD is a major ERP vendor.

92
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,870
They make software for manufacturers

93
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,900
that make products that
we all probably use.

94
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,270
They have a piece of software

95
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,240
that's evolved over 20-plus years,

96
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,580
and their customers have
built customizations

97
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,080
on top of this ERP software

98
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,440
to do things particular to that customer.

99
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,050
Super useful if you're a
customer and wanna augment

100
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,330
this off the shelf ERP with
your own functionality,

101
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,730
but over time this builds up cruft

102
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,160
and makes it very challenging for QAD,

103
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,660
for the vendor themself

104
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,540
to publish new versions of
their ERP 'cause everyone's got

105
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,460
kind of a one-off special little thing.

106
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,410
And so they have this challenge

107
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,690
of moving these
customer-done customizations

108
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,150
onto their common customization framework

109
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,980
on their newer platform versions.

110
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,870
And then MongoDB.

111
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,110
They and their customers
have a lot of Java code.

112
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,933
A lot of this Java code
is on Java 8, Java 11.

113
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,310
They really wanna get it up
to Java 21 or later versions,

114
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,083
and that's easier said than done.

115
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,250
So there's a lot of existing approaches

116
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,250
for doing code modernization at scale

117
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,930
in an automated fashion.

118
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,760
There's good old rule-based automation.

119
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,370
So this is stuff like ast-grep,

120
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,350
managing abstract syntax trees,

121
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,000
using something like OpenRewrite.

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,530
And these are good tools

123
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,570
if you can get them to do what you want.

124
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,270
They'll do it deterministically,
and they'll do it reliably,

125
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,150
but they can be kind of
brittle and kind of inflexible.

126
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,060
If you introduce a new piece of code

127
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,130
that isn't exactly following
the same conventions

128
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,220
as the ones that you wrote your
transformation recipe with,

129
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,900
it's probably not gonna work.

130
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,020
And it takes kind of some
specialized expertise

131
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,060
to write these sorts of recipes.

132
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,550
You have to know how to navigate
an abstract syntax tree.

133
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,400
You're kind of like writing
code to manipulate code

134
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,440
and dealing in this kind
of conceptual higher level,

135
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,930
and so it's a little tricky
if you haven't done it before.

136
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,510
And because of that, there's
a bit of a higher startup cost

137
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,580
in using approaches like that.

138
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,640
General purpose coding AI
has gotten really good.

139
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,890
The Kiros and the Cloud Codes
of the world are awesome.

140
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,723
You should all use them.

141
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:15,556
I love them.

142
00:05:15,556 --> 00:05:16,389
I use them a lot.

143
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,480
But one tricky part

144
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,940
about doing large scale code
modernization efforts with them

145
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,550
is that there's no easy way right now

146
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,750
to enforce consistency
across a bunch of developers

147
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,140
trying to do the same task
using those same tools.

148
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,670
I might ask a Kiro to do,
upgrade a Java runtime,

149
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,960
and it'll probably do it,

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,550
but it may follow different conventions

151
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,230
and different patterns
than if Venu does it.

152
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,640
And we're gonna end up with disparate code

153
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,810
that may not follow the standards

154
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,920
and use the right libraries

155
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,083
that my organization wants to use.

156
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,560
These tools tend to be designed

157
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,900
to be run with a human in the loop,

158
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,210
with a human sitting at
the keyboard, driving it,

159
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,010
watching what the agent does,

160
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,110
poking it this direction or that

161
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,630
which, again, fantastic if
you're doing something once,

162
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,210
not so fantastic if you're
doing it a hundred times,

163
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,260
a thousand times.

164
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,080
That human cost, even though
it's a significant acceleration

165
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,690
from someone sitting out
and doing this work themself

166
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,790
with no assistance, is still real.

167
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,490
There's still significant
cost to clicky-clacky,

168
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,503
driving a coding agent on the keyboard.

169
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,560
And another issue with doing it this way

170
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,140
is that teams' learnings remain siloed.

171
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,680
So if over the course of an
API migration, you discover,

172
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,790
oh, there's an incompatibility

173
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,560
between these two particular versions,

174
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
I had to do this workaround,

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,250
you learn that, you discover that,

176
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,500
but some other team on the
other side of the country,

177
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,430
on the other side of the world

178
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,220
that's doing the same
migration in your organization,

179
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,960
they're gonna go have to
discover that themself.

180
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,370
They're gonna run into the same issue,

181
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,350
and unless you're really
good about updating wikis

182
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,710
and looking at those wikis,
that that learning is lost.

183
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,690
You're gonna run into the
same problems several times,

184
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,390
and that's not as efficient as can be.

185
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,590
So what do we need?

186
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,870
We need a code transformation,

187
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,970
a scalable code transformation mechanism

188
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,800
that has a low barrier to entry.

189
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,150
It's easy to get started with,

190
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,430
doesn't take a lot of
specialized knowledge.

191
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,960
It's designed for automation.

192
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,720
It can be scripted together
and just kind of set up

193
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,053
to run in a headless, without
human interaction fashion,

194
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,120
something that you can teach once

195
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,560
and you can run it everywhere,

196
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,120
and that gets better every time

197
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,130
so you don't lose these learnings

198
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,223
that individual developers
are coming across.

199
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,780
Enter AWS Transform custom.

200
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,890
This is my baby.

201
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,030
I'm the PM on this product.

202
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,380
We've been working on
it for the last year.

203
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,390
This was released GA on Monday.

204
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,620
We're all very excited and proud of it,

205
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,570
and that's what we're gonna
be showing you in a minute.

206
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,590
So AWS Transform custom
is intended to discover,

207
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,170
to learn from you any
sort of code pattern,

208
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,190
API upgrade, runtime
upgrade, framework upgrade.

209
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,250
I have people doing things as
wild as converting VBA script

210
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,360
embedded in a Excel spreadsheet
to maintainable Python code,

211
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,500
and it's working okay for that.

212
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,810
Or rewriting bash scripts to Rye,

213
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,640
which is a Rust-based scripting language.

214
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,380
Like, the more I learn about
how customers are using this,

215
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,700
the more scared I become

216
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,853
because there are some
weird stuff out there.

217
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,020
Because you can teach it

218
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,310
your own custom code transformation,

219
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,680
you can do your weird stuff
with it, which is cool.

220
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,750
And because you are teaching the agent,

221
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,330
if it's doing it wrong, you
can tell it to do it different

222
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,090
and to do it better until
it does do the right thing,

223
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,740
and it does it consistently enough

224
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,010
that you feel comfortable to
start running it at scale.

225
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,090
It continuously learns.

226
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,110
It gets better every time.

227
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,480
We'll show you how that works in a moment.

228
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,940
And it's easy to run at scale.

229
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,830
So the main components
of AWS Transform custom

230
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,970
is our CLI, that you'll see in a moment,

231
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,920
which you interact with
using natural language.

232
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,753
So you tell it,

233
00:08:38,753 --> 00:08:41,730
hey, I wanna blah the
blah from blah to blah,

234
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,470
and it's gonna say, okay, cool.

235
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,310
What the heck is a blah?

236
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,870
Do you have some documentation on blah?

237
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,030
How do I go from blah to blah?

238
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,830
And we've encoded all these best practices

239
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,840
that we've discovered internally at AWS

240
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,960
for doing scaled code
modernization into the agent,

241
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,240
so it's gonna know the right
kinds of questions to ask you.

242
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,460
If you say, I wanna do an API upgrade,

243
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,830
it's gonna say, cool, do
you have the swaggers?

244
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,410
Do you have the the API documentation?

245
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,870
If you say you want to add
a whole bunch of test cases,

246
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,300
it's gonna say, okay, can
you give me an example

247
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,560
of, like, the kinds of style

248
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,210
you like your test cases to be written in?

249
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,640
Or if you want to emit
metrics in a different way,

250
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,470
it'll ask you for the schema.

251
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,990
So it shouldn't take, like, a
whole lot of domain expertise

252
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,430
to build this transformation

253
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,010
that you're gonna want to apply at scale.

254
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,080
Once you've built something
that you're comfortable with,

255
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,370
you're pretty happy with the performance,

256
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,350
you've tested it on a few repos,

257
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,810
executing it at scale is
really straightforward

258
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,023
because it is ACLI.

259
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:34,710
It's a CLI that can be driven by a human,

260
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,580
talking to an agent,

261
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,310
like you're all used to
doing these days, I imagine.

262
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,020
Or it can be driven by a machine.

263
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,290
So our syntax is totally
deterministic and machine drivable.

264
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,490
You put a bunch of commands,

265
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,860
a bunch of arguments in
a command telling it,

266
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,230
run this transformation on this repo

267
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,530
following these conditions
and blah, blah, blah,

268
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,400
and it'll just do it.

269
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,380
So it's really easy to
write a shell script,

270
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,120
to pull down your code
from wherever it is,

271
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,757
GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket...

272
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,740
I don't know, what other places...

273
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,080
And transform it and push
it where it needs to go,

274
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,480
send it for code review,
send it straight to prod.

275
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,873
I probably wouldn't recommend
that, but you do you.

276
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,210
Continual learning.

277
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,850
Both during execution of a transformation,

278
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,920
an agent is just gonna record notes

279
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,240
about what it encountered.

280
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,510
So if it goes down like a
really deep self-debug path,

281
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,520
trying to deal with some
weird incompatibility

282
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,350
it discovered during execution

283
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,390
and then I had to backtrack
and try something else,

284
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,830
it's gonna remember that next time

285
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,720
and try the shorter path.

286
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,330
Likewise, if you do an
interactive transformation

287
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,530
sitting there and watching the agent,

288
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,000
which is an option you can do,

289
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,860
and you see it going off
the rails, you can tell it,

290
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,140
hey, don't do that, do
this, it'll remember that

291
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,840
and hopefully not do it next time.

292
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,330
So how's the process work?

293
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,390
The first thing you do is
you have some sort of expert.

294
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,710
They could be on a centralized team.

295
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,660
They can be someone that
owns a particular service

296
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,640
that a lot of other teams are consuming,

297
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,620
someone who kind of
knows what they're doing

298
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,090
about this transformation.

299
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,410
They're gonna sit down with our agent,

300
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,600
and they're gonna describe what
they wanna do and go through

301
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,090
that transformation
definition building phase.

302
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,390
A transformation definition
is this term we invented

303
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,060
to represent the agent's understanding

304
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,650
of a particular transformation.

305
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,923
So it's a combination of
some markdown files, a RAG,

306
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:18,870
and a database of learnings

307
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,480
that the agents encountered
during its executions.

308
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,780
And this is something that
we consider to be your IP.

309
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,520
We don't look at it,
we don't learn from it.

310
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,200
If you wanna sell it, if
you wanna keep it secret,

311
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,200
if you wanna open source it,
that's none of my business.

312
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,540
The transformation that
you built is yours.

313
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,380
So someone's gonna create

314
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,570
an initial transformation definition.

315
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,250
They're gonna execute it a few times

316
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,680
on some local repos, and they're
gonna look at the output.

317
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,060
And they're gonna tell the agent,

318
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,190
you screwed this up, you
missed this edge case,

319
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,570
you should do this differently,

320
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,640
and it's gonna update that
transformation definition,

321
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,310
and then you run it again,
and then you run it again.

322
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,020
And hopefully, after three or four times

323
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,570
and not 30 or 40 times, it's
starting to get to the point

324
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,580
where you're like, okay, this
is, like, doing what I want

325
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,780
for the most part, cool.

326
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,680
At that point, you're ready
to share your transformation.

327
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,080
So we make that really easy
because we have this notion

328
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,780
of a transformation definition registry,

329
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,273
which is just something
within an AWS account.

330
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,510
If you give someone the
right IM permissions

331
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,820
and the transformation
definition is just a,

332
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,530
it's an honorable AWS resource.

333
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,760
We're not reinventing the wheel here

334
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,230
with permissioning and resources.

335
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,620
It's the concepts you already
know and you're used to.

336
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,600
You can make the transformation definition

337
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,150
available to other users
in your organization.

338
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,140
They can pull it down.

339
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,700
They can execute it on their code.

340
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,093
They can propose changes back
to it, and everybody is happy.

341
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,080
And once you have the
application owning team

342
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,240
somewhat happy with the quality,

343
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,590
you can start running it at scale.

344
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,630
And you can do that in the
form of a push campaign

345
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,360
if you like, where some central team

346
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,530
pulls down a whole bunch of code

347
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,260
from a whole bunch of teams,
executes a transformation,

348
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,420
and sends the resultant
code out to be reviewed

349
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,070
by the application owning team.

350
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,630
Or you can do it pull campaign style,

351
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,490
where you tell the application teams,

352
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,860
hey, you must blah the blah.

353
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,490
There's a top down mandate
that you must blah the blah,

354
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,230
but I'm gonna give you this thing.

355
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,100
You could try running it.

356
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,540
Hopefully, it does most of the job for you

357
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,340
and makes your life a little easier.

358
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,630
And humans verify, and
the continual learning

359
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,540
goes back into the
transformation definition.

360
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,670
Super cool, right?

361
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,580
We have been eating our own
dog food, as we do at Amazon.

362
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,410
We've built a whole
bunch of transformations

363
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,380
that we thought were useful
using this, and we have done

364
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,330
some pretty comprehensive
benchmarking on them

365
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,260
using internal AWS code
and some open source code.

366
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,380
And so we have this little
menu of transformations here,

367
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,277
notably, Java, Python, and
Node runtime version upgrades,

368
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:42,360
AWS SDK version upgrades
for those languages as well

369
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,510
that we are confident in,
that I'm putting my name on,

370
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,340
that we believe are pretty
good, and we give to you.

371
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,180
And you can just run them.

372
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,250
You don't have to create a
new transformation at all.

373
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,750
If you're trying to do Java, Python,

374
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,170
or Node runtime upgrades,
or AWS SDK upgrades,

375
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,003
just use these

376
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,720
and they should get you
most of the way there.

377
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,170
And if they don't, tell
me, and I need to fix it.

378
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,030
Beyond that, we have a
couple of early access things

379
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,470
that we've also released.

380
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,160
So a tech debt analysis/documentation
transformation.

381
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,050
This one's pretty cool.

382
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,490
It'll go through all of your code

383
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,070
if you've got something really
old and poorly documented

384
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,840
and generate what Venu and I think

385
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,930
is like a pretty comprehensive
documentation set of it,

386
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,480
including entity relationships,
sequence diagrams,

387
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,350
lots of pretty images, full
dependency trees and stuff.

388
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,200
It's like every way you could
think of to represent code

389
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,520
without having the code itself,

390
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,230
we try to to capture in here.

391
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,300
And as a bonus, it gives
you a little report in there

392
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,940
that says, hey, you're using
a super outdated version

393
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,010
of this and that and this,
and this is vulnerable,

394
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,680
and like, you might wanna
check these things out.

395
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,150
And then we also have an
upgrade that we're working on

396
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,010
with the Graviton team in AWS

397
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,280
to convert Java code that uses x86,

398
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,430
that has dependencies on
x86 libraries to Graviton.

399
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,800
That's early access, doing
pretty well in benchmarks.

400
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,440
We'll probably mainline
that one pretty soon.

401
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,610
These are no setup for you.

402
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,660
They're validated by us.

403
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,790
We have a pretty comprehensive
benchmarking infrastructure

404
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,970
to try to get the quality
on these really good.

405
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,950
Beyond that, you can build custom things.

406
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,690
You can build VBA to Python.

407
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,530
You can build something crazy and unholy

408
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,940
if you really want to.

409
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,610
I would recommend using
it for API upgrades,

410
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,960
language version upgrades.

411
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,150
You can use it for
language-to-language conversions,

412
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,090
but I would caveat, like,
in a localized context.

413
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,720
If you have like a 500,000
million line of code,

414
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,600
old dot net app and you
wanna reimplement it in Java,

415
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,100
you're probably not
gonna have a great time.

416
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,540
The models aren't quite that good yet.

417
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,160
But if you've got like
a whole bunch of scripts

418
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,960
that you wanna convert from
one language to another

419
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,400
that are relatively self-contained,

420
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,583
it'll work pretty well
for something like that.

421
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,220
Best practices, 'cause
that's what we're here for.

422
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,530
That's like the title
of this thing, I think.

423
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,060
Pilots.

424
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,190
Start building a transformation
that's not very hard

425
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,290
and then just run it on a
few things at small scale.

426
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,270
And that's how you get
a feel for the efficacy.

427
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,550
That's how you get a feel
for what it's going to cost.

428
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,250
So pricing for this is
entirely usage based.

429
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,930
It's based on agent minutes,

430
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,310
which is just kind of an abstraction

431
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,460
on top of our cost for
providing the service.

432
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,910
It's 0.035 cents per agent minute.

433
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,240
A typical thousand-line
Lambda costs about a buck.

434
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,060
I think a 5,000-line Java runtime upgrade

435
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,920
costs like four or five bucks.

436
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,550
We really intentionally
priced this thing very low

437
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,960
to make it up on scale.

438
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,810
So we want to incentivize
y'all to create transformations

439
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,450
that do what you wanna do and unleash them

440
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,073
and just build a lot of scale.

441
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,553
Plan, refine, pilot, I think
you all get the picture there.

442
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,120
And another best practice is
use your current workflow.

443
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,130
There's a lot of code
transformation products out there

444
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,570
that I've seen that kind of ask you

445
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,550
to onboard to a totally
new way of doing things,

446
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,260
and I think that's lame.

447
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,790
So we have intentionally built this

448
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,270
to be a CLI that has very
minimal dependencies,

449
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,030
that has a dependency on
Node, a dependency on Git,

450
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,160
and a dependency to have
an external connection

451
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,953
to our servers, to our AWS servers.

452
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,510
If you have a machine that
has a Linux environment...

453
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,730
MacOS also works, WSL also works.

454
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,310
Venu is gonna demo this on WSL.

455
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,400
Has those dependencies, you
can run your transformation.

456
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,440
So people stick it in pipelines.

457
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,360
People stick it in Docker containers.

458
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,670
People stick it in AWS Batch jobs.

459
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,590
People stick it on
laptops in their basement.

460
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,630
Like, I don't care how you run it.

461
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,520
Whatever works with your current way

462
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,430
of doing code modernization and
doing deployments and stuff,

463
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,680
it's designed to be
minimal and just slot in.

464
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,270
And I would be remiss if I did not plug

465
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,340
our AWS Transform web application.

466
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,820
So if you heard about
AWS Transform last year,

467
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,750
this is all there was to it.

468
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,830
We didn't have the CLI.

469
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,410
The CLI and custom is the
brand new thing this year.

470
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,140
But there is integration
between the CLI and the web app.

471
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,780
So if you are a program
manager, a campaign manager,

472
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,540
you're responsible for doing
a bunch of code transformation

473
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,010
at scale and you want a place

474
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,100
to get pretty charts and graphs
to show your boss and stuff,

475
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,710
all of the status of the
campaign that you're running

476
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,290
in the CLI is automatically populated

477
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,680
in the AWS Transform web app
where you have pretty charts,

478
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,500
pretty graphs, you can see what
repos have been transformed,

479
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,330
which ones have been validated.

480
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,970
And of course, you've got
the agentic chat there,

481
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,600
so you can ask questions about the data.

482
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,540
You can say, what proportion
of them fit these criteria,

483
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,880
how many got done in the last
week, which ones had failures,

484
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,180
whatever you wanna ask it.

485
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,350
All right, now the fun part.

486
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,460
- [Venu] Cool, yeah, thank you.

487
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,960
Thank you so much, Morgan.

488
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,210
I have a question for
you before I get started.

489
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,400
- [Morgan] Yeah.

490
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,330
- [Venu] Customer asked,
"Can I do Fortran to Python?"

491
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,730
What's your answer for that?

492
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,680
- [Morgan] How big is your Fortran?

493
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,640
That's the question, right?

494
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,230
If you have, like,

495
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,840
you can do hello, world, any
language to any language,

496
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,120
and beyond that, the
complexity, it varies.

497
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't want to, like,
over-promise to anybody.

498
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,720
We have a customer using some
weird esoteric old language

499
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,880
called Progress that I
had never heard of before,

500
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,810
that we didn't know if the model

501
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,420
was even going to understand,
and it totally groks it.

502
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,130
And they're putting, like, 100,000 lines

503
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,290
of code repos in there
effectively and making changes.

504
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,730
So again, I said best
practice, pilot, before.

505
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,563
Just try it.

506
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:05,580
It's cheap and easy to start and try.

507
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,440
We made the installation
as easy as possible.

508
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,890
It's one curl command to pull down our CLI

509
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,660
and start trying it out.

510
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,493
- [Venu] Cool, thanks.

511
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:14,670
Thanks for that.

512
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,093
Okay, let's now do some
coding, live coding, right?

513
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,320
So the way that I've set up is,

514
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,780
so Morgan talked about the
built-in transformations,

515
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,110
as well as the custom transformation
and doing it at scale.

516
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,410
So let's see if we can
do all of them, right?

517
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,900
So let's start with the out
of the box transformations,

518
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,170
and let's see how it works, right?

519
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,160
So the first thing is,

520
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,220
I mean, this is a command
line interface, CLI.

521
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,200
You can install it on your laptop.

522
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,020
So I'm gonna use a WSL
environment on Windows.

523
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,970
Mac and Linux is supported.

524
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,890
So I've already installed it,

525
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,910
and I'm just gonna start
with my first command.

526
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,760
So like Morgan mentioned, this can be run

527
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,150
as a interactive mode, as
well as non-interactive mode.

528
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,250
Non-interactive is basically
a bunch of commands.

529
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,270
You say, hey, ATX, run my
transformation on this repo.

530
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,590
They'll just go do it for you.

531
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,560
Or you can interact with
this, give some feedback

532
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,510
and do it interactively as well.

533
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,420
So we'll show both of
these modes right now.

534
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,690
So first thing, I'm gonna list...

535
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,210
Let's say, hey, atx custom,

536
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,590
that's AWS Transform custom,
definitions list, okay?

537
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,543
List all my definitions, right?

538
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,410
Okay.

539
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,960
Okay, so I have a bunch which I built,

540
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,560
but let's go through the
AWS managed ones, right?

541
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,440
So we have eight AWS
managed transformation,

542
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,420
which are out of the box, zero setup.

543
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,100
You can just get started.

544
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,760
There is AWS SDK v1 to v2, Node.js,

545
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,850
Python upgrades Boto2 to Boto3,

546
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,910
Python version upgrades,
Lambdas and non-Lambdas as well,

547
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,010
same thing with Node.js.

548
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,030
In early access,

549
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,310
we have the comprehensive
code base analysis,

550
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,430
which Morgan talked about,
and Java version upgrade,

551
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,940
again, it's both Maven,
Gradle build systems,

552
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,887
and x86 to Graviton.

553
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:11,460
And these are some of the user
transformation that I built

554
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,050
for demoing to customers and
for my personal use as well,

555
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,750
and this is the registry that you see.

556
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,180
So it's basically
published to the registry.

557
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,750
So once you publish it, any
user in your AWS account

558
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,750
who has access to this CLI
and proper IAM permission

559
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,170
should be able to view it.

560
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,320
Just download it and
run with their project.

561
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,153
- [Morgan] You're better than me.

562
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:37,380
When I demo it, I just use
the AWS internal registry,

563
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,080
and it shows, like, 350 transformations,

564
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,913
(Venu laughs)

565
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:41,929
which is good.

566
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:42,762
A lot of people internally are using it.

567
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:43,830
- [Venu] Yeah.

568
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,663
Awesome.

569
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:46,410
So let's start with the first one, right?

570
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,870
So I have a Lambda function here.

571
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,180
It's basically a to-do application.

572
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,970
So let's start by running
this transformation

573
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,640
on this Lambda function, right?

574
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,080
So...

575
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,300
And this is the command
that I'm gonna use, right?

576
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,970
Let's put this and then probably explain

577
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,970
what exactly I'm gonna do, right?

578
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,560
So this use case is basically,

579
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,260
hey, you're just going
to use out of the box.

580
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,090
You know what you're doing.

581
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,730
You have a bunch of Lambda
function, go run it, right?

582
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,470
Again, zero setup, just go run it

583
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,200
without creating your own
transformation, right?

584
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,260
So I'm gonna say, hey, atx custom exec.

585
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,880
Exec is execute.

586
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,380
And this is, -p is where is
my lambda function located.

587
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,030
- [Morgan] The file path on local disc.

588
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,590
- [Venu] Yeah, local disc.

589
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,280
And -n is the Python version upgrade

590
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,860
that you saw from the out of the box list.

591
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,920
C is, I mean, the bill
command that needs to be used.

592
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,540
So in case of this Python,

593
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,670
I'm just going to use no operations.

594
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,460
But for Java, you'd
use a mvn clean install

595
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,810
or something like that, right?

596
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,690
And the configuration is
basically additional context

597
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,340
that you could give, right?

598
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,700
That's the, basically,
what validation command

599
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,500
I need to use, right?

600
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,810
You can say, hey, I'm
gonna just run pytest

601
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,520
to make sure all unit tests pass.

602
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,540
And you can also give,

603
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,680
it's basically freeform.

604
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,990
You can give additional context here

605
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,730
of running this execution, right?

606
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,680
And I'm gonna say, hey...

607
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,660
Since this is very generic,

608
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,600
it can go from any Python
version to any Python version.

609
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,913
So I'm gonna say, hey, go to Python 3.3.

610
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,180
- x is basically non-interactive,

611
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,250
which means, hey, go run it.

612
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,160
And then -t is trust all tools.

613
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,740
So in case of interactive mode,

614
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,290
you might need to trust tools

615
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,640
to write files, read
files, all those things.

616
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,800
So I'm gonna say, hey, trust all my tools,

617
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,110
go and execute it, okay?

618
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,093
So let's execute this.

619
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,513
All right, so it started the
transformation right now.

620
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,990
Let's see what it does right now.

621
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,070
So basically, the first step,

622
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,170
it's going to create a conversation log

623
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,120
where you can track all the progress

624
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,640
and monitor all the progress
on the conversation log.

625
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,950
And you can resume these
conversations as well.

626
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,320
Accidentally, your
network got disconnected

627
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,830
and you control c-ed it,
there is a conversation id.

628
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,510
You can just resume this conversation.

629
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,470
That's a neat feature

630
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,890
because, I mean, sometimes
things happen, right?

631
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,030
Internet breaks down and
you have to reconnect,

632
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,743
you can do that here, right?

633
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,600
Okay, so let us do this job, right?

634
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,670
And I'm gonna show you an output,

635
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,574
what I did earlier in the day
for the same transformation,

636
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:35,820
how this is gonna look like, right?

637
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,200
So I have a dryrun folder here.

638
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,260
I just ran the same
transformation earlier in the day.

639
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,430
So basically, it ran

640
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:45,990
and it created the plan,

641
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,540
it created the, completed the changes,

642
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,720
and it basically converted
my Python function

643
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,913
from 3.8 to 3.13.

644
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,153
And let's see some of
these changes, right?

645
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,220
Because this transformation
might take anywhere

646
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,540
between 10 to 15 minutes,

647
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,380
I don't want you to just stare
at my screen, so we just-

648
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,910
- [Morgan] We are working
to make it a little quicker,

649
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,190
but we figured it's better
to be slow and right

650
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,540
than fast and wrong.

651
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,830
So we optimized for right.

652
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,150
Now, we're gonna optimize for fast.

653
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,410
- [Venu] Yeah.

654
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,243
Cool, yeah.

655
00:25:17,243 --> 00:25:19,440
So this is the same project.

656
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,500
So it did a 3.8 to 3.13 migration.

657
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,920
And so it basically did a runtime upgrade,

658
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,920
and datetime was modernized
in this new versions,

659
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:36,330
and it also added 17 to
32 passing test cases.

660
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,723
And again, it documented what it did.

661
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,820
It also did improve
interpreter performance.

662
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,110
And this is all built in.

663
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,490
I didn't give any instruction.

664
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,472
It is all built in, right?

665
00:25:49,472 --> 00:25:51,990
And it did not change any business logic,

666
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,100
no braking changes.

667
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,823
All those things are kept.

668
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,670
Okay, so it updated the readme.

669
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,770
These are the files changed.

670
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,000
I just did a git diff.

671
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,670
So what it does is once
it makes the changes,

672
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,040
it actually creates a local branch for you

673
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,570
and commits all these changes,

674
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,910
so which means at any point in time,

675
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,470
you can go to the comment ID, roll back,

676
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,710
or you can just compare and then review it

677
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,440
and then check it in or
push your code changes.

678
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,460
- [Morgan] It's especially useful

679
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,080
if the agent, like, does the right thing

680
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,000
for, like, the first three
quarters of the transformation

681
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,020
and then goes off the rails.

682
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,820
And you're like, I don't want
all that work to be wasted.

683
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,659
Like, you could just
revert to the previous-

684
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:29,520
- [Venu] Exactly.

685
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,980
Okay, so some of these
files had basically changed.

686
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,770
All the time zone things and
the main Lambda function,

687
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,350
it changed a few of the functions,

688
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,300
and also, requirements.text.

689
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,605
And it also changed the template.yaml.

690
00:26:41,605 --> 00:26:44,790
I think this is a cloud
formation template I had.

691
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,390
So it changed from 3.8
to 3.13 for deployment.

692
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,920
And it also, it changed deprecated APIs,

693
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,900
documentation updates, all those things.

694
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,473
So again, just to summarize this,

695
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,740
just go run this out of
the box transformation

696
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,850
if you have a very similar use
case for your project, right?

697
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:09,420
So yeah, that's the first
thing that I wanna show, right?

698
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,493
Anything you wanna add in out of the box?

699
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,860
- [Morgan] No, I think that's good.

700
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,940
- [Venu] Cool.

701
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,090
Okay, let's now come to
the fun part where...

702
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,090
How do you wanna create your
custom transformation, right?

703
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,710
So here, I wanna show an internal library

704
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,650
that our internal team
used the same product

705
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,310
for migrating a internal ticketing system.

706
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,140
So we had something called Fluxo,

707
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,930
which Amazon's internal
ticketing system uses,

708
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,073
that's very old,

709
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,770
very hard to maintain,

710
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,290
so we wanted to change to
something called Tickety.

711
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,910
That's also an internal system,

712
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:49,910
but that's more API driven
and more performance oriented.

713
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,330
So that's why we wanted to
change all of our projects

714
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,330
which uses Fluxo to
Tickety library, right?

715
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,980
So that's, again, Java based,

716
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,323
but this is very specific to Amazon.

717
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:05,250
The large language models does not have

718
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,990
pre-trained data on these things.

719
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,310
So that's where the power comes in,

720
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,810
where you can feed in data or
context from your organization

721
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,960
to teach the agent how to do these stuff,

722
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,320
and then so it can do
that migration at scale.

723
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,180
- [Morgan] If you've got some
weird proprietary library

724
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,010
that no one else in the world uses,

725
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,840
that's what we're trying to show here.

726
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,130
- [Venu] Yeah.

727
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,083
So let's go do this one.

728
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,703
Okay, so,

729
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,293
let's go here.

730
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,520
Okay, the other thing I
want to also mention here

731
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,740
is this connects to MCP servers,

732
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,900
which means that you can pull in data

733
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,820
pretty much from anything, right?

734
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,820
So I have this Fluxo
ticketing migration guide,

735
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,190
which we have prepared,

736
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,900
and then I've just put
it into my GitHub repo.

737
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,830
It's a private repo.

738
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,280
So I'm asking

739
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,710
ATX custom to pull in doc information

740
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,290
from my internal repositories

741
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,600
and then use it as part of your creation

742
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,810
of the transformation definition, right?

743
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,000
So I'm gonna do this
in an interactive mode.

744
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,920
I'm just gonna say ATX.

745
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,690
That will open an interactive shell

746
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,100
where you can interact with it.

747
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,990
So I'm gonna create a definition

748
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,660
based on the migration guide that I have,

749
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,170
and then review it, give feedback,

750
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,297
then execute the transformation on that.

751
00:29:30,297 --> 00:29:32,474
- [Morgan] And the cool thing
about this guide, by the way,

752
00:29:32,474 --> 00:29:34,114
if this is that guide I sent you-

753
00:29:34,114 --> 00:29:34,947
- [Venu] Yes.
- [Morgan] This is a guide

754
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:36,360
that was written for human users in Amazon

755
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,460
published to a wiki to
go and do this work.

756
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,960
Like, someone already wrote this guide

757
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,730
assuming developers were
gonna have to do it,

758
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,210
so we're just giving that to
the agent, no extra effort.

759
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,350
- [Venu] Yeah.

760
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,613
So I'm just gonna say, hey,
create a new transformation.

761
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,610
Okay, and this is the interactive mode.

762
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,640
Okay, so it's gonna ask you,

763
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,960
hey, what do you wanna do, right?

764
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,820
Language upgrades, framework migration,

765
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,067
library upgrades, all those things.

766
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:10,067
I'm just gonna say
internal library migration

767
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,060
from Fluxo to Tickety.

768
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,090
Again, the large language
model does not know

769
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,530
what the hell is Fluxo or Tickety, right?

770
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,230
That's where I'm gonna give
more information, right?

771
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,240
First, it searches in the registry

772
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,590
if somebody already created
this definition or not.

773
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,857
If not, it's gonna
create a new one, right?

774
00:30:38,721 --> 00:30:39,900
Okay, so it's asking me,

775
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,880
hey, what kind of
application libraries it has?

776
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,110
What are the main functionalities?

777
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,910
What programming language it uses?

778
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,370
Hey, do you have any
migration guide documentation,

779
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,990
example code that you can give me,

780
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,150
that I can learn from it, right?

781
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,263
I'm gonna just say,

782
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,453
okay...

783
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:03,110
It referred to this dot md file
using my GitHub MCP server.

784
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,840
It takes a bit for connecting

785
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,940
and getting the right information,

786
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,333
basically started using the MCP tool.

787
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,393
Again, trusting this tool.

788
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,920
- [Morgan] You can also just
give it a local file path

789
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,968
to a file on disc.

790
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:24,840
- [Venu] Yeah, you can
download it and give...

791
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,160
But I just wanted to show the-

792
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,390
- [Morgan] Yeah.

793
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,223
- [Venu] Power of, hey, you can connect

794
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:29,763
to your existing environments.

795
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,760
Okay, so...

796
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,553
Okay.

797
00:31:37,307 --> 00:31:41,883
Always fun with a live demo,
but yeah, it's doing it.

798
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,270
Okay, while this is running,

799
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,700
I think I was talking to
one of the customers here,

800
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,520
they had a use case for...

801
00:31:56,852 --> 00:31:58,530
I have a prompt already written

802
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:02,910
using Kiro for increasing my
unit test coverage, right?

803
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,460
Can I do it on thousands
of my repositories?

804
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,990
Yeah, absolutely.

805
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,370
That's where the power comes in.

806
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,020
Hey, you already solved this problem,

807
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,230
automation problem once
with your existing AI tools.

808
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,560
Now you want to expand it or
scale it to all other teams,

809
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,910
you could definitely do that

810
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,970
with creating your own
custom transformation.

811
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,800
- [Morgan] Another scenario
I've heard of from customers

812
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,790
that I thought was pretty cool

813
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,830
is if you wanna make your code AI ready,

814
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,980
like you wanna write a
claude.md, a kiro.md file

815
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,900
for every repo under your ownership

816
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,520
and you wanna follow certain conventions

817
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,040
but incorporate aspects of the code there,

818
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,180
you can define how you want
those agent guide files to look

819
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,920
in Transform custom and have it go

820
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,470
just write all of those
files for all of your code.

821
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:46,239
- [Participant] So one thing is

822
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:48,164
when you have multiple problems

823
00:32:48,164 --> 00:32:51,601
and you can see it sequentially
one after the another,

824
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:55,268
and one from the file
and the other from...

825
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:05,142
One prompt without an output,
and then another prompt

826
00:33:05,142 --> 00:33:08,809
which rather than an
output, has an input...

827
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,000
So the sequential exhibition
of multiple count,

828
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,456
it's kind of a...

829
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,910
- [Morgan] So it's not exactly

830
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,830
a sequential execution of prompts.

831
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,380
There's several agents under the hood.

832
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,320
There's a planning agent,
and an orchestration agent,

833
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,130
an execution agent.

834
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,230
So the first thing it does when
you execute a transformation

835
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,210
is it's gonna look at the
transformation definition,

836
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,280
which itself has some steps and guidance.

837
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,010
It's gonna look at the code
you're asking it to operate on,

838
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,590
and it's gonna say, okay,
given these instructions

839
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,180
and this code, let me develop a plan

840
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,750
for doing this execution on
this particular piece of code.

841
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,250
And it will show that to you if you like,

842
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,200
and you can approve it or
tell it to make changes,

843
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,940
and then it's gonna go
through those steps.

844
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,900
And each of those is kind
of sort of like a prompt,

845
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,700
but there's sub...

846
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,110
It's not just a single one shot.

847
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,210
There's sub-steps in between
it because after each step,

848
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,190
the agent is going to
call a validation agent.

849
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,320
It's gonna make sure, hey,
does this code still build?

850
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,520
Does what I,

851
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,310
the action I performed in
this step actually fulfill

852
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,788
the original intent of this
step based on the plan?

853
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:16,543
- [Participant] Those things
are there in the prompt

854
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:19,671
I have the validation steps
as part of the prompt.

855
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:21,421
Everything's covered.

856
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,852
So do I need to remove it?

857
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:28,269
- [Morgan] I see.

858
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:37,429
- [Participant] And the
reason why validation...

859
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:39,512
Validates what it does...

860
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,710
- So what I would do is
I would take that prompt,

861
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,570
I would give it to AWS Transform

862
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,270
during the transformation
creation process and just tell it,

863
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,640
here's a prompt I wrote
for Kiro to do blah.

864
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,030
And it's gonna say, cool,
let me look at this prompt,

865
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,140
and there should be aspects of it

866
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,460
that are directly applicable,

867
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,600
and I'm just gonna incorporate that

868
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,330
into my transformation definition.

869
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,030
There's aspects I may ask
for your clarification on.

870
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,390
But it's gonna take that
kind of raw information

871
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,850
and put it in the
structured way that it knows

872
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:24,090
effectively executes
transformations with this thing.

873
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,020
- [Venu] That's where the
refined part also comes in

874
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,570
where you saw, right?

875
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,780
Once it generates, basically
converted your prompt

876
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,950
into its own, what we
call as the definition.

877
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,260
That's where you can
review it, you can edit it,

878
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,030
or you can just give feedback saying that,

879
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,310
hey, I really don't like
this validation step.

880
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,920
Can you add more, right, to this phase?

881
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,877
It should be able to accommodate that.

882
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:48,627
- [Participant] And then it would be...

883
00:35:48,627 --> 00:35:50,794
If I have three prompts...

884
00:35:55,794 --> 00:35:57,690
- [Venu] I mean, that's something

885
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,550
you need to experiment, right?

886
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:03,180
First, I would start with
one, how it creates it.

887
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,610
If that's not what you wanted,

888
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,680
maybe split it into multiple parts.

889
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,300
If everything can be contained,
yes, multiple prompts.

890
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,180
But again, as Morgan told,
it's basically a CLI.

891
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,810
So you create three transformation,
execute this in a batch,

892
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,000
should be able to do that as well.

893
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,290
- [Morgan] When in doubt,
I like to tell people

894
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,090
to break down problems
as small as possible,

895
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,320
as atomically as possible

896
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,120
'cause you'll get better results there.

897
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,580
But for really simple things,
you can mash them together,

898
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,850
and it'll probably work and
might save you a little effort.

899
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,683
- [Venu] Yeah.

900
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:35,702
Okay, cool.

901
00:36:35,702 --> 00:36:37,470
It actually created a
transformation definition,

902
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:40,353
so let's look at the
transformation definition.

903
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:42,803
Okay.

904
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,983
Wow, it really is very comprehensive.

905
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,730
Okay, so this is the
transformation definition

906
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,720
that it created, right, for
the Fluxo to Tickety migration.

907
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,673
So let me, oops.

908
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:02,100
Okay, so it has a clear objective.

909
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,670
Hey, migrate code from my
deprecated Fluxo ticketing library

910
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,210
to modern Tickety SDK.

911
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,270
And what is the summary,
what exactly it's gonna do?

912
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,004
What is the entry criteria?

913
00:37:14,004 --> 00:37:14,837
Entry criteria is basically,

914
00:37:14,837 --> 00:37:17,700
hey, how do you wanna
take this code in, right?

915
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,700
So here, it says code imports
uses the Fluxo Java client.

916
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,140
That's the entry criteria, right?

917
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,640
- [Morgan] Entry criteria
is really cool, by the way,

918
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,810
because that's how the agent knows

919
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,610
does this transformation
apply to this code.

920
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,940
So if you point the agent at
a whole bunch of random code

921
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,790
that does not use Fluxo, it's
gonna read it a little bit

922
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,550
and be like, this doesn't apply, skipping.

923
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,010
So in the near future, we'll
have an assessment capability

924
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,620
where you can point the agent
at a whole bunch of code

925
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,320
and it'll tell you before
even transforming anything,

926
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,150
these transformations apply to this code,

927
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,483
and you can kinda stage it
out how you wanna do it.

928
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,220
- And implementation step

929
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,293
is basically step by step instruction.

930
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,280
It basically got information
from the migration guide

931
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,050
how to do this transformation.

932
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,780
First, hey, step one, update
the build dependencies,

933
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,780
and it basically broke it
down into these projects.

934
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,010
and client initialization,

935
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,073
hey, basically, how to
initialize the new client,

936
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,720
and basically covered
for Python type script,

937
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,070
all those things as well,
and get ticket operation.

938
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,293
All the APIs are also covered, right?

939
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:30,060
So these are the
implementation steps, right?

940
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,620
This is where as a domain
expert, you can come in and say,

941
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,320
hey, it looks good, it doesn't look good,

942
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,860
do we wanna change it or, or not, okay?

943
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,883
Okay, the last thing is the
validation criteria, right?

944
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,640
Yep, so the validation or exit criteria.

945
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,700
What is the goal that it want to,

946
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,230
the agent wants to achieve?

947
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,760
How am I going to satisfy?

948
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,570
So this is where, again,
we need to be very cautious

949
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,970
on how do we define this
validation criteria.

950
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,830
It could be just simple as,

951
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,430
hey, my build and unit test pass, right?

952
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,870
Or it could be very complex as...

953
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,760
So one of the customer's actually doing

954
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,410
an Angular to React migration.

955
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,840
They actually use a Playwright MCP server

956
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,040
to compare visually, hey,
my Angular and React,

957
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,150
does it look the same?

958
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,223
So it could be complex as that, right?

959
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:26,790
Or it could be deploying
it to an AWS environment,

960
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,080
checking if it works or not.

961
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,071
So that's where your expertise comes in.

962
00:39:32,071 --> 00:39:32,910
How do you wanna validate

963
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,957
if this migration is successful or not?

964
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:41,520
All right, so this created a
good transformation definition.

965
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,310
And as a human in the
loop, you can view it.

966
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:48,150
You can modify it based on
the feedback, or apply it,

967
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,040
or publish to the registry, okay?

968
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,703
So let's apply it first
for a sample project.

969
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,750
Okay, so now it's asking me,

970
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,393
hey, where is your code repository?

971
00:40:06,393 --> 00:40:08,400
And I'm gonna give this.

972
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,299
This is, again, one of the
sample projects that I have

973
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:15,330
which is in Fluxo that I
wanna migrate to Tickety.

974
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,753
Okay, so I'm gonna say,
okay, go ahead with this.

975
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,550
Now, again, it's gonna do the same thing.

976
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,940
It's gonna go analyze the entry criteria,

977
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,940
all the project files, and start
the transformation project.

978
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,060
So as Morgan described,
first, it does a planning,

979
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,520
so where it plans, hey,
how am I going to apply

980
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,100
this definition on this
current project, right?

981
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,380
What are the file changes
that needs to be done?

982
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,670
Again, here, you have an
option to modify the plan,

983
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,570
give some input.

984
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,840
Hey, this step does not
apply to this project,

985
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,250
so skip it, right?

986
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,780
You can do those things.

987
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,430
And then once the plan is approved,

988
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,760
it goes onto the execution mode, okay?

989
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,323
So let's see the plan creation.

990
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,510
Anything you wanna add to
the planning or the steps

991
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,473
while it plans?

992
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,210
- [Morgan] The important
thing to know is that

993
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,400
it's totally optional to review the plan.

994
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,443
You can tell the agent, just go for it.

995
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,980
It just depends on how
hands on you wanna be.

996
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,750
That's why, I mean, as
we've mentioned before,

997
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,820
this thing can run and very human driven,

998
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,620
like you're watching every
operation that it does,

999
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,630
approving every tool use that it does,

1000
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,460
watching every file
manipulation that it does.

1001
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,740
And you can always
control C it and pause it

1002
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,200
and tell it, don't do that, do this.

1003
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,450
So if you've got something
really complex or a piece of code

1004
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:48,330
that you're very sensitive
about or whatever,

1005
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,920
you can watch it every step of the way

1006
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,410
and very carefully guide it.

1007
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,020
Or you can YOLO mode it and just tell it,

1008
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,610
do your best at everything.

1009
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,320
It depends on how confident you are

1010
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,000
in the quality of your transformation,

1011
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,090
how risky this transformation
is to you and all that.

1012
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,090
So you can be anywhere on that spectrum.

1013
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,013
- [Venu] Yeah.

1014
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,510
Another thing is, and
while, during the execution,

1015
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,130
it also, the validation, right?

1016
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,150
It validates it.

1017
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,600
And if there are any errors,
it self-debugs the errors

1018
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,130
and fixes as well, right?

1019
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:23,550
We do have a self-debug
and validation agent,

1020
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,617
which does that automatically for you.

1021
00:42:25,617 --> 00:42:28,620
- [Morgan] And if it can't
fix them, we try very hard.

1022
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,110
So LLMs like to do this
fun stuff where they really

1023
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,870
so badly want to say
that they did the job.

1024
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,790
I mean, we've tried to
beat that out of the agent

1025
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:38,250
as much as we possibly can.

1026
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,990
Early iterations of
this would delete tests

1027
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,570
to say all the tests passed,
like, all sorts of crazy stuff.

1028
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,800
It's awful.
(Venu chuckles)

1029
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,350
So we've built as many
guardrails as we could think of

1030
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,000
to prevent this sort of behavior

1031
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,560
and try to enforce some honesty here.

1032
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,307
So if the agent is like, I
did five out of seven steps,

1033
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:54,810
and I had trouble with these two,

1034
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,100
and here's the trouble that I had,

1035
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,590
like, we really try to make it honest,

1036
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,200
because if you just go pop
this into Claude or something,

1037
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,960
there's a good chance, like,
everything will look rosy

1038
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,670
until you dig into it.

1039
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,430
That's something that we've
encountered previously.

1040
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,590
- [Participant] You guys
seem to be very focused

1041
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,920
on code itself, like language code.

1042
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,200
We have a challenge with cloud formation

1043
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,030
and modernizing the CDK.

1044
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:18,863
- [Morgan] Mm-hmm.

1045
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:19,696
- [Participant] Is that the kind of thing

1046
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:20,529
that this tool could do?

1047
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:21,630
- [Morgan] There's people
doing Terraform to CDK

1048
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,800
right now with this.

1049
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,500
The way I think of it is if
you've got any structured text

1050
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,120
and you want to turn
it into structured text

1051
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,520
that looks different, yeah,
we could do that, yeah.

1052
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,990
- [Participant] And then
you spoke a little bit

1053
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,970
about deployables, right?

1054
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:35,220
So like, actually deploying into accounts

1055
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,440
and validating the deployments worked,

1056
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,740
being able to blue to
green, or compare A to B

1057
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,355
between what was there and
what could be there, right?

1058
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:44,955
It's all capable?

1059
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,893
I know to some degree, right?

1060
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:47,726
- [Morgan] It's possible

1061
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:49,440
if you build the scaffolding
around it, right?

1062
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,850
Like, we're giving you,

1063
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,090
put in text files and have
different text files come out,

1064
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,590
and you can build the
scaffolding around it

1065
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,180
to deploy it and return to the agent

1066
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,030
information about validation
results and stuff.

1067
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:00,877
- [Participant] With the CLI tool

1068
00:44:00,877 --> 00:44:03,420
being the sort of
mechanism for interaction.

1069
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,191
So you're scripting around that tool-

1070
00:44:05,191 --> 00:44:06,024
- [Venu] Correct.

1071
00:44:06,024 --> 00:44:06,857
- [Participant] To get it to do

1072
00:44:06,857 --> 00:44:07,770
the other things that you want it to do,

1073
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,420
but then turning to that client

1074
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,070
to do the transformations
that are necessary.

1075
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:11,903
- [Morgan] Exactly.

1076
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,320
And honestly, like, I've seen

1077
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,850
two extensibility approaches taken,

1078
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,860
and it kind of depends on
what's working better for you.

1079
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,450
So you can wrap our CLI
tool in your own stuff,

1080
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,300
or you can tell our tool to
call external shell scripts,

1081
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,960
external MCP tools, and
both approaches work.

1082
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,713
It just kind of is, it's what's
better for your scenario.

1083
00:44:32,194 --> 00:44:33,714
- [Participant] Are the transformations

1084
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:34,547
importable, exportable?

1085
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,828
Can you run them to multiple...

1086
00:44:36,828 --> 00:44:38,460
(Morgan laughs)

1087
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,420
- [Morgan] One of my core tenets

1088
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,890
when we wrote the product
requirements for this

1089
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,930
was that they would be
importable and exportable

1090
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,970
because as far as I'm
concerned, this is your IP.

1091
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,200
I don't want anything to do with it.

1092
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,000
Keep it secret, open source, it, whatever.

1093
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,353
That's the customer's.

1094
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,620
They are fully exportable right now,

1095
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,200
and they are 90% re-importable.

1096
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,620
And the reason I have that
asterisk is because the RAG

1097
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,630
or the knowledge items that it discovers

1098
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,130
during an execution,

1099
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,810
rehydrating the RAG database
where we store those

1100
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,920
is not something that
we have gotten around

1101
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,860
to being able to do on the import side.

1102
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,510
So you can absolutely export it,

1103
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,520
and you can mostly reimport it,

1104
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,596
and we're getting that too to 100%.

1105
00:45:17,596 --> 00:45:18,840
- [Participant] Can you distribute this

1106
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,980
around an organization?

1107
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,680
Like, I know you guys were
talking about within an account.

1108
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,092
But I mean, we're running this,

1109
00:45:25,092 --> 00:45:26,329
we're running an organization,

1110
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:28,170
so could we have a central
account where this stuff lives

1111
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,913
and then be able to distribute that out

1112
00:45:29,913 --> 00:45:30,820
across the organization?

1113
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,860
- [Morgan] Cross account sharing

1114
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,150
is something that is on our list.

1115
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,800
It is not there yet.

1116
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,140
But in the interim, you can export it.

1117
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,070
Literally, when you export it,

1118
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,840
it comes out as a zip file
with a bunch of stuff.

1119
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,210
And then reimport it, and
you're not going to lose much.

1120
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,710
And I can talk through what you'll lose

1121
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,600
and how to get around it.

1122
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,010
Yeah.

1123
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,760
- [Participant] Can I review
the code that it generates

1124
00:45:53,047 --> 00:45:58,047
for the simple, like, transformation...

1125
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,420
So can I explore the code that it used?

1126
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,670
- [Morgan] So you can view
the plan that it generates

1127
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,700
for upgrading your code,

1128
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,130
for doing that particular
upgrade on your code.

1129
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,730
The actual transformation
definition that we provide you,

1130
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,190
we had lots of fights
with legal about this,

1131
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,950
we do not share with
customers at this time.

1132
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,270
That may change if I get my way,

1133
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,753
but we don't share that right now.

1134
00:46:23,753 --> 00:46:25,170
- [Venu] But you can extend this.

1135
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:28,800
You can extend it with
additional planned context

1136
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,560
and other things, but
you can't really view it

1137
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,063
and modify it right now.

1138
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,453
- [Morgan] It's a black box

1139
00:46:35,453 --> 00:46:36,870
that you can tack things
on the outside of.

1140
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,820
And I would like to have
it not be a black box

1141
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,463
that you can modify, but we'll get there.

1142
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,460
- [Venu] Okay, so this
is the plan it generated.

1143
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,250
Plan, again, as I told, it's
basically how do I apply

1144
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,890
my definition to this project, right?

1145
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,860
Hey, first update the build dependencies,

1146
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,710
then do the client initialization

1147
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:57,990
and what files are gonna be changed,

1148
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:02,040
what is the validation criteria
here, all those things.

1149
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,050
Again, here, as a human in the loop,

1150
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:08,220
you can basically review
the plan and provide input.

1151
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,953
Here, I'm going to just
say, hey, looks good.

1152
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,740
Proceed.

1153
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,070
So this will be able to do that.

1154
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,690
Again, in the interest of time,

1155
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:21,180
I'm gonna go to my completed one.

1156
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,360
I'm gonna show how exactly it did it

1157
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,750
and how it created a summary, right?

1158
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,870
So this is one of the things
that I did in the morning.

1159
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:35,870
And so this is the migration
summary it created.

1160
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:41,140
So what has been migrated
to Fluxo from Tickety?

1161
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,440
So the dependencies,

1162
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,930
this Fluxo Java client has been removed.

1163
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,630
it added the Tickety
client authentication,

1164
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:52,203
client initialization, what
it did, what are the changes.

1165
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,520
Again, get ticket operation
before and after code snippet.

1166
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,650
Basically, it completed all the changes

1167
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,320
that is required for documentation updates

1168
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,440
and other things for migrating,

1169
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,700
so my proprietary internal
library to another version

1170
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,773
or to a different system.

1171
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,170
Cool.

1172
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,390
So just quickly going through,

1173
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:17,730
I have two more things
that I wanna quickly show.

1174
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,520
One is the docs that I talked about.

1175
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:25,520
Again, you saw in my list,

1176
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,283
there is a comprehensive
documentation analysis.

1177
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,043
Like, I'm just gonna do again.

1178
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:40,830
So that's basically going
through your code documentation,

1179
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,360
documenting all the code,

1180
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,560
as well as creating the tech
debt analysis for your code.

1181
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,519
So this is an early
access, so it basically,

1182
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:53,160
it does a deep static
analysis of code base

1183
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,590
and then generating it, right?

1184
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:59,040
So I actually did this
for one of the projects.

1185
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,960
I don't know how many of
you are familiar with Doom.

1186
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,960
Doom is a gaming engine
that we all loved to play.

1187
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,660
And that basically was...

1188
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,660
I think it's 1990 it was created.

1189
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,320
And this is pretty much
the documentation it had.

1190
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,300
This is the original documentation.

1191
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,580
Hey, go use Doom.

1192
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,620
That's about it, nothing else, right?

1193
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:27,000
So I ran my documentation
code base analysis on that,

1194
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,300
and it actually created this
documentation folder, right?

1195
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,990
Basically, it created a complete read me,

1196
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:38,730
what exactly this code does,
what are the quick stats,

1197
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,620
what is the documentation structure.

1198
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,840
Basically, it created subcomponents.

1199
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,220
- [Morgan] One thing I
really like is it creates

1200
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,650
kind of this navigable structure
where the markdown files,

1201
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,640
you can click between them

1202
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,050
and it'll, like, navigate through them.

1203
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:52,650
It's, like, kind of a
pseudo webpage, if you will.

1204
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:53,483
- [Venu] Yep.

1205
00:49:53,483 --> 00:49:55,830
So, okay, so project overview,

1206
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,363
it created a project overview,

1207
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,780
and the file inventory,

1208
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,813
how many total lines of
code, what all things.

1209
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,710
And from architecture, it
basically created a component,

1210
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:10,110
what are the components are available,

1211
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:13,680
and basically created a
dependency mapping tree as well,

1212
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,220
hey, main program, game
systems, core subsystems,

1213
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,513
and then the utilities.

1214
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:23,910
Okay, and what are the patterns this has?

1215
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:27,330
Basically, analysis,
architecture, system overview.

1216
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:29,490
And behavior is basically
the business logic,

1217
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:30,630
like the use cases

1218
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:34,143
and behavioral documentation
as well, right?

1219
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:37,770
What are the weapon
properties, weapon mechanics,

1220
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:39,480
which is used in the game?

1221
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,593
Decision logic,

1222
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,670
basically how the decisions
are being made in the code.

1223
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:45,503
Error handling.

1224
00:50:45,503 --> 00:50:47,310
Workflows, what are the workflows?

1225
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,373
So basically, it created
all the workflows for me.

1226
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,000
- [Morgan] Make sure you
see the diagrams folder too.

1227
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,290
I like the pictures.

1228
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:56,910
- [Venu] Okay. I don't know...

1229
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,830
Okay, maybe it didn't. (chuckles)

1230
00:50:58,830 --> 00:50:59,910
Oh, yeah, okay.

1231
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:00,743
Maybe it created...

1232
00:51:00,743 --> 00:51:02,280
Yeah, there you go.

1233
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,600
So this is the component diagram.

1234
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,780
It has a main engine,
main program, game render,

1235
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,543
sound, network, play simulation.

1236
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:15,380
Okay, and abstraction,
foundation, external dependencies.

1237
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,753
Cool.

1238
00:51:17,753 --> 00:51:20,340
And also, the main thing
is the technical debt.

1239
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,040
Okay, so basically it's-

1240
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,120
- [Morgan] Some code from 1990.

1241
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,223
It found a few things.

1242
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,470
- [Venu] Security order, the
security vulnerabilities,

1243
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:33,501
outdated platform dependencies, of course.

1244
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:35,263
- [Morgan] John Carmack probably
knows better than us but...

1245
00:51:35,263 --> 00:51:36,510
(Venu laughs)

1246
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,070
- [Venu] So, okay.

1247
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,130
1990 C coding practices. (laughs)

1248
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,243
So, yeah.

1249
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:44,423
Okay, cool.

1250
00:51:44,423 --> 00:51:47,790
So the last one I wanna quickly show,

1251
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,950
I know we have 10 more minutes,

1252
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,573
is the batch, right?

1253
00:51:52,465 --> 00:51:57,465
So how do you wrap this CLI into a batch

1254
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:00,960
and run it across multiple
repositories, right?

1255
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,410
Again, I used Kiro to create a batch,

1256
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:08,580
and then basically an ATX batch launcher.

1257
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:12,000
It basically takes a input of a CSV file,

1258
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,610
which has my GitHub repositories,

1259
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,620
and I'm gonna actually
run this documentation

1260
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,780
on multiple GitHub repositories

1261
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,757
and then go, hey, go run it, right?

1262
00:52:20,757 --> 00:52:23,610
And you can also provide
additional context.

1263
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:26,040
What is the transformation name, right?

1264
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,000
So basically, this is the CSV file,

1265
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,410
and I just wrap my CLI
into a batch script,

1266
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,230
and I thought, let's run this, right?

1267
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:35,220
And I'm gonna run this script.

1268
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:39,060
I'm gonna say, hey,
launch this batch script

1269
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:43,050
with this CSV file in a
parallel mode, maximum 10 jobs.

1270
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,427
You could increase it.

1271
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:47,310
And this is the output directory to...

1272
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:48,180
This is the clone directory

1273
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,400
to download the clones from GitHub,

1274
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,050
and then what is the output directory

1275
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,827
where you need to do this.

1276
00:52:56,504 --> 00:52:57,921
So let's do this.

1277
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,453
Oops.

1278
00:53:07,969 --> 00:53:08,802
Okay.

1279
00:53:14,244 --> 00:53:16,650
Okay, so I'm in a different
directory right now.

1280
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:17,643
Give me one second.

1281
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:44,670
Okay, so it's basically
checking the version

1282
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,790
and running these commands,

1283
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:51,243
starting, like, cutting
parallel jobs, right?

1284
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,510
So let's...

1285
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,720
Okay, so it basically downloaded
all the repositories for me

1286
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:01,410
and then started running this.

1287
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:06,150
And you can basically
monitor the execution locks.

1288
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:07,650
It started creating it,

1289
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,083
and you should be able to see the results.

1290
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,710
Okay, yeah, so that's the batch mode.

1291
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,240
Basically, wrap up the SEG execution

1292
00:54:20,746 --> 00:54:24,840
or the ATX execution
command, and then go run it.

1293
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,640
- [Morgan] Our code name
was Super Elastic Gumby.

1294
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,002
So sometimes, we slip
and say Gumby or SEG.

1295
00:54:29,002 --> 00:54:30,181
(Venu laughs)

1296
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:32,370
I was really sad marketing
gave us a real name.

1297
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,203
- [Venu] Yeah.

1298
00:54:34,144 --> 00:54:37,773
And the final thing is probably, let's...

1299
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,650
And we talked about knowledge items,

1300
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:44,550
so I wanna quickly show how
the knowledge items look, okay?

1301
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,750
So I ran a bunch...

1302
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,550
So I have created a transformation

1303
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:50,550
called Java 21 modernization

1304
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:53,460
for my bunch of Java projects that I had.

1305
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,630
So I'm gonna say,

1306
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:58,200
hey, I've run this multiple
times on multiple projects.

1307
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,440
So I'm gonna say list-ki,
which is the knowledge items,

1308
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,780
which is the continual learning aspect

1309
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,423
where it learns from the agent execution.

1310
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:09,573
Let's see how that looks.

1311
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:16,140
So how we have designed
this is by default,

1312
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:19,350
it will run with knowledge items,

1313
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,930
which means it will
learn from the execution.

1314
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:22,890
That's by default.

1315
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:26,160
You can say do not learn as
well if you don't wanna learn.

1316
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,440
And these knowledge items,
when they're created,

1317
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,790
they're disabled by default,

1318
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:32,340
which means a human in
the loop can review it.

1319
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,500
And if they wanna apply
it for the next time,

1320
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,880
they can enable it.

1321
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,150
So here, if you see some of them, right?

1322
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:41,430
Like, this is a Java 21
transformation, right?

1323
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:44,580
Hey, it's found, hey, sealed
classes are incompatible

1324
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:48,180
with JPA/Hibernate Lazy Loading, right?

1325
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,700
And some of them are very specific.

1326
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,250
Hey, SolarWinds, that's
one of the project I run.

1327
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,660
It's very project specific.

1328
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,370
It's not very generic.

1329
00:55:56,370 --> 00:56:01,370
And again, Spring Boot Virtual
Threads needs this, right?

1330
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:04,860
So again, I can go and enable it.

1331
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,125
So next time, it runs
the same transformation,

1332
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:10,260
it finds that, and it basically
applies this knowledge item.

1333
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,003
That memory is already there, so.

1334
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:17,550
Okay, I'll give it to you for a wrap-up.

1335
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:18,960
- [Morgan] Yeah, thank you for your time.

1336
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,260
I think that's all we got.
