1
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:07,309
All right, good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:10,648
This is the last session of the

3
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:11,839
day in this room.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,769
My name is Luis Campus.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,769
I'm a DNAI specialist from the Netherlands,

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,649
and I'm here today to share with you

7
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:20,670
how to build,

8
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,350
manage, and share.

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,469
Quickwee dashboards using Amazon

10
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:26,309
Sage Maker.

11
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:28,949
I'm gonna be joined on stage by

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,120
my colleague Utgars,

13
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:33,348
product manager for Amazon Sage Maker,

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,679
and later on,

15
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:37,270
Mirko, who leads software engineering

16
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:38,609
at Nora.

17
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:42,889
The agenda that we have for you today is gonna be a

18
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:43,868
packed agenda.

19
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,889
I'm first gonna show you a bit of the map

20
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:47,868
of the cave

21
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,189
and

22
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,569
lay out the problem and how we

23
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:53,609
intend to solve and what is that

24
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,609
problem, how do we intend to solve it. Later, Utkar

25
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:56,250
is gonna

26
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,590
show you what happens behind the scenes and also

27
00:00:59,848 --> 00:01:01,228
an end to end demo

28
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:02,649
of this integration.

29
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,099
Merkel is gonna come and tell his

30
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,400
story and how his team

31
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:10,099
is innovating using these technologies.

32
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:11,769
So let's get started.

33
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,959
Now, one of the books by

34
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,000
Brian Schwartz,

35
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,980
The Paradox of Choice,

36
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:22,168
talks about this notion that,

37
00:01:22,278 --> 00:01:24,079
in order for someone to be happy,

38
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,159
you need to have options.

39
00:01:26,948 --> 00:01:28,609
But after a certain threshold,

40
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:30,219
too many options

41
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:32,948
becomes a hindrance, and creates

42
00:01:32,948 --> 00:01:33,829
decision fatigue,

43
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:35,489
it becomes a problem.

44
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,000
One thing I can assure you all here today.

45
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,859
The choice to be here in this room

46
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,069
was the right one.

47
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,760
So thank you for your presence.

48
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:49,359
Now, this problem is not exclusive

49
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:51,680
to technology in many.

50
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,019
Day to day situations,

51
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,388
you will find decision fatigue

52
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:59,010
because of this plethora

53
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,900
of options. Too many options.

54
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:03,430
Well, retail consumers go through

55
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,069
this either in in-store experiences

56
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:08,629
or online with too many

57
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,689
products, sometimes from the same category,

58
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,210
and being very hard to distinguish

59
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:15,028
what's the difference between them.

60
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:18,679
In the entertainment industry, we

61
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:21,099
have the same, but we have a different problem.

62
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,118
We're seeing more and more.

63
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:26,679
People replacing

64
00:02:27,058 --> 00:02:29,659
the consumption of selected

65
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,118
content for simple swiping.

66
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,149
And that has to do precisely

67
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:37,270
with that decision fatigue. I need

68
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,219
to choose content to consume,

69
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:40,830
but there are too many options.

70
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:43,449
So I will let the algorithm choose for me.

71
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:48,788
In companies, in enterprises, the

72
00:02:48,788 --> 00:02:50,338
organizations that have to manage data,

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,008
you have a similar, a similar issue

74
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:54,919
with data coming from different sources,

75
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,270
separate systems,

76
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,618
different technologies as well.

77
00:02:59,159 --> 00:02:59,849
And so,

78
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,719
once you have all these vast amounts of

79
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,379
data that is being sourced.

80
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,719
Being a consumer of that data

81
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,758
becomes a much harder task,

82
00:03:10,118 --> 00:03:12,360
let alone if you need to consume

83
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,449
that data, transform it and then serve

84
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:15,419
it to someone else.

85
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,110
Navigate through all these options.

86
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,919
Has always the challenge to bridge

87
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,038
these two worlds,

88
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:27,939
the options that we have, and the consumer.

89
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,669
Now let's go back to the retail

90
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,819
example or entertainment example, if you

91
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,258
wish. Once

92
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:36,719
you have curated

93
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:39,439
these options and extracted the metadata

94
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:42,500
from the products, let's say from an e-commerce

95
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,689
website. Or let's say,

96
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,830
a travel agency that has an

97
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,449
online uh website.

98
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,649
That metadata is being extracted

99
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,750
to create what we call the

100
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,379
filters.

101
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,868
So, uh, I'll give you my personal

102
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:57,569
example.

103
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:00,429
Every year, I go on Booking.com,

104
00:04:00,788 --> 00:04:02,159
and I try to select

105
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:05,250
one of these paradise Islands in the Mediterranean,

106
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:06,770
and I try to choose

107
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:07,849
a villa.

108
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:09,808
In front of the sea

109
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:12,000
with private, private pool.

110
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:14,118
And it, I get

111
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,699
so many options. And after that,

112
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,278
I use a 4th filter,

113
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,619
which is my budget, and it goes

114
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:22,519
down to 0.

115
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:24,500
So,

116
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,019
this is the experience that still

117
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,699
today a lot of people are grappling

118
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,220
in terms of navigating through the options that

119
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,379
exist. Like

120
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:35,500
2 decades ago, the last 2 decades, what

121
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,579
we have been doing, and all our customers

122
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:38,569
have been doing as well,

123
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:40,079
is trying to

124
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,420
detect the footprint of

125
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,980
these users on their website to

126
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,980
understand their behavior. Also try to

127
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,178
capture their comments,

128
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,619
their reviews, and then feed

129
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:52,750
a new batch of metadata

130
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:55,699
in order now, instead of being reactive

131
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,160
and just give filters to the user,

132
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:00,879
provide them recommendations. So

133
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,600
this is not something new.

134
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:03,730
Yet,

135
00:05:04,048 --> 00:05:06,290
it's something that a lot of organizations are

136
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,629
still struggling with.

137
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,170
And this is not a technology example, this

138
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,879
is just from a consumer perspective.

139
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,369
Now, let's get a little bit more, let's dive a

140
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:16,149
little bit deeper.

141
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,119
Let's transport to the enterprise

142
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,048
data world,

143
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,959
where not only you have

144
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,189
several different sources from several different

145
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:26,988
technologies,

146
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:29,278
sometimes the same data in

147
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:30,858
several different forms,

148
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:32,629
and on the other side,

149
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,199
you have humans, you

150
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,389
have machines,

151
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:39,040
you have agents, you have software,

152
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,189
you have different sizes and

153
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:42,639
different shapes of consumers.

154
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:44,678
The first step

155
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,338
is to curate that

156
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:49,579
data, extract that data, or

157
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,619
simply zero ETL that

158
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,199
data over to a lake house.

159
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:56,660
At the lake house, that's exactly

160
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,069
where you're gonna start doing your pre-processing.

161
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,579
See if your data is clean,

162
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:04,670
if it provides context, but most importantly,

163
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,220
to correlate the data

164
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,259
between all the sources, because now you have

165
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,160
everything in one place.

166
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:12,548
So far, so good, OK?

167
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,410
Once you have this data, you will

168
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,809
serve it to different communities

169
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:19,928
inside the organization.

170
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,329
Data scientists will use that to

171
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:23,410
create models.

172
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:26,369
But by the way, data scientists, if they wanna

173
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:28,689
have access to the detail and raw

174
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,809
data, they can always tap into the lake house as

175
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:32,329
well. Same thing

176
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,970
with BI analysts that will

177
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,559
create dashboards, data stories,

178
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,959
storyboards,

179
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:40,928
pixel reports, etc.

180
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:43,488
which by the way, can also tap into the lake

181
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,088
house to get detailed data.

182
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:49,238
All of these actions

183
00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:50,100
generate

184
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:51,199
metadata.

185
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,639
And so in order to provide

186
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,879
metadata to an agent, a

187
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,319
piece of software, a human or a machine,

188
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:00,519
you need to have this catalog.

189
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:03,559
This catalog will provide a much needed

190
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:04,738
discovery capability

191
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:06,500
that users want and need,

192
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,079
as well as the ability to

193
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,559
let them sift through models,

194
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,389
GI applications,

195
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,199
dashboards, etc.

196
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,250
Either an agent

197
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:21,759
or a consumer.

198
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,928
This is an

199
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:25,809
issue today.

200
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:29,369
Because there are two missing links

201
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:31,230
happening at the same time.

202
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,290
First of all, is

203
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:35,069
the creation

204
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:38,048
of a dashboard is disconnected

205
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:40,009
from the data engineering pipeline,

206
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,369
and what do I mean, what do I mean by this?

207
00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:43,809
I mean that

208
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:46,509
when a BI analyst needs to create a

209
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,629
dashboard, it needs to first

210
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:49,730
source the data,

211
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:52,230
and make sure that data is available

212
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,269
for the tool that it needs.

213
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,108
Or sometimes it may happen that

214
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:00,069
the tool will bring the pre-processing

215
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:02,108
into its capabilities, which is a bit of

216
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,189
an overkill if you already pre-processed the

217
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:06,298
data. This, this happens

218
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:06,838
a lot.

219
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,178
These tools getting fatter and

220
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:11,379
fatter in terms of capability. They

221
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:12,798
do more and more, but

222
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,939
they are not supposed to.

223
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,869
So, where is the data that I need to

224
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:19,910
build my dashboard, and I

225
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,250
need to move my data.

226
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,449
Turns out that this

227
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,028
hindrance the time it takes

228
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:27,309
to create a dashboard.

229
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,028
The second issue.

230
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,950
Is the opposite side of the

231
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,769
same coin.

232
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,349
That plethora of options I was talking

233
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,349
about happens for two reasons.

234
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:39,190
First of all,

235
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:41,129
the dashboards that are created,

236
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:43,710
leaving the private workspaces

237
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,048
of the BI analyst,

238
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:47,869
or sometimes the business user. And

239
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:50,369
there, there are a lot of duplications,

240
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:51,229
we know that.

241
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,330
And so what tends to happen is that when someone

242
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,369
needs a dashboard, they don't know where to

243
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:56,989
find

244
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,969
the exact, maybe someone has built something

245
00:08:59,969 --> 00:09:01,639
similar, so what do they do?

246
00:09:01,928 --> 00:09:03,928
They come back to square one, which

247
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:06,210
is source the data and build it yet

248
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,649
again. There's

249
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,798
no integrated governance for dashboards,

250
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:12,029
so we are here today

251
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:14,070
to solve these two problems.

252
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:18,389
And solving these two problems

253
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:20,629
means creating a connected

254
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:22,750
experience through all the three

255
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,229
stages of the data life cycle,

256
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,548
from collect,

257
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:27,658
connect,

258
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,950
and consume.

259
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,340
We're gonna talk a little bit about Amazon Sage

260
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,759
Maker and QuickSuite.

261
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:37,418
But the key topic from, for this

262
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:39,460
talk today is the integration

263
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,149
between both,

264
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,619
OK. Let's

265
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:44,678
just Overview

266
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,599
what Amazon Sage Maker is.

267
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,710
SageMaker is,

268
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,989
um, Sage Maker and SageMaker Unified

269
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,250
Studio were launched

270
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,928
in this same place last year, 1 year ago,

271
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:56,090
as an integrated

272
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:58,009
uh platform for

273
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,389
all your data, AI and analytics

274
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:02,609
needs, with 3 main layers.

275
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:05,269
The first one is the face of the tool.

276
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:07,389
We call it SageMaker Unified Studio.

277
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,649
Single environment.

278
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:11,109
And SageMaker Unified Studio

279
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:14,889
would be used by all these personas, the data scientist, the

280
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:15,529
engineer,

281
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,210
the business analyst, the Gen AI

282
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:18,830
developer.

283
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:21,048
And they all will meet

284
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:23,658
in one place, which is the Sagemaker

285
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:24,330
catalog.

286
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,369
Sage maker catalog will provide

287
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:30,129
them the data discovery capability

288
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,109
that they all need to work together.

289
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:34,570
They will have projects, they will have domains,

290
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:35,389
they will have

291
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,690
GI generated metadata. They will have all

292
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,129
these capabilities, glossaries, etc.

293
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:42,590
that they'll need to find what they need

294
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,129
and to publish their,

295
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,070
their data.

296
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:49,960
Every person will use a different tool once they are

297
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,710
in AgeMaker in the 5 Studio,

298
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:54,210
because for instance, a data scientist may

299
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,408
use SageMaker AI

300
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,408
to train and deploy AI models,

301
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:58,989
while at the same time,

302
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:02,058
A Gen AI developer can use the Bedrock

303
00:11:02,058 --> 00:11:04,029
IDE to create their custom Gen AI

304
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:08,070
applications. A dead engineer

305
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,109
may prepare and integrate their data with

306
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:10,629
EMR

307
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,908
or even runs or business analysts

308
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:15,950
or data analysts may run their SQL queries

309
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,950
using Redshift.

310
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:19,690
So they all will enter through the same door,

311
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,330
but at the end they will use

312
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,710
different capabilities of the tool. So Sage

313
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,830
Maker will integrate natively with

314
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,190
Redshift, with EMR, with Sage Maker AI,

315
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:29,389
and with Bedrock.

316
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:32,129
Now we're about to bring a brand

317
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:33,729
new member to this family.

318
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:36,109
And that's the BI analyst, which

319
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:37,070
now can also

320
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:38,969
start in SageMaker,

321
00:11:39,308 --> 00:11:40,690
use the catalog

322
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,029
and solve those two issues that

323
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:45,099
we were talking about. This means

324
00:11:45,469 --> 00:11:47,369
that in the catalog now,

325
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:50,759
Side by side with data,

326
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:53,519
models, and G AI applications,

327
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,869
there will be

328
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,668
dashboards as well.

329
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:01,960
You will still have the horizontal capabilities

330
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:03,529
of Sage maker catalog

331
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:04,940
of data lineage,

332
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:06,960
integrated data quality

333
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:08,340
from good data quality.

334
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,019
You also have the pub sub

335
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:13,019
mechanisms that exist for people

336
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,058
to share data, models and

337
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:16,219
dashboards amongst them.

338
00:12:18,428 --> 00:12:20,469
I'm not sure if you were

339
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:22,200
attentive two months ago,

340
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:23,349
but we've launched,

341
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,190
we, we did a big launch, and that was introducing

342
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,200
Amazon Quick Suite.

343
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,288
Um, it's a tool that

344
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:32,440
supersedes our previous tool called

345
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,690
Quicksight, our BI tool called Quicksight.

346
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,489
And I'm gonna expand a bit more on what QuickSuite

347
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:38,190
does.

348
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:41,469
It has 3 main pillars,

349
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,960
and all of these pillars

350
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,330
are made consistent by something

351
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,408
called spaces. This means that

352
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:50,109
you can create a space.

353
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:53,139
Provide data assets inside

354
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:53,759
that space,

355
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,500
provide files, dashboards, and

356
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,129
something called actions.

357
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:00,580
And an action is an integrated with

358
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,750
a third party tool.

359
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:04,399
And once you have all that, you can

360
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,538
create something new, a new

361
00:13:06,538 --> 00:13:08,619
colleague, and that would be your custom

362
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:09,489
chat agent.

363
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,889
You can specialize a chat

364
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:14,058
agent inside that space, that

365
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:16,298
will be an expert on all the things

366
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:17,340
you've put inside,

367
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:20,038
OK. So now you can not only

368
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:21,158
talk with your dashboard,

369
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,639
you can also have a specialist that

370
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,389
knows about that.

371
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:27,918
And most of the times, this represents

372
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:30,038
a big advancement in people that are already

373
00:13:30,038 --> 00:13:30,859
working together.

374
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,219
Now, QuickSuite is comprised

375
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:36,298
of several different tools, and I'm gonna very

376
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:38,298
quickly skim skim through through them, and

377
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:40,080
then we're gonna see how the integration works.

378
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:42,798
First of them is Quick Index that will allow

379
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:44,139
through an extensive list

380
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,918
of connectors to connect

381
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,940
QuickSuite to a plethora

382
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,519
of

383
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:52,460
external sources from SharePoint

384
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,940
to Salesforce, etc.

385
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:57,279
The other interesting part would be

386
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,918
quick sight

387
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,779
and quick research. Quicksight

388
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,979
is the tool that you use

389
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:06,038
to create dashboards, you use to create

390
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,580
uh storyboards, you use to create

391
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,359
pixel

392
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:10,940
perfect reports.

393
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:12,639
And quick research.

394
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:16,090
We have been using internally at AWS

395
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,639
and it's a game changer.

396
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,408
You will provide

397
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,298
an input in terms of natural language,

398
00:14:22,548 --> 00:14:24,590
you will provide the spaces that you

399
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,500
have created,

400
00:14:25,788 --> 00:14:27,529
and you will toggle something,

401
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:29,529
go to the web or don't.

402
00:14:29,989 --> 00:14:31,090
And it will create

403
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:33,548
the topics of a research report you would

404
00:14:33,548 --> 00:14:34,269
like to create.

405
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,489
And after that, of course, you will be able

406
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:39,658
to um customize

407
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:41,190
your, your own

408
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:42,479
research paper.

409
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:43,840
The automation

410
00:14:44,219 --> 00:14:46,259
inside Quick Suite is done through the use of

411
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:48,340
Quick flows, so you will create several different

412
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,379
flows. And in order for those flows to

413
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:52,119
connect with the tools, you will have

414
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,658
quick automate. Automate will be where you

415
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:56,519
create those actions, where you connect

416
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:59,279
to, to that external sources, Salesforce

417
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,719
and SharePoint and uh

418
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:03,058
and whatever tool you use, for instance, for

419
00:15:03,058 --> 00:15:03,580
CRM.

420
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,168
Now, this is where

421
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:08,509
all of these users will work together

422
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:09,369
inside QuickSuite,

423
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,229
and the option of the dashboards, it's

424
00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:14,139
where the BI analyst will start,

425
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,859
right? Wrong,

426
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:19,700
because the BI analyst needs

427
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,269
first

428
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:21,668
to source the data,

429
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,250
needs to understand where the data is.

430
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:26,450
So let's layer all these tools that I've talked

431
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,609
about on top of this diagram and

432
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:30,769
see how does this works. So of course, the

433
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:31,509
first one,

434
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:32,710
it's easy.

435
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,609
Lake house is Sagemaker Lake House.

436
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:38,210
The second one would be the experience

437
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,250
of unified studio would be

438
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,408
the same, both for the builder and

439
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,250
publisher persona, but also for the consumer

440
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,070
or the agent.

441
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:49,408
And they will all meet in the catalog

442
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:51,580
as um the metadata

443
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,070
catalog. They will all these um

444
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,918
teams together.

445
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,548
Once QuickSuite comes into play,

446
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:00,109
this means that

447
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,668
it will be acceptable that

448
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,928
the same catalog will provide

449
00:16:04,928 --> 00:16:06,158
the data assets

450
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:08,649
for the users of QuickSuite to start

451
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:10,649
working. And that's what we're going to explore in this

452
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:11,210
session.

453
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,928
Because once you do that, you're gonna have a

454
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:14,570
governed

455
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:17,070
uh or data governance across

456
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,489
your dashboard experience as well.

457
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,590
This means that once,

458
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:21,619
um,

459
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,989
me, for instance, I'm a BI analyst,

460
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,719
Lewis connects, enters, subscribes

461
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,859
to this table that is called

462
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,629
customer churn data.

463
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,219
Now I have access to that through a project.

464
00:16:33,678 --> 00:16:35,239
I want to create a dashboard.

465
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,460
So where do I start?

466
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,899
I just click on open

467
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:40,808
in Quick Sweet.

468
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:42,330
That's it.

469
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,538
In the back,

470
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:46,950
Amazon Sage maker will take

471
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:47,529
care

472
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,989
of all that integration. You don't

473
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:50,989
need to move data,

474
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:53,219
you don't need to integrate tools.

475
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:55,548
You will land in Quick Suite with

476
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:56,950
that data asset

477
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:59,629
immediately available to create a data

478
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:01,928
analysis which will result in a dashboard.

479
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,830
And once you create that dashboard,

480
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:06,309
the dashboard will become cataloged

481
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:08,969
automatically back in Sage Maker catalog.

482
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,338
How cool is that?

483
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:14,557
Yes,

484
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,468
OK. Well, to

485
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:19,769
show you how all this magic works

486
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:20,648
in the background,

487
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:23,028
let me call on stage my colleague Utkash.

488
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:32,189
Thank you. Well,

489
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:33,469
thank you so much, Louis.

490
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,439
So, Lewis talked about how Amazon

491
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:39,699
Sage Maker and QuickSuite together

492
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:42,000
help you simplify the end to end analytics

493
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,539
journey.

494
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,059
Now, let's explore a real-life use case

495
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,338
uh to see how it works in practice.

496
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,459
A data analyst has been asked to explore

497
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:52,818
whether customer churn interactions have

498
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,000
an impact on.

499
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:55,989
Customer churn.

500
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:58,699
So, it sounds like a simple problem at first,

501
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,358
but where do you even begin?

502
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,979
Your churn data might live in a redshift

503
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:03,828
data warehouse,

504
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,568
managed by a different team.

505
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,130
Your customer support data might

506
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,289
be in Glue data catalog in a

507
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,239
completely different account,

508
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:13,809
um, with no business context at all.

509
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:16,059
So, first of all, how do you find this

510
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:18,140
data? And once you find

511
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,259
this data, how do you get access to this

512
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:22,318
data? How do you understand this data with

513
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:23,180
business context?

514
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:25,709
And then how do you analyze and visualize this

515
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,500
data using the tools of your choice?

516
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,689
SageMaker Inf Studio and QuickSuite help you do all of that in

517
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:33,729
a single streamlined Gov workflow

518
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:34,910
that Lewis talked about,

519
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,729
and that is exactly what we'll explore in this demo.

520
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:41,799
We'll start with data discovery. We'll show you

521
00:18:41,939 --> 00:18:43,729
how you can use the catalog in SageMaker Inf Studio

522
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
to find data that you may not even have access

523
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,890
to. We will then show you how you can

524
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,809
access that data in a self-service

525
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:54,049
manner. We will show you how you can analyze

526
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,709
that data using some of the tools

527
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,029
built in within SageMaker Unified Studio.

528
00:18:58,618 --> 00:19:00,779
And then once you have analyzed your data, how

529
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:02,880
you can transition into QuickSuite

530
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,358
so that you can visualize that data

531
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:07,539
and build a dashboard and once you have built

532
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:08,259
that dashboard,

533
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:10,979
how you can catalog and share that data

534
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:13,019
so that the insights that you have generated

535
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:13,880
do not just simply

536
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,130
exist in a silo within your own PI personal PI workspace.

537
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:22,180
Now, before we start, let's take a look at

538
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:24,318
the 3 personas who will be part of this demo.

539
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:26,979
First, we have Daniel, who is a data analyst,

540
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:28,660
and his responsibility is

541
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:30,858
to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

542
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:32,519
Then we have

543
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:34,439
John, who is

544
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:37,699
Uh, who is a business business user. He

545
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:40,180
heads the customer support team, and he's

546
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,239
looking to understand

547
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:43,670
how does the customer support interactions of his

548
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,559
team impact the customer chart.

549
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,400
And finally we have Priya, who is

550
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:50,900
a data owner. She owns the uh

551
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,939
data in the catalog, and she

552
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,219
is responsible for managing

553
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:56,959
access to the data that she owns.

554
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
All right, so with that, let's jump into the

555
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,358
demo and see how the data analyst

556
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:03,219
can start with data discovery.

557
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:07,189
So here we are in Sagemaker Unified studio.

558
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:09,608
We are logged in as Daniel, who is our data analyst.

559
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,439
He's in this churn analysis project, and if

560
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,519
you go to the data page,

561
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,039
you can see that Daniel already has

562
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:16,959
access to some of the data.

563
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,358
For example, he has access to this

564
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:20,660
churn labels.

565
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,029
He can see it's technical metadata, like

566
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:25,578
which account does the data exist in,

567
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:28,269
he can look at the columns, he can look at the sample

568
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,529
data to understand how the data looks like.

569
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:33,269
But what he does not have is

570
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:35,430
access to any data related to

571
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,509
customer support metrics. So let's see if

572
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:39,029
he can find this data in the catalog.

573
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,459
So he starts by typing in the search bar, and

574
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:44,420
immediately he can start seeing some search results.

575
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,500
So let's look at the first

576
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,939
search result.

577
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:51,848
It's a table called Support chat metrics. It's

578
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:53,630
a table in the Glue Data catalog.

579
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:56,789
You can see that there is already some business context

580
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:57,529
about this table.

581
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:01,729
He can also see some technical metadata, like

582
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:03,348
where does this table exist, which account,

583
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,390
what is the S3 location of this table.

584
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:09,199
And he can see some other information like the ownership,

585
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,328
like who is the owner

586
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:11,289
of this data.

587
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:13,868
So in case if he needs to reach out to the owner, he can do that.

588
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:18,130
On the schema tab, he can see all of the columns,

589
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,699
he can see its data types,

590
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,318
and he can see the descriptions. It's not just

591
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,568
cryptic column names, but a lot of business

592
00:21:24,568 --> 00:21:26,680
context. So after all of

593
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,880
this business context,

594
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:30,239
Daniel realizes that this is the dataset he needs for

595
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:30,920
his analysis.

596
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:33,059
But how does he get access?

597
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,500
All he has to do is just hit the subscribe button.

598
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:38,650
Provide a reason for why he needs access.

599
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,588
And that's it.

600
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:41,848
He can submit the request.

601
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:45,059
Now at this point, this request goes to

602
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:45,939
the owner of the data,

603
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:47,680
who is Priya in this case.

604
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,338
So let's take a look at how Priya's experience would look like.

605
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,500
We are again in Sagemaker Unified Studio, logged

606
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,559
in as Priya this time,

607
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:57,809
and if we go to the subscription request page,

608
00:21:58,348 --> 00:21:59,309
we can see that there's,

609
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:00,858
there are a couple of pending requests.

610
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,309
Priya can open one of the requests, she

611
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:05,368
can see who, who has requested

612
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:07,689
access for what data, for what purpose.

613
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:10,650
And she can choose whether she wants to approve with full

614
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,469
access, which means,

615
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:14,029
uh, Daniel gets access to the full table,

616
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:16,229
and she can just simply approve the request.

617
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:19,900
Now what happens at this point is once

618
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,969
the request is approved,

619
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,838
Daniel should be able to access the data,

620
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,779
but to be able to do that.

621
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:27,568
We do a lot of orchestration behind the scenes.

622
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:28,949
For example, when

623
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:31,410
this request is approved, Sagemaker goes into

624
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,479
the underlying data source, which in this case is,

625
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:35,989
uh, the table is in Glue data catalog. So

626
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,838
Sagemaker goes into Lake formation, which is

627
00:22:38,838 --> 00:22:40,868
used to manage the permissions on Glue data catalog

628
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:43,189
and creates a grant on behalf of Priya.

629
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:46,000
And what that means is once that grant is created,

630
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,750
Daniel would be able to access the data.

631
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:49,848
So let's go back to Daniel's project.

632
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:53,949
And if we go to the assets page,

633
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,459
You will see that under subscribed data.

634
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,430
There's an asset.

635
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:01,299
The same asset that Daniel subscribed to, and it

636
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:02,500
shows up as accessible.

637
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:07,348
Just to confirm that Daniel can actually

638
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:08,920
access it, let's go to the data page,

639
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:11,630
and you can see that the same table also shows

640
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,489
up under

641
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,670
the Data Explorer.

642
00:23:13,949 --> 00:23:14,828
Daniel can access it.

643
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,420
Great, so let's take

644
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:20,759
a pause and revisit our demo flow. So far

645
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:21,420
what we have seen

646
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,180
is how Daniel was able to discover new data

647
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,309
that he originally did not have access to,

648
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,068
how he was able to understand that data with business context,

649
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:31,318
and how he was able to request access and

650
00:23:31,318 --> 00:23:32,299
get access to this data

651
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:33,719
in a self-service manner.

652
00:23:34,838 --> 00:23:37,088
From this point, Daniel can start analyzing

653
00:23:37,088 --> 00:23:39,160
this data. And for this, he's going to

654
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,199
use a built-in query editor within

655
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:43,199
SageMaker Unified Studio. So let's take a look at

656
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:46,479
that. He

657
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:47,699
goes to the query editor.

658
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:50,890
And he starts exploring the data.

659
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:51,949
Here he's

660
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:54,368
writing a SQL query, he executes it,

661
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,049
and

662
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:58,219
he's basically seeing how the churn rate varies

663
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:00,348
with CSET score, how does the average sentiment

664
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:00,900
looks like,

665
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,890
how does the average response time looks like.

666
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:06,098
Once he has done this exploratory analysis, he

667
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:07,358
decides to create a table

668
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:09,769
with all the dimensions and metrics that

669
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:10,439
he needs

670
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:12,519
to be able to visualize this data.

671
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:15,019
So here, he again runs a query to create

672
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:15,670
that table,

673
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:18,029
and you can see in the Data Explorer on the left-hand

674
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:19,618
side that the table is created.

675
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,809
Great. So with that, Daniel is now ready

676
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:24,930
to visualize this data in QuickS Suite.

677
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:28,259
Now, before we jump into

678
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,650
Quick Suite, let's first understand how this integration

679
00:24:31,098 --> 00:24:32,009
actually works.

680
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:34,229
Between Sage Maker and QuickSuite,

681
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:35,269
right? So,

682
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:37,150
with this integration, like Louis was saying,

683
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,529
we provide a one-click transition from Sage Maker

684
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:40,088
to QuickSuite,

685
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,709
so that as a data analyst who is working in SageMaker,

686
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,828
you can go into QuickSuite and analyze,

687
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,108
uh, and visualize the same data that you're able to

688
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:47,969
access in Sagemaker.

689
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,000
Now to make that happen, we do a lot of orchestration

690
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,660
behind the scenes.

691
00:24:52,118 --> 00:24:52,779
First of all,

692
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,858
any project that you have in Sagemaker.

693
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,838
If that project has Quicksight enabled in it,

694
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,568
we create a behind the scenes, create a folder

695
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:02,588
in QuickSuite with the same name as the project,

696
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:04,809
and any data set or dashboards that

697
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:05,868
you create in QuickSuite

698
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:07,709
will exist in this folder itself.

699
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:11,979
Any IM rolls or connections that you have created

700
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:13,799
in Sagemaker to access the data,

701
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,430
we use the same IM rolls and connections,

702
00:25:16,969 --> 00:25:19,059
the credentials within those connections to create

703
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,180
data sources in QuickSuite. So for example, we create

704
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,140
an Athena data source,

705
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,598
a redshift data source using the same IM roll

706
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:25,640
and the same connection

707
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,219
so that whatever data you are able to

708
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:30,338
access as an analyst in Sagemaker,

709
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,420
you can access the same data in QuickSuite

710
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,858
as well. Any

711
00:25:34,858 --> 00:25:36,900
tables that you want to visualize, we can

712
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,180
automatically create a QuickSuite data set

713
00:25:39,858 --> 00:25:42,029
for that table. So when you land in QuickSuite,

714
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,920
you have a data set ready for you.

715
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:46,818
To visualize. So, you can focus your

716
00:25:46,818 --> 00:25:48,439
energy on visualizing the data rather than

717
00:25:48,858 --> 00:25:50,979
trying to create a data source or go through this

718
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:51,799
extensive setup.

719
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:55,098
With this data set,

720
00:25:55,358 --> 00:25:57,640
you create an analysis and then a dashboard

721
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,559
in QuickSuite, which is a standard way of creating

722
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:00,650
a dashboard,

723
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:02,559
and once that dashboard is created,

724
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,759
behind the scenes, we automatically

725
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,259
bring that dashboard as an asset in the catalog

726
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:08,019
in Sagemaker.

727
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:09,640
And what that means is

728
00:26:10,338 --> 00:26:12,598
from that point you can add more business data,

729
00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:14,880
business business metadata to that dashboard.

730
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,348
And make it discoverable in the catalog so that other

731
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:19,529
users who do not have access to your dashboard

732
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,828
can find the dashboard. And if they

733
00:26:21,828 --> 00:26:24,180
want to use the insights that you have generated,

734
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,299
they can do that.

735
00:26:26,328 --> 00:26:27,989
And finally, we make sure that the

736
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:30,890
membership, members in the project are always in sync

737
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,250
with the members in the folder in QuickSuite. So

738
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,380
anytime you add a member to the project or

739
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,689
remove a member from the project,

740
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:38,180
we make sure that

741
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:40,459
the same members are also added and removed from

742
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:41,299
the folder as well.

743
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,130
Great. So with that understanding.

744
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,809
Let's see how

745
00:26:47,328 --> 00:26:49,549
Daniel can go from sage maker to quick suite.

746
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:52,640
So he simply chooses this option to open in Quick Suite.

747
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,699
And we open QuickSuite in a new browser

748
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,959
tab, and he lands on this data set in QuickSuite,

749
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:00,420
which is automatically created for him.

750
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,578
It's the same

751
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:04,118
with the same name as the table that he needs

752
00:27:04,118 --> 00:27:04,939
to visualize.

753
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:07,598
And now all he needs to do is just simply use this

754
00:27:07,598 --> 00:27:08,299
data set

755
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,380
in an analysis.

756
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,699
He adds this, you know, he creates an analysis

757
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,519
using this data set.

758
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:20,358
Now he wants to add

759
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:23,328
A new calculated field for churn rate.

760
00:27:23,828 --> 00:27:26,289
So he adds a calculated field. He describes

761
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:29,799
how the churn rate should be calculated in natural language,

762
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,108
and QuickSweet is able to figure out the right formula for

763
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,170
him. All he has to do is just add this.

764
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,779
New field to his analysis.

765
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,140
Now he creates a few charts

766
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,420
to understand how

767
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:41,900
the churn rate

768
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,959
varies with support metrics.

769
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,939
So here he's creating a chart to

770
00:27:46,939 --> 00:27:49,098
see how CSAT score impacts churn

771
00:27:49,098 --> 00:27:51,219
rate, and he can see that as the CSAT

772
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:53,140
score is lower, the churn rate is higher.

773
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,000
Now he also wants to see

774
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:57,259
how the sentiment in the chart impact the

775
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:57,959
churn rate.

776
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:00,500
And this time instead of creating a chart chart

777
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,880
manually, he describes it in natural language.

778
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:07,250
And QuickSuite is able to create the right chart

779
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,809
for him. All he has to do is add this chart

780
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:11,269
to his analysis.

781
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:13,910
So you can see how easy it is

782
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:15,029
to go from

783
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,410
Sagemaker to come to QuickSuite and start building

784
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,789
your analysis and charts.

785
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:21,729
Now, after doing all of this ad hoc analysis,

786
00:28:22,078 --> 00:28:23,299
Daniel realizes that

787
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:26,239
support, customer support interactions are really impacting

788
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:28,549
the customer churn and it's really important to monitor

789
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:29,818
these metrics on a regular basis.

790
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:32,519
So he goes and

791
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:35,059
creates some more beautiful charts like

792
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:36,519
these. Now I won't go into

793
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:37,640
um

794
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:40,500
showing you how exactly he built those charts, but I guess

795
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,318
you get the point.

796
00:28:41,618 --> 00:28:43,719
But once he has built this nice

797
00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:45,959
analysis with all these beautiful charts,

798
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:48,509
he wants to make these charts available to other users,

799
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:50,719
and for that, he can simply publish this

800
00:28:50,858 --> 00:28:52,118
analysis as a dashboard.

801
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:53,380
He gives it a name.

802
00:28:54,088 --> 00:28:56,108
He enables Q&A. I'm gonna talk

803
00:28:56,108 --> 00:28:57,348
about the Q&A feature in a minute.

804
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:01,789
And that's it. He can publish this dashboard,

805
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,338
which means now he can start

806
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:05,479
sharing and cataloging this dashboard.

807
00:29:08,818 --> 00:29:10,828
So let's come back to our demo flow. So far we

808
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:11,529
have seen how

809
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,289
the analyst was able to discover,

810
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,949
access the data, how he was able

811
00:29:15,949 --> 00:29:18,009
to analyze the data using the query editor,

812
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:20,088
and how he was able to go into QuickSuite

813
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:22,848
to visualize that data and build a dashboard.

814
00:29:23,348 --> 00:29:25,390
Now Daniel wants to make

815
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,390
sure that the dashboard that he has built with all

816
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,130
the insights

817
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,500
don't remain in a silo within his own personal BI

818
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,650
workspace. So how can he catalog

819
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:33,930
this dashboard

820
00:29:34,229 --> 00:29:35,890
and make it discoverable in the catalog?

821
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,838
So let's take a look at that.

822
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:42,368
So, Daniel is back to his project in Sagemaker.

823
00:29:42,588 --> 00:29:44,588
He's at exactly at the same place where he

824
00:29:44,588 --> 00:29:45,289
left before

825
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,469
moving to Quick Suite.

826
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,559
And now if he goes to the assets page.

827
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:52,709
You will notice that

828
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:53,608
there is

829
00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:56,068
an asset called Churn Dashboard automatically

830
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:58,108
created for him. He did not have to do

831
00:29:58,108 --> 00:30:00,309
anything to create this asset in the catalog. It's automatically

832
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:01,049
registered,

833
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:03,420
and from this point he can open this

834
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,049
asset.

835
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,348
You will see that.

836
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,779
A bunch of information about this dashboard is automatically

837
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:10,868
imported over from QuickSuite, like it's

838
00:30:10,868 --> 00:30:12,939
URL, which QuickSuite account does it exist in.

839
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:16,068
And on top of that, he can start adding business metadata.

840
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:17,229
So as an example,

841
00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:18,358
he is adding.

842
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:21,160
A description to this dashboard.

843
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:23,598
And once he is done adding this business metadata.

844
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:27,239
He can make this dashboard discoverable for others

845
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,858
by simply publishing it to the catalog.

846
00:30:32,868 --> 00:30:34,949
And once he's published it, you will see

847
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:37,269
that if we start searching in the catalog

848
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:37,930
search bar.

849
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:40,969
This dashboard will start showing up in the search results,

850
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,630
which means any user who has access to Sagemaker

851
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,009
can now find this dashboard.

852
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,949
Another thing that uh Daniel can do here

853
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:52,390
is that he can also start sharing this dashboard

854
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,568
with the other users and groups in the organization

855
00:30:55,068 --> 00:30:57,068
from within the catalog itself. He does not have

856
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:58,949
to necessarily go into QuickSuite to do that.

857
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:01,348
So here you will see that he's sharing this

858
00:31:01,348 --> 00:31:03,328
dashboard with a business user.

859
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:06,709
He, he can uh choose to share it with users

860
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:08,890
or groups, but in this case, he's sharing it with a user,

861
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:11,420
and once he has shared this dashboard,

862
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:13,868
again, Sagemaker goes into the

863
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:16,009
underlying service, which is QuickSuite in this case,

864
00:31:16,348 --> 00:31:18,420
and manages the permissions on the dashboard so that this

865
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,209
business user

866
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:20,608
can access the dashboard.

867
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:24,519
So let's see how the

868
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,469
experience of a business user looks like.

869
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,519
So the business user, of course,

870
00:31:28,858 --> 00:31:30,880
can access the dashboard, but it's not just that

871
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:33,439
he can access the dashboard, they can also

872
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:36,299
ask questions and dive deeper

873
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,299
into this analysis by asking questions

874
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,140
in natural language.

875
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,500
So in this case, they're asking, how does

876
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,199
the response time impact churn rate,

877
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:45,660
and Sagemaker can do all the analysis

878
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,660
behind the scenes using the same data that's used to

879
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,519
build the dashboard.

880
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,390
And come up with some charts,

881
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:53,318
as well as a natural language description,

882
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:55,029
explaining how

883
00:31:55,568 --> 00:31:57,789
the average, uh, how the churn rate uh

884
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,930
is impacted by the response time.

885
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,568
Great, so that concludes the demo. We saw in

886
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:04,519
this demo how

887
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:07,180
uh data analysts can go from

888
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,479
having no access to data to

889
00:32:09,858 --> 00:32:10,660
finding the data,

890
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:13,098
understanding it with business context, and getting access to that

891
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,838
data in a self-service manner,

892
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,180
and analyzing that data and visualizing

893
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,358
it, and finally

894
00:32:18,618 --> 00:32:21,199
cataloging and sharing their insights in the catalog.

895
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,699
Now with that, I'm going to hand over the mic to

896
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:24,500
Mirco Buholzer,

897
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:25,640
VP of Natera.

898
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:29,380
To share how NEra is using these two services

899
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,920
to drive innovation.

900
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:34,459
Thank you, Akash.

901
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:40,019
Thank you for being here. Um, I'm gonna

902
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:42,088
represent NoEra here for, um,

903
00:32:42,098 --> 00:32:44,219
this functionality. It was great to partner

904
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:46,420
with, um, AWS to actually get this

905
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,059
implemented.

906
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,880
Um, early on we like saw this

907
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,949
as something we really wanted to have in

908
00:32:51,949 --> 00:32:54,598
our, um, data analysis environments

909
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:55,739
and with this

910
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,400
integration of data and visualizations

911
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,910
into one environment,

912
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:02,519
um, it, uh, really helped us

913
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,989
quite a bit to, to like, um, get

914
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,348
the value of our tools up and running,

915
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:09,299
and we're gonna talk about a little bit more

916
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,559
on, um, how we're using this

917
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,640
and why this is quite important for,

918
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:14,578
for us.

919
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:21,259
So, NTEra was founded in 2004,

920
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:22,949
um, pioneering

921
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:24,930
the cell-free DNA,

922
00:33:25,348 --> 00:33:25,920
uh,

923
00:33:26,328 --> 00:33:28,390
technology, and we're basically building

924
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,549
non-invasive, um, tests

925
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:32,009
which can give us,

926
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:34,309
uh, critical information about health

927
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:35,588
conditions early on,

928
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:37,868
uh, in the journey of, uh,

929
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,219
many, many patients.

930
00:33:39,588 --> 00:33:41,630
Um, we have labs in

931
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,660
the San Francisco Bay Area as well as in

932
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,969
Austin, Texas.

933
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:47,630
And it's uh really

934
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,209
key for us on a mission

935
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:52,328
to help as many patients as

936
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:53,108
we can.

937
00:33:54,318 --> 00:33:56,519
So with that, we can aim at

938
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,680
transforming the management of

939
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
disease worldwide and as you

940
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,719
can see from the statement, this is

941
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:05,019
kinda like a very moonshot type

942
00:34:05,318 --> 00:34:07,318
uh um activity that we

943
00:34:07,318 --> 00:34:09,478
would like to achieve and with that

944
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,878
we know this is not something which

945
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:13,628
is uh done within,

946
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:16,059
within a month or two, right?

947
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,639
Um, we have quite a bit

948
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,280
of, uh, tests that we're actually

949
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,320
already providing from women's health all

950
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,139
the way, um, to oncology

951
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,719
and organ health and where we have a

952
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,079
deep portfolio of tests that we're providing

953
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,260
to our patients.

954
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:34,000
Um, the key part here is we want

955
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,139
to expand and, uh,

956
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,519
enhance those tests as

957
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:40,679
quick as possible. So for us it's very

958
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,719
important to be able to iterate very

959
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,918
fast and have, uh, a quick innovation

960
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:45,579
cycle.

961
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,039
Uh, across our portfolio

962
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:50,438
and uh being able to basically bring

963
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:52,519
new tests to market very quickly.

964
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:57,188
So as you can see, um, the

965
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:59,708
innovation is not just

966
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:00,429
around,

967
00:35:00,728 --> 00:35:03,300
uh, being able to, uh,

968
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,539
do the scientific innovation itself,

969
00:35:05,628 --> 00:35:08,208
but then also being able to, uh,

970
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:10,228
leverage the data that we have from

971
00:35:10,228 --> 00:35:12,228
all the other different tests that we're already

972
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:14,628
doing and with that, um, introducing

973
00:35:14,628 --> 00:35:15,809
new tests. So.

974
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,478
Uh, alone

975
00:35:17,938 --> 00:35:19,938
in the 5 last years

976
00:35:19,938 --> 00:35:22,219
we basically brought to market 5 tests,

977
00:35:22,398 --> 00:35:23,329
uh, 8 tests,

978
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:25,978
and, uh, we're able to like

979
00:35:25,978 --> 00:35:28,050
expand our portfolio quite a bit.

980
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,458
Um, for us,

981
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,239
scalability is a key component.

982
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,010
Signathera is one of the fastest growing,

983
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,378
uh, genomic diagnostic tests in

984
00:35:37,378 --> 00:35:38,398
the world,

985
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:41,559
and with that we need to have a good infrastructure,

986
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,780
um, to be able to actually handle

987
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,320
all that.

988
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,849
So, going a little bit back to

989
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:52,110
like the, the key aspects in

990
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,208
regards to combining data with visualization,

991
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:56,329
um,

992
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,070
the journey of many companies basically

993
00:35:59,070 --> 00:35:59,750
starts

994
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:02,449
probably with um

995
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:04,929
applications having siloed data

996
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,030
and analytics tools within each of

997
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,269
the applications.

998
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:09,449
Um,

999
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,500
once that

1000
00:36:10,989 --> 00:36:13,110
stage is kind like past, we are moving

1001
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,110
into kind of like an area where a

1002
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,188
lot of companies are basically building

1003
00:36:17,188 --> 00:36:19,208
centralized analytics, um,

1004
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:19,898
teams,

1005
00:36:20,188 --> 00:36:22,188
and with that we're introducing kind of like a

1006
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:24,418
bottleneck in the

1007
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:26,610
organization where, um, we're

1008
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,869
like trying to have one

1009
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:30,949
team solve all the answers

1010
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:32,750
for everyone else, um.

1011
00:36:33,668 --> 00:36:35,829
So what we can like moved into is

1012
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:38,369
really into like a data mesh model,

1013
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,989
which allows us to everyone collaborating

1014
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:42,269
very distributed,

1015
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,750
um, very uh self-serve

1016
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,329
model uh where we use unified studio

1017
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,849
and have the ability to really contribute,

1018
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,389
um, all the data products and assets

1019
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,969
to that platform.

1020
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:56,559
Um. So for example

1021
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,719
here we have a data domain on

1022
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,958
the lab side which is combining

1023
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:03,059
all the. Uh, the

1024
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:04,800
DNA data, the clinical data,

1025
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:07,418
um, as well as some of the instrument

1026
00:37:07,418 --> 00:37:09,978
and, and, um, execution

1027
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,039
and operations data, uh,

1028
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:14,059
onto the platform and moving

1029
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:16,378
that and allowing everyone else

1030
00:37:16,378 --> 00:37:18,320
to, to use that data

1031
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:20,139
across the organization.

1032
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:22,699
So this includes obviously

1033
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,878
like interpretation, but then all the way

1034
00:37:24,878 --> 00:37:25,398
to

1035
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:28,280
R&D to develop new tests.

1036
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,639
A key part from

1037
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,719
The data mesh standpoint

1038
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,148
is really having

1039
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,610
uh the ability for each of the data

1040
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,789
domains being uh

1041
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,829
separate and independent

1042
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:47,110
um we don't want to have a centralized

1043
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:49,369
uh bottleneck and with that we

1044
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:50,228
wanna make sure

1045
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:52,898
that the um the

1046
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:55,929
different teams are able to like manage

1047
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:57,349
their data on their own.

1048
00:37:58,898 --> 00:38:00,978
This has a big disadvantage where we want to

1049
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,289
make sure that we have governance,

1050
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,619
we have security,

1051
00:38:04,938 --> 00:38:07,179
we have um access rights,

1052
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,418
we know where the data is, we don't copy

1053
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:10,079
data around

1054
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,739
so to mitigate that

1055
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:14,958
we basically wanna have a centralized

1056
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:15,639
place

1057
00:38:15,938 --> 00:38:18,280
uh with unified studio to

1058
00:38:18,688 --> 00:38:21,199
kind of like collaborate around the data

1059
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,860
and being able to do that um

1060
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,398
for the full team

1061
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:28,239
and till now that was mostly.

1062
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,918
Uh, around like the analytics

1063
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:33,820
person, but it wasn't really around visualization.

1064
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,780
So, with this new functionality,

1065
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,369
we are now able to

1066
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:41,099
like um centralize as

1067
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:43,208
including the visualization aspects

1068
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,719
and the dashboards as well.

1069
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,168
Um, obviously on the platform itself, I

1070
00:38:48,168 --> 00:38:50,289
can use all the different tools, right, which are

1071
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:51,239
available. So,

1072
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,969
uh, the, the SQL UI,

1073
00:38:54,128 --> 00:38:56,199
the, uh, Jupiter notebooks,

1074
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:58,329
um, I can go into MLOps and

1075
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:00,590
so on. I have all that capability

1076
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,760
at my fingertip and can use that,

1077
00:39:03,128 --> 00:39:05,329
uh, but I'm also now

1078
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:07,679
able to bring in the actual business user

1079
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,469
and the, the visual aspects,

1080
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,110
um, and can combine all that together.

1081
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:16,878
What we were doing initially when we

1082
00:39:16,878 --> 00:39:18,378
introduced this was really

1083
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:21,099
making sure we're moving the data

1084
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:23,668
responsibility to the different

1085
00:39:23,668 --> 00:39:24,260
applications.

1086
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,219
Um, a key aspect,

1087
00:39:26,478 --> 00:39:28,840
um, that you see in many times

1088
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,378
with

1089
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:31,840
analytics organizations is that

1090
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,519
they start to collect just copy databases

1091
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:36,539
over into the analytics environment

1092
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,119
and then you have the central team trying to

1093
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,179
make sense out of it.

1094
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:42,559
Um. What we changed

1095
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:43,378
here is really

1096
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,820
making sure that um data is

1097
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,119
a first-class citizen within the

1098
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,478
application teams where they define the schema,

1099
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:52,599
where they define the actual um

1100
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:55,228
uh shape of the data that we want to publish

1101
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,800
and uh are able to like

1102
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,918
own that similar to an API or

1103
00:39:59,918 --> 00:40:01,958
something else within the application

1104
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,958
where you really have a defined way and how

1105
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:05,199
you push that into.

1106
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:06,500
The data mesh.

1107
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:08,958
So we're using like the

1108
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:11,320
application which generates um events

1109
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,978
uh which are clearly formatted

1110
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:16,320
and then move them into the data mesh.

1111
00:40:16,398 --> 00:40:18,398
We have an option for serverless

1112
00:40:18,398 --> 00:40:20,199
transformation as well if you want to,

1113
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,199
but the goal is really to have the

1114
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:25,438
application on the shape and we don't

1115
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:27,599
have to do a lot of transformation anymore.

1116
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,159
So everything is basically done on an

1117
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,239
application level and we just ingested

1118
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:34,719
into the data mesh and have it in the catalog

1119
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:35,239
available.

1120
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:41,978
So, the other big question

1121
00:40:41,978 --> 00:40:44,378
that we had was really how do we organize

1122
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:47,179
um our infrastructure

1123
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,760
uh with QuickSuite and

1124
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,938
Unified Studio and how

1125
00:40:51,938 --> 00:40:53,958
do we um kinda make

1126
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:56,280
this an an ability to

1127
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,429
really self-serve across the

1128
00:40:58,429 --> 00:41:00,079
organization. Um,

1129
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,590
obviously since

1130
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:04,398
looking at a couple of the items that we

1131
00:41:04,398 --> 00:41:06,489
already saw, you might see that

1132
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:08,648
we really wanna have small

1133
00:41:08,648 --> 00:41:09,628
independent teams

1134
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:10,989
being able to run,

1135
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,648
uh, on their own pace and with

1136
00:41:13,648 --> 00:41:15,949
that we decided to

1137
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:18,090
have lab domains we, we

1138
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,030
decided to have like a commercial domain,

1139
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:22,449
we have a clinical domain where each

1140
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:24,610
of those domains basically own

1141
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,648
certain aspects of um

1142
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:27,340
the data.

1143
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,958
And manage their own catalog

1144
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:32,079
and the uh and and uh

1145
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,208
visualizations,

1146
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:36,139
but then combined have a company-wide

1147
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,800
uh implementation

1148
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,398
where we can like share the, the

1149
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:42,519
golden data set as well as

1150
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:44,760
the golden visualizations um

1151
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,438
that can be accessed everywhere.

1152
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,128
With this, we don't really have to copy data,

1153
00:41:49,478 --> 00:41:51,519
so the information is basically

1154
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,320
just accessed directly in the domain.

1155
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,500
Um, so it's very transparent.

1156
00:41:55,918 --> 00:41:58,079
Obviously, you can make the argument you wanna have

1157
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:58,938
everything in one account,

1158
00:41:59,438 --> 00:42:01,760
uh, which is fine too, but I think this

1159
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,918
is like uh an approach where we

1160
00:42:03,918 --> 00:42:05,918
think the teams are really

1161
00:42:05,918 --> 00:42:08,019
independent and can run at their own pace.

1162
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:13,500
So, similar to that, it's kinda like the

1163
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,648
question on how do we organize our

1164
00:42:15,648 --> 00:42:16,349
teams.

1165
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:18,889
And usually you have like

1166
00:42:18,889 --> 00:42:20,929
a technology uh

1167
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:23,329
team which um owns the

1168
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:25,409
application. We mentioned, we are basically pushing

1169
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,489
and shaping the data already into the data

1170
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:29,628
mesh, so that's called the application owner.

1171
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:31,378
Um, we have

1172
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,309
product owners which really take that data

1173
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:36,478
already, create visualizations,

1174
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,668
create metrics,

1175
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:40,139
create, um, insights

1176
00:42:40,398 --> 00:42:42,668
where we know what type of

1177
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:44,878
functionality or features we need to

1178
00:42:44,878 --> 00:42:46,989
develop based on the insights we

1179
00:42:46,989 --> 00:42:49,208
get and have the ability

1180
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,510
to really run the application

1181
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,958
data driven so that we can develop

1182
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:55,989
the, the, um, have the ability to

1183
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:58,320
really create applications which, which meet.

1184
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Uh, the user's requirements and are

1185
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,378
valuable.

1186
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:03,958
The same time, obviously you have kind of a domain

1187
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:06,300
owner which makes sure that the different data

1188
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:08,519
is quite coherent across

1189
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:09,878
the different applications,

1190
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:12,260
but with that you generate

1191
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,458
high quality data because you're basically

1192
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,829
drinking your own champagne, um,

1193
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,958
and are making sure that the data

1194
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:21,260
that is coming in

1195
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:23,599
meets the metrics that you want to

1196
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,458
be able to

1197
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:26,099
um develop your application.

1198
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,019
Um. This,

1199
00:43:28,418 --> 00:43:30,619
this like model creates

1200
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:31,188
high

1201
00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:33,739
quality data which then can be used

1202
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:35,070
by the business users.

1203
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:37,929
So on the business side, obviously they might

1204
00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:40,280
have similar or different metrics.

1205
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:43,128
Uh, they probably look across different

1206
00:43:43,128 --> 00:43:44,079
applications as well,

1207
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:46,659
um, and combine some of this.

1208
00:43:46,938 --> 00:43:49,019
Uh, so you have kind of analysts

1209
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:51,418
doing this, combining some of the data sources,

1210
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:54,349
maybe creating new, um, data assets,

1211
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:56,760
um, and visualizations from it.

1212
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:59,188
Um, and is able to really

1213
00:43:59,188 --> 00:44:01,250
work independently on that level.

1214
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,409
And then obviously

1215
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:04,889
sometimes you have like the business users come in

1216
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:06,989
and say, oh, by the way, I have this

1217
00:44:06,989 --> 00:44:09,148
idea. Can you give me some data around

1218
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:11,349
it? That's when the data scientist

1219
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:12,128
can just run

1220
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,780
on its own, create a Jupiter notebook,

1221
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:17,269
run the analysis, and come back with

1222
00:44:17,269 --> 00:44:19,148
like a validation, um.

1223
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:22,010
So, the business side really is

1224
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,668
like independent as well.

1225
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:26,329
They usually have very small analytics

1226
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:28,280
teams within the business organization

1227
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:31,148
and are able to just leverage

1228
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,619
the, the infrastructure that was already built,

1229
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:36,309
uh, from the technology

1230
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:37,579
organization. Um,

1231
00:44:37,929 --> 00:44:40,050
there might be some requests when some

1232
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,250
data is missing, but in general, the

1233
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,269
goal is really to have those two

1234
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,530
teams being able to run

1235
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,208
independently.

1236
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,219
So here

1237
00:44:51,878 --> 00:44:54,309
kinda like showing some of those visualizations

1238
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:55,449
that have been built,

1239
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:57,989
um, our lab ops team

1240
00:44:57,989 --> 00:44:59,489
together with our technology

1241
00:45:00,418 --> 00:45:02,628
organization, um, obviously has

1242
00:45:02,628 --> 00:45:03,668
like all the

1243
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,969
uh clinical metrics,

1244
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:06,579
um,

1245
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,139
the execution metrics, and so on,

1246
00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:09,769
but they

1247
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,188
really wanted to have like a

1248
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:13,208
shop floor

1249
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:16,750
level instrument level visualization

1250
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,269
and insight.

1251
00:45:18,688 --> 00:45:20,809
Um, of what's going on with

1252
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:22,010
each of the instruments.

1253
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:23,449
So not just like,

1254
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:25,889
um, test metrics, but

1255
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,889
really instrument metrics.

1256
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,869
Um, this allows them to

1257
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,349
look at utilization, uh,

1258
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,898
allows them to look at

1259
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:36,320
Uh, maintenance windows that

1260
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,019
allows them to look at

1261
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,719
when or predict certain maintenance,

1262
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,340
uh, requests as well

1263
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,878
and have that basically available

1264
00:45:44,878 --> 00:45:45,539
directly,

1265
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,958
uh, on their end and it

1266
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:48,849
was really

1267
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:51,458
incredible to see them basically do that

1268
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:53,059
as a in a self-serve model.

1269
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,389
The other thing that we, they can do

1270
00:45:57,389 --> 00:45:59,500
now with that is really

1271
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,840
plan demand.

1272
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:03,619
So with the utilization of the different

1273
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:04,500
instruments,

1274
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,898
they can now basically go through

1275
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:07,659
kind of like

1276
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:10,300
what if scenarios and they can go

1277
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,780
through like planning new lab

1278
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,059
space or lab uh

1279
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:17,340
requirements based on the insights

1280
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,378
they already get from uh

1281
00:46:19,378 --> 00:46:20,860
from the production lab.

1282
00:46:24,329 --> 00:46:26,530
Another good example um that we

1283
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,570
have here is uh around billing

1284
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,570
eligibility.

1285
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:32,050
Uh, a big topic obviously for our

1286
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,409
patients. They wanna know if their insurance company

1287
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:36,610
is actually paying for the test or what,

1288
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:38,789
what they need to pay on their out of pocket.

1289
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:40,119
Um, so,

1290
00:46:40,478 --> 00:46:42,489
we worked closely together with

1291
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:44,829
the business team, the billing team, RCM

1292
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:45,949
team here in this case,

1293
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:48,688
um, together with technology, kind

1294
00:46:48,688 --> 00:46:50,478
like having 3 in a box

1295
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,590
where they're able to take

1296
00:46:52,889 --> 00:46:55,054
the data that is coming. In from

1297
00:46:55,054 --> 00:46:57,114
the different eligibility responses

1298
00:46:57,293 --> 00:46:58,715
and then optimizing

1299
00:46:59,054 --> 00:47:01,474
uh the rules and the executions

1300
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,425
to to get high

1301
00:47:03,773 --> 00:47:06,813
fully automated uh billing eligibility

1302
00:47:06,813 --> 00:47:09,135
responses back from from our vendors.

1303
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:11,519
So we can see we're close to like

1304
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:13,840
80% fully automated uh

1305
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,199
where we're getting kinda like um eligibility

1306
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:19,340
responses directly uh from

1307
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:21,239
from our system and

1308
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:24,360
believe me that wasn't that wasn't at 80%

1309
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,659
when we started so it was really

1310
00:47:26,659 --> 00:47:28,878
great to see the collaboration between

1311
00:47:28,878 --> 00:47:30,739
the different um teams

1312
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,458
to kinda get up to that, uh, level.

1313
00:47:37,148 --> 00:47:38,059
All right. So,

1314
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,550
key insights really for us

1315
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:43,349
um is creating reusable

1316
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:44,809
components within

1317
00:47:45,228 --> 00:47:47,269
uh the organization where not

1318
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:49,349
everyone has to recreate everything

1319
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:50,228
from scratch.

1320
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:53,030
So, be it uh basically starting with

1321
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,228
um data assets or data products

1322
00:47:55,228 --> 00:47:57,269
that we have in the organization, being able

1323
00:47:57,269 --> 00:47:59,269
to share that in the catalog, being able

1324
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:01,429
to reuse that across

1325
00:48:01,429 --> 00:48:02,570
the organization.

1326
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,840
Um, is a, is a big advantage

1327
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,418
and now with the integration into Quicksight

1328
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:09,760
and QuickSuite, um, we have

1329
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,800
the ability now, um, to

1330
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,789
also have dashboards with it.

1331
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:16,119
Um, a lot of times some

1332
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:18,438
of our business users just created their whole

1333
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:20,349
catalog of own dashboards,

1334
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,000
uh, which weren't shared across the

1335
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,128
organization. And

1336
00:48:25,128 --> 00:48:27,610
then the other part is really the distributed

1337
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,769
data ownership, um, so having

1338
00:48:29,769 --> 00:48:32,208
the ability to have small teams

1339
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:33,648
run on their own pace,

1340
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,090
being able to, uh, innovate, be

1341
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:38,369
able to have quick answers

1342
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:40,909
and have the ability to, um,

1343
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:43,269
uh, get back to the business owners,

1344
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,849
um, in a good way is, is

1345
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:47,929
like a key aspect that we now

1346
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:50,119
have and, um, allows us,

1347
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:52,489
um, to really walk and

1348
00:48:52,489 --> 00:48:53,550
run fast.

1349
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,000
And obviously all of this is

1350
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,579
kind of the

1351
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:00,219
the platform that we need

1352
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:01,550
for our Gen AI

1353
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,320
uh journey that we're going through,

1354
00:49:04,418 --> 00:49:05,458
um, I mean you,

1355
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,938
you, it's all great to

1356
00:49:07,938 --> 00:49:09,978
have agents and everything else

1357
00:49:09,978 --> 00:49:12,099
running if you don't really know and

1358
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:13,079
have a good,

1359
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,840
um, uh, data foundation,

1360
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,260
you're not gonna be able to get the results that

1361
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:18,840
you want.

1362
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,739
So with this we're basically able to combine

1363
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:22,418
all of that.

1364
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,530
All right, that's it from my end,

1365
00:49:26,878 --> 00:49:29,329
uh, handing it over to uh Luis.

1366
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:36,389
got. Just

1367
00:49:36,389 --> 00:49:38,510
wrapping it up. So I would like to thank your

1368
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,750

1369
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,228
