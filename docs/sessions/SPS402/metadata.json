  "title_cn": "AWS re:Invent 2025 - 针对多智能体编排的大语言模型微调：Cosine AI 案例研究 (SPS402)",
  "abstract": "Multi-agent AI systems are becoming essential for multi-step production applications, but require specialized models that are small, fast, and cost-effective. This session explores fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, and preference alignment techniques to reduce latency and costs while maintaining performance. Cosine AI will dive into how they leverage multi-agent reasoning to power their AI coding agent and scales customized agents effectively. Learn how AWS-based multi-agent systems can continuously improve fine-tuned LLMs with minimal human intervention, enabling robust coordination between specialized agents for real-world applications.",
