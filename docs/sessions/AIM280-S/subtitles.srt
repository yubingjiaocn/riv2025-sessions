1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,280
- Thanks everyone for joining.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,410
My name is Andrew Sun, from Nvidia.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,390
I help lead our global
business development

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,063
for the retail and commerce industries.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,980
Welcome to this session.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,150
It's really great to see
such a full room after lunch.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,310
And also, it says a lot
to be at a conference

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,690
like AWS re:Invent,

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,481
where there's just so many announcements

10
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:25,260
about the latest data, compute, models.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,840
And at the same time,
so many of you coming

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,360
to join us to talk
about something that is,

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,213
frankly as human as it
gets, conversations.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,310
Voice AI is really evolving quickly.

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,013
It's no longer just a simple command.

16
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:46,650
Today, it's rich, it understands
the context of a dialogue.

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,680
It can understand your
intent, your emotion,

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,440
domain specific language.

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,540
And all of this is happening in real time.

20
00:00:55,944 --> 00:00:56,777
A lot of this breakthrough

21
00:00:56,777 --> 00:00:58,230
is happening because of infrastructure

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,810
with the cloud and AWS,

23
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,690
with accelerated computing and GPUs,

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,730
as well as foundation models.

25
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,280
And all of this is becoming
so much more tangible

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,910
for every consumer and every enterprise.

27
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,160
Such that the everyday tasks that we do,

28
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,350
whether that's customer support,

29
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,000
whether that's ordering your food,

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,600
whether that's transcribing
a medical note,

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,533
this is all being rapidly
transformed with voice.

32
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:27,990
I'm excited about our panel today,

33
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,290
because we're gonna explore
where voice AI is today

34
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,820
in the market.

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,880
What does it really take
to run a voice AI workload,

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,230
not just in a pilot,

37
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,333
but actually scale that into production?

38
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,600
And you're gonna be hearing stories

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,110
from the people that are
building these products.

40
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,940
And they're building them at scale.

41
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,310
They're tackling all the hard problems.

42
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,060
Latency, cost, privacy, safety,

43
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,771
but ultimately trust of their customers

44
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:58,470
and of their employees.

45
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,960
So with that, thank you all for coming.

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,040
And let's get started.

47
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,660
I'd love to invite my panelists

48
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,850
to please introduce themselves.

49
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,683
- Cool.

50
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:07,530
Hi everyone.

51
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,917
So, my name is Shawn,
co-founder and CTO of PolyAI.

52
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:13,260
So, PolyAI is based in London.

53
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,470
We do voice agent for
enterprise contact centers.

54
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,700
We work with some of the
largest enterprise in the world,

55
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,550
and including utility
companies, financial services,

56
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,550
and lots of hospitality, and
restaurants and hotels as well.

57
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,540
So yeah, well glad to be here,

58
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,260
and love to share more with everyone here.

59
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,700
- Alright, so I'm Cameron Davies.

60
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,490
So, I'm the chief data
officer for Yum! Brands.

61
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,470
So for those of you who
don't know Yum! Brands,

62
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,570
we're the world's largest
restaurant company.

63
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,540
So, you've probably heard of
Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC,

64
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,200
or hopefully have a burger
if you're on the west coast.

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,810
With about 65,000 units worldwide.

66
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,850
So, we're using voice
in a number of places

67
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,050
across the enterprise.

68
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,640
We're happy to talk about
it in a few minutes.

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,470
- [Andrew] I think we got
the most loyal customers

70
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,180
in a developer conference.

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,511
At least Taco Bell, certainly more.

72
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:04,967
(Cameron chuckles)

73
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:06,587
- I'm Prem.

74
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,440
I'm a machine learning engineer

75
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,930
and founding engineer of Heidi Health.

76
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,020
Heidi is an AI care partner.

77
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,650
We use voice-based, we do
voice-based clinical documentation

78
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,020
and workflow automation for clinicians.

79
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,570
So, clinicians can spend
less time taking notes,

80
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,630
and more time on the patients.

81
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,220
We based outta Melbourne, Australia.

82
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,670
And we launched this product
a couple of years ago.

83
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,750
And we scaled to supporting
thousands of uses worldwide.

84
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,877
I'm really looking forward to chat,

85
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:37,440
and good to meet all of you.

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,687
- Excellent.

87
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:39,520
Well, thanks for joining us today.

88
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,580
We're so excited to have
this diverse point of view

89
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,380
here on this panel for everyone.

90
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,213
Let's jump right in.

91
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:46,170
I think in so many times when we're going

92
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,060
through a technology paradigm shift,

93
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,370
there's always sort of a
sprinkling of a thousand seeds

94
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,420
to kind of see what blooms.

95
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,860
But ultimately what we're really

96
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,830
here for is solving real customer
problems and pain points.

97
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,063
So, let's jump right in.

98
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,510
Could each of you share
a real world example

99
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,510
of where voice AI is transforming
a core business process

100
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,350
from your vantage point?

101
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,960
- Yeah, we deploy a lot of
voice agent for different,

102
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,360
of different verticals
and many of our customers,

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,770
so it's kind of quite hard for me

104
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,753
to actually pick one specific case.

105
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:20,580
I will pick one anyway.

106
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,670
So, because we just had
a Black Friday, right?

107
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,090
So we actually work with
one of our retail customers

108
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,320
here in the US.

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,590
We started with launching a
voice agent with them first,

110
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,030
because our primary
drive is always driving

111
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,650
for the voice first.

112
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,840
And that's kind of our
product for the focus

113
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,820
since the company was funded.

114
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,600
The customer use already work
with chat vendors as well.

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,830
So they do online chat,

116
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,944
which is actually a very common thing,

117
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:51,120
that Black Friday they
got a lot of traffic.

118
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,960
They also got a lot of search
traffic during Black Friday.

119
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,170
It's about three X of their normal volume

120
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,190
during that week.

121
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,440
And typically, what they have to do

122
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,810
is that they need to staff three X

123
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,135
of the existing contact center people

124
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:09,810
in order to take and
digest loads of volumes.

125
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,230
But the problem of that is
that they have to staff,

126
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,170
started hiring a couple months ago.

127
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,360
And then it's always a temporary job,

128
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,950
because after Black Friday

129
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,320
they're going to scale back the operation.

130
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,300
So the training, the hiring,

131
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,100
and afterwards letting people go,

132
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,520
it's a very expensive process overall.

133
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,950
They started with chat, and
then they wanted to do voice.

134
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,450
But voice is hard,

135
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,810
so they partner with us
to launch the voice agent.

136
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,820
And once we launched the voice agent,

137
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,660
you would thought that
people, the business,

138
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,330
we started to let people go
and they reduce workforce.

139
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,940
The reality is that they just don't have

140
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,000
to handle these kind of seasonalities.

141
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,130
They keep their workforce around,

142
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,550
because there are so many things to do

143
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,110
in the contact center anyway.

144
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,557
If they are not picking on the call,

145
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:01,830
they can totally do something else.

146
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,600
So, I think we always thought

147
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,360
that AI would take people's job away.

148
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,100
It's probably going to be true.

149
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,750
We talk a little bit already.

150
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,200
But what we are seeing now with
a lot of our customer base,

151
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,900
it just smooths that main curve,

152
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,200
and make it a lot easier for
them to manage operationally.

153
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,010
This last week we took over
their chat deployments as well.

154
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,246
So now, we are the only
channel vendor for them.

155
00:06:26,246 --> 00:06:27,930
So, the customer can actually get in touch

156
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,840
with the B2B business online
chat, order something,

157
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,810
and then funding, and then
we would know who they are

158
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,280
and when they place the order.

159
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,517
So, I think that to me is a very cool

160
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:41,370
and interesting case study there.

161
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,571
- That's a great one.

162
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:43,470
And I feel like we've heard that in,

163
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,150
at least in the retail industry a lot,

164
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,400
in the sense that the expectation

165
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,940
versus what actually happens
is that the cognitive load

166
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,590
on these very retail demanding,

167
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,360
or business operations where it's,

168
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,420
the operations are so
intense and they spike,

169
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,640
no one in that industry
ever feels like they have

170
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,890
enough hours in the day
just to do their job.

171
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,040
And so, you actually
shift that cognitive load.

172
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,230
And a lot of the times we're
hearing customers being able

173
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,760
to actually serve customers, right?

174
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,640
And focus on the actual
connection with their end user.

175
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,170
Cam, what are you seeing in your business?

176
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,130
- Yeah, I think our most
impactful is the one we've been

177
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,920
the most vocal about and most public with.

178
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,420
We're looking at voice
AI right now in two ways.

179
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,790
Which one is in the drive through,

180
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,050
and the other is in call centers.

181
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,910
And we've done another
of other applications

182
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,830
where we haven't really
talked about publicly.

183
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,990
Those are the two big ones.

184
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,100
In the drive through, we are
live with a voice solution

185
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,010
in over 600 Taco Bells sitting here today.

186
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,840
Running live, it's been
a journey of learning.

187
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,820
What we found is really interesting.

188
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,340
We talk about cutting labor,

189
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,370
that really wasn't, isn't
our key premise off of it.

190
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,530
It goes back to what
you, you use the term,

191
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,140
we use that term, which
is the cognitive load.

192
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,430
Which is if you've ever,

193
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,920
I don't know anybody work fast food

194
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,510
ever in their teenage career.

195
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,680
A couple of people.

196
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,320
If you've ever, you want stress,

197
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,320
put on a headset, go
sit at a cash register

198
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:17,160
at a busy Taco Bell that's running,

199
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,230
let's call it four or 5 million AUVs,

200
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,260
which is a pretty big
good size for a Taco Bell.

201
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,790
And during a lunch rush.

202
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,770
And try to take an order, cash
out an order, fill a drink,

203
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,130
grab a bag, make sure it's
right, get it to a customer.

204
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,720
They're all really friendly and happy,

205
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,755
and everybody's rational, right?

206
00:08:35,755 --> 00:08:37,547
(Andrew laughs)

207
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:38,380
It's tough, right?

208
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,213
It is tough,

209
00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:43,710
and it takes a set of mental
toughness to go do it.

210
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,380
So, our thoughts are if you do this,

211
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,260
what we can do is we can
take that cognitive load off,

212
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,390
we can make it easier
for these team members

213
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,890
to do their jobs.

214
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,280
And in our experiment so
far, I call it an experiment.

215
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,050
We're scaled at 600 stores.

216
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,860
Now, that's 600 outta
60,000 across the globe.

217
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,693
But still.

218
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,870
What we're finding is really
interesting, which is,

219
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,690
if you get it right, it
can do the job pretty well.

220
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,910
And in some of our best
stores it can be successful

221
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,430
somewhere from 70 to 80% of the time.

222
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,070
That it just takes the
order from start to finish.

223
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,680
And so, it can do, and
it's just getting better.

224
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,630
We're finding that consumers
are getting more used

225
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,750
to dealing with it as it's getting better.

226
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,660
In the restaurant, we see a
couple of interesting things

227
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,550
on a direct value perspective.

228
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,680
Like it never forgets to upsell,

229
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,810
it never forgets to ask about Roundup.

230
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,790
And so, you see some financial advantages

231
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,650
there for your franchisees.

232
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,390
And then for the team members,

233
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,330
what we see in restaurants
that use it and leave it on,

234
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,333
we see dramatic decreases in turnover.

235
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,020
Which is, our keyest KPI to say,

236
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,360
are we making it better to do this job?

237
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,380
- Right.

238
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,910
- And then if you're a franchisee

239
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,440
and you understand what it takes to,

240
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,110
how much it takes to go hire
a new person and train them,

241
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,200
that's a pretty big
financial incentive as well.

242
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,033
- That's great.

243
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,490
- For Heidi, I feel like voice AI

244
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,563
is the core of how we operate.

245
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,250
You must of all noticed
that when you go see a GP

246
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,810
in a clinic, you walk in.

247
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,180
And then you see your GP
sitting in front of a computer,

248
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,650
ready to take notes.

249
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,127
You sit on your bed,
the GP is asking like,

250
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:19,320
"Hey how's your..."

251
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,030
Let's just say you have a chest pain.

252
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,470
The GP is like, "Hey,
how's your chest pain?

253
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,610
How do you rate the pain?"

254
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,510
And every now and then,

255
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,820
the GP shifts between
you and the computer,

256
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,470
just taking notes,

257
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,330
making sure that they're
getting everything

258
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,250
that you said into the computer.

259
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,800
And that just sort of makes
you feel like GPS focus

260
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,480
more on the computer than on you.

261
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,990
And there's a chance that
the GPs could be missing out

262
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,510
on real details of what you're saying.

263
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,070
And what Heidi does is,

264
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,190
Heidi uses voice AI to
take automate all of that.

265
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,500
So, the GPs gets full time spent on you.

266
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,080
You just have this ambiance
scribe in the background,

267
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,910
just listen on the conversation.

268
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,140
Just make sure that it picks up

269
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,220
on everything that you're saying

270
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,430
so the doctors put the
full attention on you.

271
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,760
And also the, I feel like
with what Heidi does is,

272
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,080
the benefit is twofold.

273
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,510
One is that make sure that GPs get

274
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,030
to spend more time on you,
they hear what you're saying,

275
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,310
making sure that they don't miss out

276
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,630
on any information that you say,

277
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,040
so that everything's accurate

278
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,420
and you don't have to really think

279
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,670
about them losing on anything.

280
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,570
And the second thing is,

281
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,760
GPs don't have to spend a lot of time

282
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,181
after their usual
operating hours making sure

283
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:26,160
that they get all the admin
work and everything done.

284
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,960
So, it's sort of like it
takes a lot of cognitive load

285
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,100
away from the GPs,

286
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,680
and also make sure that
GPs free up their time

287
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,690
to spend more time with the patients.

288
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,460
- Prem, you used a really
interesting word there

289
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,530
about ambient, right?

290
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,520
Like that it's constantly there.

291
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,290
Talk to us more about
kind of what you're seeing

292
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,791
there in terms of user
adoption and engagement.

293
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,350
- Yeah, so sometimes when we
feel more about technology

294
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,750
is that it kind of hinders

295
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,763
the way we do our everyday things.

296
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,430
You have a phone, you have a laptop,

297
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,470
you also have to spend a lot
of time interacting with it.

298
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,700
You're typing things into it,

299
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,533
you have to take your time away

300
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,730
from your normal activities to do things.

301
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,170
But with voice AI,

302
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,080
you can make the technology
not feel that pervasive.

303
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,870
It's more like a thing
that's in the background,

304
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,470
listening or doing
whatever you want to do.

305
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,510
It's like a way for you to
interact with the platform

306
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,220
without actually having
to spend a lot of time

307
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,200
away from your day to day activities.

308
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,733
Like for Scribe,

309
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:19,140
it's just something that's
listening in the background,

310
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,110
making sure that it takes a
lot of the manual labor away.

311
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,120
And also, it captures the conversation

312
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,500
and makes it into a structured way

313
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,533
when you connect to an LLM as well.

314
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,340
So, it's like a really good
way for you to interact

315
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,173
with the system

316
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:32,400
than actually having
take too much time away.

317
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,690
- Yeah, thanks for that.

318
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,880
I think in many ways that's
sort of the future, right?

319
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,790
Is this technology only gets
more personal, more fast,

320
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,070
more relevant for the user,

321
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,650
that ambiance and how you
interact with it becomes

322
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,850
so conversational.

323
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,580
It's like we all have an
assistant with us at all times.

324
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,680
Which then kind of begs the question of,

325
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,720
how do you scale this technology, right?

326
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,850
If everyone starts to form the new habit,

327
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,103
and it really starts to adopt and scale,

328
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,250
what are some of those
technical considerations

329
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,130
that really need to come to
mind if you are building this

330
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,140
or partnering this for your enterprise?

331
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,900
So, let's talk about the technology side.

332
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,810
Shawn, maybe you can
start us off here with,

333
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,210
what are you seeing as the
hardest technical challenge

334
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:16,500
when it comes to scaling
a voice AI solution

335
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,390
from a pilot into a production?

336
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,620
- Yeah.

337
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,620
Yeah, I think for after ChatGPT launched,

338
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,240
I think the world becomes
a very different place.

339
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,380
Because PolyAI existed before that time.

340
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,150
I think the LM actually make
building of these agents

341
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,520
a lot faster and easier.

342
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,060
However, you would see that once you try

343
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,140
to get it to production, you
run into a lot of challenges.

344
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,805
And I think, I usually like to say is,

345
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:52,950
this technology get you to
70, 80 percent really fast.

346
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,560
Basically a couple of hours
of work you will be there.

347
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,310
And you thought that you have
already reached that level

348
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,870
of productioness.

349
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,820
And once you get into production,

350
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,850
you realize there are so
many different problems.

351
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,203
The hallucinations,

352
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,090
the instruction for the
following capabilities.

353
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,860
These are all getting better as well.

354
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,540
But when we bring in voice,

355
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,790
there's an additional layer of complexity.

356
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,180
Is about the speech recognition errors.

357
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,640
Is that if the TT is sound robotic,

358
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,410
a user will not be engaging.

359
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,350
And you started to solve
the whole business problem.

360
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,240
I think the technical
problem is one layer,

361
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,900
but then there's another
layer on top of it

362
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,440
is the adoption problem.

363
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,050
Is like, hey adoption in my thinking

364
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:41,130
is that you need three personas
to actually buy into this.

365
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,700
One is the enterprise, the
B2B business you sell to,

366
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,590
they need to feel that they're getting ROI

367
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,060
from the solution, right?

368
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,910
So, that ROI calculation
is very important.

369
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,360
The second layer is the consumers.

370
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,620
Eventually the voice agent

371
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,151
is going to talk to your customer.

372
00:14:58,151 --> 00:15:01,410
Does the customer like to
talk to the voice agent?

373
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,080
Unfortunately in this
country the answer is no,

374
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,930
because you have try out a lot of these,

375
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,520
like an automatic phone systems,

376
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,820
which is still predominantly the majority

377
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,030
of the install base,
they are not very good.

378
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,120
And so therefore, that when human realize,

379
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,790
when people realize
this is actually an AI,

380
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,130
they immediately wanted to
hang up on the phone call.

381
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,010
That's like working in contact center,

382
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,840
one of the major issues we are seeing.

383
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,900
So, the user B2B appearance
of the first turn

384
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,010
is very important.

385
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,380
You gotta understand very accurately.

386
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,130
You're gonna say in a very
crispy way that people feel like,

387
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,190
oh this agent actually
sound very different

388
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,410
from the previous ones I interact with.

389
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,610
So that is a tricky one.

390
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,170
I think the third one about scaling

391
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,960
is about procurement adoption.

392
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,270
Like now you heard AI industry,

393
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,000
a lot of people doing
forward deploy engineering.

394
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,030
It's just because the prosumer
adoption is not quite there.

395
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,550
Enterprise, a lot of them don't know

396
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,050
how to adopt these technology

397
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,380
and build effective product around it.

398
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,690
So therefore, a lot of
startups come in to actually do

399
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,330
a lot of these forward deploy methods

400
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,640
to actually go really deep
into the organization.

401
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,770
So, this is the problem,

402
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,260
I think that everyone is
trying to solve right now,

403
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,030
all the big cloud vendors as well.

404
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,360
Because I think that's the
final piece of the question.

405
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,930
Because I think ROI,
we can narrow it down.

406
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,240
The consumer side, you can
also narrow it down as well

407
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,770
with the forward deployment model.

408
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,140
But the prosumer, real, real challenging.

409
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,970
I think, but the prosumer
adoption would gradually improve

410
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,340
as technology become better,

411
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,190
and then we need to shift,
create more product layers

412
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,897
on top of these foundational models.

413
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:47,010
So, actually much more easier
to learn and interact with.

414
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,850
- That's super helpful.

415
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,210
I think that gap in closing
that last 20%, right,

416
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,290
is so fundamental.

417
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,400
How do you think about
what to prioritize first

418
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,530
when you're trying to
close that gap, right?

419
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,010
We definitely hear companies
talking about speed, right,

420
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:02,970
is really important.

421
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,220
So, there's not just a
very uncomfortable lag

422
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,090
in the conversation,

423
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:10,200
where it's just to your point,
a very inhuman interaction.

424
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,100
But then at the same time,

425
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,020
there's probably issues
like accuracy, right,

426
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,980
at the end of the day.

427
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,813
Talk to us a little bit

428
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:16,110
about from an engineering perspective

429
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,616
how you think about prioritization
of closing that gap.

430
00:17:19,616 --> 00:17:23,250
- Yeah, it's a very, very good question.

431
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,270
It's a tough problem.

432
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,790
I think one company alone
cannot solve those problems.

433
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,320
That's why we partner with Nvidia

434
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,823
to actually solve some of the problems.

435
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:32,520
Like latency, we shouldn't worry about it.

436
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,860
Because Nvidia should have the best GPUs

437
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,580
and best software knows
how to run on those GPUs

438
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,840
to solve that problem for us.

439
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,293
So, that is just something
that we decided to take that,

440
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:44,967
that on partnering with Nvidia.

441
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:48,480
And I think accuracy is
about collecting the data

442
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,220
and then continuously improve your model.

443
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,470
So, I think that continuous improvement

444
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,760
actually matters a lot.

445
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,210
But there's also fundamentally
the model that you are using,

446
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,860
does it actually,

447
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,490
is it that sufficient for your problems?

448
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,220
One very interesting use case
is we have this outbound call,

449
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,950
where the human picking up a call.

450
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,350
When the agent make a
outbound, human pick up a call,

451
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,150
accuracy was perfect.

452
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,387
But then once there's a
robotic IVR pick up the call,

453
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:17,400
the accuracy just complete poor.

454
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,300
It's just because the model didn't see

455
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,870
this kind of data before.

456
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,540
So therefore, I think that
the approach we're taking

457
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,200
is that we decided which
areas we wanted to partner

458
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,260
so that we remove those
out of our priorities.

459
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,390
Then the second piece would be,

460
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,540
well building a very
flexible infrastructure.

461
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,190
Because the good thing is
that everyone is trying

462
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,020
to solve a problem for you,

463
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,010
because AI is making so much
elements in the past year,

464
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,450
so many companies working, okay.

465
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,560
So, you kind of have to need

466
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,960
to have a flexible infrastructure ready

467
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,790
to take on all these new technology.

468
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,070
So, I think the second way
we are doing is just building

469
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,270
a very flexible platform

470
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,760
so you can integrate it
with the latest technology

471
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,870
when they are available.

472
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,703
- Got it.

473
00:18:58,703 --> 00:19:00,270
Flexibility and option value.

474
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,250
'Cause yeah, you said it so well.

475
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,230
The ecosystem is just proliferating

476
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,539
at a very incredible rate, right?

477
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:06,372
- Correct, yeah.

478
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:08,160
- And what you think
is not available today,

479
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,900
sometimes it's a matter
of just weeks, right?

480
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,600
It's no longer months, given
how fast the market's going.

481
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,060
- And to really riff off that
for a minute, if it's okay.

482
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,710
- Please.

483
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,840
- A non-engineering perspective off of it.

484
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,160
Which is fine.

485
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,080
There's nothing wrong,
it's a good perspective.

486
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,219
The way we think about it is,

487
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:29,219
there's a set of basics, right?

488
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,800
A latency of four seconds
is not gonna be acceptable.

489
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,300
So, there's a set of basics,

490
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,780
there's a set of accuracy
you've gotta at least be at.

491
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,830
There's a set of infrastructure

492
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,390
things that have to be true,

493
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,850
and cost structures that have to be true.

494
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,560
Those are minimum hurdles.

495
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,150
Which one am I gonna prioritize?

496
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,890
They all need to be true.

497
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,723
Right?

498
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:48,960
All three of these things,
there's a minimum level,

499
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,300
and you need to decide
what those minimum levels

500
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,650
of things to be true.

501
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,850
There's no prioritization there,

502
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,350
they all just have to be true.

503
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,170
But you need to understand what that is

504
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,990
and decide what that is
for your use case, right?

505
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,190
Once I have that, then it starts to be,

506
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,010
and this is where maybe
I'm just the product

507
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,220
of 20 years at Disney, and
my experience is there,

508
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,250
then it starts to be about the experience.

509
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,360
To your point.

510
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,000
Because it doesn't
matter how accurate it is

511
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,400
if it sucks, right?

512
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,120
So, do I work, do I give you
two more points of accuracy

513
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,620
or five more points of accuracy?

514
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,920
But it's a really bad experience
'cause the latency sucks,

515
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,040
or the voice doesn't sound
right, or is off-putting.

516
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,000
So, I'm a firm believer

517
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,250
that once you hit the minimum levels,

518
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,920
your number one priority
needs to be that experience

519
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,150
for that use case.

520
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,880
Because, Shawn said we've been there.

521
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,880
The reason why I think people
are still where they are

522
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,390
is because they're so used to,
how quickly can I hit zero?

523
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,060
Because I'm used to the,
like the NLPs, they're like,

524
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,080
they're really bad,

525
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,760
they can only answer the
questions they've been trained on,

526
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,773
which is 20 questions in a chat bot.

527
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:57,720
And they can't do anything
but those five things.

528
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,600
And it's just frustrating,
just let me talk to a person.

529
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,100
So we're, in my world,

530
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,520
we're still stuck in sort
of apple-Newton world.

531
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,670
Of, my experience is this.

532
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,160
We're really moving toward iPhone world,

533
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,200
but nobody's tried it enough yet

534
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
and we're not all there yet.

535
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,680
Unless we get enough people in that space,

536
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,360
we're gonna have our
hard time moving people

537
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,620
along that continuum.

538
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,540
Just my perspective.

539
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,620
- Oh, that's super helpful, Cam.

540
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,270
'Cause I think in many ways
what I'm hearing from you

541
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,490
is customer trust at the end
of the day is everything.

542
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,720
And so, there's a minimum set
of sacred sort of standards,

543
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,090
right, for your brand to make sure,

544
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,180
in order to play this game
it's important to provide.

545
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,013
Awesome.

546
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:37,846
Prem, anything you wanna add?

547
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:39,870
- Yeah, I agree with what
Cameron said on that.

548
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,360
Just to get an intro perspective on that.

549
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,860
Especially when it comes to models,

550
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,570
you always look at models in silos,

551
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,060
like how are the models
perform in terms of accuracy,

552
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,650
or precision, whatever.

553
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,640
But you also have

554
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,097
to look at it from an
end-to-end perspective as well.

555
00:21:53,097 --> 00:21:56,100
And you need to look at how
the whole customer experience,

556
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,150
it's like you put the model in,

557
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,749
okay, it's got good performance.

558
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:00,540
But at the end of the day,

559
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,400
when you go through a
whole customer journey

560
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,710
that's more really help the user achieve

561
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,610
what they want to achieve,

562
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,120
and the performance and the
experience they get out of it.

563
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,220
That's really important to how it's like

564
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,250
when you're using like
agents like voice AI.

565
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,550
- I mean, in your world...

566
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,420
The whole point is,

567
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,690
in medical world I talk to the client,

568
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,060
and I gotta remember,

569
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,300
and I'm spending over half my
time actually just charting

570
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,710
versus dealing with care.

571
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,270
And that's frustrating
if you're the medical.

572
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,430
So, you're trying to deal
with the fact that I can take

573
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,230
the thing about your job
you really don't like

574
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,700
that's necessary,

575
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,040
move it up in that experience chain,

576
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,300
and I can spend more time.

577
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,310
But if at the end of the day
I go and go back and check,

578
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,500
and all those things are inaccurate,

579
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,520
I actually made it worse.

580
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,353
- Exactly.

581
00:22:42,353 --> 00:22:43,530
- I would've been better
off just to do it myself

582
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,363
the first time.

583
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,196
- That would just double your time, right?

584
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:46,029
- Exactly.

585
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:46,862
- Yeah.

586
00:22:46,862 --> 00:22:48,510
And also, like doctors
didn't spend five years

587
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,640
in medical school just to
sit in front of the computer

588
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,473
and take notes.

589
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:52,560
They want to be a doctor.

590
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,240
And Heidi really does that really well.

591
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,940
And voice AI is like,
it really enables that,

592
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,610
to take it from a point
where the doctors don't have

593
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,440
to worry too much about
what they're saying.

594
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,543
But if the model is not
really that accurate,

595
00:23:03,543 --> 00:23:05,760
then that actually means that it creates,

596
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,890
well it pulls down the
line but not so really bad.

597
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,870
And the coding and billing everything,

598
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,490
you can't really trust that anymore.

599
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,401
- Yeah.

600
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:13,980
- Yeah.

601
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,830
Thanks gentlemen.

602
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,480
Let's switch to another
topic here on scale,

603
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,070
related to scaling, which is,

604
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,630
we're here at AWS re:Invent.

605
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,240
I think Amazon in many ways
deserves so much credit

606
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,790
'cause they pioneered
far field communication

607
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,560
with Alexa and Echo,

608
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,920
and really took the
industry in a new direction.

609
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,690
When it comes to voice AI,

610
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,010
how are you seeing AI manage
kind of nuances specific

611
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:38,850
to voice?

612
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,950
Whether that's like a regional accent,

613
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,470
whether that's noise in the background,

614
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,080
you all kind of have a
unique perspective given

615
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,760
from where you sit.

616
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,550
So, would love to hear how
you're seeing AI manage

617
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:55,550
some of that auditory
complexity and nuance.

618
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,280
- Yeah, I think from a very
technical point of view,

619
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,070
and then after seeing
several technology iterations

620
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:06,210
in the past is that you
have a lot of these local

621
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,090
or regional issues really.

622
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,520
Like accent of a particular kind,

623
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,420
or like particular kind
of understanding problems.

624
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,630
I remember in the past
nuance used to focus a lot

625
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,400
on healthcare space.

626
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,260
It's basically tailored vocabulary

627
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,703
for those use cases, right?

628
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,670
But then if you see the
technology evolution,

629
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,100
especially in machine learning world,

630
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:34,100
is becoming a more, from a
cascading system to be a more,

631
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,740
like completely connected
large newer networks.

632
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,850
I think that's just,

633
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,660
I think when I was thinking
about where to invest in

634
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,090
and then where to solve
the problem is like,

635
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,800
it's very important to remember

636
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,960
that the technology will
eventually move there.

637
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,930
And I think LLM I
remember when previously,

638
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,130
when we did chat bots,

639
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,890
it's about intent language understanding,

640
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,330
and you have some decision makings,

641
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,070
and you writing some template text,

642
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,320
and then it's a cascading pipeline.

643
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,720
But then now, is that
complete end-to-end training.

644
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,790
We have now the speech
to speech models as well.

645
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:09,120
It's try to join all
these modalities together.

646
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,520
To be frank, I don't think the
technology quite there yet,

647
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,880
but I do actually think that
this is definitely the future.

648
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,760
And so, if the technology
is going to evolve that way,

649
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,450
and you do actually have a
problem to solve right now,

650
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,580
then you just need to solve the problem.

651
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,680
If you can solve it in a nice way, great.

652
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,160
But if that problem is only,
open AI can solve the problem,

653
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,350
then that then solve the problem, right?

654
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,080
You can patch around
that problem right now

655
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,880
so that you can have a production system

656
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,470
that's kind of ready to use.

657
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,477
Because what you want now

658
00:25:39,477 --> 00:25:41,610
is what you want to ship the product now

659
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,950
rather than ship the
product several years later

660
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,420
once the technology become there.

661
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,980
But you always need to keep in mind

662
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,830
that technology would eventually catch up.

663
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,940
So, how do you build up
infrastructure or architecture

664
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,430
that factor that in in the future,

665
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,690
I think it's quite important.

666
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,970
And I think this is quite...

667
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,950
Because internally six months ago,

668
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,680
we have this review of,
oh, do we continue to cut,

669
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,980
invest in cascading systems
or end-to-end systems?

670
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,850
And then we did a lot of
testing within ourselves

671
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,110
and also with the clients.

672
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,910
The conclusion is always like,

673
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,933
in the future an end-to-end
system will be the future.

674
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,200
- I mean, the technology
will continue to change.

675
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,810
I'd say the first thing is,

676
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,870
we should continue to
reset the expectation

677
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,130
of what the standard is.

678
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,270
And what I mean by that is,

679
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,180
every time we try to do something with AI,

680
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,110
we could talk about it.

681
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,210
Like when my head of AI's
in the back of the room

682
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,717
with forecasting, and they're like,

683
00:26:37,717 --> 00:26:38,867
"Well is it a hundred percent?"

684
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:41,130
Like, well you're not a hundred percent.

685
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:41,963
Right?

686
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:42,914
- [Andrew] We're close, close.

687
00:26:42,914 --> 00:26:44,520
- So, standards should be,
like, what is the standard?

688
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,593
And right now when we talk about accents,

689
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,920
has anybody in this room
ever had a conversation

690
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,600
with someone who had an accent

691
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,650
that was different from theirs

692
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,990
and you had to ask them
to repeat something?

693
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,760
Of course you have.

694
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,320
Right, of course you have.

695
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,830
So, the expectation isn't that
the AI will perfectly hear

696
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,493
every accent perfectly and respond to it.

697
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,470
The standards should be,

698
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,560
how does it adjust when it doesn't, right?

699
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,910
With that technology,

700
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,010
and where do we tune it to specific places

701
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,960
to make sure those things that we know.

702
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,450
And we have a joke right now.

703
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,470
One of our heads on the product side is,

704
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,950
went to Oxford and he's got
a very proper English accent.

705
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:30,013
Our current voice ordering
hates Gean's accent.

706
00:27:30,013 --> 00:27:30,846
(panelists laugh)

707
00:27:30,846 --> 00:27:31,679
It's hilarious.

708
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,512
Everybody else will test it.

709
00:27:32,512 --> 00:27:33,345
It'll get 80, 90%.

710
00:27:33,345 --> 00:27:34,680
Gean tested, it'll get to 50%.

711
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,707
He'll yell at the thing, he'll call me.

712
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:36,540
"This thing is shit.

713
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,830
I can't believe we're doing this thing."

714
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,660
And it's Gean's accent.

715
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,550
So, we could tune it to him.

716
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,383
- [Andrew] Yeah.

717
00:27:42,383 --> 00:27:43,290
- But unfortunately across the US,

718
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,630
that's not the standardized
accent that we're going after.

719
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,880
Now, when we release in
the UK, we probably will.

720
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,713
- [Andrew] Yeah.

721
00:27:48,713 --> 00:27:49,982
- But so.

722
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:51,330
And then the other is the voice canceling,

723
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,250
the noise canceling, all
that stuff will come along.

724
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,980
But I think setting the expectation right

725
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,240
is the first thing.

726
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,331
That people tend to set it the wrong way.

727
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:00,164
- [Andrew] Yeah.

728
00:28:00,164 --> 00:28:02,270
Yeah, and then fine
tuning it for bullocks.

729
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,800
- Yeah, well the thing is that
I completely agree with you.

730
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,070
And then we are expecting
AI to be better than human,

731
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,070
which isn't fair because
there's a lot of news.

732
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:18,210
People go on the news and
then say that AGI is arriving.

733
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,043
The reality is,

734
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:21,510
I think the expectation
has been set way too high.

735
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,980
So yeah.

736
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,470
- Prem, any thoughts on
kind of how you think

737
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,770
about your decisions of cascading
versus composable, right?

738
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,270
This whole idea is really,

739
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,100
whether it's the business
or the technical side

740
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,320
of how do you think about the architecture

741
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,570
in a world where you know
where the world's going.

742
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,470
How do you think about it technically?

743
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,380
- Yeah, I think Shawn kind of mentioned it

744
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,540
by making the platform flexible.

745
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,610
And especially where you
are, when you're a startup,

746
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,260
you're really experimenting
different things.

747
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,160
You don't know what works,

748
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,650
and you want to make sure
that you really stay in a way

749
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,990
you can quickly adapt to change.

750
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,840
So, if you're using a
composable architecture,

751
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,220
it really helps with
enabling something like that.

752
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,827
So, when using composable architecture,

753
00:28:57,827 --> 00:29:00,900
you're just making the
components really modular.

754
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,910
So, it makes it like,
it's like hot swappable.

755
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,920
You can, like for example,
if you look at Heidi,

756
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,975
there's transcription,
there's a non generation part,

757
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:08,250
there's billing.

758
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,210
And the way we set it up,

759
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,210
we make sure that each
part is really replaceable

760
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,380
with something new.

761
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,110
And given the way things are, even if,

762
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:16,943
like for example,

763
00:29:16,943 --> 00:29:19,240
if you're using like an
agent driven architecture,

764
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,870
where you have LLMs
interacting with each other,

765
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,640
there's a lot of models
coming around all the time,

766
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,527
there's different kind of tools
coming around all the time.

767
00:29:25,527 --> 00:29:27,990
So, you need to make
sure that your platform

768
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,720
is flexible enough to
trade and change based on

769
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,890
what was coming out.

770
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,900
So, that you know how
the flexibility change.

771
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,160
But on the other hand,
cascading is really efficient

772
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,430
when you're working in a
place where you know exactly

773
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,540
what the system needs to be like.

774
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,900
Once you ironed out how you
want a certain feature to be,

775
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,070
then you can just, like, okay,

776
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,750
this is the maximum we're gonna go.

777
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,730
Okay, then at that point
we fix certain things

778
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,563
and then we set it up.

779
00:29:51,563 --> 00:29:54,270
Okay, one thing after the other,
this is how the flow goes.

780
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,210
And also, really helpful
when you want monitoring

781
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,350
and different things enabled,

782
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,437
and also it will be very
fault current as well.

783
00:30:00,437 --> 00:30:03,930
'Cause one of the downside of
having a flexible architecture

784
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,150
is that it's really hard to know,

785
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,800
when things go wrong you have to,

786
00:30:08,678 --> 00:30:09,803
it makes it a bit hard to debug when you,

787
00:30:09,803 --> 00:30:12,030
there's a lot of moving parts around.

788
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,860
But at the same time it's
a price you have to pay

789
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,883
to stay flexible.

790
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,183
- Yeah.

791
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:18,810
Look, I think it's a great question,

792
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,090
it's one we constantly ask ourselves.

793
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,190
I've been married to the
same woman for 35 years,

794
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,300
I have no fear of commitment.

795
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,920
I'm not worried about that.

796
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,780
What I am worried about is I don't have,

797
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,940
I've never had those same kind of feelings

798
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,090
for any kind of technology
vendor I've ever met, right?

799
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,540
So, finding that balance is key.

800
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,520
And is what we just said.

801
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,340
There's pieces of it I'm
just gonna need to commit to.

802
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,300
'Cause I don't know.

803
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,840
And that commitment will
create a set of stability,

804
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,110
recurrence, trainability on
my team, and an expectation.

805
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,210
Realizing that I may be behind,

806
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,430
and then there's pieces that I know

807
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,530
we need to be composable on.

808
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,230
And so, we're constantly
reinventing the architecture.

809
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,390
By the way, we just had this conversation.

810
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,040
It's not just on the technology side.

811
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,840
We had a whole conversation last night

812
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,990
about our entire data infrastructure.

813
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,510
And our current set of schemas
and the way we've done it,

814
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,343
like, you know what,

815
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:13,320
it was really great for a set of reporting

816
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,180
and analytics that we were doing.

817
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,940
It's not set up the way
we need it to be set up

818
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,547
to feed some of our upcoming LLMs

819
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:23,160
and some of the more generative AI.

820
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,110
So, how do we do that, right?

821
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,280
And how do we flex it?

822
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,310
I don't regret the money
we put in five years ago

823
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,980
to get a great star schema
to do what we needed to do.

824
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,990
Right, that's fine, right?

825
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,280
And I have no problem with the fact

826
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,710
that we need to now reinvest and adjust.

827
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,620
But there are certain elements of models,

828
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,870
for example, we were talking
about changing out modeling.

829
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,630
Some of them will get
better, some of them won't.

830
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:50,070
And so how, where I know the
composability will be key,

831
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,223
how do I architect around that
to balance the trade offs?

832
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,803
- Super insightful.

833
00:31:58,445 --> 00:32:00,510
Given we have a kind of
different perspective,

834
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,270
both on the enterprise
side as the ISV side,

835
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,580
sort of different stages of maturity

836
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,380
in terms of your organizations.

837
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,680
Talk to us about how do
you or your customers make

838
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,080
that decision of what to build

839
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,533
when it comes to voice
in-house versus partnering.

840
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,064
- I guess I'm the one
non vendor on the stage.

841
00:32:23,064 --> 00:32:23,897
(panelists laugh)

842
00:32:23,897 --> 00:32:25,290
So, but you guys, I'd
love your perspective.

843
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,180
I can say for us,

844
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,370
we have a sort of a standardized filter

845
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:34,350
that starts with IP.

846
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:38,340
Is there something we know
that we wanna keep to us,

847
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,220
or something we that
somebody else doesn't.

848
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,490
Or is there something they
know that we don't have,

849
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,620
and that would be a huge speed to market?

850
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,770
I'll use a non-voice example on...

851
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,123
We use a third party to
do email customization.

852
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:58,770
And when we looked at the
way they were doing it,

853
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,730
Rocky and I sat aside,

854
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:03,090
like, yeah, we could probably
figure this out over time.

855
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,687
It probably takes us about 18
months of research to do it.

856
00:33:06,687 --> 00:33:08,430
And at that time the
opportunity cost is gone.

857
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,977
Let's just sign the
contract and go, right?

858
00:33:09,977 --> 00:33:12,360
'Cause the IP was already there,

859
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,240
and then it's about cost
and speed to market, right?

860
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,000
And then the third thing
for us is integration.

861
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,250
Not only are we the world's
largest restaurant company,

862
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,540
but we are quickly becoming

863
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,740
the world's largest restaurant
technology company with Bite.

864
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,350
And so, there is a lock in of integration

865
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,540
with our technology
that we also care about,

866
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,180
is that we've added as a fourth filter.

867
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,670
- That's such a critical point.

868
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,710
I think so many times in paradigm shifts,

869
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,330
people race for speed, right?

870
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,550
And speed is important in a market.

871
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,130
It's important to learn,
and rapidly learn.

872
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,740
But there's always this
fundamental strategy question

873
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,350
that we see often at the C level around,

874
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,000
who owns this intelligence, right?

875
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,620
And what is truly sacred.

876
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,360
And that's a really thoughtful decision,

877
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,250
and an important one to kind of navigate

878
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,570
your approach on.

879
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,070
- Well, and that's like,

880
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,220
more than ever we'll go to the voice.

881
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,510
No matter what, we own those recordings

882
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,370
and we own that data.

883
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,630
No matter what.

884
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,760
And all the customer data,
no matter what, we own it.

885
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,520
We even own it with our third
party aggregators, by the way.

886
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,670
So, we're serious about that.

887
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,830
And that's a key for us.

888
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,000
- Yeah, I think with Bite,

889
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,931
especially in the investments
that Yum! has made,

890
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:25,287
I think it was a billion to date, right?

891
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:28,170
And in terms of how much
they've put in, the talent,

892
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,860
you can see that it's not
just sort of a vocal strategy,

893
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,693
right?

894
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:35,040
There's real technology
with real talent there.

895
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,150
Shawn, you were gonna say something?

896
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,510
- Yeah, I think in this...

897
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,320
So, voice agent itself has
a really complicated modules

898
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,460
and technical stack.

899
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,940
In order to actually
make voice agent works,

900
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,900
not just for one use cases
but for many, many use cases,

901
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,910
because that's the
industry we are in, right?

902
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:57,090
Because it's not just about
building a retail use case

903
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,110
or financial services.

904
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,520
We have to actually sell

905
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,040
into a lot of different customers as well.

906
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,680
So, in order to do that,

907
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,690
the things that we have to
build is actually a lot.

908
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:11,040
And so then, deciding what
you do and what you not to do

909
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,360
become very important.

910
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,410
And I think this is always

911
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,830
the biggest question for startup's.

912
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,830
It's like, what's your core value add,

913
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,590
and what do you focus on predominantly

914
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,050
because you have limited resources.

915
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,300
To us, it's always about delivering

916
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,810
that voice agent X B2B appearances.

917
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,630
And we are focusing on
building up the application

918
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,210
for the end customers,

919
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,520
either for the consumer or enterprises.

920
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,740
So with that in mind,

921
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,190
we have been focusing on
building the product layer

922
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,220
to make it easily configurable
for different industries

923
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,360
and different purpose.

924
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,430
Different use cases that
they're looking for.

925
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,460
So, that has been quite fundamental.

926
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,110
We also find ourself,

927
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,780
because our goal is to deliver

928
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,480
the best user X B2B appearance
as much as possible.

929
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,350
Because we see that from our
conversation with customers,

930
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,860
that's the reason they come
to PolyAI at the first place.

931
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,300
So, we'll have to invest in
areas we think that is needed.

932
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,520
That's the reason we started

933
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,250
to invest our own speech
recognition model.

934
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,550
Because we previously found that

935
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,930
some of the off the shelf
speech APIs works perfectly.

936
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,550
But for some use cases,

937
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,800
you started to see there
are limitations there.

938
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,860
And without controlling that
particular technical stack,

939
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,350
you kind of limited by what you can do

940
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,960
to deliver that best X B2B appearance.

941
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,740
And in the old days
speech recognition model

942
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,503
is such a big problem because there's,

943
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:44,947
it's not an end-to-end model yet.

944
00:36:44,947 --> 00:36:47,430
It's like you have this
language model, acoustic model,

945
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,230
and then you have a vocabulary,

946
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,233
all these things that need to
be, again a pipeline system.

947
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,370
So, we have always
hesitate to invest in that

948
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:59,790
until we realized, oh Nvidia
started to do their own models

949
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,328
and streamline this entire pipeline.

950
00:37:02,328 --> 00:37:05,340
And it was just, okay well
let's take that base model,

951
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,770
and then we train our own model up,

952
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,290
train our own data and tailor to it.

953
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,353
And it solve so many of the problems

954
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:14,880
that we will not be able
to solve previously.

955
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,390
So, I guess what I'm trying
to use these examples to say

956
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,620
is that only model is not
a goal, is not a strategy,

957
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,392
but be able to deliver a
best user X B2B appearance

958
00:37:26,392 --> 00:37:27,720
for our clients is the goal.

959
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,360
But then the goal takes
us to actually invest

960
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,920
in this particular area.

961
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,790
So, I think you always need to
find what is your north star

962
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,290
that you are trying to achieve.

963
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,450
Say no to majority of things.

964
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,283
And then realize,

965
00:37:40,283 --> 00:37:43,020
oh, this is one thing or
two I have to invest in.

966
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,100
- [Andrew] Great.

967
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,983
Prem, anything you wanna add to this?

968
00:37:45,983 --> 00:37:47,340
- I think Cameron and Shawn,

969
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,840
they covered pretty much
everything I wanted to say.

970
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,810
But it's more about just
how what your business is,

971
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,550
how much you want to outsource.

972
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,050
It's like when you're starting off

973
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,350
you want to make sure you get
your product to users first.

974
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,393
And what's the best way to do it.

975
00:37:59,393 --> 00:38:01,470
If it's something that's
business critical,

976
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,690
you wanna make sure that you
dealt with that in house.

977
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,190
But if it's something
that can be outsourced,

978
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,070
if there's like an API provider
you can use, you use that.

979
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,110
And it's also, you have limited resources.

980
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,070
So you prioritize.

981
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,350
Like, where do I invest my resources now?

982
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,060
Is it something that I can
figure out down the line?

983
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,127
Okay cool, I'll just use a
third party, get it over with,

984
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:18,600
and then figure it out later.

985
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,280
But if it's really
critical to the business.

986
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,310
Okay, I'm gonna send my resource
to research and development

987
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:26,501
and get it up and running,
and disturb my users.

988
00:38:26,501 --> 00:38:29,013
It's just about how you
prioritize your resources.

989
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,163
- Great.

990
00:38:31,163 --> 00:38:34,743
So, moving on in terms of
enabling this technology.

991
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,350
Clearly the ecosystem matters.

992
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,080
There's so many different
players that are critical.

993
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,510
What do you think are the
most critical ingredients

994
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,790
for a business leader to look for

995
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,183
when they are trying to
decide on a voice AI platform?

996
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,290
- I'll say from our perspective it's...

997
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,410
We've already hit on a couple of them.

998
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,260
For us, it's...

999
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,580
Personally, is it somebody
we wanna work with?

1000
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,250
You say that, but we've all had people

1001
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,140
that we've worked with,
with vendors in the past,

1002
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,000
and like, yeah, I just
would prefer never to work

1003
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,440
with those people ever again.

1004
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,330
And then there's people you worked with

1005
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,250
you still have relationships with today

1006
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,890
because they were just really
good and easy to work with.

1007
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,090
You can come to win-wins.

1008
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,030
And so for us,

1009
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,580
that's just the number one thing we meet.

1010
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,660
So, is this somebody that's
on the same page as us?

1011
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,680
Do they wanna work with?

1012
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,550
Then it starts to be about
the technology piece of it.

1013
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:35,640
And sometimes I don't want
the most cutting edge.

1014
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,530
Sometimes I want the one
that's gonna integrate

1015
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,770
with my technology the easiest,

1016
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,200
people that are gonna work
with my people the easiest.

1017
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,690
And then there's a minimum set.

1018
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,520
And then it becomes to that lock, right,

1019
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,650
where we talk about commitment, right?

1020
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,050
How composable is the
system, can you speak,

1021
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,300
can you work with my other things?

1022
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,070
Do I have to do the integrations?

1023
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,650
'Cause we die on the integration
hill all the time, right?

1024
00:39:58,650 --> 00:39:59,483
We all see it.

1025
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:00,660
We die on the integration hill.

1026
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,830
So, like what's already there?

1027
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,756
What am I gonna pay for?

1028
00:40:02,756 --> 00:40:04,050
What are you gonna pay for?

1029
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,090
And then that composability, right?

1030
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:10,230
And the firm belief that if
you have to lock me in so hard

1031
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:13,830
that I have no optionality,
then you obviously don't believe

1032
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,420
that strongly in your product.

1033
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,530
That's my theory.

1034
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,810
If you believe in your product,

1035
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,066
you're not gonna have
to lock me in that hard,

1036
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:21,899
because it's going to be so good

1037
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:23,340
I'm never gonna want to leave it.

1038
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,590
And you need to put the
faith in the product.

1039
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,743
- That's a great point.

1040
00:40:27,743 --> 00:40:30,600
And it kind of segues nicely
in terms of this decision

1041
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,093
that a lot of businesses
have to come up with.

1042
00:40:32,093 --> 00:40:33,780
Of when to use open source,

1043
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,840
versus when to use a
more proprietary model?

1044
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,490
Curious if gentlemen can talk a little bit

1045
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,580
about that decision
framework for your company

1046
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,190
or in customers that you've seen.

1047
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,360
- Yeah, I would say from my perspective,

1048
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,750
always start with the
easiest to start with.

1049
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,720
Because you wanted to first prove

1050
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,150
that this technology brings you ROI,

1051
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,070
you wanted to prove that this technology

1052
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,530
is actually helping your business

1053
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,660
in the way that you want them to.

1054
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,660
And so, I think that invest
too early on in the open source

1055
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,860
is probably not the right strategy.

1056
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,090
I think that you should give
it a try on the latest close.

1057
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:17,940
Those APIs, the easiest
you can integrate it to,

1058
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,100
try to build something with your workflow.

1059
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,850
And if that works well and
you prove that there' a ROI,

1060
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,100
and you realize it's not sufficient,

1061
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,540
and then open source can actually solve

1062
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,047
that problem for you, then
you should go that way.

1063
00:41:30,047 --> 00:41:32,160
That's how we did with our ASR models.

1064
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,640
That's how we did with our
in-house ALM one models as well.

1065
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,730
It's only when ChatGPT came along,

1066
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,180
we just throw all the APIs to them.

1067
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,140
Just try to build, iterate
on the product faster.

1068
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,400
And then over time you realize,

1069
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,587
oh there are problems with
this, and that and that.

1070
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:52,936
And you don't want it to be
bounded by a particular roadmap

1071
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:56,220
of a company, then that's
where I think that investing

1072
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,070
in your own model would
actually make sense.

1073
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,270
But I think the,

1074
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,660
it needs to be a very
deliberate calculation

1075
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,660
because you don't want it
to invest in technology

1076
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,763
that you don't actually need eventually.

1077
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,353
- Yeah, it's the same.

1078
00:42:12,353 --> 00:42:14,700
I'm a firm believer in open source.

1079
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,070
I believe most of the things

1080
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,560
that's built on technology or software,

1081
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,510
it's all built on open source.

1082
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,600
But having said that, I
agree with what Shawn said.

1083
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,760
When you're entering a market,

1084
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,320
you're trying to prove a concept.

1085
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,850
And your resources are limited,

1086
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,950
you wanna invest too much in open source.

1087
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,900
And also the quality of
the open source models

1088
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,020
is not up to par with the
foundation models yet.

1089
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,360
I feel like it might take
maybe two or three iterations

1090
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,250
to open source models to catch up to

1091
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,210
all the foundation wants.

1092
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,370
But you want to prove a concept,

1093
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:48,360
so the fastest way is you use
one of the APIs for wrappers,

1094
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,440
and make sure that you get,

1095
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,600
okay, I've got a product that works

1096
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,190
and I've got enough customer bases,

1097
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,720
I've got enough resources.

1098
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,600
And now, okay it's time to
invest into an open source,

1099
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,110
or invest in my own
department without R and D.

1100
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,613
And once you get that point and you can,

1101
00:43:03,613 --> 00:43:06,390
there's a lot you can do,
you have the flexibility.

1102
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:09,480
'Cause a lot of the reasons
why people move away

1103
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,640
from foundation or frontier models

1104
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,740
from different providers and calls,

1105
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,480
is everything's behind an API.

1106
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,620
You don't know what's happening there,

1107
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,170
everything's abstracted away from an API.

1108
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,210
But you get to a point
where you want to own

1109
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,740
a lot of those components,

1110
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,600
like different things,
how you wanna do it.

1111
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,460
And then once you attain a certain point,

1112
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,030
you'll be tired of just
having to call random API.

1113
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,200
To get one thing done,

1114
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,297
you might have to call
three different APIs.

1115
00:43:33,297 --> 00:43:35,070
And you can just get

1116
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,410
some open source models, hosting yourself,

1117
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:39,510
and do a much better job than they can do.

1118
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:43,260
'Cause what these foundation models,

1119
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,680
what they do is they give
you a generic use case.

1120
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,540
But based on your business needs,

1121
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,940
it might be a bit different.

1122
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,830
And they may not be flexible enough

1123
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,250
to integrate that into your future.

1124
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,150
And then you get to a point where,

1125
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,930
okay, this is where I start
investing in my own R and D

1126
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,460
and get my product to a place

1127
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,430
where these services can
no longer support me.

1128
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,840
- [Andrew] All right.

1129
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,860
Cam, you mentioned earlier

1130
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,780
a lot of the business
outcomes you're seeing

1131
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,190
and the measurement of it.

1132
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,890
I'm curious if other folks
on the panel can talk

1133
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,470
a little bit about
tangible business outcomes,

1134
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,450
and potentially to the extent

1135
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,070
you can share business measurement

1136
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,870
that you're seeing outta
your customers, right?

1137
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,770
In terms of impacts to their business.

1138
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,510
When it comes to
integrating voice obviously.

1139
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,888
- I'm sorry, could you repeat that again?

1140
00:44:28,888 --> 00:44:29,721
Sorry.

1141
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:30,554
- [Andrew] Yeah, just in terms
of are there any examples

1142
00:44:30,554 --> 00:44:33,210
of business outcomes
from integrating voice

1143
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,850
that you're seeing in health, for example?

1144
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:36,690
- Yeah.

1145
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:37,523
- [Andrew] And similarly, Shawn,

1146
00:44:37,523 --> 00:44:39,990
you serve multiple industries.

1147
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,740
Talk to us a little bit about that.

1148
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,610
- In terms of health.

1149
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,630
One thing we've noticed,

1150
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,680
that clinicians are
very hesitant to change.

1151
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,570
Like when you're trying to
introduce a new software,

1152
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,010
they'll rather, even if it's very helpful,

1153
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:55,150
they'd rather stick to whatever
they have up and running

1154
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,660
'cause they're not that tech savvy

1155
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,100
like an engineers would be.

1156
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,710
And they have something
that's set out and that works,

1157
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,270
and they don't wanna break it.

1158
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,800
And what we've observed,

1159
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,120
that when you have a software
that's built on top of voice,

1160
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,040
it kind of makes it easier

1161
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,950
for clinicians to interact
with your product.

1162
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,480
They don't even have to know it's there.

1163
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,160
It's just something that's
running in the background.

1164
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,810
No one's gonna notice it's there.

1165
00:45:20,096 --> 00:45:21,240
You only know it when
you interact with it.

1166
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,100
You start recording and
then you stop recording.

1167
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,840
That's pretty much all you have to do.

1168
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,000
And also the downstream tasks as well.

1169
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,320
You can automate a lot of that as well,

1170
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,820
like the billing and medical coding,

1171
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,720
and integrations and things like that.

1172
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,010
With the beauty of Heidi
is it has integration

1173
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,180
with a lot of EHRs,

1174
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,860
so that notes are not just sitting there

1175
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,290
in a standalone software or something.

1176
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,990
Once you've done a
consultation, we have the notes,

1177
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:43,983
and then it moves into an EHR.

1178
00:45:43,983 --> 00:45:45,690
It's just there ready to go.

1179
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:46,523
And you can also take care

1180
00:45:46,523 --> 00:45:48,810
of your downstream workflows as well.

1181
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:52,020
And all of that is being
made possible with voice AI.

1182
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,920
So, I feel like there's a
big wave of change coming,

1183
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,413
and voice AI is gonna
play a big role in it.

1184
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:00,780
- [Andrew] Shawn, anything in terms

1185
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,910
of your cross industry
view around business?

1186
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:05,670
- Yeah, so I think it's
very interesting that,

1187
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,470
because when we started working

1188
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:10,530
on the contact center industry overall

1189
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,630
we thought that cost is the primary thing.

1190
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,970
And then a lot of people
thought that we're just trying

1191
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,283
to use AI to replace humans.

1192
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,170
The reality is that once
you deploy these voice agent

1193
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,210
in various different industries,

1194
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,790
you kind of starting to realize
that different industries

1195
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,590
actually care about different things,

1196
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:32,250
and they are seeking
ROIs in different ways.

1197
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,520
So, the retail example I just mentioned

1198
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,530
is about smooth that demand curve.

1199
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:40,560
So then they can actually,

1200
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,390
they don't have to over
hire that many people

1201
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:43,980
in training lab and
then let them go later.

1202
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,450
So, that workforce management

1203
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:48,420
is a very important piece to them.

1204
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:51,450
That's for retail, because
they have seasonality.

1205
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,570
For restaurants we work
with, they actually,

1206
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:57,690
we do a lot of reservations
and bookings for them.

1207
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:01,440
And it's actually very
funny that on average,

1208
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,440
restaurants actually missing
about 20% to 30% of their calls

1209
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,273
because just about the
kind of things involved

1210
00:47:09,273 --> 00:47:11,550
that is happening inside of a restaurant.

1211
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,550
People running around,
especially at the peak hours,

1212
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:15,660
to actually pick up the call.

1213
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,230
And then sometimes if there's
availability one hour later

1214
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:21,390
they don't even negotiate
that availability.

1215
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:25,080
So, the covers will not fail for example.

1216
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,390
So, and then we just
found that restaurants,

1217
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:30,630
we usually find that they
are, for large enterprises,

1218
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,730
they found a value in,

1219
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,020
not just about the company and the law,

1220
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:37,140
but also be able to pick up
some of those revenues as well.

1221
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,020
So, I think we are helping them
to increase with maybe a 4%,

1222
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,290
5% of the revenue once
deployed the voice agent.

1223
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:47,160
Which is the kind of
ROI we would not expect

1224
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,330
to begin with, right?

1225
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,150
So, I think there are a lot
of these different aspects,

1226
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,667
and think different
industries are different,

1227
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:55,140
so you kind of have to deploy something

1228
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,083
and learn with the
clients on that journey.

1229
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,850
- The retail examples hits home obviously.

1230
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,140
Just because to your point,

1231
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:08,010
the expectation versus the
discovery was quite opposite.

1232
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,843
Right?

1233
00:48:08,843 --> 00:48:12,510
And in retail, customer service typically,

1234
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,040
especially as things move more digitally,

1235
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,050
you have last mile shipping costs.

1236
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:16,932
- Yes.

1237
00:48:16,932 --> 00:48:18,360
- And then when you can
serve a customer well,

1238
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,330
you avoid the return additional
last mile shipping cost,

1239
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:22,163
right?

1240
00:48:22,163 --> 00:48:23,070
That recovery cost.

1241
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,140
And so, when you serve
your customer as well,

1242
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,720
it can improve not only
customer life and value,

1243
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,070
but the actual order economics.

1244
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:29,903
- Correct, yeah.

1245
00:48:29,903 --> 00:48:30,736
Exactly.

1246
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,657
- It's interesting that,

1247
00:48:32,657 --> 00:48:36,510
'cause you imagine a world
where right now you call

1248
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,130
and you're put on hold
to deal with something

1249
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:41,100
because the IBR can't handle
what you need it to do.

1250
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,740
And you have a choice, stay
on hold for 45 minutes,

1251
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,272
or give me your number
and I'll call you back.

1252
00:48:46,272 --> 00:48:48,510
I think we're moving
toward a third option,

1253
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:51,792
which is, or just talk
to the virtual agent.

1254
00:48:51,792 --> 00:48:52,625
- Oh yeah.

1255
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:54,420
- Which most of us are like,
well if they can handle it,

1256
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,330
why wouldn't I of those three options?

1257
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:00,540
And then what you see is
in the restaurant use case

1258
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,380
on the reservations,

1259
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,630
and I've talked a lot
of folks in our space,

1260
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,513
we don't do that obviously,
but the ones that do,

1261
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:11,220
that idea of nobody's ever on hold.

1262
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,470
Somebody's always gonna pick up the phone,

1263
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:18,300
and so what that does to
their top line demand driver.

1264
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,220
It was there, but they were in,

1265
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,220
revenue management world
we called it an enable.

1266
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,270
You lost the business,

1267
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,190
you had no idea you lost the business

1268
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:28,627
because of availability or
nobody picked up the call, right?

1269
00:49:28,627 --> 00:49:30,360
And so as that goes away,

1270
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,330
I think it's gonna be an
interesting, as in your world,

1271
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,190
as that business case continues to flow.

1272
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,753
Because it's a very,

1273
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:40,667
I'm booking a reservation for this time.

1274
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:42,450
Right, so it's very clean,
it's very contained,

1275
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:46,380
and yet somebody can, I'd
rather do that than not.

1276
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,640
- Yeah.

1277
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,717
That's a great example, Cam.

1278
00:49:48,717 --> 00:49:51,450
And we see that in voice
adjacent with vision.

1279
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:54,060
Like in retail, often retail
companies will come in

1280
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,550
and they'll start using
computer vision to detect

1281
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:59,880
and automate and smooth out
self-checkout at a store.

1282
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,830
And as they can use more
accelerated computing,

1283
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,810
they realize that there's
a lot more workloads

1284
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:07,200
that they can actually
run on that same GPU.

1285
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,210
And so, the detection of the use case

1286
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,770
they didn't even realize they had, right.

1287
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,530
It's suddenly they're
looking at movement patterns

1288
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:14,363
of their customers,

1289
00:50:14,363 --> 00:50:17,040
and how long they're waiting
in line not just at checkout,

1290
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,973
but at the deli.

1291
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:21,810
A great example is Kohl's
in Australia realized

1292
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,110
if customers wait more
than 45 seconds at a deli,

1293
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,000
then they're gonna leave that line.

1294
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,940
And so, now they can actually
perceive it, understand it,

1295
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,550
alert the customers, and its
incremental revenue, right.

1296
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,950
- And we're talking voice,
but Lowe's isn't here,

1297
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,810
but we all know those folks.

1298
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,260
And the way they're
starting to do it the old,

1299
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,790
I don't see it in your bag, right?

1300
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:44,370
The way that's just a terrible experience.

1301
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,410
Now, the computer vision's watching

1302
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,230
what comes out of the cart
and goes into the bag,

1303
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:51,390
and say, "Hey, I think you
may have missed something."

1304
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:52,680
Like, "I counted 14 items."

1305
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,817
It's less intrusive, right?

1306
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:55,980
And it's a lot smoother.

1307
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,750
But what it's doing for them on shrinkage

1308
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,200
is really interesting.

1309
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,033
- Yeah.

1310
00:51:00,033 --> 00:51:00,870
- Yeah, it's all about
reducing the friction

1311
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,090
and making it really convenient.

1312
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,580
Alright, let's kind of move to kind

1313
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,780
of the final group of questions here,

1314
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,640
which is really about guidance.

1315
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,183
You all are unique leaders in
your respective industries.

1316
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:17,403
For an organization that's
just starting in voice AI,

1317
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:23,220
what's the top lesson or lessons
that you wish you had known

1318
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,053
from the outset?

1319
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,300
- Yeah, I'd say that if I was gonna give

1320
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,070
anybody advice on this,

1321
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:35,070
and this is just not just
voice, this is anything.

1322
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:38,651
One of the hardest things to
do is know when to let go.

1323
00:51:38,651 --> 00:51:40,890
And we talk about failing fast,
and it's like, no, no, no,

1324
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,330
you need to fail cheap.

1325
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:45,330
Because you fail fast and
expensive, that's still not good.

1326
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:46,800
You need to fail cheap.

1327
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,070
But one of the things, and we,

1328
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:52,110
if I go back the last five years at Yum!,

1329
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,880
just used that as an example,

1330
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,040
I can name six things right now

1331
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,843
that we have now stopped doing.

1332
00:51:58,770 --> 00:51:59,730
Right, we tried it.

1333
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,590
We tried it, it didn't work.

1334
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,900
And every one of those
projects had somebody

1335
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,910
who was really passionate about it,

1336
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,320
that really believed in it.

1337
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,090
And if we just gave it another try,

1338
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:11,280
we could make it work, right?

1339
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,140
And one of the hardest
things to do is saying,

1340
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,480
you know what, this isn't working.

1341
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,040
It's not worth the effort right now.

1342
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,240
Or maybe the time's not right,

1343
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,890
maybe the technology's not there.

1344
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,390
and I know we've invested in it.

1345
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:24,300
But I've literally met
people that will let a spouse

1346
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,350
or a relative go before they'll
let that project go, right?

1347
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:29,930
And so, getting that...

1348
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,180
Learning and putting the rules in place,

1349
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,403
and the stage gates in place upfront.

1350
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,800
Put it up front and say,

1351
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,410
hey, these are what the stage gates are.

1352
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,520
Here's what success are.

1353
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,900
When will we call it?

1354
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,850
What needs to be true by this point,

1355
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:47,790
or we're just gonna put it
away for the time being?

1356
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,640
And there are projects
that we let go on too long

1357
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,770
because we didn't do that up front.

1358
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,410
And not only was it a net cost,

1359
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:56,370
there were opportunity cost,

1360
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:57,480
things we should have been working on,

1361
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,970
we could have been working
on that we weren't.

1362
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:02,280
And that's the, I think is people come in,

1363
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,570
the best advice I give 'em right now.

1364
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:04,770
Let's set that up front.

1365
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,900
Every project, let's set the stage gates

1366
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,250
and understand it now,

1367
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,590
so when the time comes
we're gonna call it, right?

1368
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:11,730
We're gonna put a motion aside,

1369
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,870
we've already made the agreement.

1370
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:16,050
And unless something's changed,
that's what we're gonna do.

1371
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:19,350
- Yeah, I totally agree with that.

1372
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:22,560
Because I think, what I want
to add on top of that is,

1373
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,340
because I think voice agent,
despite that there's a lot,

1374
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,500
we have made a lot of progress there,

1375
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,790
technically the technology
still has a lot to go,

1376
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:33,633
to be honest.

1377
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,450
I think if you done it right,
it's completely possible

1378
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,160
to actually solve your problem already.

1379
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,590
But it's very likely that you are going

1380
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,790
to end up lots of resource,

1381
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:47,730
spending a lot of resources
and not going anywhere.

1382
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,290
So because of that,

1383
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:51,840
setting up those milestones
are very important.

1384
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,800
Also, finding a partner that are willing

1385
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,160
to actually go really deep
and really far with you

1386
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,670
is very important as well.

1387
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:02,670
That's why there's a lots of startups

1388
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:05,040
out there doing FDE models.

1389
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,990
We are also doing that as well.

1390
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:11,160
And if they are doing the
FDE models, try them out,

1391
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,350
let them build things for you.

1392
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,140
Maybe it's a cheaper way for you

1393
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,150
to actually speed the pyramid.

1394
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,250
And there's a lot of competition now

1395
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:21,420
in voice agent companies.

1396
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,270
So, you can negotiate
the deals, good for you.

1397
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,430
And then just give it a try.

1398
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,400
And I think that is probably a way

1399
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,900
that you should go as well,

1400
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,090
rather than also thinking about putting

1401
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:35,790
all these big technology boxes together,

1402
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:39,270
because that's actually a
lot you have to do as well.

1403
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,000
So, find a cheaper way to X B2B human,

1404
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,670
and finding a partner that you can lean on

1405
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:48,363
and trust to work on, I
think would be my suggestion.

1406
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,600
- My advice is from an
engineering perspective.

1407
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,283
And I think it's not just for voice AI,

1408
00:54:53,283 --> 00:54:56,010
it's for any project that
you start working on.

1409
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:58,500
It's always good to start small.

1410
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,500
Like you can think of building
something piece by piece,

1411
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,140
like putting the Lego pieces together,

1412
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,960
making sure that you
stay flexible on the way.

1413
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,750
You have a feature or a
product you wanna build,

1414
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,810
you wanna try and have a
proof of concept built.

1415
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,010
And you start really small,

1416
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,840
you use whatever resources you have.

1417
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,040
APIs, open source,

1418
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,230
whatever you think is
best you start with that.

1419
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,900
And then you, once you
get some validation,

1420
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,460
you start building on top of it.

1421
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,720
You have some components there.

1422
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,560
Okay, earlier I used a
third party or a vendor,

1423
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,120
maybe the latency's not that great.

1424
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,400
You swap it out, you put
a different piece on.

1425
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,050
And then brick by brick, piece by piece,

1426
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:35,150
you start building it,

1427
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:38,220
and then you get to a place where you are,

1428
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,510
the product is very flexible.

1429
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,820
'Cause like Shawn said,

1430
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,370
the technology that we have these days,

1431
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:46,200
every day there's a new model coming out.

1432
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,580
And if you want to make sure,

1433
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,651
if you wanna stay relevant
and make sure the model

1434
00:55:49,651 --> 00:55:51,000
is performing at it's best,

1435
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,310
you wanna make sure
that you're leaning in,

1436
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,830
you're making sure that you're
using the best out there.

1437
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,830
And having them build piece by piece,

1438
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,750
really make sure that you stay flexible

1439
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,750
and you can adapt to change
as quickly as possible.

1440
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,740
- Great.

1441
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,860
