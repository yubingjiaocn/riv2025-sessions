  "abstract": "The AWS Nitro System revolutionized cloud computing by providing always-on confidential computing, ensuring AWS has zero operator access to customer data. While AWS offers various ways to assure this protection, today we are introducing Nitro Isolation Engine as an enhancement to the Nitro System. Nitro Isolation Engine harnesses formal verification to provide mathematical certainty that customer workloads are isolated from each other and AWS operators, pioneering a new standard for  mathematically proven cloud security. Join this session to learn from our engineers how the Nitro Isolation Engine was designed and implemented for formal verification to enhance customer trust in the security of the Nitro System.",
