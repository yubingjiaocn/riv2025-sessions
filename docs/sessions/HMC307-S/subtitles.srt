1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,650
- Hi, good morning everyone,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,420
and thanks so much for
joining our talk today

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,820
on what cloud resilience really means

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,910
in the new era we're in today, the AI era.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,670
I'm Dev Rishi, I'm general
manager of AI here at Rubrik,

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,890
joined with Adam, the director

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,663
of cloud specialists at Rubrik.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,740
Today I'm gonna be spending some time

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,850
talking about how Rubrik
thinks about resilience for AI.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,500
Adam is gonna be talking about how Rubrik

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,890
protects some of the most
important data aspects

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,030
and workloads that are running

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,103
in an increasingly cloud native world.

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,640
Now at Rubrik, just about a month ago,

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,970
we announced a new product
that we're putting out,

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,340
and the real orientation for the product

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,250
is to underwrite one of the
biggest enterprise trends

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,850
that we've observed coming
up over the next 18 months,

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,200
and that's really the rise
of agents and agentic AI.

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,050
Over the past three months,
I've had a chance to speak

21
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,990
with over 180 different organizations,

22
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,810
at the security and enterprise IT level,

23
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,510
to understand what are some
of their key initiatives

24
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,160
when they're thinking
about their deployments

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,220
around AI in 2026 and beyond,

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,450
and what are the key concerns

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,740
that might be holding them back

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,470
from being able to
tackle those initiatives.

29
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,140
Consistently one of the main trends

30
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,960
that arises when it comes
towards the actual application

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,970
of AI inside of an organization

32
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,310
is the use of the term agentic.

33
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,410
If you've been walking
around re:Invent this week,

34
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,450
you've probably seen
your fair share of agents

35
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,340
and agentic AI as well.

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,710
And I think that it often
helps to be able to start

37
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,420
with a definition for what do we mean

38
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,253
when we talk about agentic AI?

39
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,210
We define agents in agentic AI
as LLMs with access to tools.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,140
What that really means

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,563
is models that can take
action on a user's behalf.

42
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,650
It's clear why we think
that this is going to drive

43
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,410
a lot of the enterprise
productivity going forward,

44
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,180
as we think about workflow automation

45
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,030
and productivity gains as
some of the greatest areas

46
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,740
that most enterprises have

47
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,890
for being able to achieve
business transformations.

48
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,090
But the rise of agentic AI
comes with its own risks.

49
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,060
AI agents in many ways are superhuman.

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,340
They can operate at a much faster speed

51
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,860
than a normal user might be able to,

52
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,410
but that also means that
they start to operate

53
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,840
at an area where you can do 10x the damage

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,073
in 1/10th the time.

55
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,460
Additionally, AI agents operate

56
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,430
with non-human identities and credentials.

57
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,800
They operate within an
enterprise ecosystem

58
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,283
that was not necessarily set
up for the AI generation.

59
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,610
And I think we've started to see

60
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,720
one of the biggest blockers
towards enterprise acceleration

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,870
when it comes towards the
deployment of agentic AI

62
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,430
is a fear of risk

63
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,170
or another way, as a lot of IT leaders

64
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,330
I think that I've spoken to have put it,

65
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,250
the lack of understanding
of all the different things

66
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,170
of what could go wrong.

67
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,090
And these aren't hypothetical risks.

68
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,750
We've seen examples of these
already in the early days

69
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,340
of agentic AI.

70
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,920
All the way from moments
in which a chat bot

71
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,800
might be recommending things
like a competitor's product

72
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,260
or even inventing things
via hallucinations

73
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,090
like refund rules,

74
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,730
all the way to more
dangerous types of actions,

75
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,190
like coding agents that have gotten access

76
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,000
to production databases in
order to be able to make change

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,760
and affect change, and have
decided to be able to go

78
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,430
and actually do something
to optimize a subroutine

79
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,780
that involves dropping
the production database.

80
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,850
One of the biggest questions
that I think organizations ask

81
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,980
when I speak to them about the
promise of what generative AI

82
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,730
and agentic AI can actually achieve

83
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,260
is how they're supposed to think about

84
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,450
being able to guardrail it

85
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,190
and also what happens in the cases

86
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,873
when things inevitably go wrong.

87
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,330
One of the key aspects by
definition that we think about

88
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,320
with agentic AI is that
it gets your AI agents'

89
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,530
organizations to your
enterprise applications,

90
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,330
tools, and data.

91
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,790
It's really what makes
AI agents unique in terms

92
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,110
of their capabilities.

93
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,490
We're going beyond this ability

94
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,330
to just do knowledge retrieval,
better chats, or search,

95
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,740
and actually going into the world

96
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,500
where an AI agent can update
that opportunity in Salesforce,

97
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,840
help you draft that email in Office 365,

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,970
or even be able to help
you update configurations

99
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,280
inside of your AWS account.

100
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,420
But the real trick

101
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,330
that I think a lot of
organizations deal with

102
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,300
is what it looks like to be
able to maintain and manage

103
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,300
this new AI and enterprise
digital workforce

104
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,130
that might be spanning
across different production

105
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,350
applications that were invented

106
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,060
well before the time that these AI agents

107
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,810
actually started to get rolled out.

108
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,400
In speaking with 180 enterprise IT

109
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,900
and security leaders
that I've had a chance

110
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,663
to have conversations with
over the last three months,

111
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,120
here are some of the key sets of concerns

112
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,360
that we've really heard
relatively consistently.

113
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,220
That organizations really tell us

114
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,530
that they lack the single pane of glass

115
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,510
that gives them, starting number one,

116
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,390
an answer to just the simple question

117
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,060
of what AI agents are
even actively running

118
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,980
inside of my ecosystem.

119
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,320
I've spoken to leaders at
Fortune 500 organizations

120
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,900
that talk about how this
is a board-level mandate,

121
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,210
but the way that it's
done today is manual.

122
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,820
There's a committee,
there's a intake process,

123
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,500
or somebody is manually checking

124
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,950
where all these agents are and
creating their own registry.

125
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,110
The next thing leaders are concerned about

126
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,580
is what are the types of tools

127
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,640
and data that an AI agent
can actually access?

128
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,220
Again, oftentimes a
board-level compliance mandate

129
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,380
to be able to make sure that
you have a data use policy

130
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,110
in place, but how does
this actually get enforced

131
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,911
when you have agents that are built in

132
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:38,820
AWS Bedrock AgentCore, Copilot Studio,

133
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,880
your own custom agents
directly calling open AI,

134
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,410
all the way down to the concern

135
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,683
around how do I actually
recover from an AI mistake?

136
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,150
From my experience, AI agents

137
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,610
have actually never been easier to build.

138
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,490
The long pull in adoption
towards AI acceleration

139
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,980
in organizations is no
longer the difficulty

140
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,200
of being able to use AI.

141
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,400
At this point, building
agents can take days or weeks,

142
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,260
but the deployment process

143
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,550
and the approval process

144
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,830
is actually what I've seen take months.

145
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,790
I spoke with one Fortune 500
leader in financial services

146
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,350
who said that they weren't too worried

147
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,240
about the risks that AI agents might pose

148
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,530
in their organization

149
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,480
because they know it'll
take at least nine months

150
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,160
for that agent to get approved,

151
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,660
and that's not really the formula

152
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,660
for what I think fast
adoption can look like.

153
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,510
We saw this firsthand
even at Rubrik ourselves

154
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,060
as we developed agents at the
beginning part of this year

155
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,170
to be able to start to automate

156
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,780
more and more of our internal workflows.

157
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,570
What we saw was that building
an initial proof of concept

158
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,010
was done quickly.

159
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,130
Our developers, our IT
teams, even business users,

160
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,080
were able to build an
initial proof of concept,

161
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,530
just a prompt and a collection
of like some LLM tools,

162
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,093
within days or weeks.

163
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,470
What it came next though was
really I think the long pull.

164
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,480
You needed to be able
to create design docs

165
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,030
and go through an AI
committee for approval.

166
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,460
The AI committee is
oftentimes cross-functional

167
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,910
across IT, InfoSec, and legal.

168
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,260
By a quick show of hands,

169
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,670
who here works at an organization

170
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,220
that has an AI governance
committee already set up?

171
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,110
About half the room or so.

172
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,090
One of the things that I
think we've consistently seen,

173
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,640
and I sit on our AI
governance committee as well,

174
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,620
one of the things that I consistently see

175
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,020
from an AI governance
standpoint is a real friction

176
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,670
between the people developing AI

177
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,720
and oftentimes the governance

178
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,000
that's supposed to be in place.

179
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,650
One of the things that we experienced

180
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,050
was that each time we needed
to go through this approval,

181
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,823
it would take two months or so,

182
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,510
and that was really before we
started to get into the place

183
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,410
where we were actually ready to build

184
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,030
a production ready agent.

185
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,100
So this entire lens

186
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,140
started to get extended from
the two weeks that we needed

187
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,630
in order to be able to build
that initial proof of concept

188
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,820
to now multiple months to quarters

189
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,560
in order to be able to get
something that is actually,

190
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,080
quote, production ready
and pass these initial

191
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,670
sets of checks.

192
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,990
This was frustrating for us

193
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,150
because each time we had to
go through the review process,

194
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,650
we were essentially
going through a checklist

195
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,970
and trying to make sure

196
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,740
that each of part of what we were doing

197
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,360
was correctly litigated.

198
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,800
Instead, what our developers

199
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,550
and AI agent builders asked
for is define a framework,

200
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,950
define a playground in
a policy environment,

201
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,170
where I can actually go
ahead and build agents

202
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,300
and as long as I'm building
according to the framework

203
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,320
that you've had,

204
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,740
let's cut down on some of
this initial roadblock piece

205
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,290
that allows me to actually
accelerate the pace

206
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,580
at which I'm adopting

207
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,960
and really get to my end goal,

208
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,120
which is an AI agent
deployed in production

209
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,383
as quickly as possible.

210
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,700
To me, the biggest
observation to really entering

211
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,400
into this space is that the real inhibitor

212
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,670
to both ROI and AI, as
well as acceleration AI,

213
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,040
is no longer the difficulty
of using the tooling,

214
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,990
but the risk that comes
with the tooling overall

215
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,700
and the lack of good
and effective frameworks

216
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,000
to be able to tackle that.

217
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,070
That's why Rubrik has decided
to get into this space

218
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,005
and unify some of our core competencies

219
00:08:55,005 --> 00:08:58,653
in data and identity with
this new agentic future.

220
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,413
Now, my name is Dev.

221
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:02,430
Before I joined Rubrik this
summer via acquisition,

222
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,750
I was co-founder and CEO

223
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,600
of a generative AI
startup called Predibase.

224
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,024
We worked as an LLM infrastructure
platform and the backbone

225
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:13,170
for a number of leading
technology companies deploying

226
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,720
large language models at scale.

227
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,880
We joined forces with Rubrik this summer

228
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,350
because we see a real opportunity

229
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,690
to be able to take our AI platform

230
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,120
and mix it with what
Rubrik does best in class

231
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,300
across data and identity to
bring the enterprise wave

232
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,523
of AI adoption here sooner.

233
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,960
Rubrik's core has always
been in data backup

234
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,370
and data resilience.

235
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,830
It's a company that
understands data and metadata

236
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,070
incredibly well, providing
data backup services

237
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,350
for some of the world's largest

238
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,250
and most regulated
enterprise organizations.

239
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,140
Rubrik layered on an identity solution

240
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,150
on top of that underlying data layer

241
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,440
to be able to actually target

242
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,170
some of the most compelling
areas where organizations

243
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,850
might see things like cyber attacks

244
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,340
and others that require data resilience.

245
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,780
And with the Predibase acquisition,

246
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,180
we've brought in an LLM and
AI platform that helps us

247
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,510
understand how to be able to
build for an agent feature.

248
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,700
We've combined these
three core competencies

249
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,620
around data, identity,

250
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,130
and an LLM platform for
agents into a single area

251
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,830
that we call our agent
operations platform.

252
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,810
And the key question some
of you might be wondering

253
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,600
is what do I mean by an
agent operations platform?

254
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,163
What does that actually entail?

255
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,070
To us, the agent operations platform,

256
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,810
the product that we've come across with,

257
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,210
we call the Rubrik Agent Cloud.

258
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,970
The Rubrik Agent Cloud is
Rubrik's newest product.

259
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,490
It essentially combines
three key capabilities

260
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,360
that we've heard consistently
from enterprise organizations

261
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,760
they need if they're going
to actually accelerate

262
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,323
the production rollout of AI.

263
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,460
It always starts with
monitoring and observability.

264
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,857
You can't improve systems,
you can't govern systems,

265
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,770
and you can't remediate
systems if you can't see them.

266
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,930
So the first thing the
Rubrik Agent Cloud does

267
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,640
is it hooks into your environment

268
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,580
and automatically discovers AI agents

269
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,100
across the different places
that they may be running

270
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,910
so that we can actually
populate an agent inventory

271
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,340
that shows you what are the
agents that are running,

272
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,420
who's created them,

273
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,520
what are the credentials
that are associated with 'em,

274
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,790
and what are the tools and
data that they have access to.

275
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,660
Earlier this week,

276
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,610
I'm happy to announce we also
announced our integration

277
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,890
with AWS Bedrock AgentCore.

278
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,890
So any agents that you're
natively building within AWS

279
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,240
automatically get discovered

280
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,120
and added inside of our AI
agent inventory as well,

281
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,670
and that provides that
first level of visibility

282
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,350
that many organizations need

283
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,603
when it comes towards AI agents.

284
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,360
The second challenge and the second pillar

285
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,180
for what we think about
we call governance.

286
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,860
Now governance, like AI agents,

287
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,410
can mean a lot of different
things to different people,

288
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,510
but the thing that we've
consistently noticed,

289
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,160
about half the room raised their hand

290
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,710
when I mentioned AI governance committee,

291
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,660
one of the things that
we consistently notice

292
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,840
is that organizations
have governance policies

293
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,490
that are intended to dictate

294
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,280
what AI agents can or cannot do.

295
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,930
For example, AI agents

296
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,550
should not be able to
give financial advice

297
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,500
or mention competitor products,

298
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,700
or AI agents should be operating

299
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,140
in read-only mode by default.

300
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,760
No write agents.

301
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,440
Oftentimes what we see is organizations

302
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,720
have these types of policies,

303
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,350
but no real hooks or teeth
into how to be able to enforce

304
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,140
these policies or even know
that they're being enforced

305
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,820
really at production scale.

306
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,740
Today in most organizations,

307
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,110
this is done on people and paper.

308
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,310
With the Rubrik Agent Cloud,

309
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,440
we're actually translating
this into software.

310
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,150
So policies become configurations

311
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,850
and policies that actually get
defined inside of our system,

312
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,250
either using rule systems
or natural language

313
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,740
and small models, and they can be deployed

314
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,540
for governance in real time
in any of your applications.

315
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:45,390
And the third and final
pillar of Rubrik Agent Cloud

316
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,040
is something we call remediation.

317
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,760
Rubrik as a company
with its real background

318
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,100
and resilience for the cyber era

319
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,870
has had a quote that
I've liked for a while,

320
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,910
which is called assume breach.

321
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,820
Assume that with all the good
intent that we put in front,

322
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,280
something will eventually go wrong.

323
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,710
And in my experience, I think
that this is more likely

324
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,550
to be true in the agentic future than not.

325
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,070
And so with Rubrik, we've
also released a feature

326
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,023
we call AI Agent Rewind.

327
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,260
What AI Agent Rewind allows you to do

328
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,210
is undo a destructive action

329
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,340
that an AI agent might have taken

330
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,890
on any Rubrik protected property

331
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,310
by allowing you to go ahead
and restore that action

332
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,200
from a previous healthy snapshot

333
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,913
that Rubrik maintains from backup.

334
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,760
So Rubrik is already snapshotting

335
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,580
your production environments
if you're a Rubrik customer

336
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,830
at a frequent cadence that allows us

337
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,170
to be able to offer business resilience.

338
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,210
And what we've done is
we've cross correlated that

339
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,710
with the observability
and governance layer

340
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,480
that we have in the Rubrik Agent Cloud

341
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,070
and allow you to one click rewind

342
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,530
anytime an agent's taken
a destructive action.

343
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,520
So if you think back earlier

344
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,770
to that dropped database example,

345
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,730
the real beauty is you are
no longer stuck in the water

346
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,710
if you actually had an incident like that.

347
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,330
Rubrik's AI Agent Rewind

348
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,193
allows you to remediate quite easily.

349
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,460
These three core pillars
make up what we believe

350
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,760
is one of the real accelerants
towards the adoption

351
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,970
towards AI in a lot of
enterprise organizations,

352
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,680
and I think sets us up

353
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,980
for really the identity that I associate

354
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,660
with Rubrik the most,

355
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,432
which is an organization
that really has evolved

356
00:14:22,432 --> 00:14:24,180
as enterprises have evolved

357
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,280
across different business transformations.

358
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,360
When Rubrik began as a company,

359
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,610
it was really oriented around data backup

360
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,810
for traditional business
continuity and resilience reasons.

361
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,010
Used to be that the biggest threat

362
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,193
that existed out there was
natural disaster, fire, flood.

363
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,330
A number of years later, the
next series of threats came in,

364
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,790
which were cyber disaster, cybersecurity,

365
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,350
ransomware, and others.

366
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,260
Rubrik continued to layer in

367
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,730
by data security and
identity security features

368
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,890
in order to be able to help on this.

369
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:00,870
And now we're in the AI
enabled disaster era.

370
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,740
And this is where Rubrik

371
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,510
wants to be able to continue its trend

372
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,950
of helping organizations adopt

373
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,440
the next cutting edge
technology by setting them up

374
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,813
for a successful AI adoption cycle.

375
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,440
But as I think we all know,

376
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,980
AI's core is really in
being able to manage

377
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,110
and be able to use your data effectively

378
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,700
for any of the tasks that you're doing.

379
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,260
That's really what makes
generative AI special

380
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,450
inside of each of your organizations.

381
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,090
And in order to be able to
actually have that data,

382
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,857
it relies on the integrity of that data

383
00:15:28,857 --> 00:15:30,900
and the availability of that data,

384
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,060
which is increasingly,
in many organizations,

385
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,180
living more and more in
a cloud-native universe.

386
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,710
And so with that, I wanted to hand it over

387
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,342
to my colleague Adam,
who's gonna be talking

388
00:15:39,342 --> 00:15:42,030
more about what Rubrik
does in the world of cloud

389
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,260
and cloud protection.

390
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,013
- Thanks so much, Dev.

391
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:46,230
Hey everyone.

392
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,690
Yeah, so I think to piggyback off

393
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,750
of what Dev's talked
about here so far today,

394
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,370
one of the biggest challenges I see,

395
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,680
talking to organizations as
they're moving more and more

396
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,450
of their footprint into cloud

397
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,240
and expanding significantly
is really answering

398
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,120
a fundamental question
of who is responsible

399
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,650
for data resilience?

400
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,859
Now, I think this is a
fairly familiar diagram

401
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:09,120
to most in the room.

402
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,890
It's a shared responsibility model,

403
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,770
and you know, it states AWS is responsible

404
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,210
for the security of the cloud,

405
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,750
you're responsible for the
security of your data itself.

406
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,490
But this has a push and pull,

407
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,840
I think with a lot of organizations

408
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,610
where there's somewhat of a meta shared

409
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,690
responsibility model.

410
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,430
So when I talk to a lot of organizations

411
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,230
on their data resilience strategy,

412
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,910
depending on which part

413
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,280
of the organization I'm talking to,

414
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,750
what usually ends up happening

415
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,490
when I ask the question
of who's responsible

416
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,300
for your data resilience is
something like this, right?

417
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,290
The platform team

418
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,600
thinks it's security
team's responsibility,

419
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,530
the app dev team

420
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,900
says it's the platform
team's responsibility.

421
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,940
And then both teams are
pointing at security

422
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,200
for anything cyber related

423
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,610
because they're spending a lot of money

424
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,260
on cybersecurity tools,

425
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,250
so they shouldn't have to worry

426
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,900
about remediation in a cyber event.

427
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,000
That's security's job.

428
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,620
This is a big, big challenge,

429
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,780
especially with as disaggregated

430
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,700
as a lot of cloud organizations are

431
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,350
to build efficiency, right?

432
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,926
So there's a lot of
different lines of business

433
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:08,040
who all have different needs,

434
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,120
and a lot of this also comes
down to taking a step back

435
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,400
and really thinking through
what that mental model

436
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,890
for resilience is and what
you're trying to achieve

437
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,560
with that resilience
for your applications.

438
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,360
There's a traditional high availability

439
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,040
which you get right out of the gate

440
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,160
with a cloud provider like AWS

441
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,890
where you're just trying to
build for that resilience

442
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,060
for common failures.

443
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,420
Operational outages, having, you know,

444
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,603
multi writer, multi
reader nodes in databases.

445
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,550
Things that, you know,

446
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,010
you're designed to build for that failure.

447
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,050
Then there's additionally
disaster recovery,

448
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,550
where you're planning for things like

449
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,090
those natural disasters or
maybe regional outages as well.

450
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,100
Part of that is also cyber resiliency.

451
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,430
So how are you protecting
your data from cyber attacks

452
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,650
and making sure you can
recover effectively?

453
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,440
And these are all things that
organizations need to build

454
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,250
into a continuous improvement,
making sure their CI/CD

455
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,770
pipelines are able to achieve this,

456
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,810
making sure that they have observability

457
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,643
across the board too,

458
00:18:07,643 --> 00:18:10,590
to make sure their
availability is in place.

459
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,570
If there is an outage,
that automation kicks in

460
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,820
to remediate that outage

461
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,400
and really driving towards the ability

462
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,093
to constantly test for
these types of scenarios.

463
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,390
And now, with data resilience,

464
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,730
it's not one size fits all, right?

465
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,520
So every issue you're trying to resolve

466
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,590
has a different mitigating step.

467
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,650
So one of the common ones
most organizations use

468
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,360
is just local snapshots.

469
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,810
So PAZ databases, Dynamo, EC2 Instances,

470
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,930
being able to have snapshots
on those that are local.

471
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,360
So if a Windows update goes bad

472
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,880
or if a database corrupts,

473
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,310
you're able to quickly
roll back those changes

474
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,513
in a couple of minutes.

475
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,350
Something to keep the
application highly resilient

476
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,810
but doesn't meet the
needs for all use cases.

477
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,510
The second one is more for human issues.

478
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,490
So one common occurrence is
not only just accidental issues

479
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,740
that might happen from an automation,

480
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,780
but things like accidental deletions.

481
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,810
And that's where a lot
of times organizations

482
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,850
need to build their
application resilience strategy

483
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,750
to handle for these.

484
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,090
So it's not a matter of just having

485
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,920
a local copy of the data.

486
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,700
If you disable continuous
backups on your Dynamo DB table,

487
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,050
all of your snapshots are gone.

488
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,430
How do you handle for that?

489
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,620
So that's also an area where this is

490
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,680
not only protecting
against that human element,

491
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,450
but also a regional outage too,

492
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,270
and having a copy of your
data in a secondary location.

493
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,940
So then you can do a failover if you need.

494
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,360
Not to be confused with
things like replication

495
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,940
for high availability
use cases and resiliency.

496
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,920
So having an S3 bucket replicating

497
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,490
to another region to
have lower query latency

498
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,323
or things like that,

499
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,830
but really more for that availability

500
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,510
in the event of a disaster.

501
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,830
And then finally,

502
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,770
the thing that a lot of
organizations aren't thinking

503
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,530
of top of mind is how do you recover

504
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,360
in the event of an actual cyber incident?

505
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,610
So in the event of a cyber incident,

506
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,410
that local snapshot you have

507
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,630
is not usable 'cause
there might be malware

508
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,300
on that last snapshot you
took earlier in the day.

509
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,320
So if you restore from that,

510
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,090
you're just reinfecting the environment.

511
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,970
And that's really where organizations

512
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,860
need to have this cyber
resilience strategy

513
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,810
where they have a copy of their backup

514
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,260
in a true cyber-vault
where nobody can touch it,

515
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,940
it's immutable, you can delete it,

516
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,250
and then you can then recover from it

517
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,650
in the event of an incident.

518
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,790
So AWS talks pretty regularly

519
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,050
about this 3-2-1-1-0 principle

520
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,360
for that data resiliency strategy.

521
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,150
Something that I encourage
all organizations to look at,

522
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,190
to think about, if they haven't already.

523
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,100
But what this ultimately
means is you have three unique

524
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,800
copies of your data,

525
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,720
that's not counting the primary copy

526
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,150
that you're using for
production use cases.

527
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,620
Two of those copies,

528
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,620
one will be remote, so you
have it in another region.

529
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,080
And then another one is going to be

530
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,090
that air gap cyber-vaulted copy,

531
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,640
which is kind of your copy of last resort

532
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,430
when you need to recover from
some sort of cyber incident.

533
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,890
And then in addition to that,
you still have that local copy

534
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,450
as well for fast recovery for
those operational instances.

535
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,943
And then the most important
thing is the zero.

536
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,030
Zero issues found on recovery.

537
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,280
And this is one that
a lot of organizations

538
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,230
tend to miss out on

539
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,580
simply because they're not
doing regular recovery testing.

540
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,290
So they're finding zero issues

541
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,720
because they're not doing
the testing in itself.

542
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,940
The last time you wanna,
or the last chance

543
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,160
to find an issue is when
you have an incident

544
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,390
and you can't recover.

545
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,440
You don't wanna find the issue then.

546
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,890
You wanna be able to
proactively find that issue.

547
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,740
Now, I'm not here to say
you should apply this

548
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,170
to every single workload in every single

549
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,510
different application you have

550
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,970
across your cloud environment.

551
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,490
It really also comes
down to this next step

552
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,420
that is pretty often missed
by organizations as well.

553
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,760
And that is really tiering your data

554
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,380
based on its importance.

555
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,490
So if you have a application
that's very, very critical

556
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,490
to the business and minutes of downtime

557
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,270
equates to millions of
dollars lost for the business,

558
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,310
it's a mission critical
application, right?

559
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,860
It needs to be as resilient as possible.

560
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,660
So you need to have that local copy,

561
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,340
you need to have a highly available

562
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,370
or regional copy of that
data to recover from.

563
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,600
And you of course need to have

564
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,000
a fully cyber-vaulted copy as well.

565
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,540
So you're protected from all
different failure scenarios.

566
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,810
Your tier one workloads, still
hugely business critical,

567
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:41,100
but maybe their downtime impact
is measured more in hours

568
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,990
as opposed to seconds and minutes.

569
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,580
That's where you still
need that local copy,

570
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,530
you still wanna have a remote copy from,

571
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,070
and there is some optionality

572
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,300
as it goes to that cyber resilience.

573
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,000
So sometimes it's workload dependent.

574
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,220
We highly recommend at Rubrik

575
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,500
that this should also
be a cyber-vaulted copy.

576
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,520
It's mission critical.

577
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,350
The downtime for these
types of cyber events

578
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,700
is very, very immense.

579
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,250
So even though it's not that tier zero,

580
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,170
tier one still has a lot of business value

581
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,040
and would create a lot of
business pain in order to recover.

582
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,500
Next is that tier two workloads,

583
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,720
a lot of like internal IT apps

584
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,340
that are probably very, very critical

585
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,050
to the overall business.

586
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,180
You're still gonna wanna
have a local copy of that,

587
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,140
you're still probably going to
want a remote copy for that,

588
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,420
but that is where that cyber-vaulted copy

589
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,700
tends to be a little bit more optional.

590
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,070
I see often with these
organizations, once again,

591
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,440
this is one where we do
recommend a cyber-vaulted copy,

592
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,830
but I see organizations
sometimes combining these.

593
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,370
So they'll have their cyber-vaulted
copy in another region

594
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,810
for these applications.

595
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,580
So it does eliminate one additional copy,

596
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,100
but they're still protected
from both of those use cases.

597
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,010
So they can recover from the
event of a regional outage

598
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,260
with that cyber-vaulted
copy in the other region.

599
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,090
And then last, your tier three workloads,

600
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:54,960
these are the workloads

601
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,290
that are a lot of the downstream
dev test environments.

602
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,500
Things that are very,
very easily to reproduce.

603
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,010
Maybe it is a bunch of ephemeral
infrastructure as well.

604
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,500
Things that if there's a bad day,

605
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,580
it's not the end of the world.

606
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,070
You can basically repave
the environment, right?

607
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,930
So you can tear down
that whole AWS account

608
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,000
even if there is a cyber attack

609
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,700
and then just redeploy
through something like

610
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,700
infrastructure as code and
a brand new AWS account.

611
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,440
So this is really, really critical

612
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,570
to have a good strategy in place

613
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,510
for classifying and tiering your workloads

614
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,883
to support the resilience
that they require.

615
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,550
One of the other blind spots

616
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:36,240
and probably the biggest blind
spot I see in organizations

617
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,120
is with S3.

618
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,980
So S3, the data just continues
to grow exponentially

619
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,630
year after year after year.

620
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,400
I'm always excited coming to re:Invent

621
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,980
to hear all about the
new S3 announcements.

622
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,723
S3 tables, vectors.

623
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:55,300
S3 has, you know, transitioned so much

624
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,260
in such a short period
of time from an archive

625
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,200
and backup use case to really,
it's almost a cloud database.

626
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,660
It's not even just storing
unstructured data anymore.

627
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,573
It's truly storing structured
data with data lakes,

628
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,920
all of the AI related workloads
and ML workloads as well.

629
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,260
And the growth is just massive,

630
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,110
which means there's a
lot of sensitive data

631
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,100
in these S3 buckets,

632
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,710
and there's a lot of potential areas

633
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,170
where not only bad guys can get in,

634
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,890
but even if we're talking about AI agents,

635
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,840
a lot of accidental deletions.

636
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,880
And this means that the lines of business

637
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,580
that are reliant on these S3 buckets

638
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,920
need to know where that sensitive data is

639
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,750
across all these new environments.

640
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,010
They need to know what data

641
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,580
actually needs to get protected as well.

642
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,087
They need to know what does the
recovery scenario look like.

643
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:48,150
And more importantly, a lot
of these buckets nowadays

644
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,370
are just petabytes and petabytes of data

645
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,320
with billions and billions of objects.

646
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,240
So it also becomes a scaling issue

647
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,540
of just breaking the laws
of physics in some way

648
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,720
of if you have a five petabyte
bucket in billions of files,

649
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,860
how can you recover that

650
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,550
in a timely and effective manner
that isn't weeks to months

651
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,023
of just restoring that data?

652
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,560
And usually when I talk to customers,

653
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,660
they say, I'm not worried about S3

654
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,160
because I have versioning
and replication enabled.

655
00:26:16,356 --> 00:26:19,470
And versioning and
replication just isn't enough

656
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,820
for the types of automation
accidents we see nowadays

657
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,360
and the type of cyber incidents
that we've seen nowadays.

658
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,980
Additionally, because this data

659
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,980
is continuing to grow in these S3 buckets,

660
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,380
there's a lot of additional sensitive data

661
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,460
that ends up in the buckets

662
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,290
that may not be intentionally put there.

663
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,110
So that is all an additional
risk to organizations

664
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,060
because they don't know
where their sensitive data is

665
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,210
in what buckets and that
is a place of exfiltration

666
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,890
for the bad guys.

667
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,480
There is that deletion risk as well

668
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,140
because your latest version
you can recover from

669
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,215
and depending on your
versioning lifecycle policy,

670
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:57,434
there's a lot of scripting work involved

671
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:59,160
to try to get that to recover.

672
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,960
And going back to the bucket

673
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,210
that might have billions
of of objects in it,

674
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,203
say a data lake,

675
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,961
just think about the time
taken to try to recover

676
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,440
10% of those objects to
12:00 o'clock yesterday.

677
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,150
Who knows what that looked
like at 12:00 o'clock?

678
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,770
That would be a massive lift.

679
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,470
So it's not a true kind of backup solution

680
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,050
where you can go back to
a point in time easily.

681
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:26,190
That also leads to some
threat blindness as well

682
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,740
because one common scenario

683
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,770
we tend to see in S3 is there's
a lot of buckets out there

684
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,360
that may have something like a PDF

685
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,370
that external customers download.

686
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,490
So if an attacker can get
access to that bucket,

687
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,980
they can replace that PDF
with a malware version

688
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,010
of that PDF and then that
extends into the environment.

689
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,040
So that might not be
something that's easily found,

690
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,650
but then once it is found,

691
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,510
you need to be able to not only recover

692
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,370
but recover back to the
clean version of that

693
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,560
so you're not reinfecting
your environment.

694
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,950
And that also leads to some
of this recovery uncertainty

695
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,780
with just the fact that these buckets

696
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,010
are growing and growing

697
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,390
and you need to be able to recover quick

698
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,970
so you don't have any elongated downtime

699
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,003
in these large massive S3 environments.

700
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,700
So that's where Rubrik comes in.

701
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,270
I think one of the biggest
things we help customers do,

702
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,610
especially in their AWS estate in general,

703
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,990
but even with S3,

704
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,120
is helping with some
of that data discovery.

705
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,760
Because you don't wanna
slap a backup policy

706
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,240
on every S3 bucket that you
have in your organization.

707
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,800
You just might not need it.

708
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,690
There's a lot of S3 buckets out there

709
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,430
that don't have a lot of
important things in it

710
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,290
that have easily reproducible data

711
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,390
from maybe an Aurora database

712
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,953
that's already being backed up,

713
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,390
but it becomes really,
really hard to figure out

714
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,490
which ones have that sensitive data in it,

715
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,200
might have low hanging
fruit where you do need

716
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,010
that extra level of resilience
in a cyber-vaulted copy.

717
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,330
We also help with that resilience

718
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,000
from protecting against
that deletion risk.

719
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,920
Can actually see, not only,

720
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,350
detect anomalies if there's
a mass deletion event,

721
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,660
one that may be malicious or accidental

722
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,060
in our product by default,
but we also provide

723
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,300
an immutable air gap
copy of that backup data.

724
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,430
So a lot of the bad actors, what they do

725
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,710
when they get into any environment

726
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,540
is to go directly after the backups.

727
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,480
So if the backups aren't
immutable, they can be deleted

728
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,340
and then that means that a ransomware,

729
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,010
I mean it's easier for
that ransomware attack

730
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,720
in the ransom to end up being
in a rock in a hard place

731
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,816
where organizations might
want to end up paying that

732
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:29,460
'cause they have no other recovery option.

733
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,000
Additionally too, when we take
each one of those backups,

734
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,110
we already are pre-calculating
hashes on all of the backups.

735
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,990
So we can actually see
malware as it comes in,

736
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,520
as it's backed up.

737
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,520
We have thousands of
indicators of compromise

738
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,230
that we're updating daily.

739
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,930
So as we take a backup, we know instream

740
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,470
of that backup if there may
be some sort of bad actor

741
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,540
involved in there and any sort of malware.

742
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,690
Part of that too is
helping us detect zero days

743
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,880
because as a zero day, so we
might have been backing up

744
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,743
that bad file weeks ago,

745
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,550
and that impacts a lot of the recovery.

746
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,860
So whenever we see something
bad in the environment,

747
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,790
we'll auto quarantine it

748
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,490
so you're not reinfecting the environment

749
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,420
in a matter of a restore.

750
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:17,420
But additionally we're
taking all of these different

751
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,700
threat feeds and then we
have the ability to scan

752
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,700
all of the backups we've ever taken

753
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,010
and see if that zero day has impacted

754
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,630
other parts of the environment.

755
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,660
So you might have a security tool pop

756
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,150
and say, hey, there's
an issue in account one

757
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,100
and it might have already had an issue

758
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,570
in account three, four, and five

759
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,180
that the security tools
haven't picked up on yet.

760
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,160
So we can help across the board recover

761
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,863
to that clean point in time
in a manner of minutes.

762
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,890
And what we do across our platform

763
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,630
with Rubrik is really tie this together

764
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,490
in one single platform.

765
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,980
So, from the ground up,

766
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,050
and I'll talk about our
architecture here more momentarily,

767
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,840
it is very cloud native
focused architecture.

768
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,840
So all the different AWS
workloads you see on the left,

769
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,200
we protect under what we
call Rubrik Security Cloud,

770
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,080
which is our overall SaaS platform.

771
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,460
It helps with agentic AI,
it helps with automation.

772
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,490
We have full automation AAPI
capabilities on top of it.

773
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,200
We're protecting data and identity.

774
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,580
And then we're doing data protection,

775
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,640
not only of cloud resources,
data center resources,

776
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,410
we also protect identity.

777
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,700
So if you think about it,

778
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,380
if your identity's
compromised Okta, Entra ID,

779
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,850
in the event of a cyber attack,

780
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,950
you can't even log into anything.

781
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,500
So that's often one of the
areas where we're protecting.

782
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,850
So you can do quick recovery of that

783
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:39,390
before you move into the
traditional production workloads.

784
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,470
As part of all that too,

785
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,440
we help customers identify
the sensitive data

786
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,310
in their environment,

787
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,590
through data discovery and classification,

788
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,960
that makes sure they're backing
up the critical workloads

789
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,530
in the environment and
not having any blind spots

790
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,870
in their overall data resiliency strategy.

791
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,370
And then on top of that, as I mentioned,

792
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,340
we're doing anomaly detection
and threat monitoring

793
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,360
and turbo threat hunting on
all backups that we take.

794
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,080
So that's all on by default

795
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,790
and not something that you
have to regularly manage.

796
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,320
So that's all in one platform.

797
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,340
And then in addition to that

798
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,780
we have third party integrations

799
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,500
with a lot of other
cybersecurity companies out there

800
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,593
to really bring that all under
one umbrella in one platform.

801
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,670
Now, as I talked about earlier too,

802
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,070
with classifying that tiers of data,

803
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,700
one of the coolest things
I like about our product

804
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,320
is a functionality we have,

805
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,630
we call it cloud posture risk management.

806
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,830
So before you take a
single backup with Rubrik,

807
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,290
you can plug in all of your AWS accounts

808
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:44,880
and we'll immediately
give you feedback on,

809
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,980
say you have 800 cloud
objects, you know, EC2,

810
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,530
S3 buckets, whatever they may be,

811
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,270
we'll tell you which ones
you're currently backing up

812
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,600
with snapshots today.

813
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,413
Additionally, on top of that

814
00:32:56,413 --> 00:32:59,970
we can get a sense of if
there's any sensitive data

815
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,245
in any of these cloud objects.

816
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,260
So if you have 800
objects, maybe 500 of them

817
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,780
are protected with snapshots today,

818
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,630
and the remainder though, the other 300,

819
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,130
maybe those are test dev workloads,

820
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,080
maybe those are things
that just are blind spots

821
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,820
and you're not protecting today,

822
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,390
we can see maybe there's 100
of them that we have found

823
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,700
some indicators that there's
sensitive data in there,

824
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,500
and that's a way for
these lines of business

825
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,510
to quickly realize, okay,

826
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,850
maybe there's sensitive data
in a downstream dev environment

827
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,860
that shouldn't be there and
let me delete that altogether.

828
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,980
Or maybe this was a science experiment

829
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,960
that quickly turned into
a production application

830
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,700
that now is running customer data,

831
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,760
and we don't even have
snapshots in place on that.

832
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,240
So we're not even doing the basics

833
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,460
of local recovery, let alone cyber

834
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,100
or disaster recovery to plan for.

835
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,380
So, something very quickly in these large

836
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,203
sprawling environments
to try to, you know,

837
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,840
have a good starting point

838
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,383
of finding those blind spots
in the overall cloud estate.

839
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,770
Now talking about how we're built

840
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,513
from an architectural standpoint.

841
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,270
So we do everything with
a lot of automation.

842
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,300
Especially when I'm
talking to AWS customers,

843
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,920
they wanna do everything automatically.

844
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,830
So we make that very, very
easy for our customers.

845
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,390
So you have Rubrik Security Cloud

846
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,800
that is that SaaS platform,

847
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,780
that one platform that everybody logs into

848
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,620
to manage everything,

849
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,223
from M365 to data center
to cloud to AI agents.

850
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:24,690
For AWS we have a dedicated AWS account

851
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,400
for each one of our customers under that.

852
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,200
And then everything in pink here

853
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,570
is customer managed environment.

854
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,630
So to do our install, this
can all be done via Terraform.

855
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,040
We also support cloud formation

856
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,260
and just native APIs as well.

857
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,900
We will deploy a cross account IAM role.

858
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,033
Now these roles are least privileged,

859
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,570
and we also support role chaining.

860
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,850
So since we're doing a
cross account IAM role

861
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,510
to perform backup and restore operations,

862
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,060
that role chaining allows organizations,

863
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,830
if there is some sort of incident

864
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,620
and you wanna quickly
cut off access to Rubrik

865
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,970
for some reason,

866
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,810
you can just impact that
one cross account role

867
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,643
that is chained

868
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:06,210
and then that will eliminate all access

869
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,830
to the other hundreds of accounts

870
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,300
you may have connected to Rubrik.

871
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,080
And then each one of these
other cross account roles

872
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,820
over on the left here,

873
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,920
they're fully leased permissive model.

874
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,490
So in that top box there
we have EC2, RDS, and S3,

875
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,810
but there's no Dynamo DB.

876
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,740
So you can have that IAM
role say Rubrik has no access

877
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,900
to any Dynamos, we have
no Dynamo ever planned

878
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,515
in that environment,

879
00:35:29,515 --> 00:35:31,560
making sure that we are just adhering

880
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,210
to that least principle.

881
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,460
Over on the right there's
two special accounts.

882
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,970
So first we have a restricted
data processing account.

883
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,700
This is where we're doing
all of our data processing

884
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,533
for backups.

885
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:43,920
We want that to be restricted,

886
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,710
we want that to be very minimal access.

887
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,810
We don't want other
applications running in there

888
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,510
because this is doing all
of the the heavy lifting.

889
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,650
So we wanna make sure there
is nobody with physical access

890
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,950
to that to interrupt backup
and restore operations.

891
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,050
The way we're actually
processing all of this data

892
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,940
is through something we call Exocompute.

893
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,310
So that uses Kubernetes under the cover.

894
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,840
So stateless workload.

895
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,150
When we're not performing
backup and restore operations,

896
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,870
it's a footprint of zero
in your cloud environment.

897
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,730
But when we are performing
backup operations,

898
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:18,060
this means we can scale
very linearly as well.

899
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,700
So if you have one thing to
back up, we have one pod.

900
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,800
If you have 1,000 things
that need to be backed up,

901
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,050
we'll spin up 1,000 pods.

902
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,090
So very, very efficient as we scale

903
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,940
to meet large cloud environment needs.

904
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,460
And then that, below that,

905
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,200
is what we call our data bunker account.

906
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,180
So this is gonna be
another restricted account

907
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,570
and this is gonna be where we
would store the backup data.

908
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,300
So it'll be in an immutable S3 bucket.

909
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,250
One of the other things
we're able to do here as well

910
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,340
is tier off the different storage classes.

911
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,021
So instead of having everything in an S3

912
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:51,630
standard storage class,
you can tier that down

913
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,280
to infrequently accessed

914
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,860
or even glacier depending on the use case.

915
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,350
So this is an immutable environment

916
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,600
where nobody has access to it.

917
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,080
So if there is a malicious attack,

918
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,510
your backups cannot be
impacted whatsoever,

919
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,000
and you'll always have a
clean point to recover from.

920
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,440
We do also offer what we
call Rubrik Cloud Vault.

921
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,540
So this is a logically
air gapped environment.

922
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,770
It looks very, very similar

923
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,480
except that the S3 bucket is
in a Rubrik owned AWS account.

924
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,190
So that means it's in
a completely separate

925
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:27,660
security domain altogether
from your primary environment.

926
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,010
Now, how do we automate from here

927
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:34,010
after that initial setup, and
that is through tag-based.

928
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:38,220
So, going back to that
classification we talked about

929
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,120
earlier in the tiering,
a lot of organizations

930
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,840
will have what we call SLAs,
which are backup policies.

931
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,440
So gold, silver, bronze,
just for simplicity

932
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,630
for developers adhering to this.

933
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,723
Gold may be a copy goes to another region

934
00:37:53,723 --> 00:37:56,700
and you also have a cyber-vaulted copy.

935
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,370
Silver is just a remote region one.

936
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,940
And then maybe bronze
is just that local copy

937
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,530
for fast recovery.

938
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,400
So as application developers
build their infrastructure,

939
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,860
the platform teams that they help support,

940
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,300
they can just tell their developers,

941
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,570
this is mission critical,
this is tier one or tier zero.

942
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:19,140
Make sure you put, you know,
backup equals gold as a tag

943
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,940
on that environment and
we'll automatically start

944
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,260
backing that up.

945
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,380
So the application team
don't have to get involved

946
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,630
too heavily in managing
their own backup and restore

947
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,520
if they don't want to.

948
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,740
They can offload a lot
of that mental burden.

949
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,590
But everybody still knows,
in the organization,

950
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,660
what is backed up, what is not backed up,

951
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,523
what is protected and at what level.

952
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,390
This goes to the next step as well

953
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:47,010
where as new accounts get
onboarded into the environment,

954
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,220
we can place that cross account IAM role

955
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,200
as part of a deployment pipeline.

956
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,860
And then any new resources
created in that new AWS account,

957
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,710
assuming that they are tagged properly,

958
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,590
will automatically start backing it up.

959
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,960
We do also have automated
role-based access control.

960
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,190
So if you do have an app team

961
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,300
that does wanna self-service

962
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,710
their backup and restore,

963
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,144
you can limit their access in the Rubrik

964
00:39:10,144 --> 00:39:12,180
security cloud environment

965
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,880
so they can only see the AWS accounts

966
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,080
that hold the data they care about

967
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,580
and not the entire enterprise.

968
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,800
With all of this as well,

969
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,390
this is also how we can integrate

970
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:25,173
from infrastructure as code
standpoint for recovery.

971
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,620
So if you need to recover
to a net new environment,

972
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,400
you simply would deploy that
code pipeline, new AWS account,

973
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,410
our cross account IAM role is in there,

974
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,610
and then you can instantly
start recovering.

975
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,500
Now, I talked a lot about Terraform,

976
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,517
infrastructure as code,

977
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:45,030
and I think that leads to one
of the next big blind spots

978
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:48,120
I've seen over the past
probably 12 months.

979
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,643
Automation is kicking off

980
00:39:49,643 --> 00:39:51,990
more and more across the environment.

981
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,030
Developers are developing more and more.

982
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,070
And one of the next biggest gaps

983
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:00,720
is the DevOps environment itself, right?

984
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,740
There is a lot of news
in this space recently

985
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,540
with the overall DevOps platforms,

986
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,830
where that code repository is,

987
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,590
and these are really critical
workloads for organizations.

988
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:14,670
Not only is it where the
crown jewels of code lives,

989
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,500
the metadata around all of that code,

990
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,420
and then also a lot of
the collaboration tools

991
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,303
and protectivity tools that
these app teams leverage.

992
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,460
So, it is the work
items, the wikis, right?

993
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,300
The IAC pipelines, the ML pipelines,

994
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,430
those are all included
in these DevOps workloads

995
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,190
and things like GitHub, GitLab, et cetera.

996
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,580
And if you start thinking through this

997
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,930
a little bit more and more,

998
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,260
this becomes a pretty key area of downtime

999
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,720
if there are any issues
in this environment

1000
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,080
as it impacts each one
of these areas here.

1001
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,360
So from that developer
collaboration standpoint

1002
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,390
with things like wikis and work items,

1003
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,320
well if there's an issue

1004
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,540
in that part of the
environment, guess what?

1005
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,390
Engineering planning comes to a halt.

1006
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,733
There's no more PRD reviews.

1007
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,540
What is the next thing I
need to do for this project?

1008
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,066
You know, until that's recovered,

1009
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:09,633
they're dead in the water.

1010
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,180
If you're pushing out a new update,

1011
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,560
maybe there's a large marketing event

1012
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,360
and you're planning on pushing an update,

1013
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,600
well if your CI/CD pipelines are down,

1014
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,620
you can't push that out.

1015
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,440
Or maybe there's a critical
bug that needs to get fixed.

1016
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,810
Your AI ML pipelines too.

1017
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,980
When those models are paused

1018
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,150
'cause there's issues,

1019
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,670
that means there's a lot of
potentially expensive GPUs

1020
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,920
going to waste during that time period.

1021
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,310
And then going back to what we
talked about originally here,

1022
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,480
that cloud info management.

1023
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,580
So your infrastructure as code.

1024
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,880
Well if you have a cyber incident,

1025
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,450
how can you repave that
environment and redeploy

1026
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:49,143
if you can't access your
infrastructure as code state files?

1027
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:55,310
So that's why, as a result of
this too, or apologies too.

1028
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,790
So the way that is typically
protected today as well

1029
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,990
tends to also fall down.

1030
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,080
So there is native version history, right?

1031
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,320
So a lot of time with some
of these native tools,

1032
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,030
you have about a 30 day recovery window,

1033
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,470
a little bit of a recycling bin,

1034
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,330
but that's limited retention.

1035
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,480
And then there is that
vulnerability to permanent loss,

1036
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,800
'cause you can empty the recycling bin

1037
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,020
and then there goes the data.

1038
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,570
So that leads to a resilience gap.

1039
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,910
There's also a lot of
manual scripting you can do

1040
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,490
to do your own form of
backup for a lot of these.

1041
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,680
That creates a lot of operational overhead

1042
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,930
and who's monitoring all of these scripts?

1043
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,750
So that means that I've
seen time and time again

1044
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,840
where organizations thought the process

1045
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,030
was working but the script

1046
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,710
needed an update that never got updated.

1047
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,090
The monitoring wasn't in place,

1048
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,580
so they thought things
were being backed up

1049
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,530
and they didn't realize it
wasn't until there was an issue.

1050
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,940
And then there's the other option of,

1051
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,665
hey, I also, my developer,

1052
00:42:52,665 --> 00:42:57,390
I have my code also sitting
on my laptop as well, right?

1053
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,850
So hey, the code repository goes away,

1054
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,170
I have a copy of it on my laptop.

1055
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,670
We'll just recover from that.

1056
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:06,360
Not only is that a governance nightmare

1057
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,580
for many InfoSec teams,

1058
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,990
there's also a recovery gap.

1059
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,340
Whose laptop is the code on?

1060
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,480
What version of code do they have?

1061
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,620
How am I gonna recover that back

1062
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,630
for all my other developers?

1063
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,970
And then lastly, there's
a lot of point solutions

1064
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,160
out there as well to handle some of this.

1065
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,140
But part of the issue with point solutions

1066
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,290
is that's just another
tool in the environment

1067
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,973
of ever-growing tools,

1068
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:31,530
which means oftentimes too there
tends to be compliance gaps

1069
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,720
where these point solutions
aren't meeting the needs

1070
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,220
of a more enterprise organization

1071
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,990
from a compliance standpoint.

1072
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:40,950
So recently we just announced
our own DevOps protection.

1073
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,770
So we're able to protect
these code repositories,

1074
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,000
all of these pipelines,

1075
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,340
and ensure that in the event of an outage

1076
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,300
you can recover these

1077
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,310
so then you can recover
your cloud infrastructure

1078
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,320
as part of it as well.

1079
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,760
It helps with the automation,

1080
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,180
it helps with ensuring that resiliency.

1081
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,260
And most importantly too,

1082
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,220
this is all integrated

1083
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,350
into that general Rubrik security cloud

1084
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,090
so you're not managing multiple tools.

1085
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,733
It's all together in one single platform.

1086
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,060
So with that, I did wanna give everybody

1087
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,473
in the room some homework.

1088
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:15,240
So, 'cause who doesn't
love a little homework?

1089
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,450
So when you go back to
meet with your teams,

1090
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:21,390
and I know often there's the team meeting

1091
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,930
after a re:Invent of hey, what
did you learn at re:Invent?

1092
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,300
So I think some things you can
pose to your internal teams

1093
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,460
to get some of the gears going too

1094
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,980
is do you really have a clear strategy

1095
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,490
to govern and protect against
destructive AI agent actions

1096
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:36,810
that Dev talked about?

1097
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:40,860
Additionally too, has the
organization defined a Cyber RTO?

1098
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,590
So RTO, recovery time objective,

1099
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,990
that's something that's been
around for a long time, right?

1100
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,360
If the business can sustain
four hours of downtime,

1101
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,510
you need to restore that
application within four hours.

1102
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:54,600
Cyber RTOs really translate over

1103
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,410
to if there is a malicious
attacker in our enterprise,

1104
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:01,590
what is the recovery time
from that ransomware attack?

1105
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,810
Most organizations don't have this defined

1106
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,640
'cause they've never tested it,

1107
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,470
but when you ask anybody, they usually go,

1108
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,880
it's gonna be a long time.

1109
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,970
And the impact to a lot of
the recent ransomware attacks

1110
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:13,980
and cyber attacks we've seen

1111
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,990
that have had elongated downtime,

1112
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,707
it's not because they didn't
have backups in place.

1113
00:45:17,707 --> 00:45:20,280
It's that they couldn't find
a clean point of recovery

1114
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,450
to restore from.

1115
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,400
So they're getting in
this repetitive motion of,

1116
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,440
let me restore from the latest snapshot,

1117
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,240
go run a bunch of security tools on it

1118
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,470
to make sure it's clean.

1119
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:31,050
If it's not, rinse and
repeat that process.

1120
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,050
If you do that across
thousands of cloud objects,

1121
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,760
that becomes a massive lift

1122
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,193
and elongates downtime significantly.

1123
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,230
And then additionally too,

1124
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,080
how are you safeguarding
that DevOps environment?

1125
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,550
It's now a tier zero application.

1126
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,470
I walked through all
the potential scenarios

1127
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:49,350
that can cause massive compliance issues

1128
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:53,880
and resiliency issues in
the development life cycle.

1129
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,850
So how is that being handled
today if there is downtime?

1130
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,770
And then lastly and
still one of the things

1131
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,090
that I think is most important,

1132
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,950
when was the last time
you've actually ran a test?

1133
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:04,230
Can you recover if there is an outage,

1134
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:06,930
be it cyber, be it
regional, be it operational,

1135
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,200
is there actually a true way to recover?

1136
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,693
So with that, thank you
all. Here's the QR code.

1137
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,097
I think we have a little
bit of time for Q&A too.

1138
00:46:17,097 --> 00:46:19,170
All right, well we'll be hanging around

1139
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,970
if there's any other questions after this,

1140
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:21,976
but thank you all.

1141
00:46:21,976 --> 00:46:23,123
- [Dev] Thank you all very much.
