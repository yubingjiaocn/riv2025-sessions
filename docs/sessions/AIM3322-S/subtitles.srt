1
00:00:00,288 --> 00:00:02,289
Thank you. Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:04,809
Hopefully everybody's having a great

3
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:06,169
show, uh, this

4
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:08,069
past few days, um,

5
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:11,050
we've chosen the topic here today about

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,278
thriving in the age of AI

7
00:00:13,278 --> 00:00:14,028
agents,

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,649
and there's a reason that we, we chose that

9
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,030
topic, and, and we believe

10
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,228
that we're at a point where you have a choice

11
00:00:21,228 --> 00:00:23,420
to make. And we also

12
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,100
believe that for you to thrive,

13
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,500
you actually have to reimagine

14
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,780
the way you work. And that's going to

15
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,079
be the basis um of the next

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,000
20 minutes.

17
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:35,819
Every time I speak to a CIO

18
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:37,579
they ask me one question.

19
00:00:38,348 --> 00:00:39,130
What's different

20
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:41,009
about your offering?

21
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:43,048
And we think it's a great question,

22
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,090
but we actually think it's incomplete.

23
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:47,509
We actually think the question that people should ask

24
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:48,368
us is,

25
00:00:48,868 --> 00:00:49,609
what's better?

26
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,908
Because

27
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:53,408
the road and the journey we're all on

28
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:55,848
is actually to be relevant

29
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,539
to our employees,

30
00:00:57,868 --> 00:01:00,569
to our customers, and to our partners,

31
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,609
uh, for decades to come.

32
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:05,230
So we like to answer the question, what makes

33
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,069
us better,

34
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:08,088
not just what makes us different.

35
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:10,948
My name's Cahal McCarthy. I serve as the

36
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:12,209
chief strategy officer

37
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:14,750
at Core.AI. You're welcome to join

38
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,750
our booth 1753 a little bit

39
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,329
later,

40
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:19,790
but we believe that we're at a moment in time.

41
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:23,069
That AI agents and humans

42
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,370
can achieve something that if they continue

43
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,028
to act

44
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,609
independently that they will never

45
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:31,159
achieve, but if they join collectively,

46
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,500
they're going to deliver something really transformative,

47
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,930
not just automation

48
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,150
of our existing

49
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,430
processes.

50
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,689
Let me share one slide on who

51
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:43,120
core.AI is.

52
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:44,109
We build

53
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:46,689
enterprise AI agents. In fact, we

54
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,230
let you

55
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:49,510
build enterprise agents.

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,260
The kind that help organizations

57
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,760
orchestrate AI agents front

58
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,209
to back, end to end employee

59
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:57,859
experience

60
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,500
and customer experience, we help

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,569
companies on their journey not just to automate

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,079
but to transform at scale

63
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,278
and deliver meaningful outcomes.

64
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:11,558
So thriving in the new age of

65
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:13,689
AI agents over the last

66
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:14,750
two years,

67
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,949
we've all become a little different

68
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:18,349
in how we work.

69
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,750
We brought AI into

70
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,490
our personal lives and into our

71
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,449
professional lives.

72
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:25,710
We've added them

73
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:28,929
to our toolkit, our AI toolkit.

74
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,868
In fact,

75
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,210
many of us, at least on paper.

76
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:34,819
Um, our AI first companies,

77
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:35,719
um,

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,419
and, and that's where we're gonna poke a little bit

79
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:39,669
in the, in the next while

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,338
because we believe that many companies

81
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:44,360
are, while they're bringing AI into

82
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,319
their companies,

83
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:46,778
they're sprinkling.

84
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,758
It in an unstructured manner,

85
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,500
so you will get positive outcomes,

86
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,788
but it's not done in a coordinated,

87
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:57,179
compliance, fully observable

88
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:59,409
way. It's been an

89
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:01,460
interesting two years if you wind back the

90
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,939
clock over the last 24 months

91
00:03:04,179 --> 00:03:06,258
and you look at how the narrative has

92
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:07,649
changed and emerged.

93
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,419
We started with significant optimism.

94
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:13,050
Billions of dollars have been invested.

95
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:14,270
The enthusiasm.

96
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:15,735
For advances

97
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:18,054
certainly emerged. And then about

98
00:03:18,054 --> 00:03:20,085
4 or 5 months ago on the back of

99
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:22,175
a series of maybe MIT

100
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:22,993
articles,

101
00:03:23,254 --> 00:03:24,865
we got buyer fatigue,

102
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:27,294
we got pilot purgatory,

103
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,115
we got news of experiments failing.

104
00:03:30,538 --> 00:03:32,740
Um, but we also still believe at

105
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,319
core we're at a critical moment

106
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:36,020
of inflection,

107
00:03:36,338 --> 00:03:38,838
and that inflection point is ahead of us.

108
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:41,379
Now, we get the privilege of talking to

109
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,008
hundreds of customers,

110
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:45,580
uh, every single day, every single

111
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,020
month across the globe.

112
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:49,719
And there's one comment that struck me

113
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:52,118
recently. I was in London at a dinner

114
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:53,960
and an executive said,

115
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,639
we're in. An automation

116
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,149
or not an automation we're a transformation

117
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:00,229
or transport

118
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:02,649
company first we're not an AI first

119
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:04,889
company and I thought what a

120
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:05,830
superpower

121
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,569
this executive knows what they're

122
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:09,189
doing

123
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,929
and then I actually felt maybe this is

124
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:13,210
their kryptonite.

125
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,269
Because they're catching themselves in

126
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,250
a trap

127
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,108
and the trap is just focusing

128
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:22,000
on the productivity frontier.

129
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,389
The productivity frontier is really

130
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,009
important.

131
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,660
It's important to your shareholders it's important to your

132
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,350
employees,

133
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,040
but it's not enough.

134
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:31,850
They're not challenging.

135
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,439
The business model.

136
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,889
In fact, here's a tactile board

137
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,949
that we have deployed at all

138
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,028
of our events over the past

139
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:42,269
year, whether it's in Mumbai, Dallas, New

140
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:44,470
York, and we ask people, how

141
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,000
are you thinking about AI

142
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:47,889
and everybody

143
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,910
irrespective of the city is saying how

144
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,528
do I become more competitive.

145
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,290
They're missing the point of AI.

146
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,088
AI is the

147
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:00,369
first tool in generations

148
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:02,069
that is going to allow us.

149
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:03,519
Innovate

150
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,899
our business it's going to allow us

151
00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:07,338
transform

152
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,059
what we do. It's going to allow us build

153
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,399
new products and services, but

154
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,519
all of our attention has been

155
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,720
dominated by how do we

156
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,920
drive ROI again ROI is

157
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,798
important we deliver outcomes,

158
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,500
but how do you get yourself on that journey

159
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:25,369
to true transformation.

160
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,548
Every one of us as you walk around this

161
00:05:28,548 --> 00:05:30,569
floor are going to look at

162
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,569
very similar tools,

163
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,428
rag search engine, LLMs,

164
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,689
SLMs, DLMs.

165
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:40,048
It's not necessarily

166
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:41,649
what you look at,

167
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,209
but it's how you look at them.

168
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:46,720
When Martin Luther King stood up,

169
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:49,428
he didn't say, I've got a project plan.

170
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,519
He said he had a dream.

171
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,528
When John Lennon wrote his song,

172
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:56,209
he wrote, Imagine.

173
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,730
Right? When JFK said let's go to the moon,

174
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:01,959
he said, we're going to do it not because it's easy,

175
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,920
but because it's hard.

176
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:06,410
So our opportunity

177
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:08,778
at this moment inflection is

178
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:11,250
not just to look at the tools,

179
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,720
but how do we look at our business

180
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,639
and what are the opportunities

181
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:17,079
that we see ahead.

182
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:18,798
So are you seeing a duck?

183
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,079
Are you seeing a rabbit?

184
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:22,569
We have all lived

185
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:25,028
through moments of

186
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:26,689
significant transformation.

187
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,750
We've all lived through the tech revolution.

188
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,329
The one thing we know

189
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:34,509
that happens when you have a revolution taking

190
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:35,290
place

191
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,170
is the points of friction.

192
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,738
Emerge

193
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:39,959
points of tension

194
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,319
emerge,

195
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:44,059
but it's the ones that transform their business

196
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:44,720
model

197
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,019
are the ones that realize the true

198
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:47,769
gains.

199
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,660
Now let's have a little bit of fun.

200
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:51,500
If you look at Ken Olsen,

201
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,889
who was the CEO of Digital

202
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:54,699
Equipment,

203
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:57,298
there exists no reason why

204
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:58,519
everybody should have a PC.

205
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,579
I'm not sure if everybody remembers Deck was a big company

206
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:03,569
once upon a time.

207
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:04,759
The cell phone.

208
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:07,290
Marty Cooper, director of research,

209
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,819
again, he believed that they will not

210
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,079
replace landlines,

211
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,500
and maybe this one is a little bit true, but

212
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,928
Jamie Dimon had a very strong point on,

213
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,559
on cryptocurrency.

214
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,639
Each one of these people

215
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,119
were the people that were closest

216
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:23,738
to the revolution.

217
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:26,059
But they stared at the world

218
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,470
through a lens that was tied

219
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,420
to their history.

220
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,600
It was tied to a world of optimization

221
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,220
of everything that they've built.

222
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:37,108
So let's just talk about the age of AI

223
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:39,319
agents. What does that actually mean

224
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:41,738
for us it's a shift.

225
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,858
It's truly a shift to autonomous.

226
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:48,259
And I encourage you all to get your definition

227
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,559
of what AI agents means to

228
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:52,798
you. It's not deterministic

229
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:53,928
chatbots.

230
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,480
That is your legacy world and still

231
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,988
when we speak to people,

232
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,588
they're looking at how do I make my chatbot

233
00:08:00,588 --> 00:08:01,139
better,

234
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,000
OK?

235
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,548
These are providing us with

236
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:05,910
independent reasoning.

237
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,399
They can engage in multi-step

238
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:08,920
tasks.

239
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:11,863
So don't think just inside of your vertical

240
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:12,875
or your function

241
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:15,334
think cross functionally across your world,

242
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:17,303
and they can make decisions.

243
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:19,665
These are no longer the passive.

244
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:21,774
They're the autonomous doers.

245
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,144
They're the workflow operators,

246
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:26,204
and they're the intelligence amplifiers,

247
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:28,584
and that's a major decision for us all

248
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:29,295
to make.

249
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,154
How do we want our labor force to

250
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:32,734
show up?

251
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:35,168
Do we want our labor force,

252
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:36,817
our human labor force,

253
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:38,369
to be the commodity,

254
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,028
or do we want to make a choice right now

255
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:42,467
to amplify

256
00:08:42,758 --> 00:08:44,847
through our agents and our our

257
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:47,207
digital agents and our humans to orchestrate

258
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:48,347
and work together?

259
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,788
We're at a point where we can choose

260
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:53,148
if we want to operate

261
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:54,869
in a golden age.

262
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,019
Or a dark age.

263
00:08:57,678 --> 00:08:59,719
And I think I used the word sprinkled

264
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,629
earlier on in the presentation.

265
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,178
Many companies are sprinkling

266
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,899
AI across their departments for

267
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,029
many good reasons,

268
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,058
whether it's in the pursuit of

269
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,668
productivity gains to hit their end quarter

270
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:13,379
number.

271
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,359
Um, but they are compromising their business.

272
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:19,279
They're compromising the governance. They're compromising

273
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,200
their compliance.

274
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:23,200
Each one of these AI deployments

275
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
inside of each department are

276
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,279
point solutions, and we've all

277
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,479
lived through the generation of CRM

278
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,109
where we had HubSpot, Salesforce, Vantiv

279
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,298
operating across our business.

280
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,940
Each point.

281
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:38,523
Delivers point returns,

282
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:40,962
but they don't deliver the compounding

283
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:43,241
returns that you may be looking for.

284
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:45,643
So I challenge each one of you

285
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:48,422
to not just reflect on optimization,

286
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,903
but really how do you think about

287
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:53,942
transforming your business.

288
00:09:54,322 --> 00:09:56,481
Think about AI against

289
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:58,263
the analogy of the autonomous.

290
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,725
Driving versus cruise control,

291
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,325
that's where we are.

292
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:04,764
You can reimagine not just the engine,

293
00:10:04,806 --> 00:10:07,065
but you can reimagine an experience

294
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:08,105
that's adaptive,

295
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,806
that's that's contextual,

296
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,585
that can take you on elongated,

297
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:15,004
complex journeys,

298
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:17,884
not just maintain a speed on a highway

299
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:18,625
to get you

300
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:20,605
faster from A to B.

301
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,759
We have a different level of

302
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,460
power

303
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,629
available to us today.

304
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,538
We all grew up in this vertical world

305
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,219
with sign-ins,

306
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,119
access control, training

307
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,359
per system,

308
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:37,639
migrations to single

309
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,918
instance, data optimized

310
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:42,053
across. A certain ERP,

311
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:44,654
a HRM, a CRM,

312
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:47,053
the world we're living in today is

313
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:48,533
truly, truly different.

314
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:51,413
It will be a conversational AI

315
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,004
orchestration layer that your customers,

316
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:55,404
your partners,

317
00:10:55,894 --> 00:10:58,224
and your employees can interface

318
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,433
across the systems of old

319
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,673
that we learned to.

320
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,700
Become friends with will become headless

321
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,418
systems.

322
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:07,739
We don't need to train our people

323
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:08,340
on them.

324
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:10,739
We don't need to have them interface

325
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:11,739
directly with them.

326
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:14,259
The time to proficiency for

327
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:16,658
our labor force is fundamentally different.

328
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:19,058
We're going to have to think of a world that is

329
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:20,440
more horizontal

330
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,879
and not vertical.

331
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,489
And that is the opportunity that sits ahead

332
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:25,048
of us.

333
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:27,729
So let's talk about thriving and thriving

334
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,788
to me means relevance,

335
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,288
relevance to your customers, your

336
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:33,009
employees,

337
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,950
and your partners.

338
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:38,009
The first question we see uh people ask

339
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:38,668
us is

340
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:41,629
how do I bring AI into my business?

341
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:44,200
And it's not always with the

342
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,269
technology. It starts with the

343
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:48,428
change management and the first thing

344
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:49,570
we encourage

345
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:50,649
at CR

346
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:52,440
is please ensure

347
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,190
that you've got leadership top down

348
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,729
support

349
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:58,109
and there's many ways you can equip

350
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:00,469
that that does not mean

351
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:03,529
there isn't a place for citizen development.

352
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:06,678
You can have bottoms up, but when the top

353
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:08,119
down support shows up,

354
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,989
provides you with the governance, the environment

355
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:12,038
to succeed,

356
00:12:12,469 --> 00:12:13,889
change accelerates.

357
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:16,788
Obviously you need well governed data. Every

358
00:12:16,788 --> 00:12:18,859
one of you here is probably familiar with,

359
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:20,269
with how to do that.

360
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,570
What we know is that AI thrives

361
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,450
when there's a room

362
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,869
and an environment created to

363
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:30,548
allow you experiment. Experimentation

364
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:31,869
needs to be encouraged.

365
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:32,889
Learning

366
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,529
is a competitive advantage.

367
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,330
Experimentation failure is

368
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,399
what will drive your business forward.

369
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:42,658
And then lastly, we deeply

370
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:44,899
encourage everybody to reflect on

371
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,279
an AI platform

372
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,859
with all of the observability and

373
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:50,000
the controls

374
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:52,779
to support your business. And guess

375
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:53,440
what?

376
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,038
That's what Core does.

377
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,869
We provide you with this

378
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,450
marketplace to rapidly

379
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,119
help you accelerate deployment,

380
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,609
multiple templates, hundreds

381
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:07,889
of them to get you going.

382
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,330
The second thing is we provide

383
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,070
an end to end.

384
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:15,029
Enterprise solution. Think

385
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,109
of your customer experience. Think

386
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:19,389
of your employee experience. Think

387
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:21,690
of your office front to back and middle,

388
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,500
and we can operate seamlessly

389
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,658
across each and every one of them.

390
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:29,168
We give you all of the tools

391
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:30,769
to make you successful.

392
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:33,619
Whether that's a low code, no code,

393
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:35,950
or perhaps a pro code if you wanna become

394
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,190
more sophisticated,

395
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:39,750
we give you all of the observability,

396
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,950
the compliance, and the governance,

397
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:43,570
and we're agnostic

398
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,869
to the integration.

399
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,750
If you're on AWS or some other platform,

400
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,029
bring it along,

401
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:51,389
bring your LLM, bring your SLM.

402
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:54,489
We will let your human beings thrive

403
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:56,788
by giving you all of these controls

404
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,048
with all of the connectors to

405
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:01,710
link into your pre-existing systems.

406
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,599
Let's go a little bit deeper

407
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:05,379
on each one of them.

408
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:08,428
The first offering we have inside of our platform

409
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:10,519
is AI for work,

410
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,359
and here you can search across silos

411
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:15,658
with our agentic rag and LLMs.

412
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,119
You can automate

413
00:14:17,538 --> 00:14:19,979
your workflow with AI agents, and

414
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:22,798
most importantly, you can orchestrate.

415
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,048
And if you're an AWS shop, you can orchestrate

416
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:28,369
across Amazon, but we can also

417
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,690
take you outside of that environment.

418
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,269
We are deployed today

419
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:35,570
at scale in the most

420
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,149
complex

421
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:38,029
environments in the world.

422
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:41,119
And we're driving real measurable

423
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:43,279
business outcomes that

424
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,219
are transforming businesses

425
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,500
at scale,

426
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,359
delivering either customer satisfaction

427
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,019
results

428
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,200
or driving OPEC savings

429
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,678
or allowing these companies drive

430
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,599
some new business or productivity services.

431
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:01,690
AI for service is very

432
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,879
similar, but we're focused on the customer

433
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,450
experience

434
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,250
and this is where we leverage our truly agentic

435
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:10,149
capabilities to empower customers

436
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,048
to reinvent how they interact.

437
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,019
And that is a huge game changer. We're

438
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,119
not just focused on improving

439
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,779
better wait times, better response

440
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:22,940
times, but how do you react? We've got

441
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,178
46 channels that

442
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:25,719
allow

443
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:28,099
customers to interact directly

444
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:29,200
with your enterprise.

445
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:31,783
This is transforming. The customer

446
00:15:31,783 --> 00:15:34,134
journey in many, many, many ways.

447
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:36,543
And finally AI for

448
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:38,663
process and this is the one

449
00:15:38,825 --> 00:15:41,404
that gives you all of the controls

450
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:43,783
that you would need to transform

451
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:46,614
your businesses and businesses and

452
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:48,364
organizations are discovering

453
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:51,085
really new ways

454
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:53,705
to automate what they thought were

455
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:55,325
truly complex.

456
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,830
Experience that they thought could never

457
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,058
be automated,

458
00:15:59,849 --> 00:16:01,479
um, zero touch IT

459
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:04,168
operations, triage

460
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:05,450
detection,

461
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,869
resolution of AI of

462
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:10,308
IT tickets. We're doing this

463
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:12,389
today at scale, and it's

464
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,808
companies like yours that have built

465
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,190
the workflows.

466
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,509
From very simplistic,

467
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:21,090
cross-departmental with an

468
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,210
orchestration layer that are

469
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,109
delivering amazing outcomes.

470
00:16:25,729 --> 00:16:27,090
So let's think about

471
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,250
your employee of the future.

472
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,210
And we think about the employee, the human

473
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:32,869
employee,

474
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,609
a little bit like a mixing board.

475
00:16:35,918 --> 00:16:38,119
They've got dozens of inputs.

476
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:41,090
They've got hundreds of adjustments

477
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:43,389
and thousands of possibilities

478
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:45,149
that they can make.

479
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:46,989
Now if you look at this,

480
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:48,428
a novice

481
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,288
will just see complexity.

482
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,690
But if you're a professional,

483
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:55,869
it's an instrument of creation.

484
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,570
You don't need

485
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:00,250
to be a songwriter.

486
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:02,450
You don't need

487
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:05,289
to be the best instrument player.

488
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,118
To be a great

489
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:10,500
sound or mixing board person,

490
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:13,358
but this allows somebody to orchestrate

491
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,199
into something beautiful,

492
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:18,059
and that is the power of bringing your

493
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,598
AI agents with your human

494
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:21,279
agents

495
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:23,939
together to orchestrate work in

496
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,838
a very, very unique way.

497
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,917
So how do you measure success?

498
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,059
In the future

499
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,039
when you are thriving and we think

500
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:36,318
the way to measure success is

501
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:37,000
not

502
00:17:37,318 --> 00:17:39,680
based on the number of AI agents

503
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,598
that you may have deployed.

504
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:45,380
It's not going to be based on the sophistication

505
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,799
of the LLMs. In fact, we

506
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,979
see many companies migrating now

507
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:52,680
for cost reasons or optimization

508
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,150
reasons to SLMs

509
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,318
don't participate in the arms

510
00:17:58,318 --> 00:17:58,858
race.

511
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:00,390
That you see

512
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:01,640
in the media,

513
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,088
which is Company X has deployed

514
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:06,390
1 million AI agents.

515
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:09,269
Company X has chosen X

516
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,689
partner to embed

517
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:13,309
inside of their ecosystem.

518
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,170
Ask yourself,

519
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:17,890
what are the creative new revenue

520
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,920
streams

521
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:21,348
that my company can create?

522
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,348
What is the new opex model

523
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,910
that my company can create?

524
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,670
What are the new services and products

525
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,809
that my company can create

526
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:33,848
that is

527
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:36,910
not only will make you different

528
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:39,279
but they're the questions that we

529
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,430
think that will allow you to

530
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,009
become better.

531
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:45,469
Thank you for taking the time to hear our story

532
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:47,630

on a daily basis.

538
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,529
Thank you very much.
