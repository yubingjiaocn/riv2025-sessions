  "abstract": "AI and agents are disrupting SaaS, but this session will show you how to turn disruption into growth. In just five steps, we’ll demonstrate how to build an enterprise-grade agentic workflow solution that executes an advanced, regulated process and can be deployed to thousands of B2B clients. We’ll design it with a blueprint, make it real on AWS with built-in security, make it functional with live data, make it accessible through a chatbot and web interface, and finally grow revenue by deploying at scale. Learn how agentic apps unlock SaaS expansion with limited resources. This presentation is brought to you by Pega, an AWS Partner.",
