1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,720
- Hello, everyone. Hi,
thank you for coming.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,310
My name is Ron, I'm the
co-founder and CTO of Eon.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,040
And with me, I have CJ.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,030
- Hi, CJ Keefe.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,909
I'm the Director of
Infrastructure, DevOps, and SRE

6
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:17,100
for SoFi.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,590
- Great, so today, we're gonna talk

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,320
about cloud infrastructure backup,

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,180
and I think that it's gonna
be a different point of view

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,913
on what backups can really do for you.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,583
So I'll start

12
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:36,583
and then CJ will tell us
how SoFi leveraged Eon

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,140
to get more out of their backups.

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,850
So let's start by just
letting you know what Eon is.

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,260
So Eon is a cloud
infrastructure backup company.

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,900
We've founded the company two years ago,

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,460
and Eon is one of the most
fastest growing companies

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,010
in that space of cloud infrastructure

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,320
and cybersecurity ever.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,780
And that might sound a bit surprising,

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,290
how can something as mundane as backup

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,303
can drive such hypergrowth?

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,070
And I think that this is going
to be very interesting today

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,840
because our mission

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,750
is to unlock the true potential of backups

26
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,880
and the true potential of backups,

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,540
which until today were kind
of useless insurance policies

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,530
in some way

29
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,210
that we really had to store.

30
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,150
We had to have backups for everything

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,820
because we might need to
recover data, obviously,

32
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,730
but compliance also mandates that.

33
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,590
But we didn't get a lot
of value out of that.

34
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,590
And cloud infrastructure backups
accrue between 10 and 30%

35
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,790
of your cloud bill.

36
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,280
So that didn't make sense for us.

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,070
We said how can we have
so much spend in the cloud

38
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,113
that doesn't generate enough value?

39
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,190
And not surprisingly,
everything starts with the AI

40
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,190
and with these unbelievable
advancements that we've seen

41
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,030
over the past years

42
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,140
and this technology that
actually changes every aspect

43
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,910
of our lives these days.

44
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,990
And when we have such a
disruptive technology,

45
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,800
it always introduces
opportunity, obviously,

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
but also confusion,
noise, fear, et cetera.

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,820
So what does backup have to do with AI?

48
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,653
That is something

49
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:28,170
which is not as intuitive
as we would think.

50
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,850
And let's say, what?

51
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,020
So if we would look at AI,

52
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,660
and what AI basically means today

53
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,660
is that it requires, as
all new technologies,

54
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,680
infrastructure and applications.

55
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,000
So we have great applications

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,940
that leverage AI today, so many,

57
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,680
and we have these amazing things,

58
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,860
those foundational models, those
LLMs that use generative AI

59
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,530
and bring so much value to organizations.

60
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,420
And then the classic infrastructure,

61
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,630
compute, obviously, databases, and so on.

62
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,430
And then there's something very unique

63
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,440
and interesting with AI.

64
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,820
It's data.

65
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,010
Basically, AI takes data

66
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,210
and makes it the enterprise's
invaluable asset.

67
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,920
So almost your currency.

68
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,130
So in a space where data is so precious

69
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,783
and is such an asset,

70
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,440
that basically means that
we need access to our data

71
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,010
and we need our data.

72
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,970
So let's imagine that
we could go back in time

73
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,820
and talk to ourselves
a couple of years back

74
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,460
and tell them that this is
what is going to happen.

75
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,510
Your data is going to be
your most valuable asset

76
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,283
and obviously, we would
start to store the data,

77
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:43,593
hold the data and leverage that.

78
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,510
But that's really interesting

79
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,273
because if you look at your data today,

80
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,660
you actually do have that data,

81
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,150
that historical data in your backups.

82
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,880
But your backed up data
today is pretty much useless

83
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,010
because you can't read the data,

84
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,090
you can't access the data,

85
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,760
so you can't leverage it for AI.

86
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,180
And that's where Eon transformed
this market completely

87
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,260
and that's what drove this
hypergrowth that we've had

88
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,313
in customer adoption.

89
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,460
So we'll talk about that,

90
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,050
but before we talk about that,

91
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,490
let's just tell,

92
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,190
well, what is backup
actually in the cloud?

93
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,720
Because we were used to,

94
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,120
for someone like me that have
been operating in that space

95
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,530
for close to 20 years,

96
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,530
backups were tapes or boxes
that we put in data centers

97
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,830
and took snapshots of whatever
you had in your data center.

98
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,390
But in the cloud,

99
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,390
backups basically are in the
form of either versioning

100
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,190
and replication of object storage

101
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,370
and the storage services
or cloud native snapshots.

102
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,280
Your databases, managed or unmanaged,

103
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,220
SQL database, relational
databases are now SQL

104
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,290
like your DynamoDB, et cetera.

105
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,030
And these are the actual forms of backup,

106
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,960
but all of them stored on S3,

107
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,120
if we're talking about AWS.

108
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,040
But you can't access the data,

109
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,450
if I have an RDS snapshot or
an EBS snapshot, for example,

110
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,910
and I want to access the
data that is backed up

111
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,740
in that RDS snapshot,

112
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,540
I need to do a full-blown restoration

113
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,920
into a different location,

114
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,567
and only then can I access the data

115
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:22,050
and we'll talk about why
is that so challenging

116
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,480
and why doesn't it make any sense

117
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,400
for you to pay such a huge
chunk of your cloud bill

118
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,160
and for storage that you
pay per gig per month

119
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,480
but can't access the data.

120
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,753
So we'll talk about how Eon
completely transforms that.

121
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,473
But before we do that,

122
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,280
and we'll obviously see
how SoFi leveraged that

123
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,480
with Eon as well,

124
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,830
but before we do that,

125
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,090
let's start with the problem description.

126
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,170
Why are backups broken in the cloud today?

127
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,430
What are the challenges

128
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,093
that we have been seeing
customers face in that space?

129
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:02,670
And we've seen that over the years.

130
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,500
Before co-founding Eon,

131
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,790
I was the general manager

132
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,790
for the migration disaster
recovery services at AWS.

133
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,910
And we've seen from up close
why customers are struggling

134
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,490
with their cloud infrastructure backup,

135
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,280
both in managing it,
orchestrating backups,

136
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,430
but primarily when they do need access

137
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,170
to that backed-up storage,

138
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,010
what can they do

139
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,540
and why is it so hard?

140
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,300
So there's very limited visibility.

141
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,850
We've seen advancements in
the space of cloud security

142
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,380
and performance monitoring and so on

143
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,203
that didn't apply for backups.

144
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,960
It's very hard to manage backup policies

145
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,450
to know if you're backing
up what you actually need

146
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,210
for the right amount of
time in the right locations

147
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,820
and are you paying for
what you actually need

148
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,310
or are you exposing yourself to risk

149
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,870
if you have friction

150
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,760
when you need to pass a compliance audit

151
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,550
and you need to prove that
you're backing up data,

152
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,230
how can you access the data,

153
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,080
how can you show that
you're backing up your data

154
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,610
as you should have,

155
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,230
both on the reporting side

156
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,750
but also with generating evidence?

157
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,390
The process today of generating evidence

158
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,250
that you're backing up your data properly

159
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,870
requires you to do a
full-blown restoration

160
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,250
of the entire thing.

161
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,841
Think of a large DynamoDB table

162
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:21,720
with billions of items.

163
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,420
In order to access one backed up item,

164
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,150
you need to recover the
entire billions of them,

165
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,820
pay a lot of money on
creating a huge table

166
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,980
only to access that single
record that you need

167
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,570
for your compliance audit.

168
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,073
That doesn't make any sense.

169
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,900
And basically, it means that
your data is inaccessible.

170
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,720
So what we've started with that problem,

171
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,060
let's solve the problem of recovery.

172
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,260
Because on the other hand,

173
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,730
there was another space

174
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,940
that did amazing advancements
over the past few years

175
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,740
and that's the data management space

176
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,310
where companies like
Databricks and Snowflakes

177
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,880
and the cloud providers
have done amazing job

178
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,530
in storing data in data lakes
in a format that is readable

179
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,463
that can be used by any
engine such as Athena in AWS.

180
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,530
And our thought was, let's take backup

181
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:18,530
and use that piece of
technology, use that format

182
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,520
in order to store the backed-up data,

183
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,630
which is still immutable, still
object block, still air gap.

184
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,950
So it's a full-blown read-only backup

185
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,373
across points in time,

186
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,770
but it is accessible.

187
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,290
So I can run SQL queries
directly on top of my backup

188
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,250
and I will show you that in the demo

189
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,830
and while we are accessing the data

190
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,540
for the purposes of recovery,

191
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,300
that basically allows us to use it for AI,

192
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,520
for analytics, for a lot of other things.

193
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,560
And that data that we've been storing

194
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,660
for that period of time

195
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,520
is now a valuable asset.

196
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,310
And that can be a huge win for all of us.

197
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,840
And then there's cost,

198
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,000
and cost is rising,

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,130
when we look at cloud
infrastructure backup,

200
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,310
it's extremely ineffective
in the way that it is stored.

201
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,240
And the reason,

202
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,400
and we'll talk about that in depth today,

203
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,900
is that the technology that
is used to storing backups,

204
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,260
which is basically incremental storage,

205
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,090
every day, your data changes,

206
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,910
some percentage of it
changes, not all of it.

207
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,030
So we need to store every
day only what have changed,

208
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,470
those deltas.

209
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,620
But that's a very, very
complex thing to do.

210
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,760
And all of the technology was
invented for data centers.

211
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,350
All of the vendors out there

212
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,150
that are doing cloud infrastructure backup

213
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,160
took their technology from on-prem

214
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,630
and tried to apply to the cloud.

215
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,310
But the cloud is different.

216
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,143
It's different

217
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,340
because storing data in the object storage

218
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,220
is not bound to a single disc.

219
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,640
It is scalable

220
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,440
and APIs cost money

221
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,080
because it's a distributed control plane.

222
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,430
So reading and writing

223
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,620
when you're doing that incremental changes

224
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,620
and deduplication algorithms
accrue a lot of cost of APIs

225
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,540
and that's what we've
solved with Eon as well.

226
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,090
And then there is a ransomware risk

227
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,440
in data protection.

228
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,790
And we are seeing today

229
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,700
that there's a huge gap
in ransomware detection

230
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,070
specifically in the cloud.

231
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,740
And definitely, when we're
referring to managed databases

232
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,470
that can be encrypted
in the application layer

233
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,620
and we'll see how we
unsolved that as well.

234
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,770
So a little bit about Eon.

235
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,690
First of all, as I've said,

236
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,870
Eon provides live data access to backups.

237
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,990
And that's extremely
important for various reasons.

238
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,440
First of all, as we've said,
simplify the recovery piece.

239
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,030
When I need to recover data,

240
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,300
I don't want that old operating system,

241
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,100
which is coupled with the data.

242
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,380
Let's say that I wanna
run a simple SQL query

243
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,840
on a snapshot from a year ago.

244
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,270
Today, before Eon, I would have,

245
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,890
and let's assume that that was running

246
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,700
on a Postgres database on a VM, on an EC2,

247
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,030
I would have to recover
the entire EC2 instance.

248
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,210
Now think about it, it
brings old operating system,

249
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,910
a year old, packed with
security vulnerabilities.

250
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,120
It'll pull from the past
that old Postgres software,

251
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,920
which is potentially end of life,

252
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,440
and the DBA to upgrade it.

253
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,300
It needs to live in a network

254
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,790
that potentially does not exist anymore,

255
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,550
and it consumes resources and accrue cost.

256
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,320
It needs to run full-blown compute.

257
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,990
I only wanna run fetch one record

258
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,530
and I need to restore
potentially terabytes of data.

259
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,370
With Eon, we provide
live access to the backup

260
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,520
and we'll show you how,

261
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:40,560
we wanna reduce the
total cost of ownership,

262
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,630
and that ties back to AI.

263
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,290
AI accrues a lot of cost for compute.

264
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,210
If there are inefficiencies

265
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,010
in the way that you're
storing your backups

266
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,650
and you're spending such a
large chunk of your cloud bill

267
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,700
on that,

268
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,650
we wanna free up that budget

269
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,230
either for you to be more efficient

270
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,110
or to move that to things
that bring you value

271
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,393
and to use that once again for AI.

272
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,630
Eon does full ransomware
resilience for all of the services,

273
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,420
including managed and unmanaged databases,

274
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,040
VMs, file services,

275
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,570
and I'll show you how

276
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,683
and just doing automation
around backup management.

277
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,800
So how can I access my
data from my backups?

278
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,290
We've just said that the backup
is holding all of the data

279
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,467
and the historical data as well,

280
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,570
and I want to leverage that

281
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,210
in order to gain all of that value.

282
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,870
So Eon transforms your cloud backup

283
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,420
to a live data lake.

284
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,440
So if you would look at the
bottom section of this slide,

285
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,733
you'll see that Eon,

286
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,810
you know, even before we go into backups,

287
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,830
what is a data lake?

288
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,780
So a data lake basically is a lot of data

289
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,500
that is stored on object storage,
usually, let's say on S3,

290
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,780
in a format which is readable,

291
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,200
Avro or Parquet files are the
most popular file formats.

292
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,310
But in order to ingest
data into the data lake,

293
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,690
you need to extract it

294
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,110
from all of the different
cloud resources, your ETLs.

295
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,120
And that is extremely disruptive,

296
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,740
especially for enterprises,

297
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,777
'cause think about it,

298
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:23,250
you need to access each
production database.

299
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,170
You need to know what's in there

300
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,080
and you need to build
an engineering project

301
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,540
that actually fetches the data.

302
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,460
Eon has a different approach.

303
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,620
We're backing up the data anyway,

304
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,540
so we're accessing the data anyway

305
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,910
without accessing the production,

306
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,260
without impacting the production.

307
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,750
But when we're backing up the data,

308
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,150
we're extracting the Tableau data,

309
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,360
the data from databases, file systems,

310
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,190
indexing them completely,

311
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,980
and then storing them in object storage,

312
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,690
whatever cloud that you choose.

313
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,680
So now you had the zero-ETL data lake,

314
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,170
data from all of your
backups is transformed,

315
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:06,170
including converting your old
snapshots into that layer.

316
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:10,170
And then once you have all of the data

317
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,370
stored in a more efficient way,

318
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,000
you'll see cost cut down by at least 50%.

319
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,830
And now you can leverage
that data as well.

320
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,100
And we expose it via public interfaces.

321
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,758
So beyond Eon's API,

322
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:28,050
you can just access it using
simple object storage APIs

323
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,540
and we also add catalogs around it.

324
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,940
So the next piece of data lake

325
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,690
is trying to understand
what do I have in that data.

326
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,150
Now it helps me to recover data

327
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,610
because now if a
compliance auditor asked me

328
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,130
to provide the evidence
of this and that data,

329
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,840
I can just easily do that,

330
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,050
'cause everything is indexed,
searchable, queryable.

331
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:54,000
But I can also use analytics
and data lakes tools

332
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,650
on top of my backups.

333
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:00,360
So things like Amazon Redshift and Glue,

334
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,220
Snowflake, Databricks.

335
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,330
Every analytics engine that
supports data lake format

336
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,573
can now be directed directly
on top of your backups.

337
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,563
And now let's talk about AI.

338
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,100
So we've already got that place

339
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,050
where we can extract all of your data

340
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:23,460
from all of your resources
converted into readable format

341
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,560
that is accessible to
those analytics engine

342
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,390
because a data backup platform

343
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,250
needs to process all of your data,

344
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,350
100% of your data because it back it up.

345
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,850
So every byte that changes,

346
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,490
every row in a database that is updated

347
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,980
needs to be backed up.

348
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,690
We can do light calculations

349
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,640
that doesn't add any
significant cost at all

350
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,140
in the backup process.

351
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,240
So once we're backing up the data,

352
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,950
we are indexing the data that
is backed up in a few ways.

353
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,820
The first is trying to
understand what's in my data.

354
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,490
When I'm backing up a
database, for example,

355
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,490
I will use a foundational model,

356
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,910
an LLM that is owned by the customer.

357
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,440
So we can support any LLM

358
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,470
that the customer decides to bring.

359
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,283
So for example, let's take
Claude via Bedrock as an example,

360
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,920
and it generates some textual context

361
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,980
on what does that table has

362
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,850
for each and every database
table that we're backing up,

363
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,650
we're taking that data

364
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,890
and we're embedding it
in a vector database.

365
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,430
And that allows us to do
RAG on top of the backup.

366
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,050
We'll see that in action in a minute.

367
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,550
But what it actually means

368
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,950
that now I can search across my backup

369
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,030
and I can find the data that I'm after

370
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,100
across all of my backups.

371
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,630
On top of that,

372
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,680
we're doing some calculations
such as entropy calculation,

373
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,450
which is the primary tool
to identify ransomware.

374
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,710
And we're doing some algorithms
that identify lineage

375
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,620
between the different resources.

376
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,780
So what can be joinable with what,

377
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,780
how can I join data from
one resource to another,

378
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,070
that is extremely valuable,

379
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,120
and we'll see that.

380
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,220
So all of that brings a lot of value.

381
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,410
And then on the client side,

382
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,490
we have a chat interface that
allows us to search for data,

383
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,060
to generate queries
that can run on my data

384
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,920
in order to simplify recovery

385
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,320
and also gain a lot of insight,

386
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,193
from my data, generate reports,
doing analytics and so on.

387
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,670
So cross-cloud resilience
is the next topic,

388
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,523
and we'll see that in action in a minute.

389
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,840
We've all seen outages
recently in all cloud providers

390
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,493
and when there's an outage,

391
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,250
it's a very interesting phenomena.

392
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,540
And being there as the GM for
the disaster carbon services

393
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,080
back in '21 when we've
seen similar events,

394
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,270
we've seen that customers
are very reluctant

395
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,580
to actually fail over.

396
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,840
And the reason

397
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,510
is because failing over
from one region to another

398
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,970
is, first of all, it's a hard problem.

399
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,470
It's a hard problem to solve,

400
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,480
and it adds a lot of risk.

401
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,030
And you're starting with that race.

402
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,920
Who will recover first?

403
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,620
Will I succeed to recover
first to a different region

404
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,460
or will the cloud provider
recover before I should even try?

405
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,120
And we've seen customers, first
of all, sitting and waiting

406
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,170
and throughout the time

407
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,960
before they're failing over,

408
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,790
they're losing access to their data

409
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,430
because their backups
once again are locked.

410
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,780
They can't read data from their backups.

411
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,020
So now they're downtime
in their primary region

412
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,330
and they can't access
their data in the secondary

413
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,913
until they will do that
full-blown recovery.

414
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,820
More than that if outages take too long,

415
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,820
like we've seen, right now, 14 hours,

416
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,480
customers do try, give
up and try to fail over.

417
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,880
And then there is a very
interesting phenomena,

418
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,110
there are not enough
resources in the target region

419
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,790
to hold all of that load.

420
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,520
So something like us-east-1,
which is such a popular region,

421
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,670
trying to fail over to a different region

422
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,320
and customers are getting iced,

423
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,180
insufficient capacity error,

424
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,430
which basically means that
they can't run compute

425
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,020
in that region.

426
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,540
And today, data is
coupled with that compute.

427
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,930
If I have an RDS snapshot,
once again, I'll need a VM,

428
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,020
an RDS instance that has an
issue to instance under the hood

429
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,520
in order to access the data.

430
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,130
But with Eon, I can run compute anywhere

431
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,413
and access that backed-up data.

432
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:48,530
We'll see in action how can
we chat with your backup

433
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,930
and a few words about that integration,

434
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,210
then we'll just see the product in action.

435
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,370
So integrating with the...

436
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,540
Eon is a storage company.

437
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,640
We're backing up your data.

438
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,890
The data sits in the cloud

439
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,150
and is charged in the
per gig per month model.

440
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,910
We want to make your data, your asset,

441
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,210
not just for AI but also for analytics,

442
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,400
both for the recovery use cases,

443
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,530
but also as a general data lake.

444
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,190
And Eon is integrated with
as a zero-ETL data utility

445
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,140
with any data analytics engine

446
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,650
that you're probably using,

447
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,483
and let's just see the product in action.

448
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,810
All right, so this is the Eon console.

449
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,650
And in this console,

450
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,810
you can first of all
start with the first view

451
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,800
and the first view

452
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,250
will show you all of
the different resources

453
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,960
in all of the different cloud providers

454
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,793
from all of the regions

455
00:20:55,793 --> 00:20:57,333
and all of the service types.

456
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,290
And Eon does that in an agentless way.

457
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,750
The space of cloud infrastructure backup

458
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,930
was not innovated in a long, long time.

459
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:11,280
And using on-prem paradigms
of let's take my box

460
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,120
for my data center

461
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,390
and try to transform it
into a virtual appliance,

462
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,030
and the cloud simply doesn't work

463
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,960
and it doesn't work

464
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,910
because the cloud is built differently

465
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,620
than an on-prem environment.

466
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,800
We have so many resources,
they change all the time.

467
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,540
Data is moving around,

468
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,660
from self hosted databases
to managed databases,

469
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,670
SQL to NoSQL and so on.

470
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,793
And Eon does all of that
in an agentless way.

471
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,670
But what's interesting
here is that you can see

472
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,530
that Eon augments that view

473
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,830
and add automatic data classification.

474
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,560
So you can see what do
you have in your data.

475
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,090
And that is very, very important

476
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,870
because if I zoom in,

477
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,520
I can see that we've identified
in the actual resource

478
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,290
that I have some credit card number.

479
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,860
So I have financial
information in that resource

480
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,170
and this resource is protected.

481
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,410
And the reason that this
resource is protected

482
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,280
is because you, the customer,
have defined this example,

483
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,710
a very simple backup policy,

484
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,850
everything in production

485
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,210
that has financial information, or PII,

486
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,130
will get this backup policy,

487
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,360
a daily backup

488
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,280
for three months in one region

489
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,410
and a monthly for a year in another.

490
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,410
And this does not rely on manual tagging.

491
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,120
That's the big deal here.

492
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,790
It means that if data moves around,

493
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,530
the backup policy will stick.

494
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,290
If an application team
spins up a new application

495
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,790
and it's running in production

496
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,370
and it has financial information,

497
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,590
the backup policy will
be applied automatically.

498
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,930
So obviously, we support tags,

499
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,450
but giving you the ability

500
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,120
to define contextual backup policies

501
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,650
is making sure that first of all,

502
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,020
you're backing up everything
that you need to back up

503
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,610
to the right amount of time,

504
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,810
meeting your business needs
and compliance requirements,

505
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,660
but also that you're not
over backing up your data,

506
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,290
which can expose some
of data as a liability,

507
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,983
but also generate cost
that you don't want to pay.

508
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,553
And now let's talk about data recovery.

509
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,800
So this is an interesting example.

510
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,810
This is an RDS database.

511
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,030
If I wanna restore that RDS database,

512
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,960
I can select,

513
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,720
let's go back any point in time,

514
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,430
hit that Restore,

515
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,630
and with Eon,

516
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:34,620
because of the fact that we've
unlocked the actual format,

517
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,350
it's not stored as an RDS snapshot,

518
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,730
it is stored as that
immutable data lake format.

519
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,660
We can restore the entire
thing to any cloud provider

520
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,860
and any account on the fly.

521
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,350
So I can recover between
one cloud to another,

522
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,090
backup from one cloud to another.

523
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,050
And that's huge,

524
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:56,343
especially for events that we
need cross-cloud resilience.

525
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,120
But what if I'm not
after the entire thing?

526
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,890
I just want some of the data.

527
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,960
I just want to pull a few records.

528
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,403
If I wanna do that,

529
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,140
I can zoom in into our database explorer

530
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,220
and this is the one and
only database explorer

531
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,460
that runs directly on top of your backups.

532
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,693
So let's once again
select that point in time.

533
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,840
Once I hit that,

534
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,670
I'm locking the schema

535
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,530
to that point in time

536
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,810
and now I can run any SQL query

537
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,280
directly on top of my backup.

538
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,843
So let's pull a few records,

539
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,780
hit that and in a second, I have my data.

540
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,370
So if I want to pull a few
records out of a huge database,

541
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:57,240
I can do that live directly
on top of my backup

542
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,440
and think of the alternative.

543
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,450
The alternative can take ages

544
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:03,630
and introduce a lot of
risk pulling from the past,

545
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,730
once again that operating system,

546
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,473
end of life software and so on.

547
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,750
But what if I don't know where my data is?

548
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,520
A compliance auditor can come in

549
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,313
and ask, hey, for a financial
service institution,

550
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,690
let's show me that you
can provide evidence

551
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,720
of all the checks that John
Doe wrote a few years back,

552
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,010
or an insurance company,

553
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:31,010
I wanna see all of the rejected
claims for car insurance

554
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,690
and drivers in this and that age

555
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,980
or for the purposes of analytics,

556
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,383
but I don't know necessarily
where my data is.

557
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,750
So we've talked about AI

558
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,550
and we've talked about RAG.

559
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,843
Let's see that in action.

560
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,780
So with Eon,

561
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,330
I can search across all of my backups.

562
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,530
So let's do that.

563
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:54,530
Let's search for rejected
car insurance claims, so.

564
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,930
Once we do that,

565
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,890
this now runs your LLM

566
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,050
on top of the RAG,

567
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,070
that vector database

568
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:15,090
in order to search for relevant data.

569
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,620
So it has found the same database

570
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,283
that we've fetched those
insurance claims earlier on,

571
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,500
this RDS backup.

572
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,120
But what's more interesting

573
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,470
is that it has detected
few other databases.

574
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,217
So I can see here a NoSQL
database in MongoDB,

575
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:33,303
self hosted on EC2,

576
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,830
and then spreadsheet
that it has found on S3.

577
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,150
And what's interesting here

578
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,000
is because of the fact that
we are, as I said before,

579
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,430
we're doing processing of the data,

580
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,650
so we identify the lineage

581
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,800
and the join ability between
the different resources.

582
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,600
It has detected here that this uuid column

583
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,270
in that insurance policies table

584
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:01,500
correlates in the actual
values to that document

585
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,550
that it is found in MongoDB,

586
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,230
even though it has different names,

587
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,740
it actually found that it
had same correlation of data

588
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,630
and that the idea here correlates

589
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,530
to that rejection spreadsheet

590
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,470
that it has found on your S3 backups.

591
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,940
So this is very interesting,

592
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,890
and let's generate a query.

593
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,690
So let's ask it to build a query

594
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,930
and let's fetch those insurance claims

595
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,230
and let's group the results.

596
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,480
So let's see, what do I have here?

597
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,590
Some interesting,

598
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,160
so I see some age group over here.

599
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,140
Let's look at some car category,

600
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,973
and let's do that.

601
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:50,040
So the rejected claims

602
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,790
and let's group the results

603
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,920
by driver age

604
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,233
and car category and date.

605
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,730
Once I do that, this operates our agent

606
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,450
that does text to SQL
based on that schema.

607
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,550
And you see that it has generated a query.

608
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,060
I can see the actual
query that is generated

609
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,680
to run directly on top of my backups

610
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,630
to pull that data.

611
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,520
But note this,

612
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,743
and this is extremely important,

613
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,260
this new technology,

614
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,160
this amazing AI thing also
introduced a lot of risk.

615
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,630
And with Eon,

616
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,560
the governance and access
control sit at the storage layer.

617
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,040
So I can see that I'm
authorized to read that query.

618
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,030
Let's see why.

619
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,220
I'm hearing the role of a data analyst

620
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,140
and I've defined a contextual
access control room

621
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,190
that is only something

622
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,830
that can be done in the storage layer,

623
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,920
so an outside agent can't access my data.

624
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,470
So this is a rule that
we've defined that said,

625
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,490
hey, this user cannot
access any production data

626
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,150
that has PHI, patient health information.

627
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,580
So this table does not have any PHI,

628
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,290
I can run that query

629
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,940
and I have that access control.

630
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,800
So let's actually run the query.

631
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,543
Yes, please do.

632
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,980
And that run the query.

633
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,810
And I have those results,
as simple as that.

634
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,607
So I could search for my data

635
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:25,980
and I couldn't generate any query,

636
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,100
but now let's examine the actual results.

637
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,470
And if I look at the data,

638
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,980
I can see that most of
it is relatively fresh

639
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,710
from the past couple of months,

640
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,390
but this is a backup platform.

641
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,220
I have all of my historical data,

642
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,330
all of my cloud snapshots.

643
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,630
So let's see if I have
some data in snapshots.

644
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,250
This runs an AI agent

645
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,760
that is analyzing the previous snapshots

646
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,090
and it has found that
each of those resources

647
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,630
has some past history

648
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,380
and that there's some
intersection between them.

649
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,570
So in the past six months,

650
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,310
I have all of the data.

651
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,660
So let's generate a graph

652
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:17,660
and see how rejected claims
have looked over time.

653
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,543
So let's generate a graph.

654
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,230
Let's count the number of claims,

655
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:44,163
per month, over six months.

656
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:48,573
And now this, let's let it think,

657
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,150
and now generated a
graph, as simple as that,

658
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,933
directly on top of my backup.

659
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:57,990
I actually don't see an
interesting trend here,

660
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,070
but I can go on

661
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:03,240
and continue to run that
and generate graphs,

662
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,650
access my data.

663
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,350
Now think of a compliance audit

664
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,090
that asked me to give all the checks

665
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,260
that John Doe wrote five years ago,

666
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,840
and all I have to do is input here,

667
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,730
give me all the checks that
John Doe wrote five years ago

668
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,680
and I will immediately get the results.

669
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,280
And that is a whole new level
for backup and recovery,

670
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,990
but also unlocking that asset

671
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,670
not only for backup

672
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,190
but for the entire
organization getting a huge win

673
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,190
out of that as well.

674
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,690
I also wanna show you
what we're doing with logs

675
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,820
because once we started to show this

676
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,950
to additional customers,

677
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,400
they've found additional use cases

678
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,020
where data that was until
today kind of locked

679
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,240
can be used in the backup themselves.

680
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,570
So if we look at typical log management,

681
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,180
you have your access logs
and you have performance logs

682
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,790
and you have applicative logs and so on,

683
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,530
audit trail, et cetera.

684
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:01,560
And there are amazing tools out there

685
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,160
that are high-end tools to analyze logs.

686
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,580
The problem is that on one hand,

687
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,990
compliance requires you to
store logs for a very long time,

688
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,550
90 days, 180 days,

689
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,133
depending on the industry
and the type of data.

690
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,810
On the other hand, when you
actually need to analyze logs,

691
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,590
usually, you will only go for
the relatively fresh logs.

692
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,030
If I have a problem today,

693
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,250
I would usually analyze
logs from yesterday,

694
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,140
from couple days ago,

695
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,030
not from 80 days ago.

696
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,430
And those systems are extremely expensive,

697
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,500
and as we've said, we
want to cut down cost

698
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,320
and use it to things that brings us value,

699
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,970
and what I've been hearing from customers

700
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:46,830
is they're dumping those
retained log to S3 once again,

701
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,100
only keeping short, fresh logs

702
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,490
in their primary log analysis tools,

703
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,760
your seams or your performance
monitoring platform

704
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,593
and so on.

705
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:03,123
But when they do need
to access older logs,

706
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,150
when need arrives,

707
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,250
they need to ingest all of
it again to that system,

708
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,390
continue all of the retention,

709
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,400
a lot of manual work.

710
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,930
So let's see what we're doing with Eon.

711
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:16,800
Basically, those logs
from your object storage

712
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,680
or primary logged softwares

713
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,083
are ingested into that unified platform.

714
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,990
And we have the tools here in our console

715
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,130
to analyze those logs.

716
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,443
So if I need to access an older log,

717
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,710
I can just do that from here.

718
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,130
So let's, you know, filter those,

719
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,950
see that the logs in specific errors,

720
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,963
I can have those messages here.

721
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:49,050
I see a lot of data on
the logs themselves.

722
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,340
But what's really interesting here

723
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,860
is that I can also see
where they came from.

724
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,900
So I can see that these
logs were picked up

725
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,880
from an S3 bucket.

726
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,950
They can come from
multiple cloud providers.

727
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,350
You can pull logs from your VMs,

728
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,750
your database logs and so on,

729
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,580
access logs, obviously.

730
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,490
And if I wanna analyze them further,

731
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,270
once again, I can go into my query editor

732
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,700
and just fetch data from
my logs here as well.

733
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,490
So let's play around
with that a little bit.

734
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:21,390
So let's pull some logs,

735
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,700
no, no, from my AuditTrail logs

736
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,803
and let's order those.

737
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,450
Let's do that by the eventTime

738
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,423
and limit some results,

739
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,937
and I get immediate access to my logs

740
00:34:38,937 --> 00:34:40,740
and I can run any query here.

741
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,870
So once again, if I need to find my logs,

742
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,360
I can do that with the
same level of performance.

743
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,090
And the challenge with those,

744
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,700
let's say high-end log systems,

745
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,950
they use very expensive

746
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:56,070
and great databases like Elasticsearch,

747
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,090
but they're very expensive.

748
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:01,860
And to hold data that you
need to retain for a long time

749
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:06,150
require just to cruise
outrageous cost actually

750
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,170
if you look at your Splunk

751
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,180
or your other tools that you're using.

752
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,850
And this also allows you to optimize

753
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,990
and shift away your budget

754
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,153
to things that bring you more value.

755
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,473
So with that, I think that I can,

756
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:29,220
let's go back to the slides

757
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,537
and I will pass it on

758
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:34,510
and so you can hear how SoFi
have been leveraging Eon

759
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,633
to get that value.

760
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,610
- Thanks, Ron.

761
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,443
- Thank you.

762
00:35:39,443 --> 00:35:41,220
- So I think I need a banner up here

763
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,783
that says actual customer.

764
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,650
My goal here is I'm not a sales guy.

765
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,600
I'm very much an engineering leader.

766
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,340
I wanted to talk to you a little bit

767
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,140
as somebody who's gone
through this process

768
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,640
from engagement all the
way through implementation

769
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,840
in recent times,

770
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,870
like I think we finished
roughly three months ago

771
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,120
with our full deployment.

772
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,920
So just to talk a little
bit about the company,

773
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,650
SoFi is essentially a
software development company

774
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:10,650
or a tech company that owns a bank.

775
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,640
With that being said,

776
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,257
we're highly regulated as
many of you are, OCC, FRB.

777
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,580
We have many, many different
regulators and auditors

778
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,880
that we have to answer to.

779
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,590
Obviously, we want to move fast.

780
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,210
We want to enable our customers

781
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:32,210
and we want to ensure that we have uptime.

782
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,800
A lot of what we talk about

783
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,830
is how do we get to that five nines.

784
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,810
Most of the time, that's unrealistic.

785
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,930
One of the things that
led us down this path was

786
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,320
I had a firewall go down

787
00:36:45,314 --> 00:36:47,610
in one of my Amazon environments.

788
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,690
The backup provider we
used was unaccessible.

789
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,900
We had to go through AWS
to get their EC2 backups

790
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,030
to actually restore that service.

791
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,360
This took a process of an entire day

792
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,063
where one of my AWS
regions was not available.

793
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,230
As part of that, I challenged my team,

794
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,670
how do we do this better?

795
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,010
Who can we look at? What can we do?

796
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,570
This isn't acceptable.

797
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,680
Yeah, we were available.

798
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,240
We have five AWS regions.

799
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,890
We're highly available.

800
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,170
We've got disaster recovery,

801
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,880
but I had a full region
that was unavailable,

802
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,430
that impacted my software developers,

803
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,070
that impacted my compliance team,

804
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,230
that impacted my cyber team.

805
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,280
How do we get better?

806
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,900
Again, some of the challenges
that Ron had spoken to,

807
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,923
we experienced.

808
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:40,170
We're fragmented across
five AWS regions, right?

809
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,990
Those backups only reside in each region.

810
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,180
Those snapshots only
reside in each region.

811
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,133
We did not have cross regional backup,

812
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,950
retention policies,

813
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,720
we're very manual, right?

814
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,540
My teams were having to go
create retention policies

815
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,160
based on that region

816
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,470
and what customers we were
serving out of that region.

817
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,400
We own a bank.

818
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,823
There's very, very specific
retention policies to banks.

819
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,193
We talked a little bit
about the firewall outage.

820
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,610
Anytime we had to make a change,
we were talking about days,

821
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,890
sometimes weeks to make a change

822
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,140
to whether it's the retention policy,

823
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,020
compliance issue that came up,

824
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,090
MRAs, if you guys are familiar with those,

825
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,550
matters requiring attention
that came up from the auditors,

826
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,780
like these things took weeks,

827
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,730
sometimes months to actually implement.

828
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,610
One thing, the slide is great,

829
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,810
but I want to talk a little bit more

830
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,300
about the engagement with Eon.

831
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,950
With Eon coming in,

832
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,570
it wasn't just a sales pitch.

833
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,275
They came in, they worked
with us from day one.

834
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:47,610
SoFi is notoriously
hard to onboard vendors.

835
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,720
They brought their team in

836
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,700
and worked with us every
single step of the way,

837
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,020
worked with our compliance team,

838
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,910
worked with our cyber team,

839
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,050
got everything in place

840
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,480
so that we could kick off our POC, right?

841
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,280
As part of that POC,

842
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,170
they walked us through

843
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,670
and worked with us side by side

844
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,840
to identify where exactly
all of our data was,

845
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,840
how much data we were using,
how much our AWS spend was.

846
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,880
Then we were actually able to
put the financials together

847
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,840
and be like, okay, if we go
with Eon, this is our AWS spend.

848
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,570
This is how much we're spending with Eon.

849
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,850
Now, like most of you,

850
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,700
I'm a little skeptical
when I see those numbers,

851
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,700
I think I'm pretty positive.

852
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,660
The number we came up with

853
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,820
was like a $9,000 a month savings.

854
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,653
I was like, that's neat.

855
00:39:33,653 --> 00:39:35,700
That's great, all right.

856
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,750
In reality, we're plus 20% of that now.

857
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,920
So I think we're sitting in

858
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,770
about $12,000 a month of savings.

859
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,440
So we've blown past their estimations

860
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,610
and are continuing to grow, right?

861
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,600
So the more we grow,

862
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,460
the more we bring into the environment

863
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,900
in our five AWS regions,

864
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,730
the more we're actually saving.

865
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:00,330
So they're not just giving
you the sales pitch.

866
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,700
They're actually working
with you side by side,

867
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,220
identifying where the
cost saving measures are

868
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,420
and where these technologies

869
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,020
are actually helping you
implement the things that you need

870
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,373
and identify your issues and
how to resolve those issues.

871
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,990
With that, we got through the POC.

872
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,880
Everything was great.

873
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,493
We're seeing the cost savings.

874
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,560
We were able to, with Eon
working side by side with us,

875
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,910
roll out to our entire
environment across five regions

876
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,260
in a matter of weeks, right?

877
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,230
Generally, that's unheard
of for a company like ours,

878
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,610
probably like yours,

879
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,620
I mean just the software
development life cycle

880
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,860
takes weeks, if not
months, per region, right?

881
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,640
Going through SDLC, you
have lower environments,

882
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,900
getting up into production,

883
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,780
like, it's a long drawn out process.

884
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,700
With Eon working side by side with us,

885
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,950
we were able to do that for five regions

886
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:59,490
in approximately two weeks, right?

887
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,230
With the added benefit,

888
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,840
I might add, Ron talked
about this a little bit,

889
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,380
of the data classification,

890
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,840
which was a brand new thing for us

891
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,050
as well as my cybersecurity
team doing cartwheels

892
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,900
because of the ransomware protection.

893
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,870
I know Ron didn't talk about it a lot,

894
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,400
but if you bring your
cybersecurity team in,

895
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,530
they will be very happy
to have the conversation

896
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,940
around ransomware protection.

897
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,773
I'm positive.

898
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,170
We talked about the rollout,

899
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:32,070
but one of the things that I
think impressed me the most,

900
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,780
and he showed you the dashboard

901
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,053
and my manager is here
that I referenced here,

902
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,603
I had an unknown regulation
around student loans, right?

903
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,330
Obviously, SoFi is known.

904
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,650
We started out with student loans,

905
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,150
that's where we made our hay,

906
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,980
but there was a regulation
out of New York City

907
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,540
that I wasn't aware of.

908
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,243
We own a bank. I've got
seven-year retention policy.

909
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,750
As we were insourcing that infrastructure

910
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,540
into the corporate infrastructure,

911
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,640
I came across an unknown regulation

912
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,870
working with my compliance team

913
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:06,810
where I needed to keep all of
that student loan information,

914
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,150
regardless if it was SoFi

915
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,520
or Golden Pacific Bank,
the bank that we own,

916
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,430
for 10 years, right?

917
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,560
We had to make this change very quickly

918
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,780
in order to stay within compliance.

919
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,410
I called my manager, I
said, "I made a booboo.

920
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,267
We need to fix this very quickly."

921
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,210
Told her what we needed to do.

922
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,250
She literally had made the change

923
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,753
before I hung up the phone.

924
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,490
That would've taken us weeks previously.

925
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,550
She was able to make
the change in real time,

926
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,080
get us back within compliance,

927
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,010
be able to evidence that change
for our compliance officer

928
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,963
before we actually hung up the phone.

929
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,830
That, if nothing else,

930
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:54,830
is a testament to how
quick, easy and versatile

931
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,313
that the product is.

932
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,930
Just talking about some of the results.

933
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,760
I talked about the cost, right?

934
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,790
They underplayed the cost
savings by quite a bit

935
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:06,900
when they talk to us.

936
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,590
Like the cost savings is in perpetuity.

937
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,833
Like that is AWS spend that
I'm putting somewhere else now.

938
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:19,350
The operational burden is
almost non-existent, right?

939
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,730
This is all in software for us.

940
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,010
It all runs through our SDLC pipeline.

941
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,010
My team is not having to go maintain this.

942
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,300
We're not having this
like we build the policy,

943
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,323
we deploy it,

944
00:43:29,213 --> 00:43:30,900
we tag the services
that need to be involved

945
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,103
and let it go.

946
00:43:35,678 --> 00:43:37,680
I talked about the ransomware protection.

947
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,530
I can't talk about that nearly enough.

948
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:43,020
My cybersecurity team
is very happy with this,

949
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,420
and then it's a hundred
percent automated from our end,

950
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,050
like it is built into all of
our builds as we build them

951
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,970
and as we continue to move forward,

952
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,200
as we continue to expand,

953
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,760
as we will, we're in five regions now,

954
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,250
probably seven by the end of the year,

955
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,050
this is all built into our
software deployment pipeline.

956
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,410
What's next for us?

957
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,680
We're continuing to look at
how do we build these analytics

958
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,200
into everything that we do, right?

959
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,710
So that's the integration of the Eon data

960
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,160
that we were just speaking
about with my SRE team

961
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,490
that's starting to build policies

962
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:27,000
around the data
classification that we've got.

963
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,130
My engineering team
has started looking at,

964
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:32,283
I think, Ron, you spoke
specifically, PII and PCI data.

965
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,420
We own many PII and PCI environments.

966
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,500
We're looking at now,

967
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,790
how do we contextualize that

968
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:40,890
for our compliance
officer and our risk teams

969
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,270
to go in and be able to look at that

970
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,890
from an evidencing perspective.

971
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,660
Again, reducing the operational burden

972
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,340
on my engineering teams

973
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,070
and then again, taking
that to the next level,

974
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,050
and this is something that
is near and dear to my heart,

975
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,550
is self-service compliance,

976
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,340
is how do I take that, turn that evidence,

977
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,680
like anytime we make a change
through an MR or whatever,

978
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,210
how do I automate that evidence

979
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,090
so that my engineers don't
have to be randomized anymore.

980
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:07,710
We can just go auditor, internal
audit, one load, two load.

981
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,030
Here's where the repository is,

982
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,960
where all this data is,

983
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,000
or here is the query that you run.

984
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,230
Go get your evidence.

985
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,970
Again, reducing the operational burden

986
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,170
on my engineering teams.

987
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,310
All right, Ron, I'll hand
it back off to you, man.

988
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:21,600
- Yeah, thank you so much

989
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,210
and first of all, I want
to encourage all of you

990
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,290
to come over to the booth.

991
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,040
We have a very unique booth

992
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,320
where you can see additional demos,

993
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,910
dive into the specific use cases

994
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:35,490
that are most interesting to you.

995
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:40,490
So please, come over booth 529,

996
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:44,730
and I think that now we can
go on and have a quick Q&A,

997
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,013
if anyone has any questions.
