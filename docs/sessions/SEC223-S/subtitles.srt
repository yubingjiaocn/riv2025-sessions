1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,940
- Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,530
Thank you for joining.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,240
It's a pleasure to be here.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,870
So my name is Lavi, one of
the co-founders of Upwind.

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,900
I'm gonna walk you through
our story, what we do,

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,820
why the hell do you need to hear

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,460
about another cloud security platform,

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,110
and what we're doing differently.

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,303
So let's kick it off.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,140
So Upwind, we are on a mission

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,110
to build the best cloud security platform.

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,310
A little bit about us.

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,400
We're a team that goes
together for so many years.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,110
We all met together back at the days

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,790
in the Israeli military,

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,880
coming from a DevOps
infrastructure background.

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,610
Upwind is actually the second
company we're building.

18
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,890
The first one was called Spot.

19
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,270
We're building a cloud security...

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,390
Sorry, we were building a
cloud automation platform

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,490
that was matching the right infrastructure

22
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,470
to the right application,

23
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,350
to the application demand
in terms of performance,

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,763
cost, availability.

25
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,600
We were acquired by NetApp in 2020

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,370
for almost half a billion dollar.

27
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,477
For two years we were there until we said,

28
00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:06,420
"We wanna go back to innovation,"

29
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,220
and then we started Upwind.

30
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,810
And a true story about Upwind

31
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,560
and the idea that led
us to build a company.

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,370
So back in 2022, when we started Upwind,

33
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,840
we're looking at the market,

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,350
and we're looking like what is out there

35
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,810
in terms of, you know, cloud security.

36
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,570
And we saw that there
was a really, you know,

37
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,000
different approach to how you deal

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,067
with cloud security back then.

39
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:35,637
And we said, "We need to
fundamentally change that."

40
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,700
So we're on a mission,

41
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,980
we're building a cloud security platform

42
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,720
with an entirely new
dimension of visibility.

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,510
Take you through the whole
journey of securing your code,

44
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,370
configuration, workloads,
application, your data, your APIs,

45
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,420
your AI workloads, but in
a very different approach.

46
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,190
And why is that?

47
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,280
Why does the world need a new CNAPP?

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,580
You know, you all probably
know the competitive landscape

49
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,820
of cloud security, the
old players out there,

50
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,550
the most successful one,
the less successful one,

51
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,920
but why the world really needs that?

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,070
So if you look at modern architecture,

53
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,740
and especially what happens with AI,

54
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,140
our attackers are leveraging AI,

55
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,380
and now we are building
AI agents and MCPs,

56
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,880
they're just behaving
differently than what we used to.

57
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,323
And what do I mean by that?

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,040
So when we look at AI
workload, new architecture,

59
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,140
everything happens at runtime.

60
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,093
Everything happens in real time.

61
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,830
Things are communicating through APIs.

62
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,863
Everything is ephemeral,
keeping minimal state.

63
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,760
Everything is leveraging
data flow, you know,

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,620
in real time, in runtime,

65
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,790
and there has to be another
dimension for visibility

66
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,880
that fundamentally
gives you a new approach

67
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,910
to see what happens in your environment.

68
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,120
So you need a visibility
to your API layer.

69
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,210
You need a visibility to
every process execution,

70
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,250
to every network flow in layer three,

71
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,870
layer four, layer seven.

72
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,350
You want a visibility to
how data flows internally

73
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,580
in your environment,

74
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,220
and how it flows from the
internet to your environment

75
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,100
and from your environment outside.

76
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,510
You wanna understand your topology,

77
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,720
you want to understand your
architecture in real time

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,600
and see all the changes, why it happens.

79
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,590
And you wanna observe and
detect attacks as they happen.

80
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,150
You can't anymore just
look at your exposure

81
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,850
and attack past and your vulnerabilities

82
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,020
and misconfigurations.

83
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,400
It's important.

84
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,390
But in parallel, you want
to see how things behave

85
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,370
in real time to detect threats,

86
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,130
to respond to them, to
give root cause analysis,

87
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,530
to understand how to
prevent them the next time.

88
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,770
To put the guard rails and
the right policies in place

89
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,483
to secure better the environment.

90
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,030
So Upwind is bringing a fresh new approach

91
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,990
to how we look on
securing your environment.

92
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:17,580
So we all used to see the
environment from the outside.

93
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,430
We called it an outside in approach.

94
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,060
It was very based on configuration,

95
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,140
on statically scanning the
environment, which is important.

96
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,630
You want to see how you
configure your environment.

97
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,930
You want to see everything
that exists over there.

98
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,590
You do it in an agentless
fashion, it's very quick.

99
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,620
It gives you full inventory visibility,

100
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,360
but you want to include another dimension

101
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,990
that is radically different
than how you approach

102
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,970
cloud security before that.

103
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,330
And that's the inside out
approach we're talking about.

104
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,464
You wanna have the visibility that lives

105
00:04:56,464 --> 00:05:00,570
inside the application,
inside the workload,

106
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,960
that can understand from
the inside how it behaves,

107
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,620
so you can build behavioral
baselines of every application

108
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,273
and workload in your environment,

109
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,373
so you can understand exactly
how it behaves, what it does.

110
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,910
And then you can do two things

111
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,090
very differently than what you used to do.

112
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,170
One, when you have this
dimension of visibility

113
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,300
on your runtime environment,

114
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,400
you can detect threats in real time.

115
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,350
So attackers don't use anymore

116
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,630
non-malicious activities

117
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,380
and leveraging attack paths
that is very easy to detect.

118
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,090
They're using automated AI
tools that are very different

119
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,580
than how we used to detect threats.

120
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,610
Everything now behaves differently.

121
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,610
You want to observe the behavior
and then look at anomalies,

122
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,850
look at deviations from
a regular baseline,

123
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,560
detect threats while they happen,

124
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,350
find indications of compromise,

125
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,470
then connect the dots to create a story

126
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,280
that tells you exactly what
happened, how it happened,

127
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,020
and let you detect things in real time,

128
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,173
let you respond that with
all the context you need.

129
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,870
And the second piece,

130
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,963
now that you have the runtime
context and visibility,

131
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,550
you can really go back to
your posture management,

132
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,390
feed this context to all
your misconfigurations,

133
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,200
compliance issues,
vulnerability management,

134
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,972
and I'll say, is this
critical vulnerability

135
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:41,070
that CVSS says it's critical?

136
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,540
Is it just critical in the
wild, theoretically critical

137
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,190
for every organization?

138
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,420
Or is it really critical
for my specific workloads

139
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,230
in the way that they behave
in my runtime environment?

140
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,710
And that gives you a
very different approach

141
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,400
to how you prioritize all
your security findings.

142
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,780
Because I can tell you,

143
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,200
no matter what cloud security
platform you use today,

144
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,450
no matter how much it
tells you it can prioritize

145
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,960
your findings in the best way possible,

146
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,100
at the end of the day, you
are suffering from hundreds

147
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,160
or thousands or tens of thousands alerts

148
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,260
that you need to know how to deal with.

149
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,510
And you want to cut through this noise

150
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,280
and deal with the 5, 10,
15 most critical things

151
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,110
when you wake up in the morning.

152
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,820
And how do you do that?

153
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,560
When you really understand

154
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,980
what is critical in your
specific runtime environment,

155
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,330
because now we can say, is the
package that is vulnerable,

156
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,670
or the misconfiguration that is exposing

157
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,820
a critical exposure path,

158
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,120
is it really critical
for my specific workload?

159
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,580
Is the package really
loaded to the memory?

160
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,830
Is the function really being called?

161
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,660
Is the way that I connect
to my different pieces

162
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,900
of my environment, to my sensitive data,

163
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,780
to my exposed internet traffic,

164
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,400
is it really matching to the way

165
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,280
that this vulnerability
can be exploitable?

166
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,980
When you have the runtime
context and the data,

167
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,410
you can actually figure that out,

168
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,120
and cut through this noise and understand

169
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,383
what is really critical in
my specific environment.

170
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,820
So the Upwind Runtime piece
is leveraging all the context

171
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,040
we can get by shifting left,

172
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,350
watching at all your CICD pipeline,

173
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,140
your code changes, your
configuration changes,

174
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,240
your infrastructure's code,

175
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,170
feed that with the dimension
of runtime visibility,

176
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,600
and then take you through
the entire journey

177
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,990
of securing your code,
securing your configuration,

178
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,180
dealing with your own vulnerabilities,

179
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,593
identifying exposed secrets
at rest and in real time,

180
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,673
looking at your data and
how it's being secured,

181
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,780
you know, at rest and in motion.

182
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,230
Baseline every workload
for threat detection.

183
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,390
Do API security on top of it.

184
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,640
Do AI security on top of it.

185
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,370
And that's how you can
really complete the picture

186
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,743
and understand how your
environment behaves,

187
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,160
whether it's really exposed at real time,

188
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,310
what are my most critical
threats that I need

189
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,783
to deal with immediately.

190
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,090
And we have to talk about AI.

191
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,890
Everyone talks about AI these days,

192
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,800
so you know, I have to
spare a minute about that.

193
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,380
When you think about AI security,

194
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,050
everyone talks about
AI security right now.

195
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,770
You can't deal with
securing your AI workloads

196
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,993
with how we traditionally used
to secure our environment.

197
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,870
AI agents, MCPs, they live at runtime,

198
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,240
they're ephemeral, they
keep minimal state,

199
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,250
they communicate with APIs.

200
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,240
Data is flowing in microseconds.

201
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,340
You need to have the runtime visibility

202
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,140
to understand how they behave,

203
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,683
to have a full visibility
to how it actually,

204
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,710
what actually your developers are doing.

205
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,730
Where is my AI workloads
internally and externally?

206
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,013
How data flows to AI services?

207
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,880
What sensitive data go
outside of my environment

208
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,800
to AI services?

209
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,000
How can I detect threats
coming through my MCPs

210
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,730
and AI agents inside my environment?

211
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,460
That all happens at runtime.

212
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,150
So from a postural perspective,
you want the visibility,

213
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,010
you want a graph to query everything,

214
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,140
to understand all the technologies,

215
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,770
all my misconfigurations, all
my critical vulnerabilities.

216
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,520
But from the other side, you
want to understand in real time

217
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,920
when you are being attacked.

218
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,813
So The Upwind Way is all about
give you a full discovery,

219
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,123
put a map of how your environment
looks like in real time.

220
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,820
No more visuals,

221
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,970
no more static snapshots
of your environment.

222
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,820
Real time view on the changes that happen

223
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,070
in your environment, on our data flows,

224
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,860
on our network flows,
on our different pieces

225
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,070
in your architecture are being changed,

226
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,270
we put it on a timeline.

227
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,760
You can watch it like a Netflix movie.

228
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,120
Go back in time, see how
things change, investigate,

229
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,210
and find the real critical
pieces of your environment

230
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,490
and with critical threats.

231
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,140
That's the first thing.

232
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,110
The second piece, now
that we have this data,

233
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:39,110
identify all your exposures
and reduce your attack surface.

234
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,680
The third piece, fix the
5% that really matters.

235
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,170
Not the thousands of alerts you have,

236
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,780
like the 5 to 10 alerts
that when you wake up

237
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,500
in the morning, your security
engineer, your SOC engineers,

238
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,620
your DevOps people
opening up the dashboard,

239
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,140
opening up the Jira dashboard,

240
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,300
whatever ticketing system you are using,

241
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,780
they're dealing with these
specific critical findings

242
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,870
that would really secure your environment

243
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,333
and make them believe in
your security as well.

244
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,630
And then the fourth piece,

245
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,180
you really want to have this engine

246
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,020
that gives you peace at day and at night,

247
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,960
that you always have the right engine

248
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,570
to detect threats as they happen.

249
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,280
That can block attacks,

250
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,800
that can prevent them from happening,

251
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,500
that can give you the whole story

252
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,930
and the chain of events
on how attackers got

253
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,163
into your environment,

254
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,460
how we got permissions,

255
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,380
how we escalated that,

256
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,380
how we got into your specific data

257
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,160
and network secrets and everything,

258
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,370
and where you can stop it in this journey.

259
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,930
So you know that we can detect it,

260
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,760
you know that we can prevent it.

261
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,490
And the worst case, you know
that you can respond to it.

262
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,250
When you leave at runtime,
you can kill a process.

263
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,460
Like go to the level of the
process that is being executed

264
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,910
inside the container to stop an attack,

265
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,120
to stop a network path,
to stop an API path,

266
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,060
to stop a path to
sensitive data and so on.

267
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,180
You want to have all these
capabilities in real time

268
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,493
to really deal with all
these kind of threats.

269
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,030
So with Upwind, you can
get started in minutes,

270
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,340
you get our agentless cloud scanners

271
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,040
that gives you full visibility
to how your environment

272
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,330
is being behaved, is configured,

273
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,650
is leaving your environment.

274
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,580
And then the other side,
the runtime sensors,

275
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,730
which are the heart of our
platform that feed data

276
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,490
to every piece of our platform

277
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,440
that gives you this visibility.

278
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,470
They are being automatically managed,

279
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,360
automatically being deployed.

280
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,700
They're so easy based on EVPF,

281
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,345
so lightweight that you won't even feel

282
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:58,650
that they exist over there.

283
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,970
But these are like the heart
and the soul of the platform

284
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,180
that gives you this new
dimension of runtime,

285
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,040
this new possibilities from a visibility

286
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:13,950
and defend perspective to really secure

287
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,900
your traditional workloads,

288
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,670
but also the new era of AI,
leveraging AI capabilities

289
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,720
to secure it and secure
every new stuff you build

290
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,863
in your environment.

291
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,390
And the platform covers you

292
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,370
with all the different use
cases you can think about

293
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,440
in your cloud security journey.

294
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,270
From all your posture,

295
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,123
from a cloud and data and AI perspective,

296
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,320
all your workload and
infrastructure security,

297
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,960
and of course the runtime
threat protection.

298
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,190
So we are securing every
piece of your cloud stack,

299
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,990
every use case you can
consolidate many different tools

300
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,410
that you used to use
into a single platform

301
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,680
that can really give you
the right visibility,

302
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,920
cut through the noise,
and really secure you

303
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,033
in this modern architecture and cloud era.

304
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,340
And with that I really wanna
welcome you to our booth.

305
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,530
It's in aisle 600.

306
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:24,530
It's a self shop with a
self bot and cool T-shirts.

307
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,370
So you can see a demo, see how
it looks like in real life,

308
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,830
talk about your specific
need, your architecture,

309
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,900
and how we can help with that.

310
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,950
So thank you very much.

311
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,866
I'll be here for a few
minutes if anyone wants

312
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:38,580
to have a conversation,

313
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,380
and welcome all of you to our booth.
