1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,650
- So I thought we would start

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,323
with something a little different, a joke.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,557
A senior civil servant
was asked a question,

4
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:12,810
"How do you define cloud governance?"

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,057
They thought for a moment and responded,

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:19,590
"It's when we move our
servers to the cloud.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,480
We also bring along our
500 page policy documents

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,310
on our flights."

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,193
It's governance in the cloud.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,183
So, we do have a lot to
share with you today.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,550
We are going to be spotlighting

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,550
a major public sector organization,
Japan's Digital Agency.

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,910
The agency serves its citizens

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,480
by spearheading the digital transformation

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,833
of its national ministries
and local governments.

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,950
My name is Nivas Durairaj.

17
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,277
I'm part of our cloud
governance team here at AWS

18
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:03,750
and we help our customers

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,080
with building out foundations on AWS.

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,890
We're joined by Mr. Ohmura,

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,820
who is the specialist SA manager in Japan,

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,030
and he leads cloud operations
and cloud governance.

23
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,723
And our special guest
speaker, Mr. Yamamoto,

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,140
who is the Chief Cloud Officer

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,483
at the Digital Agency of Japan.

26
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:30,270
Okay.

27
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,393
Here's our agenda.

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,920
We're gonna first talk
about what does it mean

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,800
to balance agility and compliance

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,683
and why is it important for organizations?

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,850
Then the core part of this presentation,

32
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,050
the governance story of the
Digital Agency of Japan.

33
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,450
And lastly, we'll round it off

34
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,443
with a few key governance launch updates.

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,180
Let's talk about customer needs

36
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,060
in highly regulated industries.

37
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,790
Here are a few key needs

38
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,760
that customers in this space have.

39
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,760
And usually the customers
are customers in healthcare,

40
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,640
public sector and financial services.

41
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,250
But it's really any
customer that's dealing

42
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,270
with sensitive data sets
as well as workloads

43
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,113
with strict security and
compliance requirements.

44
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,043
So if you look at innovation, here,

45
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,720
we're discussing teams that
are expanding on the cloud.

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,000
They're building new products,

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,660
and they need to take advantage

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,580
of some of our latest tooling,

49
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,980
some of the latest AI services.

50
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,600
They wanna bring the products to market

51
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,490
as quickly as possible.

52
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,060
With regenerative AI and gen AI,

53
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,610
it's really time for organizations

54
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,730
to rethink existing processes

55
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,960
and see how we can build
some automation with AI.

56
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,510
But if application teams are doing this,

57
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,170
then the central operations teams

58
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,130
will also have to think
about how to expand

59
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,053
the cloud environment and how
to do it efficiently at scale.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,300
Organizational agility, this simply refers

61
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,470
to the ability of an
organization to adapt to change

62
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,470
as well as deliver outcomes
without unnecessary friction,

63
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,623
essentially reducing roadblocks
for the organization.

64
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,850
And of course our security
and compliance teams

65
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,600
are looking to make sure
that the organization adheres

66
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,050
to the security compliance
regulation policies

67
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,853
and standards and frameworks.

68
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,820
So, we can actually place these needs

69
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,820
into two separate areas,
agility and compliance.

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,050
Your development teams are
looking for the independence

71
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,620
to make technical decisions on their own.

72
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,790
They also want the freedom to experiment

73
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,113
and build products.

74
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,820
On the other side, your
central operations teams

75
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,550
are looking to see how
they can build efficiency

76
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,550
and standardization at scale
across the entire organization.

77
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,680
And then of course, your security teams

78
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,420
are looking to implement controls

79
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,650
to make sure that the organization

80
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,363
is following regulatory and
compliance requirements.

81
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,660
So there's a tension here.

82
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,163
It almost seems like this is
moving in opposing directions.

83
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,360
And so the key insight here

84
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,280
is that this isn't an
either or proposition.

85
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,613
It's actually a balanced approach.

86
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:20,073
We need both agility and
compliance within an organization.

87
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,160
You will see that guardrails
replace the roadblocks.

88
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,590
We're simply defining clear boundaries

89
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,453
on where teams can operate,

90
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,280
and then automation enables compliance.

91
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,863
And the last one is it's
a shared security model.

92
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,643
Everybody is responsible
for security and compliance.

93
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,060
So we talked a little
about cloud governance

94
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,790
at the beginning and that
was the incorrect definition,

95
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,010
but what's the real definition?

96
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:01,010
And here at AWS, we actually
have a formal definition

97
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,610
for cloud governance.

98
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,530
It's a set of rules, processes,

99
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,590
and reports that guide your organization

100
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,990
to follow best practices,

101
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,770
essentially building your
foundation in alignment

102
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,533
with the business requirements
of the organization.

103
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:22,850
So it's great to have a
definition, but where do we begin?

104
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,930
And so oftentimes,

105
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,930
this starts by building
an environment on AWS.

106
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,460
A great analogy to think of it as a house,

107
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,400
the same design principles
when you're building a house,

108
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,160
determining where the rooms
go, the access points,

109
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,410
the doors, very similar.

110
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,223
You'll be building an AWS
environment like this.

111
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,840
We build our environment on AWS

112
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,664
using two foundational services,

113
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,500
AWS organizations and AWS Control Tower.

114
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,500
This diagram here, that is
an architectural diagram,

115
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,440
a multi account environment.

116
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,973
It's what AWS Control
Tower deploys for you.

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,870
And we are highlighting it here

118
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,870
because it follows the
well architected principles

119
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,460
in building your foundations.

120
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,800
And we'll talk about a few of them.

121
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,510
And landing zone, it
simply means a secure,

122
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,583
scalable multi account environment.

123
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,280
And if you look at this diagram here,

124
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,990
notice the multiple accounts.

125
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,030
This is actually a very key principle

126
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,360
on how we design our services.

127
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,830
We use multiple accounts

128
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,640
because it helps us operate efficiently,

129
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,170
it helps us manage our
teams, and at the same time,

130
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,650
it reduces risk, security risks,

131
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,963
reducing the security blast radius.

132
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,740
And then if you look at this diagram,

133
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,220
notice that it sets up Identity Center.

134
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,420
One of the very first steps

135
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,920
that a lot of our customers take

136
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,620
is that they set up identity access

137
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,870
to the multiple accounts.

138
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,650
And in this case, Identity
Center is integrated

139
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,930
or can be integrated with Okta, Ping,

140
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,143
any kind of identity federation provider.

141
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,310
The next is the log archive account.

142
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,690
This is based on the principle

143
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,180
that we want to track activity

144
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,630
that's taking place
across your environment.

145
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,620
And so in this case, Control
Tower is centralizing

146
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,160
CloudTrail logs across its environment,

147
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,460
and it's also including AWS Config logs.

148
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,400
So we are tracking the API activity

149
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,890
as well as resource configuration changes

150
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,070
that are important for compliance

151
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,983
as well as operational investigations.

152
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,550
Next is the audit account.

153
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,550
You can also think of it
as the security account.

154
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,960
Here lies all of our security
administrative tools.

155
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,640
And in Control Tower's case,

156
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,510
it sets up the AWS Config aggregator.

157
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,350
We'll hear a little bit more
about Config in a future slide,

158
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,580
but the takeaway here

159
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,580
is that you can receive
security notifications

160
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,033
on non-compliant resources
across your environment.

161
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,273
Now, provisioning accounts,

162
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,950
I guess I wanna be clear
that when we create accounts,

163
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,530
it's quite simple to create an account,

164
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,270
but when you provision an account,

165
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,830
there's actually a lot more steps

166
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,350
that take place in
provisioning an account.

167
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,840
We are actually customizing the account

168
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,570
so that it can be used by other teams.

169
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,390
Typically what happens
is customers will set up

170
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,350
the proper networking
resources, identity security,

171
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,690
lots of administrative tools,

172
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,810
and in some cases, they may also set up,

173
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,690
depending on who is using those accounts,

174
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,780
domain specific tools could be SageMaker

175
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,390
or could be database tools and so on.

176
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,363
So that's what it means
to provision accounts.

177
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:17,760
We provide some customizations
frameworks to do this,

178
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,830
but it's important to understand

179
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,370
that sometimes provisioning
accounts can get complicated

180
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,600
and can take some time.

181
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,853
It's different from account creation.

182
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,700
Lastly, it's the QR code at the edge.

183
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,580
It guides you on how to create some OUs

184
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,990
within your environment.

185
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,850
You don't have to create every single OU,

186
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,550
but the principle to take away here

187
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:46,550
is that create OUs based
on common policy groupings.

188
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,583
So this summarizes our
environment best practices.

189
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,640
Use accounts as building blocks,

190
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,680
the multi account environment,

191
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,980
automate the account
provisioning and customization,

192
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,030
track activity across your environment

193
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,463
and implement a strong
identity federation.

194
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,830
Okay, so landing zone governance,

195
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,480
we talked about the landing zone,

196
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,683
we talked about centralizing
identity access and logging,

197
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,733
automating, account provisioning.

198
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,760
But there's something that's missing,

199
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,050
something very important,

200
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,143
and important for security and compliance.

201
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,253
It's establishing controls.

202
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,670
So the three types of
governance controls, preventive.

203
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,840
And here, we're simply making
sure that users and roles

204
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,790
are restricted from performing
actions on resources.

205
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,393
And this applies across
the CLI and console.

206
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,423
And then with proactive controls,

207
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,380
we're scanning the resources
before they're provisioned.

208
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,530
And this can take place
with infrastructures code

209
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,770
and sometimes developer pipelines.

210
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,890
The benefit of proactive
controls is that this leads

211
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,240
to developer development
efficiency along the same lines

212
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,810
of shifting left principles,
but we're catching the errors

213
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:29,370
before it gets provisioned or deployed.

214
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,770
And then the last advantage
of proactive controls too

215
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,563
is also about the cost efficiency.

216
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,330
We're preventing the
resources from being deployed,

217
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,390
so that results in lower costs.

218
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,390
Then the last one is detective controls.

219
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,260
These are simply non-blocking
rules, but we'll tell you,

220
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,030
we'll evaluate certain resources

221
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,793
and tell you what's
compliant or non-compliant.

222
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,560
So AWS organizations has
three preventive controls.

223
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,870
Two of them launched last year,

224
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,830
resource control policies
and declarative policies.

225
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,720
With service control policies,

226
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,840
we are preventing or
restricting identities

227
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,330
based on API actions.

228
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,663
And I'm sure everyone's
quite familiar with them,

229
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,270
they've been around for several years,

230
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:26,130
but you can apply them to
all of our AWS resources,

231
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,100
containers, EC2, SageMaker and so on.

232
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,990
Now, RCPs, resource control policies,

233
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,760
define the maximum available
permissions on a resource.

234
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,710
So we typically see this being used

235
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,200
for data perimeter use cases,

236
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,200
and it's very helpful
when we are able to apply

237
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,800
what permissions can be
enabled on a service at scale

238
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,810
across a multi account organization.

239
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,167
And so the services that
it supports today are S3,

240
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,703
KMS and Secrets Manager.

241
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,470
But very powerful when
you don't have to think

242
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,990
about what permissions should be allotted

243
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,113
to each and every resource
in your organization.

244
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,760
And then declarative policies
are also very powerful.

245
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,760
Here, they enforce a desired
configuration for a resource,

246
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,190
and those resources
include VPC, EC2 and EBS.

247
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:34,190
But again, the power here is
that this is applied at scale.

248
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,103
Now, AWS Config rules, these
are our detective controls.

249
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,450
I think the main points I'd
like you to take away from here

250
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:56,450
is we can group Config rules
into conformance packs,

251
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,080
and that makes it easier to
deploy across the organization,

252
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,860
maintain the Config rules as
well as view them centrally

253
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,030
in a dashboard.

254
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,540
So that's the benefit of
using conformance packs.

255
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,560
And then Config also supports aggregators.

256
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,260
In Control Tower, you
notice that we had set up

257
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,500
a Config aggregator in
the security account,

258
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,310
but you can also create
custom Config aggregators

259
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:31,310
for your own special accounts or regions.

260
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,403
And then custom rules.

261
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,940
You can build custom rules

262
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,340
depending on what your
business requirements are.

263
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,410
And almost every single customer

264
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,200
will want to create custom rules.

265
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,170
And the easiest way to
create custom rules today

266
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,920
is using Kiro or Amazon Q Developer.

267
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,007
It used to be a lot more complicated.

268
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:58,020
We did have some frameworks earlier,

269
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,390
but now it's far easier to create it

270
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,573
with some of our gen AI tooling.

271
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,103
So the question is,

272
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,933
should we start by building custom rules?

273
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,390
You certainly could,
but we would recommend

274
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:23,373
that you also take a look
at our managed controls,

275
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,900
and we have a number of managed controls

276
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,347
across our services.

277
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:35,347
AWS Control Tower has
over 1000 control types

278
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,030
as well as 17 frameworks,

279
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,270
so you can search through
these common controls

280
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,960
and understand how to apply them at scale

281
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,790
across your multi account environment.

282
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,300
And that's a big benefit of
using Control Tower controls.

283
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,550
It doesn't just apply to one account,

284
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,650
it applies to all of the accounts

285
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,803
that are under Control Tower governance.

286
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,640
And then we also have Security Hub CSPM,

287
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,200
and this checks to confirm
if an AWS environment

288
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,800
is following security best practices.

289
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,100
It centralizes the findings
across all of your accounts,

290
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,230
and you can also integrate it

291
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,173
with third party security tools.

292
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,310
So here we have two separate AWS services

293
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,170
with managed controls.

294
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,530
The question that often
our customers ask is,

295
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:36,510
how do we know which service
is applying which control

296
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,770
and why are these controls being used?

297
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,300
And so that's why we have
the controls catalog,

298
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,363
which is also part of
AWS Control Tower today.

299
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,180
But it lets you search,

300
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,990
list out your controls
across your environment,

301
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,730
understand the control
objectives, for example,

302
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,120
whether we are using it for a
control for data encryption,

303
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,790
lets you search which kinds
of controls are applied

304
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,490
to different services and so on like that.

305
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,970
So you don't even have to
enable AWS Control Tower

306
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,620
to search through the catalog.

307
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,450
You can simply visit the catalog

308
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,093
and list out the managed controls there.

309
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,360
So here are the controls best practices.

310
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,453
Align your control objectives
to a security framework.

311
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,040
Apply the detective controls
before the preventive controls.

312
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,010
And this is a very important
one because far too often,

313
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,140
we see that customers are impacted

314
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,603
by applying preventive controls.

315
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,500
And while it might seem like
there will be no impact,

316
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,200
it has impacted production workloads.

317
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,950
So the guidance here is
try as much as possible

318
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,380
to apply detective controls,

319
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,330
understand what is non-compliant

320
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,450
before applying preventive controls.

321
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,650
And then of course the last
one is continuously monitor

322
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,350
and test your controls.

323
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,300
Your development teams are always building

324
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,500
and using new tools.

325
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,320
We want our controls to adapt

326
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,413
to what your teams are
doing in the organization.

327
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,130
So the question is,

328
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,975
I talked a lot about AWS
cloud governance principles

329
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:29,490
and we covered a little bit
of information on services,

330
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,490
but how does this look like
in a real world scenario?

331
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,653
How do you implement
governance defined by law,

332
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,973
and where does a large
organization even begin?

333
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,710
The Digital Agency of Japan

334
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,000
supports 1,700 plus local governments,

335
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,843
and has an environment
of 6,000 plus accounts.

336
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,693
Here's a short video
introducing the agency.

337
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,713
- [Narrator] You can't
see digital technology,

338
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,140
but it's always there right beside you.

339
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,850
(birds chirping)
(indistinct chattering)

340
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,093
And there are things only
Digital can make possible.

341
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,990
With Digital, you can get
the certificates you need

342
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,355
without worrying about having enough time.

343
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:31,105
(cheerful music)

344
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,570
Payments are made simpler and easier

345
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,079
by using your My Number Card.

346
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:41,829
(cheerful music)

347
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,220
At school, everyone can
learn at their own pace

348
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,998
using personalized
textbooks or digital tools.

349
00:20:53,998 --> 00:20:56,748
(cheerful music)

350
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,674
Your identity can be
verified securely at events.

351
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:04,507
(cheerful music)

352
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,830
Even when you're busy
caring for your child,

353
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,492
you can submit applications
without visiting public office.

354
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:17,242
(cheerful music)

355
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,370
Even if a patient cannot speak,

356
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,560
their medical history and prescriptions

357
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,070
can be shared immediately.

358
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,870
Anytime, anywhere.

359
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,860
The right service for the right
person at the right moment.

360
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,410
By providing personalized support for all,

361
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,930
we strive to build an inclusive society

362
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,703
accessible to everyone.

363
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,533
Digitalization for
everyone in everyday life.

364
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,413
Digital Agency.

365
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:57,774
- Okay.

366
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,400
Okay, hi everyone.

367
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,870
Can you hear me?

368
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,520
Okay, good.

369
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,340
I'm Nori Yamamoto, Chief Cloud Officer

370
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,053
of Digital Agency in Japan.

371
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:16,230
I'd like to talk about how
we achieved both scalability

372
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,683
and governance in our Government
Cloud project in Japan.

373
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,860
First of all, let me introduce
Digital Agency itself.

374
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,730
Digital agency was founded
in September, 2020,

375
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,643
just after the COVID-19 worldwide shock.

376
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,230
During the COVID-19, we Japanese noticed

377
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,040
that we could not trace
who was vaccinated or not,

378
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,040
where the vaccines are
available or in short

379
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,383
because of the paper
and manual operations.

380
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,830
At that time, one of the
minister referred to it

381
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,693
as a digital defeat.

382
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,750
To solve this situation,

383
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,760
Digital Agency was founded

384
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,310
and has been driving the
digital transformation

385
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,563
of the government over past four years.

386
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,320
We achieved many things.

387
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,990
For example, the My Number Card.

388
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,110
You saw the My Number Card in the videos,

389
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,070
and the My Number Card is
a national ID card in Japan

390
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,330
and which are possessed
by 100 million people,

391
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,243
almost 80% of the population in Japan.

392
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,100
Recently, there's some
personal information

393
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,910
like medical information
or tax information,

394
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,010
those information are integrated

395
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,130
into the My Number Card
and My Number portal.

396
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,800
So we can access to
the digital application

397
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,510
by using the My Number Card.

398
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,910
The Government Cloud.

399
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,650
The Government Cloud is a baseline

400
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,463
for those digital transformation
or digital applications.

401
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,530
And many systems are start
using the Government Cloud

402
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,153
as their common platform,

403
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:59,340
the common platform for
the digital transformation.

404
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,300
Not only the central government
ministries and agencies,

405
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,310
but also the local governments.

406
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,870
We actually, we have
1,700 local governments

407
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,740
and quasi-public organizations.

408
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,000
Now we have more than 6,000 AWS accounts

409
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,430
and 300 to 400 accounts

410
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,043
that created in every month recently.

411
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,923
It's scaling very fast.

412
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,790
To create 300 AWS accounts in one month,

413
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:36,150
the account provisioning must be automated

414
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,280
that we've developed
such kind of automation,

415
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,930
not me exactly, the (indistinct),

416
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,440
and any other members develop it.

417
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,393
And before the automation,

418
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,070
the users who are in the
queue of the account creation

419
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:54,360
and have to wait for that
completion for five working days.

420
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,760
But after the automation,

421
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,243
the users can start using
cloud in the next day.

422
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,100
And a reduction in our
administrative tasks.

423
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,473
Those are very significant, also.

424
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:11,820
Before the automation,

425
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,420
the creating accounts took 30 minutes

426
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,160
and some preparatory tasks

427
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,960
related to several accounts
take one hour or so.

428
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,250
So the creating the 300
AWS accounts in one month,

429
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,720
it used to take 260 person hour,

430
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,583
but after the automation,
we reduce it to zero, zero.

431
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,740
So that's the results

432
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,433
of our scalability mechanism we developed.

433
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,180
And before explaining
our scalable mechanism,

434
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,660
we government officers
must emphasize this,

435
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,483
the governance is also very important.

436
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,750
And for the local governments,

437
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,570
the independence of the local governments,

438
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,233
local autonomy, is also very crucial.

439
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:10,050
And the governance and the
local autonomy and scalability,

440
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,663
those are kinds of contradiction I think.

441
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,570
So the government card must
be the balanced platform

442
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:22,260
that resolves the conflict
between the governance,

443
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,470
local gov, local autonomy and scalability,

444
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,843
enabling all these achieved.

445
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,150
So again, the governance and
local autonomy and scalability,

446
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,433
those are government card objectives.

447
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,774
I explain three objectives

448
00:26:39,774 --> 00:26:44,774
and how we achieved we three
by balancing all of them.

449
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,550
But before explaining three objectives,

450
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,500
let me explain the system
overview of the Government Cloud.

451
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,520
The users can access

452
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,260
to their own cloud environment directory

453
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,210
and the management functions

454
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,260
and logs functions are set up
aside the cloud environment,

455
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,360
the user cloud environment

456
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,300
by using the cloud service cloud services

457
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,753
like Control Tower or Security
Hub as Nivas mentioned.

458
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,960
And then the GCAS, Government
Cloud Assistance Services,

459
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,910
which is the web services we developed

460
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,130
that's so-called the vending machine.

461
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,520
And also the visualizing dashboard

462
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,740
or payment management systems.

463
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,610
Those are developed outside
the management functions

464
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,133
of the Government Cloud
by connecting loosely.

465
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,455
So to achieve the agility and scalability,

466
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:49,560
we have to avoid creating the bottlenecks

467
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,560
like (indistinct),
integrated management systems

468
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,600
over top over the cloud.

469
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,120
Instead we enable users

470
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,950
to leverage the cloud technology directly

471
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,600
so the users can use the Government Clouds

472
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,853
just as they would the public cloud.

473
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,013
Then the first objective, the governance.

474
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,140
I explain two aspects of the governance.

475
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,660
The one is institutional aspect

476
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,600
and the other is the technical aspect.

477
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,710
The first one is institutional aspect

478
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:33,090
Data are encrypted and
under the direct contract

479
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,930
between Japanese government and the CSPs.

480
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,330
The direct contract is very important

481
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,553
for claiming the sovereign immunity.

482
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,813
The direct contract is
under the Japanese law.

483
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,250
And strong data domestically
is very important

484
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:54,033
for ensuring that laws effect directory.

485
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,980
And selling the data domestically

486
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,570
and data appropriately to
ensure those kind of things.

487
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,150
The audit and the contract certification

488
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:10,680
called ISMAP in Japan,
those are very important.

489
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,189
To summarize, I'm sorry, to summarize,

490
00:29:14,189 --> 00:29:17,970
data are managed domestically

491
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,750
and it's under the direct contract

492
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,823
based on the Japanese law.

493
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,020
We can ensure those are
operated appropriately

494
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,590
according to the audit and certification.

495
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,750
So that's how we achieved

496
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,830
the institutional aspect
of the governance.

497
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,923
And second, the technical
aspect of the governance.

498
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,173
Data are encrypted by the
user's own encryption key.

499
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,370
The encryption key is stored in HSN

500
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,323
and hardware security module,

501
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:57,723
which is the certified
as the (indistinct) 140.

502
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,580
The encryption key is
authorized to be managed

503
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,990
by the key owner in the
key management services.

504
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,480
So to access the encryption key,

505
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,440
key owner is strictly
identified by My Number

506
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,743
and it is strongly authenticated
by (indistinct) devices.

507
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,593
So nobody can access to data
directly bypassing encryption.

508
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,830
And technically the
data is fully controlled

509
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,513
by the key owner only.

510
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,240
Therefore, the data are
governed both institutionally

511
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,710
through contract and law and technically

512
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,413
through encryption and
strict key management.

513
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:48,120
Those kind of governance approach
doesn't impact the scaling

514
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,670
because there are no bottlenecks

515
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,738
for the user application
except encryption.

516
00:30:54,738 --> 00:30:57,333
The users just encrypt data.

517
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,183
Then the second
objectives, local autonomy.

518
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,410
So as I mentioned before,

519
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,680
the local government
emphasize the local autonomy,

520
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,280
local autonomy, independence,
their independence.

521
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,600
So, only pre predefined automated process

522
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,613
can access to environment,

523
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,940
and even Digital Agency
employees must not to access

524
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,733
to the environment of
the local government.

525
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:34,050
And when Digital Agency employees access

526
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,873
to management accounts,
management functions,

527
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,383
the predefined procedures are required.

528
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,860
And those kind of
procedures and operations

529
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,683
are reviewed by the auditor every year.

530
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:52,803
So the user, of course data encrypted

531
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,720
and even the data agency
employees cannot access

532
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,870
to data directory bypassing encryption.

533
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,830
So, the user can control the data

534
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,453
in the independent environment
from CSP and data agency.

535
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,660
And those kind of local autonomy approach

536
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,493
doesn't impact scaling also.

537
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:21,570
And the third objectives,
agility and scalability.

538
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,550
As I mentioned before,

539
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:27,330
the agility and scalability
is almost realized

540
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,943
by the cloud technology
like Control Tower.

541
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,450
But it's still necessary

542
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:37,950
to map the real structure
to AWS organizations

543
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,951
because the real structure,
the organizational structure,

544
00:32:41,951 --> 00:32:46,590
power structure which is define
who is responsible for what,

545
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,563
does define one organization to another.

546
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,320
So the AWS organization's
service is not enough

547
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,680
to represent the real
organizational structure.

548
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,002
Rather than that, I think AWS
organizations must be designed

549
00:33:03,002 --> 00:33:07,110
according to AWS best practices

550
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,543
like SGP policies, et cetera.

551
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,130
So we need to develop
the mapping functions

552
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:17,700
between the real structure
to AWS organizations,

553
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,390
and we have to develop
the management system

554
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,833
of mapping information.

555
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,188
Then we developed automated
such kind of process

556
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:30,153
during the provisioning.

557
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,157
That caused the results of
our scalability mechanisms

558
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,305
as I mentioned before, the
waiting time reduction,

559
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:42,483
the task reduction.

560
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,573
Sorry.

561
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,290
And we, sorry.

562
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:53,220
And we developed these three objectives

563
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,073
over five GSPs we contracted.

564
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,993
So multiple cloud strategy
is very important, I think.

565
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:07,560
We defined some rules as
our multiple cloud strategy.

566
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,273
For example, the first one
is one CSP for one system.

567
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,560
Do not split a single cohesive system

568
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,843
into multiple clouds.

569
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,740
even if they would like to conduct,

570
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,290
they would like to build
the redundant system

571
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,403
across the clouds.

572
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:32,370
They can build the redundant
system even in one CSP

573
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,723
by using the multiple regions,
a multiple availability zone.

574
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,890
If they split the systems,

575
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,200
one system into the one (indistinct),

576
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,990
it leads to cost increase

577
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,663
and the complex operations, I think.

578
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,970
The second one is similar to the first one

579
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:57,840
and necessary for integrated
management systems.

580
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,050
I think one operational organization,

581
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,490
one operational team
should deal with one CSP

582
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:10,170
because when they want
to deal with two class,

583
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,870
they have to acquire skills double

584
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:16,890
and they have to pile
up the knowledge double.

585
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,313
So those leads to cost increase
and complex operations.

586
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,030
And last thing is data portability.

587
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,237
Data portability is also
important, of course.

588
00:35:27,237 --> 00:35:29,223
And the data and the programs,

589
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,510
especially related to
the core application,

590
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:38,510
those should be exported and the data

591
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:42,753
and the programs portability
is very important.

592
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,750
For example, the (indistinct) technology

593
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,230
rather than lambda function as a services.

594
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,080
Those would be preferred,

595
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,543
especially for the core applications.

596
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,170
And in the final deck,

597
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,420
we are planning the additional services

598
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,190
around the existing ones
to assist the cloud usage,

599
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,670
total cloud usage from
the fast registration

600
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,933
to the operations.

601
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,160
For example, we will release git services,

602
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,913
we call it GCAS DevStack in April, 2026.

603
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:24,480
And regarding AI, we've been
prepared AI environments

604
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,500
where the user can utilize AI services.

605
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,830
And Japan has announced
the government policy

606
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,413
to actively utilize AI,

607
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:38,313
and we will prepare for the government AI.

608
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,473
So the AI services in government
card will be the platform,

609
00:36:43,473 --> 00:36:46,920
will be the infrastructure
for government AI.

610
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,733
So we are continuously contributing to it.

611
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,930
So, those are how we
achieved three objectives

612
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:01,530
of the Government Cloud and how
we achieved both scalability

613
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,233
and governance in our
Government Cloud projects.

614
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,690
So I introduce Ohmura.

615
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,760
Ohmura will explain
(indistinct) in more detail.

616
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,397
Ohmura, please.

617
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,397
- Thank you.

618
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:19,260
Thank you very much, Yamamoto,

619
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,330
for sharing variable experience

620
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,343
at Government Cloud in Japan.

621
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,730
Hi, I'm Yutaka Ohmura,

622
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,153
manager of specialist
solution architects in Japan.

623
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,310
I worked with Digital
Agency to build the agility

624
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:38,223
and governance in the Government Cloud.

625
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,580
As we discussed Digital Agency's case<

626
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,990
a key point of their success
was the implementation

627
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,360
of best of practices for cloud
government, cloud governance.

628
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,520
Nivas already shared several
best of practice with us,

629
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,950
and I pick out four best of practice

630
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:09,570
and I will dive deep into
these best practices.

631
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,783
And let's learn the lesson
from Digital Agency.

632
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,220
First best practice is
align control objectives

633
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,903
to a security framework.

634
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,443
How achieve this in Digital relationship?

635
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,900
For governance, as Yamamota
explained, start with the law

636
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,903
and finally it's implemented at the end.

637
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,263
Digital Agency aligns with
principle based approach,

638
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,180
so a high level document like law

639
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:52,020
and regulation defines a guideline.

640
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,470
And each organizations and
systems needs to determine

641
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,743
and define their own controls
following that guidance.

642
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:08,070
As you can see on top,
in Japan we have a law,

643
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,503
the basic act on cybersecurity.

644
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,890
And for the regulation,

645
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:18,210
national cybersecurity office
defined unified standards

646
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:22,473
for information security
measures for government agencies.

647
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:28,230
And Digital Agency created a guideline,

648
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,150
a security by design guideline

649
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,223
for government information system.

650
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,220
These guidelines are
not so specific enough,

651
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:43,220
So they difference the
framework like Nist CSF

652
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:49,423
and control catalogs like NIST SP800-53.

653
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:55,170
With this framework and control catalog,

654
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:59,553
they mapped their guidelines
to implementation.

655
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:05,220
And here is another control objectives,

656
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,650
ensure proper security measures

657
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,863
without disrupting operational efficiency.

658
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,493
To achieve this, they use
these two types of controls.

659
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,510
First one is preventative control.

660
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:26,510
They are using AWS organizations
service control policy.

661
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,580
But they use this in minimum

662
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:34,233
because they don't want to
limit the developer function.

663
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,563
For example, prevent users
from creating IM user

664
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:43,530
and access key.

665
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,093
That's a preventative control.

666
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:51,240
And they mainly rely on
to detective controls.

667
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,333
They're using AWS Security Hub CSPM.

668
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:58,710
For the detective controls, for example,

669
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,983
AWS Config should be enabled and so on.

670
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,263
To implement that, they
using AWS security hub,

671
00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:12,180
CSP'S standard like CIS benchmark

672
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,063
and the AWS foundational
security best practices.

673
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,250
Security hub already have managed control

674
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,440
and mapping to framework

675
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,283
so they can easily
implement control objective.

676
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,863
This is how they created the controls.

677
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:39,330
Moving to next topic,
the second best practice

678
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,383
is to implement strong
identity foundation.

679
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,630
As Yamamota mentioned,

680
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:53,370
they're managing several
thousands of users,

681
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,683
local government and its users.

682
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:01,383
So, automation and
scalability are the keys.

683
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:07,413
First challenge is the
five days to create users.

684
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,779
That's because they had
a manual user process,

685
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:15,093
manual user authentication process.

686
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,240
So they created all authentication systems

687
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,400
to use My Number Card.

688
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,003
As Yamamota said, its an
Japan's national ID card.

689
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,290
So they implement it on GCAS.

690
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:36,290
GCAS is Government Cloud
Assistance Systems they created.

691
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,090
And on top of that,

692
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,423
they implement that user
authentication systems.

693
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,830
With this automated system,

694
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:51,810
they reduced the lead
time of user creation

695
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:55,290
from five days to just one hour,

696
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:58,863
and also reduced the
workload of Digital Agency.

697
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,170
Second challenge is thousands of users

698
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,063
on IAM Identity Center.

699
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,920
There is a limitation of permissions,

700
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,520
number of permission sets
in IAM Identity Center.

701
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,563
That's 3,500.

702
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,270
To scale that,

703
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:26,133
they created the idea
just two permission sets,

704
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,793
administrator and non-administrative.

705
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,206
For administrator,

706
00:43:34,206 --> 00:43:39,206
they associate it with the
administrator permission set.

707
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,993
With that permission set,
when user creates the account,

708
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,683
the administrator role will recreate it.

709
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,933
With this role, they
can create another role.

710
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:00,070
They don't use IAM users
because this agency

711
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:04,350
not permit to create IM users.

712
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,740
So instead of that, they
create laws on guest account

713
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,563
To use such a law,

714
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,550
they use non administrator law.

715
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,180
This the non administrator user.

716
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,750
This user is associated
with the permission set

717
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,333
for Switch role only role.

718
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,790
With this law, non-administrator user

719
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,950
can switch the other roles

720
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,923
like developer roles and operator roles.

721
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,103
With this simple model,

722
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,530
they can easily scale user management

723
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,533
and keep it simple to manage users.

724
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,390
The third best of practice

725
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:59,163
is automate account
provisioning and customization.

726
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:07,490
Yamamoto said they create
370 accounts per month.

727
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:11,583
So they need to automate everything.

728
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,400
They're using multiple
cloud service provider.

729
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,570
So when user want to create account,

730
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:25,263
they have access to the data fast.

731
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:31,190
And from GCAS, it's kick
the step functions workflow

732
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,733
and sends the request and
store the request to the SQS.

733
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:42,050
Then Lambda function create
account with Control Tower.

734
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:49,510
This SQS is needed to
limit the account creation,

735
00:45:52,806 --> 00:45:55,110
parallel account creation

736
00:45:55,110 --> 00:46:00,110
because Control Tower
limits account creation

737
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,463
to five at once.

738
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:09,650
Then they call several
APIs with lambda function,

739
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,943
or for example subscribe to
enterprise support and so on.

740
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,980
As you may know, Control Tower
have account customization

741
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,443
with infrastructure code
like Cloud Formation.

742
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,180
However, infrastructure's code is suitable

743
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,833
for define the status.

744
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:37,450
So instead of that, to
define the procedure

745
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:39,933
lambda level function is suitable.

746
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,370
And especially subscribed
to enterprise support

747
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:47,823
is not supported by cloud permission.

748
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,573
So in such case, the lambda
function is suitable.

749
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,520
And also they have
another database on GCAS.

750
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:02,220
This is because this is real world.

751
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,303
So when user want to create account,

752
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,820
Digital Agency needs to have
some real world information

753
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,383
like local government name
or email address for billing.

754
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,890
To store this data on GCAS,

755
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:26,550
they don't need to have manual process

756
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:30,543
like writing some
information on note or so.

757
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:35,550
Like this, Digital Agency created

758
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:39,513
a fully automated
mechanism account creation.

759
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:47,210
And yeah, this is the automated
one time account setup.

760
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,810
For the resources defined
by infrastructures code

761
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:57,330
and require changes in the future,

762
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:01,812
Digital agency uses two
type deployment model

763
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,943
with service catalog.

764
00:48:04,943 --> 00:48:07,413
What is prototype deployment?

765
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,030
They defined secure baseline.

766
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,690
For example, check and remove
default security group,

767
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:16,523
and so on.

768
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,653
This is defined by CDK,

769
00:48:21,005 --> 00:48:25,647
and they created several service
catalog products from that.

770
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:31,850
And when local government
administrator want to deploy it,

771
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:35,850
they pull that product and deploy it.

772
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:39,183
They own their account by themselves,

773
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:42,663
then they create their own systems.

774
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:50,730
These two type deployment
compare to push style deployment.

775
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:54,183
It's like a CloudFormation
stack and so on.

776
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,640
However, if Digital Agency
uses CloudFormation stack set,

777
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,693
there are two problems.

778
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:09,320
First one is Digital Agency
is not permitted to access

779
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,440
to the guest account because
of the local autonomy.

780
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,553
This is one problem.

781
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,220
And second problem is if Digital Agency

782
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:26,157
deploy these baseline
by cloud (indistinct),

783
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,950
they need to coordinate

784
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:32,910
with the local government administrators.

785
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:37,080
for example, when the
template will be deployed

786
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,913
or what's the current status
of that secure baseline.

787
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,225
So this prototype deployment model

788
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:52,225
enabled them this secure baseline

789
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:58,083
without any coordination by
local government administrator.

790
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,920
And when Digital Agency want
to update the secure baseline,

791
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,820
it's very simple.

792
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:10,740
Digital Agency should just update

793
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,603
the service catalog product.

794
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,890
Then, a local government administrator

795
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,980
pull that new version of the product

796
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,660
and deploy it by themselves.

797
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:25,410
There is no coordination
between Digital Agency

798
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:28,503
and local administrator.

799
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:33,213
This is a pull style deployment model.

800
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:40,530
Okay, last best of practice
is continuous monitoring

801
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,900
and testing of controls.

802
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,943
Don't set and forget.

803
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,980
In the government cloud,

804
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,400
local government administrator
has responsibility

805
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,323
to fix security issues.

806
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,020
However, digital agencies administrator

807
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,870
usually don't send security issues

808
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:06,390
to local government administrator.

809
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,253
So how to notify?

810
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:11,913
In the secure baseline,

811
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:17,810
Digital Agency already
defined the event breach rules

812
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,190
and AWS chatbot.

813
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:24,680
With this services, detected
security issues sent

814
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,760
to the local government
administrator directly

815
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,263
and they fix that security
issues by themselves.

816
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,860
This distributed notification systems

817
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:44,070
enabled Digital Agency not to handle

818
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,747
a massive number of (indistinct).

819
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,563
because they have thousands of accounts.

820
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:56,073
Then also enable to align local autonomy.

821
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,940
However, other administrator,

822
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,360
Digital Agency needs to understand

823
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,723
the security posture of
the Government Cloud.

824
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,920
To do that, they get periodic
report from security hub

825
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,453
and check critical event only.

826
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,323
Once they find critical event,

827
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,333
they notify to local
government or administrator.

828
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,582
This is how they implement

829
00:52:28,582 --> 00:52:33,243
to manage security postures at scale.

830
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,490
This conclude AWS cloud
governance best practice

831
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:41,820
that Digital Agency has
addressed in detail.

832
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:46,350
So I hand it back Nivas to
wrap up this presentation.

833
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:47,430
Thank you.

834
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:48,263
- Thank you.

835
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:56,670
- So you heard from Mr.
Yamamota and Mr. Ohmura

836
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,070
on how the Digital Agency

837
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:03,540
achieved a real world
implementation of cloud governance

838
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,663
and had real impact.

839
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,560
And this is just a summary
of the best practices.

840
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,363
So feel free to take a picture.

841
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:18,033
We covered it all in our sessions.

842
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,990
And now the launch updates,

843
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,585
we had several and we just decided

844
00:53:24,585 --> 00:53:29,585
to point a few of the key
ones, namely transfer accounts.

845
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,340
A lot of organizations are moving accounts

846
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:40,200
between different organizations
for mergers and acquisitions

847
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,570
or just different business needs.

848
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:46,680
And in the past, we had to
make an account standalone,

849
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,480
add credit card information

850
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,780
and then move it to the
second organization.

851
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:56,130
Now you can simply invite the account

852
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:59,280
over to the target organization.

853
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,073
So this makes it much more efficient.

854
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,193
Second launch AWS billing transfer.

855
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:12,210
While we still recommend
that organizations

856
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:15,213
use a single organization,

857
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,130
sometimes there are cases
where companies and customers

858
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,170
have to use multiple organizations

859
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:24,480
due to regulatory compliance

860
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,583
or actual business requirements.

861
00:54:27,566 --> 00:54:30,840
Example, partners that are
supporting multiple customers,

862
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:35,640
in this case in the past
administrators to log into each

863
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,240
and every management account
of the different organizations

864
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,770
and review the costs, the
cost analysis and invoicing.

865
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,200
Now you can centralize that.

866
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,250
Now you have centralized view

867
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:53,373
of what's taken across
multiple organizations.

868
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,390
And so this helps with invoice collection,

869
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:00,213
payment processing and cost analysis.

870
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,480
And something to note here too
about the AWS organizations.

871
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,250
Even though the administrator can review

872
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,900
across different organizations,

873
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,920
each organization is still
responsible for its security.

874
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,920
So this is just sending
costs over, centralizing it,

875
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,110
providing cost visibility,
but the security management

876
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:27,513
is still separate.

877
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:32,640
On controls only, we talked
about the controls catalog.

878
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,743
We talked about AWS Control Tower.

879
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,670
Now you can have a
controlled solely experience

880
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,080
with AWS Control Tower.

881
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,332
You don't necessarily need
the landing zone components.

882
00:55:43,332 --> 00:55:46,170
And so this will be very
helpful for customers

883
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:49,740
that have already built
out a custom landing zone.

884
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:53,480
They can simply take
advantage of the controls

885
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,210
in Control Tower, which
include SCPs, RCPs,

886
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,883
as well as Config rules to apply at scale.

887
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:06,270
So as next steps, just
sharing some resources,

888
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,510
I did not share all of our launches,

889
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:13,530
but this QR code summarizes a list

890
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:16,353
of our cloud governance
and other launches.

891
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,370
And the key takeaway,

892
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,320
cloud governance gives
you the right foundation

893
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,164
to experiment and execute.

894
00:56:24,164 --> 00:56:26,550
We saw this clearly with
