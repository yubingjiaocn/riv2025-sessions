  "abstract": "AI has enabled teams to ship software at an unprecedented rate, but safety around release practices hasn’t kept up. In this session, LaunchDarkly CEO Edith Harbaugh will explore how modern teams can use automated guardrails like progressive rollouts, real-time observability, and instant rollbacks to reduce release risks while shipping faster at scale. We’ll also highlight how these controls apply to AI-powered applications, where speed and safety are both critical. Edith will be joined by select LaunchDarkly customers to share how they’ve built cultures of velocity and confidence in software and AI delivery. This presentation is brought to you by LaunchDarkly, an AWS Partner.",
