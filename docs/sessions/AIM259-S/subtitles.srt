1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,440
- Hi.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,970
Welcome everybody.

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,800
If you are looking for
closing the gap between

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,230
shipping and safety
shipping faster at scale,

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,970
you're in the right place.

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,050
So thank you for coming.

7
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,610
It is 9:00 AM in Las Vegas,

8
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,880
which is either noon if
you're from the West coast,

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,560
or 6:00 AM if you're on Vegas time.

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,460
So thank you all very much for coming.

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm Edith Harbaugh.

12
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,740
I am CEO and co-founder of LaunchDarkly.

13
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,010
And with me today I have
Jeffrey Goldberg of Qlik

14
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:30,120
and Nate Gray, Ally,

15
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,117
and do you wanna give a
brief intro of both of you

16
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:34,867
and your roles before we get going?

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,500
- Sure, I'll go first.

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,460
Nate Gray, Ally Financial, Ally Bank.

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,510
You might have seen the commercials.

20
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,603
We're the largest digital
bank in the country.

21
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,440
I am over digital engineering operations,

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,230
so primarily customer facing applications

23
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,653
and the APIs that interact with them.

24
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,373
- And I'm Jeff Goldberg, I, whoa,

25
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:01,290
and I work at Qlik.

26
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,950
We're a data integration
analytics and AI software company.

27
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,060
And I am a product manager responsible for

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,307
a number of different
areas in the platform.

29
00:01:11,307 --> 00:01:14,280
And I help our developers with tools,

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,343
bringing in tools that help
them with their productivity.

31
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,140
- So I'm gonna give a very
brief overview of LaunchDarkly.

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,490
This is not meant to be a vendor talk,

33
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,560
it's meant to be them discussing software.

34
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,930
But I want to give a
little level set about

35
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,000
what LaunchDarkly does.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,390
So I started LaunchDarkly
in 2014 as the founder.

37
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,190
And the reason why I started it,

38
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,070
is because I kept feeling the
same pain over and over again

39
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,780
as both an engineering manager

40
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,430
and then as a product manager,

41
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,650
which was that releases are hard.

42
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,740
You know, back then we did
a release once a quarter

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,800
and every time there's
so much anxiety around,

44
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,659
is it gonna go out okay?

45
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:52,492
You know, 'cause back then

46
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:53,507
build pipelines where (indistinct),

47
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:57,210
and then even beyond that, after you ship,

48
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,830
is it gonna fall over and go thud?

49
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,363
Basically, you know,

50
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:04,240
the fingers crossed I
test a lot in a server

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,130
that was in production.

52
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,620
I tested a sandbox, but now
it's in live in production,

53
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,570
is it actually gonna work?

54
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,570
And then work has a lot
of different definitions.

55
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,510
After you push it, is it actually
delivering business value?

56
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,220
You know, something could be working fine,

57
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,333
but customers hate it.

58
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,140
So from all that, I came up
with the idea for LaunchDarkly,

59
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,890
which is basically a runtime
control plane for features

60
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,037
where you can launch measure
and control features after,

61
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:37,380
so you can launch them and
then measure and control them.

62
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,480
From that over the last 10 years,

63
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,760
we've continued to expand on what it means

64
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,250
to be a feature management platform.

65
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,100
So now LaunchDarkly allows
you to release something,

66
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,720
it allows you to observe it

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,580
and allows you to iterate with it,

68
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,770
with our experimentation engine.

69
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,770
And we do all this via
a base of 20 plus SDEKs.

70
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,720
If you are using a language,
we probably have it.

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,460
And if we don't have an SDK for it,

72
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,656
it is probably something like COBOL

73
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:05,580
where we cannot physically do it.

74
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,620
But anything else that
you want, we have it.

75
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,253
Set top boxes, devices,
we have an SDK for it.

76
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,070
And the goal of all this is
to de-risk every release.

77
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:17,903
You know, as a former,

78
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:19,740
as I said before, as a product manager

79
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,450
and engineering manager,

80
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,540
when something goes wrong,
you feel it very viscerally

81
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,130
that something has gone wrong,

82
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,750
it's bad in the field.

83
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,680
And even more than that,

84
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,783
that under stress that you have to fix it.

85
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,790
So if something goes wrong,

86
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,700
you have this panic
feeling due to cortisol

87
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,370
and that is actually the
worst time to make a decision.

88
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,290
Some of the worst releases
I've had happen is,

89
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,060
when something goes bad

90
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,890
and then there's this panic moment of

91
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,630
what version do you roll back to?

92
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,160
How do we roll it back?

93
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,560
And suddenly you're trying
to roll forward or roll back

94
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,393
and cherry pick

95
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:53,100
and you somehow end up in
a worse mess than before.

96
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,780
So our goal is to de-risk every release

97
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,680
by allowing you to do self
rollbacks at (indistinct)

98
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,380
and also to allow you some new features

99
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,600
we've built over the last 10 years

100
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,090
to allow you to accelerate AI development.

101
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,340
Because with this ability
to do quick rollbacks

102
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,750
and girded releases,

103
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,240
you can have a lot more
confidence in what you're doing.

104
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,030
As well we can help you
experiment after it is released.

105
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,230
So if you have functionality

106
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,070
that you wanna see

107
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,400
whether people like different
AM models differently,

108
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,230
you can test that out.

109
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,740
And all this happily
coincides very nicely with,

110
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,870
not just developer productivity,

111
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,970
but developer happiness.

112
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,630
This is a big goal of mine.

113
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,210
You know, if you have confidence
that things that you ship,

114
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,260
if something goes wrong,

115
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,120
you could quickly iterate on them,

116
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,563
it's a lot easier to ship.

117
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,520
If you have stress and anxiety about,

118
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,320
oh, is this gonna work,
is it's not gonna work?

119
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,830
That's what I think that
development really slows down,

120
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,100
'cause then suddenly you
have a lot of meetings

121
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,560
or conference calls about
how confident are we,

122
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,543
which is his own operational drag.

123
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,830
So that's a brief
overview of LaunchDarkly.

124
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,030
Now I'm really gonna turn it over

125
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,040
to a group discussion about

126
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,223
the gap between speed and reliability.

127
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,430
I'd say for a while this was seen

128
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,990
as a false dichotomy in my mind

129
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,720
that you could either go
fast in the Facebook model

130
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,080
of ship everything, break
everything, who cares.

131
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,770
Or I'd say the slow and steady
of let's ship once a quarter

132
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,690
and really make sure it's right.

133
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,670
And the reason why I feel like
this was a false dichotomy

134
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,290
is because if you have
a quarterly release,

135
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,870
it's actually more likely
that something goes wrong

136
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,370
because you have so many fixes,

137
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,200
so many things working together

138
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,580
that it's much more likely that

139
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,390
something will break With
all this combination.

140
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,610
I feel like if you ship more frequently

141
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,650
with smaller units of value,

142
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,810
it's a lot easier to
isolate what's happening

143
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,580
and that it's actually much easier

144
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,080
to get more reliable software.

145
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,900
My joke is, you know,

146
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,880
so I used to be a big time runner

147
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,325
and the joke is that, you know,

148
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:57,930
you go to the doctor and your knee hurts

149
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,250
and they say, well, you know,

150
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,900
if your knee hurts, stop running.

151
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,830
If you're a software development company

152
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,300
and your releases are always broken,

153
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,010
you can't just stop shipping.

154
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,300
It's not a valid answer to say,

155
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,740
hey, whenever we're
not gonna ship anymore,

156
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,418
'cause all our releases are terrible.

157
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:14,820
The the right answer is
let's keep doing this

158
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,870
until every release is easy and reliable.

159
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,440
So I have a couple questions for panelists

160
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,780
just to get started

161
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,970
and I'll ask you both to answer this one.

162
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,980
How do you feel like cadence has changed

163
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,350
in your own orgs over the last 10 years?

164
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,700
Like, how have you bridged this gap

165
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,623
between speed and reliability?

166
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,170
- I'll go first. Yeah, sure.

167
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,700
So we've moved from an on-premises product

168
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,900
to the cloud,

169
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,900
and I think that that has been a key point

170
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,730
of moving from those quarterly releases,

171
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,830
or we were releasing
software five times a year

172
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,940
for an on-premises product,

173
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,050
to now just continuous
delivery of features of bugs.

174
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,470
And that really transformed
the development organization.

175
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,140
It really became something

176
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,170
where the developers
were really very happy

177
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,880
because they were just constantly,

178
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,190
they were feeling like they
were able to achieve velocity.

179
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,750
They were able to go ahead

180
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,330
and just keep moving, keep progressing

181
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,020
in different iterations of the software

182
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,370
that they were delivering.

183
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,190
It's interesting though
that now we're, you know,

184
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,460
five or six years into our cloud journey,

185
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,460
and we have some desire to
offer certain capabilities

186
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,440
from a continuous perspective,

187
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
but then there are other
features that we wanna hold back.

188
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,970
But it's not necessarily

189
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,510
because of any sort of
like engineering drag

190
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,650
or anything like that.

191
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,233
It's more about marketing

192
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:52,380
and the integration of product marketing

193
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,380
and thinking about how release
is now more about moments

194
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,960
in addition to being able to
push and ship more frequently.

195
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,010
So it's coming up with that balance

196
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,780
that we're working on right now.

197
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,160
- Yeah, that's a pretty common pattern of

198
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,240
sometimes there's a reason why

199
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,818
customers don't wanna
see something, right?

200
00:08:14,818 --> 00:08:15,780
Then like if you're doing a big promotion

201
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,790
around Black Friday,

202
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,470
you don't wanna show it in August.

203
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,610
- Right.

204
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,450
Right, exactly.

205
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:26,430
And for us, we have large
enterprise customers that will,

206
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,380
what they like to do is they like to

207
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,650
essentially preview features
before they're released.

208
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,230
They like to do things like
build their own documentation,

209
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,790
even though we have documentation,

210
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,860
they like to build their own enablement.

211
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,550
So what we're beginning
to offer in the new year,

212
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,280
is a way for customers to
configure their tenants

213
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,430
through just a toggling capability,

214
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,050
a different release channel

215
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,100
that they want to have
their tenants release

216
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,410
or receive different features.

217
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,080
So items that would be on a monthly

218
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,790
or a quarterly release

219
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,830
will be determined by product management,

220
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,450
product marketing and the engineering team

221
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,160
in collaboration with one another.

222
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,993
And they'll go ahead

223
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:08,460
and they'll set up the
targeting rules to set that up.

224
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,010
But if your tenant is
set up for continuous,

225
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,310
you'll actually get those
features as they ship.

226
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,100
And that gives the customer
a lot more confidence

227
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,440
because they can control

228
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,190
how they distribute and
allow their end users

229
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,320
to consume these new capabilities

230
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,840
with better support
models from their side.

231
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,430
- And are your developers happier now

232
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,490
because they can decouple
release from deployment?

233
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,730
- I think that's still, you know,

234
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,670
something that is where there's some,

235
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,640
still some growth opportunity.

236
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,170
I think we've been in a centralized model

237
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,060
for release management
for such a long time

238
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,620
because even though we moved to the cloud,

239
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,320
we still maintain more of
that on-premises mindset

240
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,670
of release.

241
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,630
But now we have close to 400 developers

242
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,700
and engineers that have access

243
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,700
to toggle feature flags in production.

244
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,380
And so we've decentralized

245
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,720
and given the development
teams more control,

246
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,420
they're gaining more confidence.

247
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,640
Because they have that capability,

248
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,700
they're more thoughtful
about when flags get toggled.

249
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,430
And so we've seen incidents go down

250
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,530
and that helps raise
their confidence as well.

251
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,640
Coming back to your point of

252
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,710
do we need to have these
gates in these meetings

253
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,150
to feel like we're confident,

254
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:29,150
now they have the wherewithal
to have more control over that

255
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,600
and take action

256
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,450
if they see anything that
doesn't look right immediately.

257
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,333
- How about you?

258
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,480
- Yeah, developer happiness

259
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,853
has been a key driver of our
tech modernization actually.

260
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,130
I wrote a blog post on
Ally Tech blog about

261
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,340
how Ally got our nights and
weekends back, you know,

262
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,800
we were doing the quarterly
releases then monthly releases,

263
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,909
but they were always middle
of the weekend, right?

264
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:59,430
For a bank, if someone
can't log in to check their,

265
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,470
you know, check their
account or transfer money

266
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,060
or pay a bill, that's a really big deal.

267
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,243
So like we can't cause customer impact,

268
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,100
but also engineers
can't work 45 hour weeks

269
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,010
and nights and weekends.

270
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,890
So what's the solution?

271
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,560
Yeah, LaunchDarkly was a big part of that

272
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,393
through feature flags.

273
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:24,780
So now we do, we went from, I say monthly,

274
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,990
but it was monthly
releases plus, you know,

275
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,210
a handful of hot fixes

276
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,933
that obviously are always
rushed out and ill tested,

277
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,520
to this year we're averaging
68 releases a month

278
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,420
across about 15 applications.

279
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,890
We feature flag every UI change.

280
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,160
We do API first development,

281
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,330
so the API, we've separated
APIs from UI deployments,

282
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,840
separated releases from deployments,

283
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,110
APIs go in for the UIs.

284
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,640
We then target, you know,

285
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,730
the new version of the
API with phased roll-outs.

286
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,280
First we do customer
pilot or employee pilot.

287
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,683
So testing in production,

288
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,380
everyone says, don't test in production.

289
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,630
No, please do test in production.

290
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,670
That's the only way you can actually test

291
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,130
what's happening in production, right?

292
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,703
So create segments for
our internal pilot team,

293
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,710
then 1% roll-out to customers,

294
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,030
5% roll-out up to, you know,
up to a hundred percent

295
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,060
as long as all the metrics are tracking.

296
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,893
- That's great.

297
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,600
Like what changes have
you felt in your own team

298
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,480
with getting their
nights and weekends back?

299
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,770
- Yeah, I mean,

300
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:51,770
I'm a father of two boys
that keep me very busy

301
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,040
and, you know,

302
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,290
I preach work-life balance to my team,

303
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,763
it's really important to me.

304
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,760
I have the benefit of having

305
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,470
leadership that agrees with that.

306
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,730
And so we can ship at 5:00 PM

307
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,710
as soon as the stock market closes

308
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,140
because we have the confidence that

309
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,570
we know before we're
gonna break something.

310
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,845
We can, you know, we
can back out that pilot

311
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:22,650
even if we do cause customer impact,

312
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,780
it's not a 30 minute pipeline deployment,

313
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,953
it's a 32nd, you know, flag flip.

314
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,070
So it's improved developer
satisfaction tremendously.

315
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,750
- What changes have you
felt in your own team

316
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,643
with the change in cadence?

317
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,110
- I think, you know, from our developers,

318
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,340
they really like that they
have that flexibility.

319
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,370
But I think one thing
that you were just saying

320
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,750
the separation of deployment

321
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,620
and release is really where
they feel more comfort.

322
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,860
I think that there was such
a tight coupling before,

323
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,950
now there's this confidence
that they can deploy.

324
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,303
They can just continuously
deploy as long as they have,

325
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,280
they've set up their flags

326
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:17,910
to basically deploy dark into
those production environments.

327
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,200
And then they're able to very, you know,

328
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,990
very granularly turn on,

329
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,200
whether it's through a phase
roll-out, or release pipeline,

330
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,900
or using guarded roll-outs.

331
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,970
We just implemented guarded roll-outs

332
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,840
in the last couple of weeks,

333
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,270
so we were just starting
our enablement there.

334
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,960
But in terms of the functionality

335
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,400
of using different targeting rules,

336
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,470
it's really interesting to see

337
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,510
the maturity of the
teams as they go through

338
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,000
and they work through those things.

339
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,590
They've really started to,

340
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,950
and I guess enjoy being able to say,

341
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,510
oh, I put it on this tenant,

342
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,160
so gonna invite you to this tenant

343
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,090
that I have internally,

344
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,440
so that you can go ahead
and take a look at it.

345
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,770
We have some announcements this week,

346
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,350
and those we're doing
some private previews,

347
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,436
so we're working with, you know,

348
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:07,830
there's a, again, a collaboration between

349
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,820
the dev management team

350
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,450
and product management to
establish different segments

351
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,990
for those different
previews that we will do

352
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,770
throughout the journey to a
generally available product.

353
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,150
And it's just wonderful to know that

354
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,810
we can keep delivering that
software into production

355
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,850
with aspects of it still turned off

356
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,760
because we can be super granular with

357
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,440
how many flags we wanna have,

358
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,210
how we bring the flags together

359
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,890
from a prerequisite perspective.

360
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,620
And we also tie it in
with access control too.

361
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,860
So we on the back end and the front end

362
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,490
so that we can make sure
that when we do release,

363
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,140
we're not only releasing just a UI change,

364
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,180
but we're implementing the access control

365
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,200
that goes along with it

366
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,200
and it's really looking
at the full feature

367
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,800
across multiple flags,

368
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,323
it seems like that kind
of granular control.

369
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,720
- Where do you feel
that there's still risk?

370
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,640
Like what are some
non-negotiable guardrails?

371
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,053
And this is for both of you.

372
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,562
- For us in a, you know,

373
00:16:10,562 --> 00:16:12,262
we're a highly regulated industry.

374
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,600
You know, auditors and regulators

375
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,740
are regularly checking that

376
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:24,180
every GitLab production tag
aligns to an approved CR

377
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,110
with test evidence and scans
are all done appropriately.

378
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,640
And so it's regulatory

379
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,650
and compliance risk is a big one for us,

380
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,013
making sure that we're doing
everything by the book.

381
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,770
And then, you know, resiliency,

382
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:45,770
being able to instantly know
if you're causing trouble

383
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,093
and flip that flag back.

384
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,690
- In our world we have
two different pieces.

385
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,740
We're FedRAMP compliant product.

386
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,630
So we have to sometimes separate

387
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,640
what is released in our
commercial environment

388
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,880
and stage that release before
we're allowed to bring that

389
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,060
into the federal environment
for the purposes of audit.

390
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,470
We have to go through audit processes

391
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,303
and that sort of thing

392
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:13,110
from a significant change perspective.

393
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,360
So that's one non-negotiable piece.

394
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,760
And we make sure that there's
that separation of duties

395
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,550
and that there's the people who can access

396
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,710
the FedRAMP environment,

397
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,010
have a mechanism to turn on

398
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,770
and set up the flags in the right way.

399
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,310
And then I think one
of the other, you know,

400
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,440
things that we've been able to do

401
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,540
because of our decentralization

402
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,680
of the teams really owning their releases

403
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,963
and owning their feature flags now is,

404
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,480
really being confident
before you turn a flag on

405
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,310
for right default.

406
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,810
Default true is not the way

407
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,670
that you start working on a flag,

408
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,230
you start with default false

409
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,000
and you protect yourself
using the targeting rules

410
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,320
as a guardrail.

411
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,653
So those are some of the pretty,

412
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,110
I guess, light non-negotiable
pieces on our commercial side

413
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,380
because we've been so
restrictive in the past

414
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,020
that's actually caused more incidents

415
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,273
than it's actually prevented.

416
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,870
- Can you tell us a little bit more about

417
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,990
how has being too cautious
caused an incident, if you can?

418
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,480
- Well, yeah. So again,

419
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,700
it comes back to something I
think I said a few minutes ago

420
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,070
where when we were in a,

421
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,290
even as we started to decentralize,

422
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,450
it was still kind of
like this hybrid approach

423
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,450
where we had a release
champions team, right?

424
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,720
And again, it's about having
knowledge of your feature

425
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,660
and someone who's a release champion

426
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,660
may not necessarily be in
the same domain or org,

427
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,920
but they're being, you know,

428
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,030
asked through Slack,

429
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,130
hey, can you flip this
on in production for me?

430
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,200
And they're just like,
yeah, sure, no problem.

431
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,780
And then all of a sudden
it's like, you know,

432
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,200
support calls start coming in, you know,

433
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,420
errors start flowing through into Splunk

434
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,010
and everybody, you know, you get,

435
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,530
all of a sudden you have
250 people jumping into

436
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,750
an incident channel in Slack.

437
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:20,750
Now that the ownership has
fully shifted to the dev teams,

438
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,340
they don't have to ask
anyone for permission.

439
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,990
They are in control.

440
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,880
We treat our developers like
adults and responsible people,

441
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,180
and they care about that.

442
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,270
They don't want incidents,
they want their,

443
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,710
they wanna make sure that their code

444
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,930
works properly in production.

445
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,220
So this level of control just
automatically solves the,

446
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,570
it solves the problem
itself, it solves itself.

447
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:54,120
- It definitely felt that, you know,

448
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,730
I got into engineering because
I liked building things.

449
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,400
- Yep.
- And when we had, you know,

450
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,400
I'm old enough that we used
to have like annual releases,

451
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,230
that's just really painful, you know?

452
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,460
'Cause you're working on something

453
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,823
and sometimes by the time it's
ready to ship, it's obsolete.

454
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,540
But if you can release
once a week or once a day,

455
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,130
you get this little,
you know, kick of joy of

456
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,880
well, A, there are people using it.

457
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,423
And also if they're not gonna use it,

458
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:20,730
I at least know that sooner.

459
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,530
- Yep.
- You know?

460
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,150
- Well this is the next phase for us,

461
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,040
is really getting into,

462
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,000
as I was mentioning,

463
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,230
the private preview that we're doing

464
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,227
for some of the new features
that we have coming out soon

465
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,900
and getting into more experiments.

466
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,520
So we've turned on all of
that observability parts.

467
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,180
We're engaging our design team

468
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:47,310
to facilitate more experimentation
through LaunchDarkly.

469
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,980
We're building out capabilities
that allow our customers

470
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,520
to opt into betas and previews

471
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,280
and different parts of our release model,

472
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,470
so that we can get feedback earlier,

473
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,780
so that we can actually
put something out there,

474
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,250
that I think you were saying it

475
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,500
at the beginning of the
call where, you know,

476
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,360
you think that the meta approach

477
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,190
where you're throwing something out there

478
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,990
and just let it break is bad.

479
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,830
It's not that it's bad
per se, it's a choice.

480
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,880
It's how you control that decision.

481
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,720
And that's the exciting part
about using LaunchDarkly

482
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,560
is it gives you so many
different opportunities to,

483
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,470
and control, not in a negative sense,

484
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,630
but control in a positive sense.

485
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,600
The feedback loops that you establish,

486
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,220
whether they're customer driven,

487
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,510
where the user's opting in

488
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,030
or they're experiments that we wanna run,

489
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,410
whether it's AB testing

490
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,980
or doing something where we
allow our customers, you know,

491
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,880
operate in a canary mode or
do blue-green deployment.

492
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,280
That flexibility for our development teams

493
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,080
and for our design teams

494
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,000
and our product management teams

495
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
just enables better quality
outcomes for our customers.

496
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,200
We will end up shipping lovable,

497
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,730
like not to use the company's name,

498
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:13,080
but you know, the lovable and features

499
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,400
that our customers crave

500
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,440
and they look forward to.

501
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,190
- I mean, that's what we're
all here for is I think is,

502
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,440
you know, it's fun to see, you know,

503
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,720
bits and bytes turn into real experiences.

504
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,830
- Yeah, for sure.
- Along with that, you know,

505
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,663
I have to ask this 2025,

506
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,390
how are you approaching AI

507
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,340
and how it plays into
your own release cycles

508
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,990
and your own software development?

509
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,403
And either you can.

510
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,073
- We treat models like features.

511
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,940
So, you know, our enterprise AI team is,

512
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,320
we have a employee front end

513
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,290
for like a ChatGPT type experience

514
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,020
that is a hundred percent feature flags.

515
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,980
And then for the AI configs models,

516
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,420
being treated like
features and phase roll-out

517
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,453
and measured just like any
other customer feature would be.

518
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,760
- In our platform where our customers

519
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,310
are ingesting a lot of data into it.

520
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,770
And then either running that

521
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,410
through transformation
pipelines and analytics,

522
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,650
and then we have the capability
to build out assistance

523
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,630
that you can deploy out into

524
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,900
and embed into other ecosystems.

525
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,990
What we need to be thoughtful about

526
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,990
is how our customers
want to treat that data

527
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,640
and where they want that data to go.

528
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,640
So being able to give them the opportunity

529
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,790
to control the artificial
intelligence capabilities

530
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,300
of where they can pull data
from is really important.

531
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,220
So like, I'm not gonna,

532
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,540
I'm not an AI expert,
but criss-cross region

533
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,080
inference I think is something that

534
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,080
has become really
important for our platform

535
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,540
as our customers have data residency

536
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,100
and sovereignty concerns.

537
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,630
So we are offering a way
for our customers to use

538
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,670
different versions of our AI platform

539
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,230
based on a toggle that they flip that

540
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,010
calls a LaunchDarkly API,

541
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,090
adds them to a segment and
then enables that feature,

542
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,706
allows them to start
using that cross reference

543
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:32,820
or cross region technology,

544
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,910
so that they can enrich their AI products.

545
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:40,650
And it's, again, it's just
that kind of integration

546
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:45,030
is really great to
provide to our customers

547
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:49,800
as a way that they can control
a certain set of features

548
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,480
for those types of use cases.

549
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,153
And that's how we're
enabling AI capabilities

550
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,710
alongside what you were saying

551
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,800
just from like a feature
functionality perspective.

552
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,270
- And ironically, our head of AI

553
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,790
was a LaunchDarkly user
in his previous role

554
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,980
that we acquired that company.

555
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,980
And so he already came over
asking for feature flags.

556
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,400
- Which company was that?

557
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,470
- It was, I knew you were gonna ask that.

558
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,000
- Oh, I felt like I should
know it and I don't.

559
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,140
- Yeah. It was a point
of sale lending company.

560
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,300
- I think I know, yeah.
- Okay.

561
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,220
- Well, I guess I stated
at the beginning that,

562
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,740
I feel like there isn't really a choice

563
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,410
between speed and reliability.

564
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,820
I guess to put it back to you two,

565
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,170
do you feel like going faster

566
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,820
has made your software more reliable?

567
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,710
Or what do you still struggle with

568
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,380
or think about in your own processes?

569
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,620
- There's still, I mean,

570
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,470
going faster brings new
complexities, new challenges, right?

571
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:54,150
I mean, we broke our monolith
APIs into microservices.

572
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,350
We broke our web architecture

573
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,973
into a micro front end.

574
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,270
And so there's a lot more moving pieces,

575
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,673
but they can all be
independently deployable.

576
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,123
So giving that freedom to,

577
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,170
we have a rule that
essentially everything,

578
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,850
every application, every deployment

579
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,863
has to be independently deployable.

580
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,270
And so that's how we've
managed that new complexity

581
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,570
that came with moving faster

582
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,480
is getting rid of dependencies
everywhere we can.

583
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,313
- That's smart.

584
00:26:28,313 --> 00:26:31,080
Was it hard to go through
that process? Did you-

585
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,290
- There were certainly
some learning, yeah,

586
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,060
some lessons learned throughout the way.

587
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:41,060
Some, you know, I'm not gonna lie and say

588
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,710
we didn't take down production or twice,

589
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,373
but I think everybody here
probably has done that.

590
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,790
- For us, the reliability piece

591
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,360
is really important because of, again,

592
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,280
the just the feeds and speeds of the data

593
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,980
and the way that our customers use data

594
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,230
to take decisions every day.

595
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,400
So what we've been trying to do, again,

596
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,400
to help the developers have
a greater level of control

597
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,130
is using context and making sure that

598
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:21,810
the full product set is
context aware of the user

599
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,160
or of the tenant,

600
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,040
or specific services that are in place.

601
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,680
So one of the things
that we've implemented

602
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,660
when we see a degradation
of a particular service

603
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,730
from a reliability perspective is,

604
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,240
we've created a string based feature flag

605
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,360
that our SRE team can go in

606
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,200
and toggle a debug mode
for a specific tenant.

607
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,460
And so now they can actually,

608
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,920
so they can identify the support,

609
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,290
will identify a customer
that's having an issue,

610
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,540
they'll supply the tenant ID,

611
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,100
the SRE will go in

612
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,830
or the dev team will go in,

613
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,310
they'll add the targeting
to that specific tenant,

614
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,510
turn on debug mode.

615
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,020
And now that will change the
logs that come into Splunk,

616
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,840
so that they can actually do
more of a forensic analysis

617
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,340
of what's actually happening

618
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,830
across the services
that they're using, so.

619
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,150
- But only for that customer.

620
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,440
- But only for that customer,

621
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,880
only for that tenant.

622
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,720
So like we have OEM products,

623
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,540
so we have customers that
have thousands of tenants

624
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,920
in production as end customers
of their SaaS solution

625
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,260
- Yeah.
- are embedding analytics.

626
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,680
So being able to trace that

627
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,840
and have that level of control,

628
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,550
that drives reliability.

629
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,970
So I kind of feel like
your question about speed

630
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,220
and reliability, yes, they
kind of go hand in hand,

631
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,800
but what we've been able to do

632
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,530
is actually decouple it, right?

633
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,700
We use the platform to drive
those use cases separately.

634
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,640
Reliability in terms of
like the shipping faster

635
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,520
just comes from what
we've been talking about

636
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,170
relative to the access

637
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,310
and the control that the
developers have of their features.

638
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,140
But this piece really helps us

639
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,980
shortcut any sort of like real digging

640
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,780
into any code to really
understand what a problem is

641
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,840
because we can just turn
that on and turn that off

642
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,200
as needed to identify problems.

643
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,420
And that reliability is really great.

644
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,730
And then what we can do is, again,

645
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,532
through segments is we
can control regionally

646
00:29:34,532 --> 00:29:37,020
what things are happening.

647
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,510
So if it's isolated to a specific region,

648
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,390
because even though you're in production,

649
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,330
we're in 15 different regions, you know,

650
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,940
ghosts in the machine, they happen,

651
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,610
you can basically set things up,

652
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,650
so that as you're fixing problems,

653
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,723
you can isolate down.

654
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,590
And that's where the context
piece really, really helps

655
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,690
and shines with reliability.

656
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,850
- Yeah. So LaunchDarkly is actually

657
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,130
a big customer of LaunchDarkly.

658
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,820
So we serve trillions
of features every day

659
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,340
and we do a lot of interesting stuff.

660
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,120
People think of us as just
serving features to users.

661
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,503
A user can be a machine,

662
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:19,260
a user can be an API,

663
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,150
so we can really dive in

664
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,850
and if, you know, we're
getting session calls

665
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,980
that are not good, we can, you know,

666
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,940
block an IP block an API
and do that very quickly.

667
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,810
- Yes. Yeah.

668
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:35,810
And I think, you know,
to log roll a little bit

669
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,530
on the LaunchDarkly part,

670
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:42,270
I see that not only from
that ability to isolate

671
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,200
because of context,

672
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,200
but that also percolates into
just the usability features

673
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,950
from an administration perspective.

674
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,950
So as the effectively the
product owner for LaunchDarkly,

675
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,170
I take a look at like authorization

676
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:03,170
and how roles and teams are set up.

677
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,330
And what I love is the granular

678
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:13,910
way that we can scope
machine tokens or users

679
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,560
and they're actually born from the same

680
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,820
access control model.

681
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,160
And that is,

682
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,740
especially with what we're
doing in the release cadence

683
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,430
and with the criss
toggle that I mentioned,

684
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,730
we have basically just
instead of, you know,

685
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,290
having a an API token

686
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,000
that can basically do a
whole bunch of things,

687
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,393
it literally can touch those two segments.

688
00:31:37,884 --> 00:31:42,510
It can write to those two
segments and that's it.

689
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,420
That level of granularity
and control is just,

690
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,830
it's fantastic.

691
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,120
- Yeah. We have a lot of people

692
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,460
who use us for device management.

693
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,293
For example, you know,

694
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:52,380
if you know that it's not gonna work

695
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,110
on this version of Android, just block it.

696
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,040
- Yeah.
- Don't have

697
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,300
a bad user experience.

698
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,853
- Yeah. Yeah. It's very cool.

699
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,380
- What are you thinking about in terms of

700
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,630
where you want your
release processes to go?

701
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,120
I mean, it seems like you both
are pretty forward looking.

702
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,160
Is there things that are
still on your roadmap

703
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,953
or do you feel like you
are in a good steady state?

704
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,623
- Yeah, automation.

705
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,010
I don't know what,

706
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,860
I don't know what automation
really looks like, right?

707
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,090
I mean, I know we want it.

708
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,430
I know the more automation the better.

709
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,100
I know that the automation we've put in

710
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,898
has made significant improvements.

711
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:36,093
But in a regulated industry,

712
00:32:37,264 --> 00:32:39,750
I don't know that we'll
ever get to like, you know,

713
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,933
one button full automation.

714
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:48,150
There's gotta be some human
in the loop along the way,

715
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,190
but automating as much of
the pipeline as possible,

716
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,310
automating testing.

717
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:58,310
The difficult part for us with
production validations is,

718
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,840
when you're validating in production,

719
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,360
it's a real bank account, right?

720
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,470
Like our developers are
logging in on release calls

721
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,383
to their personal account and you know,

722
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,730
moving money and purchasing shares.

723
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,930
And that's really the
only way we can do it.

724
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,690
There's a team that

725
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,180
was supporting auto payments

726
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,030
that for a time they didn't
have anyone on the team

727
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,310
that had an auto loan through Ally.

728
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,410
So they would've to ask for volunteers

729
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,210
to come validate.

730
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,540
So production validations are,
have always been a challenge.

731
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,990
Anything we can do to
automate that, you know,

732
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,000
that's where we want to go.

733
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,930
- Yeah. It's it's so true.

734
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,750
I mean, I don't, I bank like anybody else.

735
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,250
I want the number to be right.

736
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,080
- Right. Exactly.
- Yeah.

737
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,780
Automation, I completely
agree with what you're saying.

738
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,780
The ability for our
developers to be able to,

739
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,000
and this is where I see
like guarded roll-outs

740
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,630
and some of the other
capabilities coming into play,

741
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,770
that automation.

742
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,780
And then allowing our customers to choose

743
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,310
in certain cases,

744
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:13,110
so that our developers are
focused on shipping features,

745
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,600
not necessarily getting calls to say,

746
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,510
hey, can you toggle this on
for this particular tenant?

747
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,830
They wanna try this out, right?

748
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,940
Because, you know, we're in the middle of

749
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,470
an engagement or something like that.

750
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:30,470
So being able to support those
types of use cases is huge.

751
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,870
And that's where the automation comes in.

752
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:38,870
The tighter integration
with the products set.

753
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:44,040
And then just giving the developers

754
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,720
the opportunity to work through

755
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,950
the experimentation processes

756
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:57,090
and have that trigger different workflows

757
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,580
either inside or outside of LaunchDarkly,

758
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,460
I think is another way for them to

759
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:07,980
accelerate their workflow from
a development perspective.

760
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,410
- Yeah. A big change I myself have seen

761
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,490
over the next 10 years

762
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,163
is just the acceptance
that automation is good.

763
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:18,600
So, you know, when I started
the company 10 years ago

764
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,250
when I talked to prospects about,

765
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,020
hey, you can move stuff through stages,

766
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,471
like the examples you gave.

767
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:25,290
- Yep.
- And I would ask,

768
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,370
do you wanna have this automated?

769
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,750
They would say, absolutely not.

770
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,370
You know, somebody needs
to flip that switch.

771
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,500
I need somebody to flip it.

772
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,840
But what's changed, I
think AI has accelerated,

773
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,190
is people are like,

774
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,520
actually a machine could
flip it faster than a human.

775
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,710
And in fact, I do not
wanna wait for a human,

776
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,420
like, you know, we have a customer

777
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,430
that does payment processing,

778
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,540
they're like, if something's going wrong,

779
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,520
I wanna stop it within a second.

780
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,570
- Oh yeah.
- I don't wanna wait

781
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,280
for somebody to get paged five minutes.

782
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,260
Like I want a second.

783
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,430
And then the person get paged,

784
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,200
they could figure out why it went wrong.

785
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,210
But I don't want that delay.

786
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,430
- I think you're absolutely right.

787
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,903
Like it's an,

788
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,370
I can't presume what, you
know, what developers want.

789
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,373
But as someone who's always
aspired to be a developer,

790
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:14,280
I really embrace automation

791
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,860
because if I can not have to worry about

792
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,270
that kind of concern,

793
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,670
and I can continue to focus on building,

794
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,400
that's the part of the
job that I really enjoy.

795
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,400
So to be able to automate
that, either get an alert

796
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,270
or what have you so that,

797
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,580
or have it automatically roll back,

798
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,920
it's just like, that's great,

799
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,950
'cause I don't have to,

800
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,530
I'm gonna say context
in two different ways.

801
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,470
I don't have to context switch
from being in builder mode

802
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,990
to being in fix it mode, right?

803
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,070
But then,

804
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,980
what you're mentioning
from an AI perspective,

805
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,420
which is so important is that,

806
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,613
it's all about context.

807
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,800
That is what,

808
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,170
if you give your agents,

809
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:02,100
you give your AI the
context of what you want,

810
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,040
you give it, you provide
the instructions on

811
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,030
how to behave when you
see certain conditions,

812
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,577
it will go ahead and handle that for you.

813
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:14,250
And that you can provide that
in a natural language way

814
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,950
versus like, dragging and dropping blocks,

815
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,010
I think is what makes
it way more approachable

816
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,920
for a developer now than
it did maybe, you know,

817
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,110
even three to five years ago

818
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,210
where it was like, oh, use Workato.

819
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,190
Like, sorry Workato folks.

820
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,260
It's a great tool, but you know,

821
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,510
where you're dragging and dropping blocks.

822
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,430
I mean, we have that
capability in our platform

823
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,830
with like click automate,

824
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,500
but our customers want to
be able to just, you know,

825
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,990
be like Scotty in "Star Trek
Four" and say hello computer,

826
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,033
and out comes transparent aluminum.

827
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,833
- Anything to add?

828
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,410
- So we've shifted left
on security scanning,

829
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,530
which has prevented a lot
of last minute fire drills.

830
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,430
So, you know, implementing security gating

831
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,140
at the point of, you know,

832
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,830
that first merge request means, you know,

833
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,110
we're not waiting on a
weekly scan to come in

834
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,870
right before the release sign-offs.

835
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,120
The developers have much more control

836
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,130
over the timing of those releases.

837
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:22,130
And then by having everything
independently releasable

838
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,470
and feature flagable,
if something comes up,

839
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,040
that component just
doesn't go that release.

840
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,040
And so we don't have to back out code

841
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,550
at any point in process.

842
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:40,200
We just, you know, decide
not to flip that feature

843
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,330
or deploy that microservice.

844
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,070
- Hearing you talk about that again,

845
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:47,400
makes me remember the way we
used to develop a decade ago.

846
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,358
And I don't want to go back. (laughs)

847
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:50,280
- No, no.

848
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Actually, so the first
time we used a feature flag

849
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,550
from LaunchDarkly,

850
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,120
it was the second week of COVID.

851
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,340
And the feature that
we'd been working on for

852
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:08,790
a month or so was an annual
employment verification

853
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,930
for customers,

854
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,330
that certain products require

855
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,980
annual employment verification.

856
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,220
Well, when half the world
was being, you know,

857
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,470
laid off and fired,

858
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:22,110
that's probably not the best time to ask

859
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,370
for employment verification.

860
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:26,520
So, but we had this big release that,

861
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,900
this was before we had, you know,

862
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,760
this is at the beginning of
our modernization journey,

863
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,590
but we had introduced feature flags

864
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:36,120
and that one happened to be the first one

865
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,190
and we just toggled it off

866
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,320
and everything else was able to release.

867
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,120
We didn't have to break
up the release package.

868
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,080
We didn't have to,

869
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,250
I mean we did some retesting,

870
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,680
'cause we, you know, we didn't know

871
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:52,170
what we didn't know from this new tool,

872
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,640
but it worked flawlessly

873
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,550
and then we were able to delay
that employment verification

874
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,570
for three months

875
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,150
and just toggle it on when we were ready.

876
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,860
- Yeah. That's the origin of our name.

877
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,660
That's a classic dark launch,

878
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,620
- Right? Yeah.

879
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,390
- You know, where you can
ship out features dark

880
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:10,350
and then to your metaphor default false

881
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,870
and then slowly turn them on.

882
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:16,920
- Yeah. Almost a hundred
percent of our UI releases

883
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,393
are now deployed dark,

884
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,810
validated by just the development teams

885
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,433
and product teams in production.

886
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,370
For mobile it's a little differently.

887
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:29,375
It's a little different because, you know,

888
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,950
you have to release new binaries,

889
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,450
push those releases out to customers

890
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,960
and we get negative customer feedback

891
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,620
when we release too fast in mobile.

892
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,630
People don't want to download a new app

893
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,833
every time they use it.

894
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:45,803
Especially, I mean,

895
00:40:45,803 --> 00:40:47,370
if you're trying to
check your bank account

896
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,400
and you don't have
great service, you know,

897
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,840
you might not be able to do that

898
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,600
because you can't, you know,

899
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,483
you can't wait 20 minutes
to download a new app.

900
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,543
And so by being able to,

901
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,580
by being able to feature flag web

902
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,323
and mobile features together,

903
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,910
we can release web as often as we want,

904
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,890
as often as developers need to.

905
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:17,220
Mobile goes in a slower cadence,

906
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,143
we're about biweekly now.

907
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:25,010
And then once all the pilot
testing is done on each,

908
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,570
then we can flip both of
those features on together,

909
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:31,710
so that customers, regardless
of platform they're on,

910
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,140
see that same feature at the same time.

911
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,900
- That's part of the origin
story of LaunchDarkly

912
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,070
is I would, I was at TripIt,

913
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,900
which is a mobile app

914
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,350
and we had that exact
use case of, you know,

915
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,650
somebody is on the road perhaps to Vegas

916
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,100
and they're desperately
trying to look at something

917
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,360
on their phone now is not the time

918
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,410
- Yep.
- to ask you

919
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,715
to update your app.
- That's right.

920
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:57,933
- You know, and also they,

921
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,780
we learned the hard way that some stuff

922
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,970
that looked great in a mockup internally

923
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,680
in our user testing,

924
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,560
when somebody is running through
an airport, they hate it.

925
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,420
Like, I don't have time to
look at your beautiful UI,

926
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,250
just make the, you know,
make the buttons louder

927
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,170
and prettier is not an option,

928
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,553
just louder.
- Yep.

929
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,240
- Well, before we turn it over
to the audience, you know,

930
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,880
any final advice for people
on their own journeys?

931
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,950
Like you said you had some,
your own lessons learned,

932
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,400
but as people are looking to ship faster

933
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,040
with more reliability at the same time,

934
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,640
what advice would you give them?

935
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:34,000
- My advice is

936
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,670
bring your developers to the product.

937
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:42,180
Don't restrict their access to it.

938
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,850
I think that's a key
lesson that we've learned.

939
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:49,850
And provide them opportunities
to explore the paths

940
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:58,140
that they want to take to
release their products, right?

941
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,820
The platform itself provides
numerous different ways

942
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,710
to go to market.

943
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,710
And what I see my responsibility
from a product perspective

944
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:14,770
is to highlight what the
different features within

945
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,120
feature flagging can bring to bear

946
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,120
and show them different use cases

947
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,240
that they could employ when
they choose to go ahead

948
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,410
and release.

949
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,780
And that's how we will expand the maturity

950
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,280
and expand the confidence

951
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,440
that our developers will have

952
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,950
to use the full range and
capabilities of the product,

953
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,263
so that they can release more reliably.

954
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,680
They'll get more hands-on
experience with it

955
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,713
and that's what will help drive the speed.

956
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,570
- Yeah. Develop our autonomy.

957
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,460
I was gonna say that as well.

958
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,110
That's when we went through

959
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,420
our tech modernization initiative,

960
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,110
I laid out release
management guiding principles

961
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:04,560
and I did a road show to all
of the leadership stakeholders,

962
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,740
making sure that everyone's
on board with this.

963
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,190
And number one on that was

964
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,260
development teams should have the autonomy

965
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,003
to move at their own speed.

966
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:19,530
We are release processes
like a bus schedule.

967
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,810
Like you don't have to
get on every bus, right?

968
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,633
It there, like you're gonna have,

969
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,910
you have scheduled options,

970
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,250
you have ad hoc options

971
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,770
and it's up to like the release team

972
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,740
is supporting those
product teams to get it out

973
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,573
to customers.

974
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:37,590
Balancing that, you
know, speed and safety,

975
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:41,160
balancing customer service,

976
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,980
our customers being the
product teams we support

977
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,160
and you know, our risk management hats

978
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,090
as release management.

979
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:53,090
So giving development teams the autonomy

980
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,230
to move at their own speed

981
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:59,400
while putting the right
checks in place, right?

982
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,643
By putting the right gates in place,

983
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,235
the right tooling.

984
00:45:06,235 --> 00:45:11,040
We do, you said that they have developers

985
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,490
are actually releasing
their features themselves.

986
00:45:14,804 --> 00:45:16,590
But LaunchDarkly has an
approval flow built in

987
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,090
if you choose to use it

988
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,093
and we use that so the
developer builds the flag,

989
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,760
submits the request,

990
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,630
and then the release team
submits the change request,

991
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:30,180
gets that approved, approves reviews,

992
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,830
and approves the change
request within LaunchDarkly

993
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,453
and then pushes it out.

994
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,710
- Well I wanna conclude by saying,

995
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,910
I know LaunchDarkly is a vendor,

996
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:42,990
but a lot of the techniques

997
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,990
that we talked about today you
can use without LaunchDarkly.

998
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,220
So I hope you learned a lot about

999
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,550
how you can improve your
own development processes

1000
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,920
and even if you're not using LaunchDarkly,

1001
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,373
make your developer lives
happier and reduce risk.

1002
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:01,323
I would like to now open it
up to questions from anybody.

1003
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,810
We don't have a runner for the mic,

1004
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,000
so you'll have to speak loudly

1005
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,310
and I will ask the person in front,

1006
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:09,603
'cause you sat in front.

1007
00:46:10,614 --> 00:46:11,447
- [Audience member] Yeah.

1008
00:46:11,447 --> 00:46:12,280
So my question is,

1009
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,070
how does that tie into like, versioning?

1010
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,530
So if you're doing,

1011
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:18,690
let's say doing dark releases,

1012
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:21,026
when you actually update the,

1013
00:46:21,026 --> 00:46:23,139
like do semantic versioning,

1014
00:46:23,139 --> 00:46:27,237
when would you update the release
number or the tag version?

1015
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,143
- So we do it,

1016
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,680
we actually don't use,

1017
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,270
I'm sure he just doesn't
want me saying this.

1018
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:39,630
We don't use feature
flags for our APIs yet.

1019
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:44,630
So the UI targets the new API version.

1020
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,240
So we'll deploy a new API version

1021
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,970
that sits in parallel in production,

1022
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,830
nobody's calling that yet.

1023
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:57,480
And then one by one those
consumers will re-point

1024
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,290
via a feature flag and phase roll-out

1025
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:05,160
over to the new version. Does
that answer your question?

1026
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,360
- [Audience member] I think so.

1027
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,220
I mainly work with the platform.

1028
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,165
So I provide pipelines for teams to build,

1029
00:47:11,165 --> 00:47:13,443
to push for applications.

1030
00:47:13,443 --> 00:47:16,116
So we increment our versioning

1031
00:47:16,116 --> 00:47:18,570
when every three weeks
we push out changes,

1032
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:21,360
but it'd be nice to be
able to push out releases

1033
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:26,360
or deploy items without team
always keep (speaking softly),

1034
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,897
have that constant tech debt.

1035
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,980
- So what we're looking into,

1036
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,450
we haven't done this yet,

1037
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:40,110
but as we're separating
deployment from release,

1038
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,750
what we are looking at

1039
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:46,320
is how not only would you
do a blue-green deployment,

1040
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,780
but also like a blue-green release

1041
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:53,340
where you are tying the feature
flagging to that version,

1042
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,020
so that you can go ahead
and actually phase roll-out

1043
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,133
from that perspective.

1044
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:02,040
The other way that we do it,

1045
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,533
the way that we do it today is we do,

1046
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,950
I mentioned we have a
lot of different regions.

1047
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:12,210
So what we've done is created
segments that have regions

1048
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:15,420
of different profiles
in what we call zones.

1049
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,630
And as part of our release
pipeline will release to zones,

1050
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:20,160
we will evaluate,

1051
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,650
make sure that things
are working properly,

1052
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,150
and then the teams will go ahead

1053
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,270
and continue to move those new versions

1054
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:31,470
or turn those new versions of
the software on in release.

1055
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:35,670
So it's really trying
to provide that one part

1056
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:36,750
that is handshake.

1057
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,520
We're again, early days there,

1058
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,440
but there's the
functionality to support it.

1059
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,810
And our customers are also looking for it,

1060
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:46,770
like I mentioned earlier,

1061
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,750
with respect to just the
release cadence piece

1062
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,635
where some of our customers

1063
00:48:50,635 --> 00:48:52,890
want to have a tenant that's canary,

1064
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:56,070
that's basically getting
like nightly updates.

1065
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,540
So we're gonna try to figure out

1066
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,540
how we can provide that,

1067
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,890
so that their tenants
can run in a canary mode.

1068
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,220
- There's a couple other techniques,

1069
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,230
but we can take that for after.

1070
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:09,750
You were just, 'cause you were persistent.

1071
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,350
You right there. Just talk loud.

1072
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:13,169
- [Audience member] Okay.

1073
00:49:13,169 --> 00:49:14,703
Well I have a question.

1074
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,277
Sorry for this question, but you answer.

1075
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:22,470
Yeah, okay. Are you able to hear me?

1076
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:23,520
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1077
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,320
Edith, I'm really sorry for this question,

1078
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,020
but why should I not
build my own LaunchDarkly

1079
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,780
using AI? And like I-
- I love that question.

1080
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,280
- Sorry.
- I love the question.

1081
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,200
Don't apologize.
- Yeah. Okay.

1082
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,250
So there are two parts.

1083
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,950
What I always look for one
is like open source tools,

1084
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:40,950
which will do the things
for which I'm paying

1085
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:43,470
or if the open source
versions are not available,

1086
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,210
why can't I just give Claude

1087
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,100
or any of these tools,

1088
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,140
like instructions to build what I want

1089
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,350
and it'll be specific to my
deployment and my release.

1090
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:54,240
So why should I not build it

1091
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,730
and why should I look at LaunchDarkly?

1092
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:57,960
- That's a great question.

1093
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,970
And number one, the reason
why I started the company

1094
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,770
is 'cause I think just using feature flags

1095
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:04,110
is a better way to use software.

1096
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,300
So I'll say if you have simple use cases,

1097
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,340
a hundred percent just build it in-house.

1098
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,173
Like if you're just like,

1099
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,580
hey, I just need some simple on offs,

1100
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,770
I have some very simple release processes

1101
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:16,470
where I have a beta group
and a non-beta group

1102
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:18,420
probably could do that yourself.

1103
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,940
I think if you have a
more complex situation

1104
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,590
like the ones that you just described.

1105
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,180
- So we had our own,

1106
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,330
we did purchase LaunchDarkly
I think back in 2020.

1107
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:30,520
We were using our own feature
flag management service

1108
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:35,100
because we had, you know, 15 services,

1109
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,400
we're now 300 services and growing, right?

1110
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,410
We're adding new services every week.

1111
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:43,530
And so it's just not a concern

1112
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,060
we want our developers to have.

1113
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,860
So I think to your point, right,

1114
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,460
it all depends on you reach
a certain size and scale

1115
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:55,460
where you need to offload that concern.

1116
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,740
And where all a developer has to do

1117
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,880
is add a a few lines of
code to do an evaluation

1118
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,430
and then all the aspects of being able

1119
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:07,680
to have a finer grain control

1120
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,070
just works for our teams,

1121
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:13,493
so that they don't have
to worry about that piece.

1122
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,380
- I know, Nate, you're
in a regulating industry,

1123
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,850
so you might have something to add about

1124
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,383
why not just have AI build it?

1125
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:25,140
- Yeah, well we haven't
looked at specifically

1126
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,840
that question using AI to build it,

1127
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,850
but I was actually hanging out with guys

1128
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:32,070
from Flickr last night

1129
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,240
and they claim that they

1130
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,780
created the first feature flag.

1131
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,670
- Oh, MacAskill.
- Yeah.

1132
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,570
- Yeah, I know.

1133
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:44,570
- And, but they're also
LaunchDarkly customers, so like-

1134
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,473
- That's how I know them.

1135
00:51:45,473 --> 00:51:47,160
- Yeah. So I said,

1136
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,050
well clearly like there,

1137
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:51,990
so they said we, you know,
we invented feature flags

1138
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:54,978
and now we're paying
for this service. Why?

1139
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,300
Because 'cause they do it better.

1140
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,060
- I don't claim that we invented
feature flags, by the way.

1141
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,230
Let's say that we make it easier.

1142
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:03,240
- Oh, yeah.
- I just have a follow up

1143
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,580
on that if that's okay.

1144
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,430
So when you're saying that,

1145
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,240
so my problem there is that,

1146
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,100
I don't want to be vendor logged in

1147
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,900
and then like I would want to build things

1148
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,050
which are only specific to my deployment.

1149
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,810
Although I understand,
well, she would have,

1150
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:21,510
I mean like her company would
have much more expertise

1151
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,343
in that area,

1152
00:52:22,343 --> 00:52:24,450
but we would know much more about Aztec.

1153
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:28,290
So I mean, how do you measure that,

1154
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:30,090
when is it good to go to a vendor

1155
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:33,060
and when is it good to
build it on your own?

1156
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,380
- I mean, I think that's
a broader question

1157
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,550
than LaunchDarkly.

1158
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:37,170
I mean we're at AWS

1159
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:40,380
where I hope most people
have chosen a cloud vendor.

1160
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,200
If you really wanna
build something yourself,

1161
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,120
I mean that's your decision.

1162
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,240
- Yeah. I would say if
you're a small dev team,

1163
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,720
everyone's using the same
languages and platforms,

1164
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,300
maybe it makes more sense
to build something in-house.

1165
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,300
We have hundreds of dev teams

1166
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,663
using different languages,
different platforms,

1167
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,600
different frameworks,

1168
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,600
and we would need an entire platform team

1169
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:09,900
to support feature flagging,

1170
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,080
which would be probably more than that,

1171
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:12,913
I'm sure it would be more

1172
00:53:12,913 --> 00:53:14,193
than what we're paying LaunchDarkly.

1173
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,200
- Somebody over there
had a question, I think.

1174
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:23,430
- [Audience member] So my
question is trying to understand

1175
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:24,855
how this works at New York company.

1176
00:53:24,855 --> 00:53:27,405
By the way, I'm a very big
fan of feature flagging.

1177
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:29,730
So you mentioned, Nate,

1178
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:32,292
that your company moved
from one release a month

1179
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,125
to 68 releases

1180
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:35,580
and my team moved from one release a month

1181
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,560
to about 120 releases.

1182
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,520
We just, you know, we say
just keep on shipping.

1183
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,270
One of the problems that
we get into is the flags.

1184
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:46,383
They get overwhelming.

1185
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,190
And now the problems that we have is,

1186
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,530
we don't use LaunchDarkly currently.

1187
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,180
We use an open source software,

1188
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,390
but there are overwhelming number of flags

1189
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,700
and no one knows how to, you know,

1190
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,803
which one to remove, which one to keep.

1191
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:08,310
Is there kind of a governance
that you have in your teams?

1192
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,710
- Yeah. And they solve for
that within the platform.

1193
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:14,160
I should also say we're
not paid to be here.

1194
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,420
It maybe it sounds like we were,

1195
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,590
we're just fan boys,

1196
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:20,043
like that we're, you know?
- We huge fan boys.

1197
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,260
- Actually, they pay us

1198
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,433
because they're customers.
- That's right.

1199
00:54:23,433 --> 00:54:25,710
That's right. Yeah.

1200
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:28,740
- And so within the console,

1201
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:33,300
they have a stale flag
module where you can go.

1202
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:38,300
Any flag that hasn't been
called in three weeks

1203
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,260
or something like that.

1204
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,640
There you can set your parameters,

1205
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,610
but there's specific
definitions for stale flags.

1206
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:48,840
There's a dashboard where dev teams can

1207
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,970
do that either every sprint,

1208
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:52,777
review their stale flags, do that,

1209
00:54:52,777 --> 00:54:54,990
you know, every other, every third sprint,

1210
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,660
build it into their workflow,

1211
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,340
so that they're just reviewing

1212
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,290
what flags are no longer getting called

1213
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,270
so they can clean up that
tech debt along the way.

1214
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:06,765
- Yeah. For us it's a combination of

1215
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:10,440
the code references capability
that's in LaunchDarkly.

1216
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,110
So you add GitHub action

1217
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:16,740
that basically has LaunchDarkly
scan for feature flags

1218
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,630
inside of the repo.

1219
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:21,600
And then it reports that into the projects

1220
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,680
inside of LaunchDarkly.

1221
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,930
So you can go into a specific feature flag

1222
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:25,980
and if you have got a flag

1223
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,500
that's actually operating
across multiple repos,

1224
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,460
you'll be able to see the
repos that it's used in.

1225
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,760
And then you're able to
define how many lines of code

1226
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,130
you wanna show inside of LaunchDarkly

1227
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:40,740
where the feature flag is
to determine whether or not

1228
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,810
it's actually something
that's safe to remove.

1229
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,250
And then like you're saying,

1230
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:47,280
there's a number of different affordances

1231
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,360
within LaunchDarkly.

1232
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,970
There's some default rules that exist

1233
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:54,330
that look at flag evaluations,

1234
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:58,513
time that the flag has been existing to,

1235
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,670
and it will start to indicate,

1236
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:04,470
oh, this is ready for code.

1237
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:06,780
This flag is ready for code removal.

1238
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,580
Oh, you've removed it from all the codes,

1239
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,380
so now it's ready to archive.

1240
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,770
And those affordances we can,

1241
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,370
we take that and then we
provide that information

1242
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,110
to the team so that they can go ahead

1243
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:22,650
and build into their sprint plans

1244
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,040
any sort of flag cleanup
operations that they need

1245
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,893
to make sure that they take
care of to maintain hygiene.

1246
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,700
- Yeah. We actually just
released a hygiene agent

1247
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,620
at GitHub universe that will help

1248
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,360
analyze that more automatically.

1249
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,047
- Oh, I need to look at that. I love it.

1250
00:56:40,047 --> 00:56:42,570
- Yeah. And it came
from, again, as you know,

1251
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:44,970
being around for over
a decade is, you know,

1252
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:47,880
I used to see if you used
to search for feature flags,

1253
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,040
the number one hit was an
article not written by me

1254
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,357
that said feature flags

1255
00:56:51,357 --> 00:56:53,850
are the worst kind of technical debt.

1256
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:55,410
And it was people who were using

1257
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:57,420
some sort of home brew, homegrown solution

1258
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:00,090
and they just were
accumulating so much crud

1259
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,190
- Yep.
- of like stale broken flags

1260
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:03,240
that nobody knew what to do anymore.

1261
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,797
And it's like feature flags

1262
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:06,330
are the worst kind of technical debt

1263
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:07,530
if you're not managing them.

1264
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:11,580
- Yep. There are, we've
found a couple use cases

1265
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,413
for permanent feature flags though.

1266
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,630
If, yeah,

1267
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:22,230
let let's say, you know,
a key vendor goes down

1268
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,600
and we have an outage in our website,

1269
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,270
we have flags that can send
up a coach mark to say,

1270
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:28,103
I'm sorry,

1271
00:57:28,103 --> 00:57:30,600
like we're experiencing
technical difficulties right now.

1272
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,160
And so that flag's just always out there

1273
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,323
and we just flip it on when we need to.

1274
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,510
But for the most part

1275
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:39,060
you're gonna want to clean up flags

1276
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:42,270
once they're no longer being
evaluated on a regular basis.

1277
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:43,740
- Yeah. We have some customers who,

1278
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,140
if they're getting floods of traffic,

1279
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,330
either from a denial service attack

1280
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:53,250
or just something that could
just put up a graceful failure,

1281
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,890
which is much better than
tire sites just collapsing.

1282
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:58,980
- Yep.
- I think we have time

1283
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,113
for one more question if there's anybody.

1284
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,150
- [Audience member] Hi, sorry.

1285
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,980
So my question was already asked,

1286
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,990
so I have a different one now.

1287
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:12,540
About the reliability of feature flags.

1288
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,090
So the biggest concern that comes up

1289
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:17,070
when thinking about LaunchDarkly

1290
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:19,320
and discussing with the management

1291
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,590
is not necessarily the cost,

1292
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:24,930
'cause you can still
explain the cost benefits,

1293
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:28,860
but the reliability on something

1294
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:33,180
which is served from an
external third party server

1295
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:37,050
to look at and say that,
okay, if this goes down,

1296
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:39,780
then this was the last guardrail

1297
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:43,170
that we had before everything
is displayed to the customer.

1298
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:47,310
- Yeah. Maintaining flag
defaults is a big part of that.

1299
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:51,870
And we're at the AWS conference,

1300
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:55,030
last time we saw this was,
you know, was the USE outage

1301
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:00,630
where there were two teams

1302
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:03,873
who had not set their defaults
correctly and they went down.

1303
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:07,110
You know, LaunchDarkly had some, you know,

1304
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,523
they were in USE Swan,

1305
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,940
they had some lessons learned outta that,

1306
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:15,870
but the people who had
maintained their defaults,

1307
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,375
even when AWS was down,

1308
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,613
even when LaunchDarkly was
down, it worked flawlessly.

1309
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:21,720
- It's a great question.

1310
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:26,280
And you know, similar to that situation

1311
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,630
where LaunchDarkly helps is having

1312
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:32,580
different services like the relay service.

1313
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:36,990
So the relay service acts
as almost like a middleware

1314
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,990
to go back to central,

1315
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:43,740
but at least it's caching a
set of all the flag variations.

1316
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,770
So our tenants are actually
talking to that first

1317
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:50,370
before they go back to
LaunchDarkly central.

1318
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,620
Any changes that are coming from central

1319
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,900
are basically being
brought down to that relay.

1320
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,690
And then I think some of the
other protection mechanisms

1321
00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:00,570
that certainly helped us in
that experience was that,

1322
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:04,290
when our users are
working with our platform,

1323
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:06,240
there's local storage that's being used

1324
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,070
where there's flag caching net,

1325
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,290
that happens naturally.

1326
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:15,290
So the reliability from a
user experience perspective

1327
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:18,000
is just, from my perspective,

1328
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,850
is something that is easily mitigated

1329
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,740
by these different mechanisms

1330
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,630
that LaunchDarkly has in place

1331
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,700
or, you know, with a small sidecar

1332
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,400
that you in install in your environment

1333
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:33,630
that you can prevent those kinds of,

1334
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:37,260
or at least you can for
a short period of time

1335
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,173
you have some protection from that.

1336
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:44,220
- Well, thank you very
much to Nate and Jeffrey.

1337
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:45,720
This wasn't meant to be a vendor talk,

1338
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,850
but thank you for describing
the product so well.

1339
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:48,813
I appreciate it.

1340
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,720
Can we give first,

1341
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,680
if you have more questions,

1342
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,170
we do have a booth on the
floor if you wanna visit it.

1343
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:57,423
And can we please give
our panelists a big hand.

1344
01:00:57,423 --> 01:00:59,173
(audience applauding)
- Thank you.
